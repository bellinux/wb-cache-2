40|$|Twenty-eight Red Sokoto does were {{supplemented}} with crop residue-based and concentrate rations at 1 and 2 % {{of body weight}} in a 7 -treatment completely randomised block design experiment. Average daily milk yield, total milk yield, total lactation length and milk composition were monitored and subjected to least squares analysis to test the effect of treatment. Results indicated that Ration 1 C which comprised of mainly crop residue with much lesser protein levels than the concentrate rations (1 A and 2 A), produced 54 kg of milk over a 90 -day lactation period averaging 0. 60 kg per day. At the other extreme, the negative control ration (Green grass and Digitaria hay) contained the least protein and dams that fed on it had the shortest lactation length (41 days), and therefore least total and average daily milk yields (10. 2 and 0. 25 kg, respectively). It was evident that in absolute terms, milk from does on Ration 2 A contained the highest percentages of fat (6 %), protein (6. 33 %), total solids (21. 85 %) and SNF (15. 85 %). As expected, milk from does on the negative control ration ranked least with respect to all the parameters studied. It was concluded that Ration C fed at 1 % level is a good supplementary <b>feed</b> <b>package</b> for increased milk production in Red Sokoto goats because it competes favourably with conventional concentrate rations. It also gives milk with lower fat content than conventional concentrate rations which from a consumer point of view, is healthy and desirable...|$|E
40|$|The {{parameters}} {{investigated in}} this study {{with the objective of}} evaluating growth, lactation and reproductive performances, included birth weight, litter size, 0 - 90 days gain and average daily gain of kids as well as the milk yield and progesterone profile of Red Sokoto does supplemented with crop-residue based rations during the long-dry period of the subhumid zone in Nigeria. A total of 7 treatments of 4 goats each was utilised. All treatment groups had a basal diet of Digitaria smutsii hay and natural pasture ad libitum. Ration A supplemented with the conventional concentrate was used as the positive control; rations B and C were supplemented with crop residues; and ration D without supplement was used as the negative control. Supplementation with concentrate and crop residues significantly increased (P < 0. 05) the birth weight and liveweight gains of kids, but litter size was unaffected. The heaviest kids at birth (1. 3 - 1. 4 kg) were from does in treatments 1 A, 2 A and 2 C, while does in treatments 1 B, 2 B, 1 C and D had the lightest kids (1. 07 - 1. 18 kg). The highest gains of 53. 9 g·day- 1 were recorded in treatment 2 A and the least (32. 4 g·day- 1) in treatment 1 B. Supplementation also significantly influenced (P < 0. 01) the daily milk yield of dams over the 90 -day period of the dry season. All the does had similar progesterone profiles from late gestation through parturition to early lactation irrespective of their treatment group. It was concluded that ration C fed at the 2 % level is a good and affordable supplementary <b>feed</b> <b>package</b> for increased birth weight and preweaning gains in kids for meat production...|$|E

40|$|Variations {{in weight}} gain, milk yield, milk composition, {{nutrient}} intake and digestibility of Red Sokoto goats supplemented with crop-residue based rations during the long-dry period were investigated. Ration A, the conventional concentrate ration, {{was used as}} the positive control, Rations B and C were the two crop-residue test diets, while Ration D the unsupplemented treatment, {{was used as the}} negative control. Each of the supplementation rations was fed at 1 and 2 % of the goats body weight (designated as 1 A, 2 A, 1 B, 2 B and 1 C, 2 C respectively). The supplemented group of goats had significantly higher (P< 0. 05) dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) intakes as well as nutrient digestibilities than the unsupplemented groups. DM digestibility improved with supplementation by a range of 4. 1 to 27. 9 %, while CP digestibility improved by 17. 1 to 42. 2 %, the highest value being in does on Ration A. It was evident that supplementation significantly (P< 0. 01) influenced weight gains and milk yield of dams. Goats on ration 2 C recorded the highest average daily gains of 39. 29 g/day while their counterparts fed rations 1 B and D lost 28. 57 and 92. 86 g/day respectively. Ration 1 C which comprised mainly of crop residue with much lesser protein levels than the concentrate ration, produced 54 kg of milk over a 90 -day lactation period averaging 0. 60 kg per day. Goats on Ration D had the shortest lactation length of 41 days and the least total and average daily milk yields of 10. 2 and 0. 25 kg respectively. Milk from does on ration 2 A contained the highest percentages of fat (6 %), protein (6. 33 %), total solids (21. 85 %) and solids-not-fat (15. 85 %). Milk from goats on ration D ranked least with respect to all parameters studied. It was concluded that the goats made appreciable gains in the long dry season on crop-residue based diets that compared favourably with the conventional concentrate rations.

40|$|The {{projects}} {{in oil and}} chemical (O&C) industry often experience problems during their execution, because of those problems, some of the project ends with large cost and schedule overruns. The poor performance of projects not only affects the strategic objective of project’s owner but also poses a dual threat to engineering and construction (E&C) companies. They negatively affect their profit margins and their business objectives. Given the strict budget constraints imposed by the present global economic situation, owners and stakeholders expect their projects to be delivered cost effectively and efficiently. Therefore, {{it is important for}} E&C companies to strive for improvement in their project management practices. The current thesis research is a step in direction to introduce a new concept for improvement in performance management practices. For that purpose, the research introduces “early detection of project problems” as the main instrument and uses the quantitative information from past project to develop a body of knowledge and first conceptual model to predict the future performance of projects at their early stages. The research is conducted in five phases, {{the first phase of the}} research explores O&C project and their performance management practices. Based on the gathered knowledge via literature study and available information, the main research question is formulated as “How can future problems and performance of a current O&C project be predicted at early stages using knowledge and experience from past {{projects in}} an EPC environment?” Thereafter, a series of sub questions were formulated aimed to answer the above-mentioned research question. The later part of the first phase developed a structured research approach and research methods. In the second part of the research, efforts were directed to find the so-called “early warnings” of problems. To identify the early warnings, two main sources were explored, literature and experts from O&C project industry. Each investigation into respective sources resulted into number of early warnings. Each identified early warning was evaluated on selection criteria with three selection parameters. After the careful evaluation, the following ten early warnings were selected. ID Early warning indicator LES Lack of understanding of project execution strategy among project team PTE Project team lacks experience required for the project COC Conflicts between owner and E&C contractor NCO Numbers of change orders CCO Cost impact of changes FED Percentage of missing information in <b>FEED</b> <b>package</b> PH Growth in process man-hours PS Delay in process engineering CE Change in concurrency level between process and piping engineering DPO Delay in issuance of purchase orders The selected early warnings were carried to the third phase of the research, in which four detailed case studies were performed to have observatory evidence. The case studies in this phase consisted of four project with different performance levels. The difference in performance levels of case projects set the contrast in which the predictive capability of early warnings could be observed. The case study investigation found that there is a relationship between early warnings, project problems and project performance. After obtaining the observatory evidence, the fourth phase of the research adopted a purely quantitative approach and studied the behavior of early warnings in a relatively larger set of past projects. Subsequently correlation analysis was performed to find correlations between early warnings and final project outcomes (which collectively asses the project performance). The quantitative analysis did present interesting and encouraging results. The main results are mentioned as follows: I. Early warnings do behave differently in case of poor and good performance projects, few in terms of their absolute value and few in their incremental changes. II. Correlations do exist between EWI and project outcomes, however not all the EWI found to be correlated with all project outcomes. III. The EWI indicators does show a dynamic quantitative relationship with project outcomes over engineering duration of the project Using the results from quantitative analysis, an attempt is made in the last phase of this research for the development of prediction model, which can predict the future performance of projects. The results of pilot prediction model were analyzed and compared with forecasts made via traditional forecasting methods. The comparison of forecasts found that prediction model does make prediction that is more accurate. However, there are errors with-in prediction models. In addition, the external validation of model suggested limited reliability and accuracy of pilot model. The dataset used for quantitative analysis and building of prediction model is relatively small and limit the generalization of findings. Therefore, to have a more accurate prediction in good projects, a dataset is required which contains a balance of Successful and less than successful performance projects. Despite the smaller dataset, the findings and approaches presented in this research can be used to build a useful model and subsequently applied in O&C project industry. A set of insights and recommendations (short term and long term) has been made for Fluor to implement the findings of this research to develop an operational performance prediction system. The research possibly has following main contributions to scientific and industry. Contribution to scientific community I. A shift from reactive project management to proactive project management II. A new and constructive role of past projects Contribution to O&C project industry I. An approach, which facilitate the early detection of future potential problems II.

Feed is a significant contributor to emissions from animals raised in Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) or factory farms, as corn or soy beans must be fertilised, irrigated, processed into animal <b>feed,</b> <b>packaged</b> and then transported to the CAFO. In 2005, CAFOs accounted for 74% of the world's poultry production, 50% of pork, 43% of beef, and 68% of eggs, according to the Worldwatch Institute.

A single-visitmultiple- subject survey was used to collect data on milk production & marketing systems. A total of 181 milk households were individually interviewed. On-farm feeding trial was conducted on twenty lactating cows of uniform parity and stage of lactation using a Randomized Complete Block Design (5 treatments & 4 replications). Average body weight and initial milk yield of cows were 231. 7 ± 36. 7 kg & 1. 08 ± 0. 11 kg/cow/day respectively. The treatment groups included grazing (T 1), noug seed cake (T 2), adlib urea treated wheat straw (T 3), noug seed cake+ adlib urea treated wheat straw (T 4) and concentrate comprising 74 % maize grain+ 25 % noug seed cake + 1 % salt (T 5). From the survey, rural small-holder, periurban, and urban milk production systems were identified. Milk and butter were found to be marketed mainly through informal marketing systems. Indigenous and Fogera-Friesian crossbreds were the dominant cattle breeds. The major livestock feed resources are natural pasture, crop residues and aftermaths. Trypanosomiasis, pasteurolosis, anthrax and black leg were the major reported cattle diseases. The main problems of milk production & marketing were lack of feed, disease outbreak, lack of improved cattle breeds and distance to marketing points. The on-farm feeding trial result showed a significant difference (P 0. 05), for increased milk protein, solids-not-fat and ash contents. The highest and the lowest milk yield per day was recorded for cows fed urea treated wheat straw and the control group, respectively. The intervention diets increased the net profit/cow/day by ETB 3. 40 (T 2), 6. 33 (T 3), 3. 58 (T 4), and 3. 84 (T 5) over the control (T 1). In general, despite the untapped milk potential of the district, the existing milk production (mainly extensive) & marketing (mainly informal) systems are found to be interwoven by many constraints. Urea treated wheat straw supplementation improved milk yield, weight gain and economic return. Therefore, further works are needed in areas of milk nutrition, health, product marketing, input delivery and services and scaling up the <b>feeding</b> <b>package</b> developed in this study considering the respective milk production systems to capitalize the market oriented milk industry in the district.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2002. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Botrytis {{bunch rot}} of grape {{is caused by}} Botrytis cinerea Pers. :Fr. Conidia of the pathogen, which is {{dispersed}} by wind, water droplets and by insects, can penetrate the intact grape berry cuticle, but disease expression occurs only under predisposing conditions. Since relatively high infection rates often occur in vineyards, predisposing factors must play {{a fundamental role in}} primary infection and subsequent disease occurrence. Insects can play a very important role in this regard by depositing inocula at wound sites during feeding and by providing fresh wounds during their oviposition and feeding activities. The aim of this study was (i) to determine the potential of the Mediterranean fruit fly to transfer B. cinerea and other bunch and fruit rot fungi in natura, (ii) to investigate the transport, deposition and subsequent disease expression on grape berries in vitro, and (iii) to investigate fruit fly activities and the nature of deposited conidia and mycelia of B. cinerea by aid of digital photography and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively. Two Sensus fruit fly traps containing the para-pheromone, Capilure, were installed in orchards and five neighboring vineyards on four farms in the Stellenbosch region. Ceratitis fruit flies were collected weekly, identified and counted to determine the fluctuations in fruit fly population. Following field collection, the fruit flies were plated on Kerssies' B. cinerea selective medium and the number of flies yielding the pathogen was recorded. Two fruit fly species, C. capitata and C. rosa, were captured during the study period. Ceratitis rosa numbers comprised only 1 % {{of the total number of}} fruit flies captured. Ceratitis capitata numbers, and the percentage B. cinerea contaminated flies generally increased after harvest in the different orchards and vineyards. Following harvest, the percentage flies yielding B. cinerea was higher in vineyards compared to orchards. Furthermore, in each vineyard an increase in percentage B. cinerea contaminated fruit flies was preceded by a corresponding increase in its neighboring orchard. The levels of both Penicillium and Alternaria contaminated fruit flies stayed high throughout the investigation period, especially after harvest of the orchard cultivars. Low incidence of Aspergillus, Mucor and Rhizopus spp. were recorded on C. capitata. These findings suggest that the Mediterranean fruit fly may play an important role in the dispersal of inocula of fungi associated with postharvest decay from early-maturing stone fruit orchards to mid- and late-maturing wine grape vineyards, and in disease induction under conditions unfavourable for natural infection. Three experiments were conducted to determine the potential of fruit flies in provoking B. cinerea decay. In the first experiment, transport of conidia and disease expression were investigated on rachis segments bearing unwounded berries only. In the second experiment, the effect of wounding on disease expression was investigated. In the third experiment, the effect of inoculum type (mycelia and conidia) on transportation and disease expression was investigated on rachis segments bearing unwounded berries, and on segments with wounded berries. The table grape cultivar, Dauphine, and the wine grape cultivar, Shiraz, were used at véraison, two weeks before harvest and harvest, and the transport studies were conducted in ethanol-disinfected perspex cages. Disease expression was studied in dry (~ 56 % RH), ethanol-disinfected perspex chambers incubated at 22 °C. The isolations from berries revealed that the flies deposited, without preference, high amounts of B. cinerea at various positions on the grape berry's surface. The freezing studies showed that the deposited conidia germinated and penetrated the berry skin at various positions. However, B. cinerea developed more often at the pedicel end than on the cheek or style end, which indicated a peculiar interaction between B. cinerea, the fruit fly and host tissue at this part of the berry. This phenomenon was substantiated by the finding that B. cinerea also developed more often at the pedicel end of berries that were not frozen. Further evidence for this interaction was found on intact berries exposed to flies that carried mycelia after feeding on berries without sporulating colonies of the pathogen, but showing symptoms of slippery skin. Significantly more decay developed on wounded berries compared to the unwounded berries and more so at the wound site. In addition, female fruit flies were responsible for significantly more decay development than male fruit flies. The study thus proved that the Mediterranean fruit fly can promote B. cinerea disease development under conditions unfavorable to natural infection. The activities of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, on grape berries were monitored by aid of digital photography. In addition, the deposition of conidia and mycelia of Botrytis cinerea at three sites (pedicel end, cheek and style end) on the grape berry, germination of the fungal structures after dry (± 56 % RH) and moist (± 93 % RH) incubation and wounds inflicted during ovipositioning were examined with an epifluorescence microscope. The observations revealed that the fruit fly's activities were generally restricted to the grape berry. They visited the grape berry cheek more often, but visitations to the pedicel end of berries increased substantially from véraison to harvest, indicating the possibility of nutrient leakages at this site. Microscopy revealed that the flies deposited conidia singular, in <b>feeding</b> <b>packages</b> and in faecal excrements on the berry surface. The conidia in <b>feeding</b> <b>packages</b> were ensheathed by salivical fluids and occurred in clusters of 10 to 50 conidia. An average of 60 % of the conidia in <b>feeding</b> <b>packages</b> germinated under dry conditions (± 56 % RH). Conidia that passed through the intestinal tract of the fruit fly and that were deposited in faecal excrements were deformed and low in viability. These conidia did not occur in cluster format, but were proportionally spread with the faeces on the surface of the grape berry. Conidia that were deposited singular and in faecal excrements did not germinate unless incubated under moist conditions (± 93 % RH). Wounds inflicted by female fruit flies during ovipositioning were most frequently observed on the cheek. This predisposition to B. cinerea infection of grape berries by the activities of fruit flies, suggested an important role for the flies in the initiation of Botrytis bunch rot epidemics in vineyards. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: DIE ROL VAN DIE MEDITERREENSE VRUGTEVLIEG, CERATITIS CAPITATA, IN BOTRYTIS CINEREA TROSVERROTTING VAN DRUIWE Botrytis-trosverrotting van druiwe word deur Botrytis cinerea Pers. :Fr. veroorsaak. Konidia van die patogeen wat deur wind, waterdruppels en insekte versprei word, kan die intakte druiweskil binnedring, maar siekte-uitdrukking vind slegs onder spesiale omstandighede plaas. Aangesien relatief hoë infeksie vlakke algemeen in wingerde voorkom, moet predisponerende faktore 'n fundamentele rol in die primêre infeksie, en die daaruit voortspruitende siektetoestand speel. Insekte kan 'n baie belangrike bydrae lewer deur inokuia tydens voeding by wonde te deponeer. Nuwe wonde kan ook tydens oviposisionering en voeding ontstaan. Die doel van hierdie studie was om (i) die potensiaal van die Mediterreense vrugtevlieg om B. cinerea en ander tros- en vrugverrottingswamme in natura oor te dra, te bepaal; om (ii) die verspreiding, deponering en daaropvolgende siekteuitdrukking op druiwekorrels in vitro te ondersoek; en om (iii) die aktiwiteite en aard van die gedeponeerde konidia en miselia met behulp van digitale fotografie sowel as epifluoressensiemikroskopie waar te neem.

Ceratitis-vrugtevlieë is weekliks versamel, geïdentifiseer en getel om fluktuasies in die vrugtevliegpopulasie te bepaal. Na die veldversameling is die vrugtevlieë op Kerssies se B. cinerea-selektiewe medium uitgeplaat. Gedurende die studie is twee spesies vrugtevlieë, C. capitata en C. rosa, gevang. Na oesstyd het die aantal Ceratitis-vrugtevlieë en die persentasie vrugtevlieë, besmet met B. cinerea, in die verskillende boorde en wingerde toegeneem. Na oestyd was die persentasie vrugtevlieë wat B. cinerea gedra het, hoër in die wingerde as in die boorde. Elke toename in die persentasie B. cinerea-besmette vrugtevlieë in 'n wingerd is voorafgegaan deur 'n ooreenkomstige toename in die aangrensende vrugteboord. Die aantal vrugtevlieë besmet met Penicillium en Alternaria spp. het tydens die navorsingstydperk deurgaans hoog gebly, veral nadat die vrugteboord-kultivars geoes is. Die voorkoms van Aspergillus-, Mucor- en Rhizopus spp. op Ceratitis-vrugtevlieë was deurgaans laag. Hierdie bevinding wys daarop dat vrugtevlieë 'n belangrike rol speel in die verspreiding van swarninokula, wat met na-oes verrotting geassosieer word, van vroegrypwordende steenvrugteboorde na mid- en laatrypwordende wyndruifwingerde. Drie eksperimente is in vitro onderneem om vrugtevlieë se potensiaal om B. cinereaverrotting te veroorsaak te bepaal. In die eerste eksperiment is ragi met slegs ongewonde korrels gebruik om die oordrag van konidia en siekte-ontwikkeling te ondersoek. In die tweede eksperiment is die effek van verwonding op siekte-ontwikkeling ondersoek. In die derde eksperiment is die effek van inokulumtipe (miselia en konidia) op verspreiding en siekte-ontwikkeling ondersoek deur ragis-segmente met gewonde korrels sowel as ragissegmente met ongeskonde korrels te gebruik. Die tafeldruif-kultivar Dauphine en die wyndruif-kultivar Shiraz, by kleurbreuk, twee weke voor oes en by oestyd, is in die eksperimente gebruik. Die oordragstudies is in etanol-ontsmette perspex-hokke uitgevoer. Siekte-ontwikkeling is bestudeer in droeë (± 56 % RH), etanol-ontsmette perspex-kamers en geinkubeer by 22 °C. By ondersoek is gevind dat vlieë, sonder voorkeur, groot hoeveelhede B. cinerea op verskeie dele op die druiwekorrel-oppervlak deponeer. Bevriesingstudies het aangetoon dat die gedeponeerde konidia op verskeie dele van die korrelontkiem en die skil binnedring. Botrytis cinerea het egter meer dikwels by die korrelsteelkant as by die stempelkant, of op die wang, ontwikkel. Hierdie bevinding het 'n eiesoortige interaksie tussen B. cinerea, die vrugtevlieg en gasheerweefsel by die korrelsteelkant van die korrel aangetoon. Die verskynsel is gestaaf deur die bevinding dat B. cinerea ook meer dikwels by die korrelsteelkant van die korrels wat nie gevries is nie, ontwikkel het. Verdere bewys van hierdie interaksie is gevind by ongeskonde korrels wat aan die vlieë wat miselia gedra het blootgestel is. Die siekte het beduidend meer dikwels op gewonde as ongewonde korrels en verder aansienlik meer dikwels op die wondoppervlakte ontwikkel. Dit was ook duidelik dat vroulike vrugtevlieë baie meer vir verrotting verantwoordelik was as manlike vrugtevlieë. Die studie bewys dus dat Mediterreense vrugtevlieë die ontwikkeling van B. cinerea kan bevorder in omstandighede wat ongunstig is vir natuurlike infeksie. Die aktiwiteite van die Mediterreense vrugtevlieg C. capitata op die druiwekorrels is met behulp van digitale fotografie waargeneem. Verder is die deponering van konidia en miselia van B. cinerea op die verskillende dele (korrelsteelkant, wang en stempelkant) van die korrel, ontkieming van die swamstrukture na droeë (± 56 % RH) en nat (± 93 % RH) inkubasie en wonde wat tydens oviposisionering veroorsaak is, met epifluoressensie-mikroskopie ondersoek. Die waarnemings het onthul dat die vrugtevlieg se aktiwiteite gewoonlik tot die druiwekorrel beperk is. Hulle het korrelwange meer dikwels besoek. Besoek aan die korrelsteelkant het aansienlik toegeneem van kleurbreuk tot oestyd, wat op die moontlikheid van voedingstof-lekkasie by die deel aandui. Mikroskoopstudies het aangedui dat vlieë konidia enkel, in voedingspakkies en in fekale uitskeidings op die korreloppervlakte deponeer. Die konidia in die voedingspakkies is deur speekselvloeistof omhul en het in groepe van 10 tot 50 konidia voorgekom. Gemiddeld 60 % van die konidia in voedingspakkies het in droeë omstandighede (± 56 % RH) ontkiem. Konidia wat deur die spysverteringskanaal van die vrugtevlieg gegaan het en in die fekale ekskresie gedeponeer is, was misvorm en het lae lewensvatbaarheid gehad. Laasgenoemde konidia was nie in groepe gedeponeer nie, maar is proporsioneel met die feces op die oppervlak van die druiwekorrel versprei. Konidia wat enkel en in feces gedeponeer is, het nie ontkiem nie, tensy toestande vogtig (± 56 % RH) was. Wonde wat deur die vroulike vrugtevlieë tydens oviposisionering veroorsaak is, is meer dikwels op die wang van die korrelopgemerk. Hierdie predisposisie van druiwekorrels tot B. cinerea-infeksie, meegebring deur die aktiwiteit van die vrugtevlieg, dui daarop dat die rol wat die vrugtevlieg in die inisiëring van Botrytis trosverrottingepidemies in wingerde speel, van beduidende belang is...|$|R
40|$|The International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) {{is one of}} 13 centres {{supported}} by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). It {{is one of two}} centres dedicated to livestock research; the other is the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) in Nairobi. ILCA's goal is to increase sustainable livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa and its main target groups are smallholders and agropastoralists in the semi-arid, subhumid, humid and highland zones. The Centre's work is organized in six major research areas or thrusts: cattle milk and meat; small ruminant meat and milk; animal traction; animal feed resources trypanotolerance; and livestock policy and resource use. African national programmes have been closely involved {{in the development of the}} research programmes for each thrust, and will participate in them through collaborative projects and networks. The research is backed by training and information services to national programme staff. Two major networks are already operating under the animal feed resource thrust: the Pasture Network for Eastern and Southern Africa (PANESA) and the African Research Network on Agricultural Byproducts (ARNAB). PANESA includes multilocational pasture and forage germplasm screening trials in East and Southern Africa and is involved in developing <b>feeding</b> <b>packages.</b> The network is dual-purpose, providing a means of exchanging information and experience and acting as a coordinating body for collaborative research. The focus of ARNAB is the use of agricultural by-products, such as straws and stovers, as animal feed. A major objective of the network is to develop standardized methods for feed evaluation both in the laboratory and in feeding trials, in order to improve the comparability of results from different situations. Under ILCA's new strategy the former Small Ruminant and Camel Group network will now focus on sheep and goats only. The network is being developed into a collaborative research network under the small ruminant meat and milk thrust. The livestock policy and resource use thrust also has an existing information network the African Livestock Policy Analysis Network. Other networks are planned, including one to study the role of credil in livestock development. The African Trypanotolerant Livestock Network, coordinated jointly by ILCA and ILRAD, was established to study the complex interactions that influence trypanosomiasis and its effects on livestock performance. Two other major networks are planned: one on animal traction and one to study dairy production in West Africa. A recurrent theme in all ol ILCA's research efforts, and in the networks, is the need to share information. To help meet this need, ILCA has established an information centre unique in Africa, which includes a comprehensive library on livestock and related topics, a collection of nonconventional literature microfiched in African countries, and a variety of computerbased current awareness services. The library holds more than 15, 000 books and some 1300 general and scientific periodicals. The microfiche collection comprises more than 25, 000 documents, ranging from university theses to unpublished national programme reports, many of them selected and microfiched national programme reports, many of them selected and microfiched by ILCA in the 24 African countries covered so far. The entire library collection, including the microfiche collection, is now computerized allowing on-line searches. Several computer-based reference and current awareness services are available to African national programmes, including: - On-line literature searches of ILCA's in-house data base AGRIS, AGRICOLA and CAB International, parts of which are available on CD-ROM (see Spore 9) at ILCA; - Selective dissemination of information based on the AGRIS and CAB International data base; - Current titles, in which the contents pages of periodicals received in the library are copied and grouped into five categories (animal nutrition, animal science, agronomy and soil science, agricultural economics and rural sociology, and animal health and veterinary medicine) and sent to agricultural libraries throughout sub-Saharan Africa; - Document delivery, providing users with microfiche copies and photocopies; and - Specialized bibliographies prepared by ILCA's documentation staff.

40|$|Objectives This study {{assesses the}} risk of {{exposure}} to hazardous chemical residues in pork meat, liver, and kidney collected at wet markets in Nghe An and Hung Yen provinces and discusses health impact implication. Methods 514 pig feed, kidney, liver, and pork samples were pooled and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed for tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, sulphonamide, chloramphenicol, β-agonists, and heavy metals. We compare the results with current regulations on chemical residues and discuss health implications. Results Legal antibiotics were found in feed. Tetracycline and fluoroquinolones were not present in pork, but 11 % samples were positive with sulfamethazine above maximum residue limits (MRL); 11 % of <b>packaged</b> <b>feed</b> and 4 % of pork pooled samples were positive for chloramphenicol, a banned substance; two feed, two liver, and one pork samples were positive for β-agonists but did not exceed current MRL; 28 % of pooled samples had lead, but all were below MRL; and all samples were negative for cadmium and arsenic. Thus, the health risks due to chemical hazards in pork in Hung Yen and Nghe An seemed not as serious as what were recently communicated to the public on the mass media. Conclusions There is potential exposure to sulphonamide, chloramphenicol, and β-agonists from pork. Risk communication needs to focus on banned chemicals, while informing {{the public about the}} minimal risks associated with heavy metals.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} kinematics, redundancy resolution and control methods for Stewart platform and algorithms for mechanism design and optimization. ^ In this dissertation, techniques are developed to support Jacobian analysis and position analysis for kinematics of Stewart platform. Especially, a numerical method for finding all the solutions of the forward position analysis {{problem for the}} most general Stewart platform is presented. This method {{is based on the}} polynomial continuation method. However, it constructs start system and the homotopy based on physical design rather than mathematical equations. It has superior efficiency since it eliminates all of the extraneous paths before the solution tracking procedure starts. This method is further generalized as a 2 ̆ 2 Continuous Design Transmutation Method 2 ̆ 2 for solving problems in engineering analysis and design, which involve searching solutions of a system of polynomial equations. ^ To overcome deficiencies of Stewart platform, redundancy schema are suggested in this work. The kinematic constraint equations and system Jacobian for redundant Stewart platform are developed. The global optimal resolutions of joint rates are formulated and solved as a problem of the calculus of variations. The results show that significant improvement can be achieved by introducing and optimizing the redundant DOF. ^ A new manipulation method for controlling compliant motion of a Stewart platform is presented. In this work, the force and position variables are packed into one set of 2 ̆ 2 motion feedback 2 ̆ 2 by replacing the force errors with virtual motion quantities. The joint inputs are adjusted based on this combined <b>feed</b> back <b>package.</b> Since only the Jacobian of inverse kinematics is used in the control scheme, the computational complexity is reduced. The applications of this method are demonstrated in simulation experiments. ^ At last, a formulation and numerical method for design and optimization of the profile of cutting blades is presented. It is shown that the front line curvature of a cutting blade is related with the cutting force and input force or torque {{in the form of a}} first-order differential equation. The mechanics in the cutting process can be improved by adjusting the curvature of the rotary blade according to the solution of the differential equation. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} new analysis released {{earlier this}} month says that nearly half (49 %) of all recent tropical deforestation {{is the result of}} illegal clearing for commercial agriculture. The study also finds that around half of this illegal destruction was driven by overseas demand for agricultural commodities including palm oil, beef, soy, and wood products. In addition to devastating impacts on forest-dependent people and biodiversity, the illegal conversion of tropical forests for commercial agriculture is estimated to produce 1. 47 gigatonnes of carbon each year [...] equivalent to 25 % of the EU's annual fossil fuel-based emissions. The world must wake up to the scale of how much of this agricultural production is taking place on land that has been illegally cleared. According to the study 90 % of the deforestation in Brazil from 2000 to 2012 was illegal, primarily due to the failure to conserve a percentage of natural forests in large-scale cattle and soy plantations, as required by Brazilian law. (Much of this occurred prior to 2004, when the Brazilian government took steps to successfully reduce deforestation.) And in the forests of Indonesia, 80 % of deforestation was illegal [...] mostly for large-scale plantations producing palm oil and timber, 75 % of which is exported. While other countries also experience high levels of illegal deforestation, Brazil and Indonesia produce the highest level of agricultural commodities destined for global markets, many of which wind up in cosmetics or household goods (palm oil), animal <b>feed</b> (soy), and <b>packaging</b> (wood products) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to define}} a role of various {{maintenance}} modes, such as enteral tube feeding (ETF) and complete parenteral feeding in different phases of acute pancreatitis (AP). Subjects and materials. The impact of various modes of nutritional support on pancreatic secretory activity and the course of AP was comparatively analyzed in 774 patients (mean age 45. 3 ± 4. 7 years) with AP. The criteria for evaluation of {{the activities of the}} pancreas and its inflammatory process activity were considered to be clinical and laboratory parameters (pain, body temperature, hemogram, amylasemia, the degree of dynamic ileus and abdominal inflammatory infiltrate, and the level of gastrointestinal peptides), and ultrasonographic and computed tomographic data. The additional impact of different types of protein-calorie provision on pancreatic secretory activity was studied in 23 patients with external pancreatic fistulas, by using debetometry. Results. ETF was shown to have a stimulating effect on pancreatic secretion and AP worsening when it was used in the early phases of the disease. The optimum time of complete parenteral feeding (days 5 — 14 after the onset of the disease) and the criteria for the possible initiation of ETF were determined. Emphasis was laid on the important role of enteral <b>feeding</b> in a <b>package</b> of therapeutic measures in AP in the phase of pyonecrotic lesions. Conclusion.

All intervention farms were assigned measures to avoid buying in new animals and having direct contact or sharing water sources with other cattle. Furthermore, package A (7 farms) aimed to keep a clean environment and closed groups of young-stock; package B (14 farms) aimed for improved water and <b>feed</b> hygiene, whilst <b>package</b> C was assigned both A and B. The control farms (26 farms) were asked not to alter their practices. Farms, which were assigned intervention package A, exhibited a 48 % reduction in E.  coli O 157 burden over the 4. 5 months (average) of observation, compared to 18 % on the control farms. The effect of package A compared to the control farms in a crude intention-to-treat model was RR = 0. 26 ($p= 0 $. 122). When the risk ratio was adjusted for actual application of the different measures, the effect of intervention package A became stronger and statistically significant (RR =  0. 14 $p= 0 $. 032). Statistical evidence ($p<$  0. 05) showed that dry bedding and maintaining animals in the same groups {{were the most important}} measures within the package and weak evidence ($p<$  0. 1) showed that a closed herd policy and no contact with other cattle may also be of importance.

40|$|Lipolysis and {{oxidation}} of lipids {{in foods}} {{are the major}} biochemical and chemical processes that cause food quality deterioration, leading to the characteristic, unpalatable odour and flavour called rancidity. In addition to unpalatability, rancidity may give rise to toxic levels of certain compounds like aldehydes, hydroperoxides, epoxides and cholesterol oxidation products. In this PhD study chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques were employed to determine the degree of lipid oxidation in different animal products and its relationship with technological parameters like <b>feeding</b> fat sources, <b>packaging,</b> processing and storage conditions. To achieve this goal capillary gas chromatography (CGC) was employed not only to determine the fatty acids profile but also, after solid phase extraction, the amount of sterols (cholesterol and phytosterols) and cholesterol oxidation products (COPs). To determine hydroperoxides, primary products of oxidation and quantify secondary products UV/VIS absorbance spectroscopy was applied. Beef and pork meat {{in this study were}} analysed. In actual fact, lipid oxidation is a major deterioration reaction in meat, meat products and results in adverse changes in the colour, flavour, texture of meat and develops different compounds which should be a risk to human health as oxysterols.

40|$|Introduction: In {{patients}} with autoimmune skin blistering diseases (ABDs), the diagnostic gold standard has classically been {{direct and indirect}} immunofluorescence (DIF and IIF), despite inherent technical problems of autofluorescence. Aim: We sought to overcome autofluorescence issues and compare the reliability of immunofluorescence versus immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in the diagnoses of these diseases. Methods: We tested via IHC for anti-human IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE, Kappa light chains, Lambda light chains, Complement/C 3 c, Complement/C 1 q, Complement/C 3 d, albumin and fibrinogen in 30 patients affected by a new variant of endemic pemphigus foliaceus in El Bagre, Colombia (El Bagre-EPF), and 30 control biopsies from the endemic area. We also tested archival biopsies from {{patients with}} ABDs whose diagnoses were made clinically, histopathologically and by DIF/IIF studies from 2 independent dermatopathology laboratories in the USA. Specifically, we tested 34 patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), 18 with pemphigus vulgaris (PV), 8 with pemphigus foliaceus (PF), 14 with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and 30 control skin samples from plastic esthetic surgery reduction surgeries. Results: The diagnostic correlation between IHC and DIF-IIF was almost 98 % in most cases. IHC revealed evidence of autofluorescence around dermal blood vessels, dermal eccrine glands and neurovascular <b>packages</b> <b>feeding</b> skin appendices in ABDs; this autofluorescence may represent a non-specific immune response. Strong patterns of positivity were seen also in endothelial-mesenchymal cell junction-like structures, {{as well as between}} dermal fibrohistiocytic cells. In PV, we noted strong reactivity to neurovascular packages supplying sebaceous glands, as well as apocrine glands with edematous changes. Conclusions: We suggest that IHC is as reliable as DIF or IIF for the diagnosis of ABDs; our findings further suggest that what has previously been considered DIF/IIF autofluorescence background may be of relevance in ABDs. Our discovery of reactivity against edematous dermal apocrine glands {{may be related to the}} fact that PV has a vegetant form, with lesions present in anatomic areas where these glands exist...|$|R
40|$|In 1984, Eli Goldratt {{published}} his novel “The Goal – {{a process of}} ongoing improvement”. Constraints Management has since evolved into a field of study, still widely debated and written about today. Most companies soon realized that the principles of Constraints Management {{could no longer be}} ignored to stay competitive. The South African Breweries (now SABMiller plc) is the world's leading brewer in developing markets. The company has dominated the South African liquor market for years and is currently the second largest brewing company in the world, operating in Africa, China, Europe and the USA, yet even a company with this reputation can still be ignoring the basic principles of Constraints Management. This dissertation concentrates on the application of Constraints Management in a selected brewery in South Africa. The measures used in one of SAB’s most successful breweries will be tested against Constraints Management principles, illustrating how the practice of driving performance measures without focusing on the constraint can lead one away from the goal of the company. Rosslyn Brewery is a brewery driven by traditional brewing industry performance measures. The key drivers of the brewery have always been to increase factory efficiency and reduce costs. Rosslyn set the benchmark for packaging efficiency within SAB. The problem is that the packaging operation is not the constraint in the brewery. The throughput of the brewery is determined by the operation <b>feeding</b> into <b>packaging,</b> i. e. filtration. The end result is that even though the packaging lines have the best efficiency, they still have to stop and wait for beer to become available from filtration, resulting in downtime, frustration and eventually costly overtime and weekend work. The core conflict of the brewery is the trade-off between running all the resources as efficiently as possible, and thereby decreasing product cost, and running only the constraint as efficiently as possible, resulting in an increase in throughput. The Thinking Process was used to evaluate the conflict and a solution developed. The solution consists of the following: 1. The brewery has to adopt Constraints Management using the 5 step process of ongoing improvement. The capacity constraint has to be exploited and all other operations subordinated, to ensure that products are not produced for the sake of improving efficiency. 2. The operational measures of the brewery have to be changed from increasing factory efficiency and reducing R/hl to increasing throughput, decreasing inventory and decreasing operating expense. 3. The production schedule and raw material release for the whole plant need to be determined by filtration. This requires a change in the current advanced planning solution to incorporate the principles of Drum-Buffer-Rope. If the decision is made and actions taken, the brewery will be able to survive the next decade, even if there is a further decline in the market. If not, the focus will still be on reducing product cost, whilst improving the efficiency of all operations. This will lead to further line closures and retrenchments, doing nothing more but reducing SABMiller’s potential future capacity and flexibility.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{models for}} measuring warehouse performance {{have been used}} by single metrics and single productivity ratio such as fill rate per hour. While these traditional models are very easy to implement, they have been lacking in benchmarking performance over time. Therefore, this study aims to overcome such limitations of the traditional models by exploring the unknown relationships between performance indicators in five measurement areas: labour, cost, time, utilisation, and administration, throughout five typical steps in warehouse functions (receiving, handling, storing, order picking, and shipping). This study consists of two parts: quantitative study and qualitative study. In quantitative study, the proposed model was generated using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique together with a dataset of 201 warehouses from hard disk drive, animal <b>feed,</b> and foam <b>packaging</b> industries in Thailand. With the use of the AMOS software program, the results show that the SEM model consists of ten indicators that are significant to warehouse performance at level of significance of 0. 05. These indicators are, for example, labour hour, transportation cost, degree of space utilisation, and degree of error-free orders shipped. Importantly, the SEM model was tested whether it was acceptable based on the goodness-of-fit measures. The results show that the values obtained for the five measures: chi-square (p = 0. 217), GFI = 0. 972, NFI = 0. 971, CFI = 0. 995, and RMSEA = 0. 032 indicating that the SEM model was acceptable to measure warehouse performance. Furthermore, the SEM model was extended using an analogy based approach. This approach allows a company to retrieve other warehouses&# 146; information in order to improve their own performance. In qualitative study, the methodological triangulation was used to triangulate three different methods for warehouse performance measurement. These three methods are the SEM model, the multiple case study, and validation of the SEM model using data from 80 companies in Thailand and a company in Australia. The results show that all ten indicators from the SEM model are used by the Thai and Australian companies to measure their warehouse performance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the SEM model is able to measure warehouse performance in real situations...|$|R
40|$|The HB-Line (HBL) {{facility}} at the Savannah River Site (SRS) {{is designed to}} produce high-purity plutonium dioxide (PuO{sub 2 }) which is suitable for future use in production of Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel. The MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) requires PuO{sub 2 } <b>feed</b> to be <b>packaged</b> per the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Standard 3013 (DOE-STD- 3013) {{to comply with the}} facility's safety basis. The stabilization conditions imposed by DOE-STD- 3013 for PuO{sub 2 } (i. e., 950 C for 2 hours) preclude use of the HBL PuO{sub 2 } in direct fuel fabrication and reduce the value of the HBL product as MFFF feedstock. Consequently, HBL initiated a technical evaluation to define acceptable operating conditions for production of high-purity PuO{sub 2 } that fulfills the DOE-STD- 3013 criteria for safe storage. The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that within the defined operating conditions, the HBL process will be equivalent for meeting the requirements of the DOE-STD- 3013 stabilization process for plutonium-bearing materials from the DOE complex. The proposed 3013 equivalency reduces the prescribed stabilization temperature for high-purity PuO{sub 2 } from oxalate precipitation processes from 950 C to 640 C and places a limit of 60 % on the relative humidity (RH) at the lowest material temperature. The equivalency is limited to material produced using the HBL established flow sheet, for example, nitric acid anion exchange and Pu(IV) direct strike oxalate precipitation with stabilization at a minimum temperature of 640 C for four hours (h). The product purity must meet the MFFF acceptance criteria of 23, 600 {micro}g/g Pu (i. e., 2. 1 wt %) total impurities and chloride content less than 250 {micro}g/g of Pu. All other stabilization and packaging criteria identified by DOE-STD- 3013 - 2012 or earlier revisions of the standard apply. Based on the evaluation of test data discussed in this document, the expert judgment of the authors supports packaging the HBL product under a 3013 equivalency. Under the defined process conditions and associated material specifications, the high-purity PuO{sub 2 } produced in HBL presents no unique safety concerns for packaging or storage in the 3013 required configuration. The PuO{sub 2 } produced using the HBL flow sheet conditions will have a higher specific surface area (SSA) than PuO{sub 2 } stabilized at 950 C and, consequently, under identical conditions will adsorb more water from the atmosphere. The greatest challenge to HBL operators will be controlling moisture content below 0. 5 wt %.

By 2014, approximately 60 countries had adapted elements of the package, yet {{there has been little}} research to assess its effect. The USAID-funded Strengthening Partnerships, Results, and Innovations in Nutrition Globally (SPRING) project, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) are evaluating the effectiveness of the package when implemented at scale in one local government area in Kaduna State, Nigeria. Here we report pre-programme baseline findings on women's empowerment, which has {{an important role in the}} improvement of the nutritional status of mothers and children. Methods: We conducted a household survey to assess knowledge and attitudes about nutrition in a sample of pregnant women and mothers of children younger than 2 years in Kaduna State, Nigeria. We also used semi-structured surveys to collect quantitative and qualitative data to record attitudes of community leaders at the state and local government and community levels. Findings: Between December, 2014, and June, 2015, we collected baseline data from 2225 women who were either pregnant or had a child aged under 2 years. We included data from 78 ward and community level representatives, 86 % (67) of whom were men. Respondents from the group of pregnant women and mothers reported some decision-making power around infant and young child feeding practices; however, their level of empowerment was limited. Half of these respondents [997 [49 · 9 %] decide for themselves when to stop breastfeeding and what to feed a child (1155 [57 · 2 %], and 78 · 1 % (1583) decide when to feed a child. However, fewer than half of respondents control resources to pay for transport to health centres (905 [40 · 1 %]), medicine (910 [41 · 3 %]), fruits and vegetables (1091 [49 · 4 %]), and meat or other animal-derived foods (969 [44 · 0 %]). Most community leaders disagreed that only men should make important family decisions (70 [90 · 9 %]), but most women agreed (1350 [62 · 4 %]). Most women (1652 [78 · 3 %]) reported that, in their household, the husband alone made decisions about his wife's health care. In addition, 730 women (32 · 8 %) reported that they could not go to the health centre or doctor alone. Interpretation: Baseline findings show that it is important to challenge women's own beliefs and to actively encourage them to become advocates for their own and their children's health. For the best possible results from the C-IYCF programme we recommend discussions of women's empowerment during support group meetings, including examples of how women can express their own ideas and will; promotion of productive activities in support groups to build women's self-efficacy; and the engagement of men in discussions on nutrition and women's role in decision-making as well as priority nutrition practices for her and her child's health.
