40|$|In the {{framework}} of coupled cell systems, a coupled cell network describes graphically the dynamical dependencies between individual dynamical systems, the cells. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>network</b> of a network reveals the hidden symmetries of that network. Subspaces defined by equalities of coordinates which are flow-invariant for any coupled cell system consistent with a network structure are called the network synchrony subspaces. Moreover, for every synchrony subspaces, each network admissible system restricted to that subspace is a dynamical systems consistent with a smaller network. The original network is then {{said to be a}} lift of the smaller network. We characterize networks such that: its <b>fundamental</b> <b>network</b> is a lift of the network; the network is a subnetwork of its <b>fundamental</b> <b>network,</b> and the network is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>network.</b> The size of cycles in a network and the distance of a cell to a cycle are two important properties concerning the description of the network architecture. In this paper, we relate these two architectural properties in a network and its <b>fundamental</b> <b>network...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dynamical {{systems with}} a network {{structure}} can display anomalous bifurcations as a generic phenomenon. As {{an explanation for}} this it has been noted that homogeneous networks can be realized as quotient <b>networks</b> of so-called <b>fundamental</b> <b>networks.</b> The class of admissible vector fields for these <b>fundamental</b> <b>networks</b> {{is equal to the}} class of equivariant vector fields of the regular representation of a monoid. Using this insight, we set up a framework for center manifold reduction in <b>fundamental</b> <b>networks</b> and their quotients. We then use this machinery to explain the difference in generic bifurcations between three example networks with identical spectral properties and identical robust synchrony spaces...|$|R

We consider networks of both complex topologies and heterogeneous but chaotic oscillators, and investigate {{the onset of}} global phase synchronization. Based on a heuristic analysis and by developing an efficient numerical procedure to detect the onset of phase synchronization, we uncover a general scaling law, revealing that chaotic phase synchronization can be facilitated by making the network more densely connected.

30|$|Our {{proposed}} {{method is}} primarily directed at proper route selection at mobile network level for message delivery. As is well recognized, routing forms {{the crux of}} mobile communication. Improper routing can set off problems such as delays, jitters, packet drops, etc. in a network.

Our proposed algorithm, also takes into account selection of base station before routing calculation and implementation can take place.|$|E
