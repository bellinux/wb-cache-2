50|$|This gene is {{directly}} involved, with Myc and IgH, in a three-way <b>gene</b> <b>translocation</b> in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. As {{a result of}} the <b>gene</b> <b>translocation,</b> the N-terminal region of the gene product is disrupted, which is thought {{to be related to the}} pathogenesis of a subset of high-grade B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The N-terminal segment involved in the translocation includes the region that shares a strong sequence similarity with those of BCL7B and BCL7C. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.|$|E
50|$|Transcription {{factories}} are also suggested {{to be responsible}} for gene clustering, this is because related genes would require the same transcriptional machinery and if a factory satisfies these needs the genes would be attracted to the factory. While the clustering of genes can be beneficial for transcriptional efficiency, there could be negative consequences to this. <b>Gene</b> <b>translocation</b> events occur when genes are in close proximity to one another; which will occur more often when a transcriptional factory is present. <b>Gene</b> <b>translocation</b> events, like point mutations, generally are detrimental to the organism and so therefore could lead to the possibility of disease. However, on the other hand recent research has suggested that there is no correlation between inter-gene interactions and translocation frequencies.|$|E

5000|$|Treatment lengths vary {{depending}} on location and stage of the disease at diagnosis. Radical chemotherapy may be as short as six treatments at 3-week cycles, but most patients undergo chemotherapy for 6-12 months and radiation therapy for 5-8 weeks.Radiotherapy {{has been used for}} localized disease. The tumor has a unique property of being highly sensitive to radiation, sometimes acknowledged by the phrase [...] "melting like snow", but the main drawback is that it recurs dramatically after some time. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been proposed as possible treatment by down-regulating the expression of the oncogenic fusion protein associated with the development of Ewing's sarcoma resulting from the EWS-ETS <b>gene</b> <b>translocation.</b> In addition, the synthetic retinoid derivative fenretinide (4-hydroxy(phenyl)retinamide) has been reported to induce high levels of cell death in Ewing's sarcoma cell lines in vitro and to delay growth of xenografts in in vivo mouse models.|$|E
40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>translocations</b> that repress the {{function}} of the Runx 1 transcription factor {{play a critical role in}} the development of myeloid leukemia. In this report, we demonstrate that Runx 1 precisely regulates c-fms (CSF- 1 receptor) gene expression. Runx 1 controlled expression by binding to multiple sites within the mouse c-fms gene, allowing interaction between promoter and downstream enhancer elements. The runx 1 and c-fms genes showed an identical pattern of expression in mature macrophages. Runx 1 expression was repressed in CSF- 1 stimulated, proliferating bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and significantly increased in quiescent, CSF- 1 starved cells. The RAW 264. 7 and Mono-Mac- 6, macrophage-like cell lines expressed low levels of Runx 1 and both showed growth arrest and cell death with ectopic expression of Runx 1. The EM- 3 cell line, which represents an early myeloid progenitor cell line, showed growth arrest with Runx 1 expression in the absence of any detectable changes in cell differentiation. These findings suggest that Runx 1 regulates growth and survival of myeloid cells and provide a novel insight into the role of Runx family <b>gene</b> <b>translocations</b> in leukemogenesis...|$|R

50|$|Overexpression is induced as {{a result}} of gene amplification, growth factor or {{oncogene}} induced expression by Src, Ras, ErbB2, STAT3, STAT5,Â  impaired protein degradation, or chromosomal translocation. Gene amplification is responsible for overproduction of cyclin D protein in bladder cancer and esophageal carcinoma, among others. In cases of sarcomas, colorectal cancers and melanomas, cyclin D overproduction is noted, however, without the amplification of the chromosomal region that encodes it (chromosome 11q13, putative oncogene PRAD1, which has been identified as a translocation event in case of mantle cell lymphoma).In parathyroid adenoma, cyclin D hyper-production is caused by chromosomal translocation, which would place expression of cyclin D (more specifically, cyclin D1) under an inappropriate promoter, leading to overexpression. In this case, cyclin D gene has been translocated to the parathyroid hormone gene, and this event caused abnormal levels of cyclin D.The same mechanisms of overexpression of cyclin D is observed in some tumors of the antibody-producing B cells. Likewise, overexpression of cyclin D protein due to <b>gene</b> <b>translocation</b> is observed in human breast cancer.|$|E

Here we have examined gene translocations and lateral gene transfers in closely related genome pairs. The results reveal that translocated genes undergo elevated rates of evolution and <b>gene</b> <b>translocation</b> tends to take place preferentially in recently acquired genes.

40|$|Background: Synovial sarcoma is an {{aggressive}} tumor {{and has two}} common histological subtype, biphasic and monophasic. It has SYT-SSX gene fusion that decreases expression of p 53 tumor suppressor. The prognosis is associated with mitosis and tumor diameter. Therefore this study conducted to know the pattern of p 53 expresion and its association with mitosis, histological subtype, and other prognosis factors. Methods: Twenty synovial sarcoma cases consisted of 4 monophasic and 16 biphasic cases from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital â Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia (CMHospital-FMUI) 2005 - 2011 were analyzed for association of p 53 expression and mitosis as prognostic factor. Haematoxylin-eosin slides were used to count mitosis. Paraffin block materials were used to analyze p 53 expression by immunohistochemistry and to detect SYT <b>gene</b> <b>translocation</b> by FISH (Fluorescein in situ Hybridization). Results: The Fisherâs exact test showed that positive p 53 expression was associated with tumor diameter < 5 cm {{although it was not}} associated with mitosis. The histological subtype has no association with p 53 expression and mitosis. Unfortunately, only 7 / 19 cases were positive for FISH-SYT <b>gene</b> <b>translocation.</b> Conclusion: In synovial sarcoma, p 53 expression is associated with tumor diameter.

One of these lymphomas, involving the gallbladder and duodenum, showed a marginal zone lymphoma-like (MALT type) pattern of cellular infiltration with CD 5 negativity but (unexpectedly) Cyclin D 1 positivity. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of this case was performed because of the aberrant expression of Cyclin D 1, and was clearly positive for the Cyclin D 1 <b>gene</b> <b>translocation.</b> The second case, occurring in a lymph node, showed the typical growth pattern of a follicular lymphoma but it had an atypical immunophenotype, namely, expression of Cyclin D 1, CD 10, and Bcl 2 and focally Bcl 6, accompanied {{by a lack of}} CD 5 and CD 23.
