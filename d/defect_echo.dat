40|$|Axles are {{important}} part of railway locomotives and vehicles. Periodic ultrasonic inspection of axles can effectively detect and monitor axle fatigue cracks. However, in the axle press-fit zone, the complex interface contact condition reduces the signal-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, the probability of false positives and false negatives increases. In this work, a novel wavelet threshold function is created to remove noise and suppress press-fit interface echoes in axle ultrasonic defect detection. The exponential threshold function proposed by Andria [1] can 2 ̆ 7 t get a gradual curve for later optimum searching process; and the novel wavelet threshold function with two variables is designed to ensure the precision of optimum searching process. Based on the positive correlation between the correlation coefficient and SNR [2] and with the experiment phenomenon that the defect and the press-fit interface echo have different axle-circumferential correlation characteristics, a discrete optimum searching process for two undetermined variables in novel wavelet threshold function is conducted. The performance of the proposed method is assessed by comparing it with traditional threshold methods using real data.

In this method, IE method is used for the detailed nondestructive evaluation of concrete structure and Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) method is employed for the measurement of the average P-wave velocity of whole thickness. The signal received by the transducer in the IE test consists in a sum of the direct surface wave and side echoes, the bottom or <b>defect</b> <b>echo</b> (target echo), and the background noise. In the FFT based frequency domain analysis, sometimes, it is difficult and not straightforward to extract the information on the target echo. The time-frequency analysis can provide the temporal variation in frequency components of the signal and thereby has advantages in the analysis of IE signal. In this paper, time-frequency analysis based on short-time Fourier transform is presented to improve the interpretation of IE signal.

40|$|We have {{explained}} in previous papers [1, 2] {{a completely different}} NDE technique applied to the titanium alloy billet, the time reversal process, which allows conversion of a divergent wave issuing from a defect into a convergent wave focusing on it.

However, this technique is subject to the principal NDE systems problem: the false alarms. Indeed, high levels of grain noise can mask signals from smaller or lower acoustic reflectivity flaws and than a grains configuration can be confused with a small defect.

The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the outcomes of transcatheter closure of secundum atrial septal defects (ASDs) in elderly patients. Patients and methods: From a total of 488 patients with ASDs who underwent transcatheter closure, 75 patients aged over 60 years (45 female, 30 male) with a mean age of 65. 3 ± 15. 7 (60 – 75) years were analyzed. All patients had an isolated secundum ASD with a mean pulmonary blood flow:systemic blood flow of 2. 84 ± 1. 9 (1. 5 – 3. 9). Symptom-limited treadmill exercise tests with respiratory gas-exchange analysis and transthoracic color Doppler echocardiographic study, as well as quality of life measured using the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF- 36) were repeated in all patients before the procedure and after 12 months of follow-up. Results: The atrial septal device was successfully implanted in all patients (procedure time 37. 7 ± 4. 5 [13 – 59] minutes, fluoroscopy time 11. 2 ± 9. 9 [6 – 40] minutes). There were no major complications. The <b>defect</b> <b>echo</b> diameter was 17. 7 ± 15. 8 (12 – 30) mm. The mean balloon-stretched diameter of ASDs was 22. 4 ± 7. 9 (14 – 34) mm. The diameter of the implanted devices ranged from 16 to 34 mm. Significant improvement of exercise capacity was noted at 6 and 12 months after the procedure. Exercise time within 6 months of ASD closure was longer (P< 0. 001) compared to baseline values, and also oxygen consumption increased (P< 0. 001). Seven quality-of-life parameters (except mental health) improved at 12 -month follow-up compared to baseline data. The mean SF- 36 scale increased significantly in 66 (88 %) patients, with a mean of 46. 2 ± 19. 1 (5 – 69). As early as 1 month after the procedure, a significant decrease of the right ventricular dimension and the right atrium dimension was observed (P< 0. 001). The right ventricular dimension decreased in 67 patients (89. 3 %).

An analytical solution to the noncoherent detection problem is derived, which in contrast to the classical noncoherent detector, is optimal for wideband signals. An optimal detector for multiple transient signals with unknown arrival times is also derived and shown to yield higher detection performance compared to the classical approach based on the generalized likelihood ratio test. An application that is treated in some detail is that of ultrasonic nondestructive testing, particularly pulse-echo detection of defects in elastic solids. The defect detection problem is cast as a composite hypothesis test and a methodology, based on physical models, for designing statistically optimal detectors for cracks in elastic solids is presented. Detectors for defects with low computational complexity are also formulated based on a simple phenomenological model of the <b>defect</b> <b>echoes.</b> The performance of these detectors are compared with the physical model-based optimal detector and is shown to yield moderate performance degradation. Various aspects of optimal detection in static nonlinear sensor systems are also treated, in particular the stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon which, in this context, implies noise enhanced detectability. Traditionally, SR has been quantified by means of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and interpreted as an increase of a system's information processing capability.

In his escape, he kills or maims several Dolls and Dollhouse staff members (including Echo's previous handler) but leaves Echo unscathed. After his escape from the Dollhouse, Alpha begins to send anonymous packages to Paul Ballard that hint at the existence of the Dollhouse and Echo's former identity. Alpha reveals himself after posing as an Environmental Systems Consultant involved {{in the construction of the}} Los Angeles Dollhouse facility, Stephen Kepler, whom Ballard has tracked down. He leads Ballard into the Dollhouse, takes control of the security and automated systems, and leaves with Echo. Though Echo escapes him, he remains at large. On learning of Echo's full self-actualisation and her romantic attraction to Paul Ballard, he imprints Paul's personality into himself and leaves the real Ballard brain-dead. In the series finale, Alpha is shown to have <b>defected</b> to <b>Echo's</b> side. When the wiping technology is to be reversed, Alpha isolates himself from the group in fear that his pre-wiped personality as a serial killer would lead the others to danger.|$|R
40|$|When {{detecting}} the ultrasonic flaw of thick-walled pipe, the flaw echo signals are often interrupted by scanning system frequency and background noise. In particular when the thick-walled pipe <b>defect</b> is small, <b>echo</b> signal amplitude is often drowned in noise signal and affects {{the extraction of}} defect signal and the position determination accuracy. This paper presents the modified S-transform domain singular value decomposition method {{for the analysis of}} ultrasonic flaw echo signals. By changing the scale rule of Gaussian window functions with S-transform to improve the time-frequency resolution. And the paper tries to decompose the singular value decomposition of time-frequency matrix after the S-transform to determine the singular entropy of effective echo signal and realize the adaptive filter. Experiments show that, using this method can not only remove high frequency noise but also remove the low frequency noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of echo signal...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{attempted}} a qauntitative analysis of atrial septal defect (ASD) shunt by means of multiplane transesophageal echocardiography. We studied 18 ASD patients (pts), aged 13 to 69 yrs (median 32, 3 yrs), and considered flow convergence signal as a marker for shunt flow. The maximum axial distance of the first color alias ASD flow convergence region (FCR) from the left atrial defect border was measured. Using the hemispherical isovelocity surface assumption peak shunt flow (Q) was calculated (ml/s) as follows: Q= 2 r 2 Va, where r (cm) is the maximal distance of the flow convergence and Va (cm/s) is the aliasing velocity used for imaging of the flow convergence. The same peak shunt flow rate was also measured {{as the product of}} the CW or high PRF pulsed Doppler peak velocity of the shunt flow and the corresponding smallest diameter of the <b>defect.</b> Contrast <b>echo</b> was performed using saline infusion and videointensity signal was used to calculate shunt flow. Peak shunt flow rates calculated by the flow convergence method correlated well with those derived from CW or PW Doppler velocity-time integral (y= 0. 93 x – 6. 1, r= 0. 95, p< 0. 0001, SEE= 15 ml/s) and those derived from contrast echo (y= 0. 98 x – 6. 8, r= 0. 93, p< 0. 0001, SEE= 12 ml/s). In 6 pts Qp/Qs calculated by oximetry method at cardiac catheterization showed good agreement with echo results. Thus, each TEE method allows an accurate quantitative evaluation of ASD shunt flow...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} quantitate shunt in atrial septal defects (ASD), we studied 17 ASD {{patients}} (pts), aged 13 to 68 yrs (median 31, 7 yrs), by multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

40|$|Twelve {{cases of}} endocardial cushion defect were studied {{before and after}} {{operation}} with ultrasono-cardiotomography (tomography) cross-sectional echocardiography, two-dimensional echocardiography, B-scan echocardiography) and M-mode scan along a horizontal section of the heart. For comparison, 20 healthy subjects, 18 cases of mitral valvular disease, 4 cases of congestive cardiomyopathy, 1 case of partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, and 25 cases of atrial septal defect of secundum type were also examined with the same technique. In cases without cardiac malformation, the echo of the anterior mitral valve was usually continuous medially {{with that of the}} interatrial septum in the horizontal plane {{at the level of the}} membranous septum. This feature was clearly recorded in all cases with right heart enlargement. In ostium secundum atrial septal <b>defect</b> the <b>echo</b> of the anterior mitral valve continued into that of the interatrial septum. An echo interruption was shown, indicating the defect itself to be in the middle part of the interatrial septum. In all the cases of endocardial cushion defect which we examined discontinuity was shown between the echo of the anterior mitral valve and that of the interatrial septum. This discontinuity was interpreted as indicating the defect itself. The mitral valve ring echo was close to the basal end of that of the interventricular septum, possibly reflecting an abnormal attachment of the mitral valve. In all cases, after operation, the echo of the artificial interatrial septum was recorded, continuous with that of the anterior mitral valve. The features of the echocardiographic sweep from the anterior mitral valve to the interatrial septum were thus different in the three groups. These echocardiographic differences are thought to correspond to the anatomical differences between the normal, atrial septal defect of secundum type, and endocardial cushion defect, and are essential features differentiating them from each other...|$|R
40|$|Funicular shell {{structures}} are usually associated to synclastic shapes, which are concave towards the inside. The {{use of these}} shapes as sound reflective ceilings in auditoria is generally avoided as they can cause undesirable sound concentrations. These {{are the source of}} acoustical <b>defects,</b> such as <b>echoes</b> and colouration, and tend to have a negative subjective impression by the audience. Existing concert spaces built with synclastic shapes thus typically had to be altered by invasive sound reflective surfaces and treatments that significantly influence their spatial quality. Previous research on the use of Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGAs) for the shape optimization of concert spaces shows the acoustic potential of freeform, continuous surfaces with both convex and concave areas, and the difficulty of achieving high standards with synclastic shapes (Mendez Echenagucia et al. [13], Mendez Echenagucia [14]). Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) is capable of generating compression-only shapes that go beyond synclastic surfaces, thus presenting an opportunity for the use of funicular structures for concert auditoria (Block [6]). This paper presents the use of Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGAs) for the acoustical optimization of compression-only shell structures. The MOGA combines ray-tracing simulation fo...|$|R
40|$|Total Focusing Method imaging based is an {{ultrasonic}} testing method which {{has emerged in}} recent years as alternative to standard phased array inspection methods in non-destructive testing, due to its high resolution and the realistic images of defects it provides. In case of crack like defects, it provides realistic images where the profile and the tips of the defects are reconstructed. TFM imaging relocates energy of temporal signals at the spatial position of the reflectors which gave them birth. Thereby, diffraction echoes are located {{at the tip of the}} <b>defect,</b> and specular <b>echoes</b> appear along the proofle of the defect. This signature allows to characterise with confidence the planar nature of the defect. However, a correct reconstruction requires to use the relevant ultrasonic path to produce the wanted echoes among a large number of possible pathsbetween the array transducer and the reflector. In this paper, we have developed a method based on physical considerations, for predicting relevant paths. The developed tool will be applied on several inspection congurations involving notches nearby welds. Validation will be achieved from a variety of synthetic and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A semi-analytical {{modeling}} {{approach of}} the ultrasonic beam-defect interaction developed by CEA (the French Atomic Energy Commission) has been implemented within the CIVA software since many years. This model is based on Auld’s reciprocity arguments between transmitted and received ultrasonic fields and on the application of suitable approximate theories such as Kirchhoff approximation or geometrical theory of diffraction for the field-to-flaw interaction. The simulations features include prediction of <b>echoes</b> arising from <b>defects</b> (direct specular <b>echoes,</b> corner echoes with reflection at the backwall, account for mode conversions due to reflections at the defect or at the backwall), as well as geometrical echoes due to reflections on the specimen boundaries. With the successive versions of the software this approach is continuously improved in order to extend its applicability to more complex configurations and also, when needed, to enhance its reliability. Widening the scope of applicability has been requiring, in parallel, a multiplication of experimental campaigns of validation. In this communication we recall the theoretical basis of the approach. We present the most recent evolutions of the models which mainly concern inspections of parts showing complex geometries. In such configurations, we show various examples of experimental validation performed on realistic mock-ups containing artificial reflectors (electro-eroded notches, side drilled holes …). Introduction: Ultrasonic modeling tools have been gathered in the CIVA software developed at the French Atomi...|$|R
