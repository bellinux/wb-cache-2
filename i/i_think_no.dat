25|$|Pennsylvania {{has passed}} a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his {{religious}} faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>no</b> State can constitutionally demand. For me {{this is not something}} that can be swept under the rug and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.|$|E

When the simple funeral {{was held in the}} Homestead's entrance hall, Emily stayed in her room with the door cracked open. Neither did she attend the memorial service on June 28. She wrote to Higginson that her father's [...] "Heart was pure and terrible and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>no</b> other like it exists." [...] A year later, on June 15, 1875, Emily's mother also {{suffered a stroke}}, which produced a partial lateral paralysis and impaired memory. Lamenting her mother's increasing physical as well as mental demands, Emily wrote that [...] "Home is so far from Home".|$|E

2500|$|Inquiring {{after the}} reliques of former manners, I {{found that in}} Ulva, and, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>no</b> where else, is {{continued}} the payment of the Mercheta Mulierum; a fine in old times due to the Laird at the marriage of a virgin. The original of this claim, as of our tenure of Borough English, is variously delivered. It is pleasant to find ancient customs in old families. This payment, like others, was, for want of money, made anciently in the produce of the land. Macquarry was used to demand a sheep, for which he now takes a crown, by that inattention to the uncertain proportion between the value and the denomination of money, which has brought much disorder into Europe. A sheep has always the same power of supplying human wants, but a crown will bring at one time more, at another less. (Johnson) ...|$|E
2500|$|Fremantle went on {{to write}} in his book [...] "Three Months in the Southern States" [...] that he had [...] "not {{attempted}} to conceal any of the peculiarities or defects of the Southern people. Many persons will doubtless highly disapprove {{of some of their}} customs and habits in the wilder portion of the country; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>no</b> generous man, whatever may be his political opinions, can do otherwise than admire the courage, energy, and patriotism of the whole population, and the skill of its leaders, in this struggle against great odds. And I am also of opinion that many will agree with me in thinking that a people in which all ranks and both sexes display a unanimity and a heroism which can never have been surpassed {{in the history of the}} world, is destined, sooner or later, to become a great and independent nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1931, New York Times {{reporter}} William Buehler Seabrook, allegedly in {{the interests}} of research, obtained from a hospital intern at the Sorbonne a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident, then cooked and ate it. He reported, [...] "It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>no</b> person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable." ...|$|E

2500|$|.....by far {{the most}} Radical measure of my lifetime. I do not object to the {{principle}} of graduated taxation: for the just principle of ability to pay is not determined simply by the amount of income.... But, so far as I understand the present measure of finance from the partial reports I have received, I find it too violent. It involves a great departure from the methods of political action established in this country, where reforms, and especially financial reforms, have always been considerate and even tender.... I do not yet see the ground on which it can be justly held that any one description of property should be more heavily burdened than others, unless moral and social grounds can be shown first: but in this case the reasons drawn from those sources seem rather to verge in the opposite direction, for real property has more of presumptive connection with the discharge of duty that that which is ranked as personal...the aspect of the measure is not satisfactory to a man of my traditions (and these traditions lie near the roots of my being).... For the sudden introduction of such change there is <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>no</b> precedent {{in the history of this}} country. And the severity of the blow is greatly aggravated in moral effect by the fact that it is dealt only to a handful of individuals.|$|E
