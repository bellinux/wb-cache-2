Based on in-depth interviews with these leaders, she explores how the Movement’s commitment to Morocco as well as the ummah (Universal Community of Believers) interact with the way these muslims perceive and position themselves in the national context of Spain. Se examina en este ensayo la evolución reciente de las asociaciones musulmanas en España creadas por inmigrantes marroquíes vinculados al movimiento islámico al-‘Adl wa-l-Ihsan (Justicia y Espiritualidad). Partiendo de las declaraciones de un liderazgo emergente de este movimiento en España, la autora trata de explicar cómo el compromiso político de estas personas y el vínculo espiritual con su Guía marroquí incorporan, al tiempo que reelaboran, elementos del discurso dominante sobre la necesaria adaptación del islam a España. Entrevistas en profundidad con estos activistas revelan cómo los lazos del Movimiento con Marruecos y con la umma (Comunidad universal de creyentes) interactúan con el modo en el que estos musulmanes perciben y se posicionan en el contexto nacional de España...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2011. Major: Political science. Advisors: David Samuels, Kethleen Collins. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 252 pages, appendix A. The main question I explore in my dissertation is, "Why are some Islamic movements forming political parties {{while others are}} staying as movements?" Although many observers assume that Islamist movements tend to be radical, numerous movements across the Muslim world have deliberately chosen to attempt {{to work within the}} existing political system by formally becoming political parties. Cases of such transformation have occurred in democracies (e. g. Indonesia) and in authoritarian regimes (e. g. Yemen), and in countries using Islamic law (e. g. Jordan) as well as in those with secular legal systems (e. g. Turkey). Hence, it cannot be explained as a function of political liberalization. My findings also challenge the argument that a rising Muslim middle class is driving the creation of new Islamic political parties (IPPs) : sometimes IPPs form {{in the absence of a}} middle class, and sometimes they do not form even despite considerable middle-class pressure. Thus, IPP formation presents a widespread and important yet unexplored political puzzle in the Muslim world vis-à-vis the question of Muslim democracy [...] a discussion my dissertation takes head-on. I argue that factors internal to Islamist movements matter for understanding why some movements become parties and others do not. I have found that movements with a vanguard mobilization strategy, in which a small group of leaders frame the cause and mobilize masses around an Islamic identity, tend to establish parties. In contrast, movements with a grassroots mobilization strategy in which the aim is to construct mass consciousness through grassroots activities tend to remain outside of formal politics, eschewing party formation. I develop my argument based on in-depth qualitative fieldwork in three countries on five Islamist movements: Turkey and Morocco each host one movement that became a party (National View Movement/Turkey, Unity and Reform Movement/Morocco); and one that rejects party formation (Gűlen Movement/Turkey, <b>Justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spirituality</b> Movement/Morocco). Jordan, meanwhile, hosts the Muslim Brotherhood, which spawned the Islamic Action Front Party, and provides an interesting case of movement-party co-existence. These five cases vary on the question of whether and when a party was formed, thereby controlling for the influence of external factors and focusing on internal dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Religion <b>and</b> <b>spirituality</b> {{are major}} {{forces in the}} lives of Americans and are {{especially}} salient for women and families in the time surrounding the birth of a child. A large and growing body of research indicates that specific aspects of religiousness <b>and</b> <b>spirituality</b> are associated with better physical and mental health. However, the mechanisms of these associations are not well understood, though many have been hypothesized. The hypothesized mechanisms are reviewed to develop a conceptual model of religiousness, <b>spirituality,</b> physical <b>and</b> mental health, and their mechanisms and empirical evidence supporting these pathways is examined. This conceptual model provides the basis for several hypotheses tested in three studies which examined associations of religiousness <b>and</b> <b>spirituality,</b> together <b>and</b> separately, with three markers of health: depressive symptoms, the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein, and the diurnal slopes of the stress hormone, cortisol, and tested psychosocial resources as a mechanism of these associations in a large sample of postpartum women. Psychosocial resources and the religiousness <b>and</b> <b>spirituality</b> constructs were operationalized with multiple measures and tested in a study of low income postpartum women who were of diverse ethnicity. Results indicated that psychosocial resources composed of indices of mastery, self-esteem and optimism were associated with religiousness <b>and</b> <b>spirituality.</b> Furthermore, religiousness <b>and</b> <b>spirituality</b> were associated with depressive symptoms and C-reactive protein, but not diurnal cortisol slope. In particular, higher religiousness <b>and</b> <b>spirituality</b> both together <b>and</b> separately predicted lower depressive symptoms throughout the first year postpartum. Higher religiousness <b>and</b> <b>spirituality</b> together <b>and</b> <b>spirituality</b> alone predicted lower C-reactive protein at six months postpartum. The psychosocial resource factor composed of mastery, self-esteem, and optimism mediated the associations of religiousness <b>and</b> <b>spirituality</b> with depressive symptoms, but not of associations of religiousness <b>and</b> <b>spirituality</b> with C-reactive protein. These findings contribute substantially to existing knowledge by demonstrating a link between <b>spirituality</b> <b>and</b> inflammation for the first time, and regarding psychological resources as mechanisms of associations of religiousness, <b>spirituality,</b> <b>and</b> health-related outcomes. These findings can guide future research on associations of religiousness, <b>spirituality,</b> <b>and</b> health and their mechanisms...|$|R
