40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} <b>in</b> heroin-assisted treatment (<b>HAT)</b> {{compared to}} methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) : {{the course of}} heroin craving and illicit heroin use, their mutual association, and their association with multi-domain treatment response. Design: RCTs on the efficacy of 12 months co-prescribed injectable or inhalable HAT compared to 12 months continued oral MMT. Setting: Outpatient treatment in MMT- or specialized HAT-centers in the Netherlands. Participants: Chronic, treatment-refractory heroin dependent patients (n= 73). Study parameters: General craving for heroin (Obsessive Compulsive Drug Use Scale) : self-reported illicit heroin use; multi-domain treatment response in physical, mental and social health and illicit drug use. Findings: The course of heroin craving and illicit heroin use differed significantly, with strong reductions <b>in</b> <b>HAT</b> but not <b>in</b> MMT. General heroin craving {{was significantly related to}} illicit heroin use. Heroin craving was not and illicit heroin use was marginally related to multi-domain treatment response, but only in MMT and not <b>in</b> <b>HAT.</b> Conclusions: Heroin craving and illicit heroin use were significantly associated and both strongly decreased <b>in</b> <b>HAT</b> but not <b>in</b> MMT. Craving was not related to multi-domain treatment response and illicit heroin use was marginally related to treatment response in MMT, but not <b>in</b> <b>HAT.</b> The latter was probably due to the strong reduction in illicit heroin use in most patients <b>in</b> <b>HAT</b> and the small sample size of the sub-study. It is hypothesized that the strong reductions in craving for heroin <b>in</b> <b>HAT</b> are related to the stable availability of prescribed, pharmaceutical grade heroin.
