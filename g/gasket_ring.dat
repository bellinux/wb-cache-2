Examination revealed that the failure was by sulphide stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Analysis suggests that most probably, the SCC was promoted in the components because of formation of polythionic acid in the system in presence of O 2 and/or H 2 O. Compositional analysis showed that the ring and the flange were fabricated from SS 347 and SS 321 steels respectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel micro dynamically tuned gyroscope (MDTG) with adjustable static capacitance. First, {{the principle of}} MDTG is theoretically analyzed. Next, some simulations under the optimized structure parameters are given as a reference for the mask design of the rotor wafer and electrode plates. As two key components, the process flows of the rotor wafer and electrode plates are described in detail. All the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photos show that the fabrication process is effective and optimized. Then, an assembly model is designed for the static capacitance adjustable MDTG, whose static capacitance can be changed by rotating the lower electrode plate support and substituting <b>gasket</b> <b>rings</b> of different thicknesses. Thus, the scale factor is easily changeable. Afterwards, the digitalized closed-loop measurement circuit is simulated. The discrete correction and decoupling modules are designed to make the closed-loop stable and cross-coupling effect small. The dual axis closed-loop system bandwidths can reach more than 60 Hz and the dual axis scale factors are completely symmetrical. All the simulation results demonstrate the proposed fabrication of the MDTG can meet the application requirements.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{hydrothermal}} moissanite cell for in situ experiments at pressures up to 1000 bar and temperature to 850 Â°C. The original moissanite cell presented by Schiavi et al. (2010) was redesigned to allow precise control of fluid pressure. The new device {{consists of a}} cylindrical sample chamber drilled into a bulk piece of NIMONIC 105 super alloy, which is connected through a capillary to an external pressure control system. Sealing is provided by two gold <b>gasket</b> <b>rings</b> between the moissanite windows and the sample chamber. The new technique allows the direct observation of various phenomena, such as bubble nucleation, bubble growth, crystal growth, and crystal dissolution in silicate melts, at accurately controlled rates of heating, cooling, and compression or decompression. Several pilot experiments on bubble nucleation and growth at temperature of 715 Â°C and under variable pressure regimes (pressure oscillations between 500 and 1000 bar and decompression from 800 to 200 bar at variable decompression rates) were conducted using a haplogranitic glass as starting material. Bubble nucleation occurs in a short single event upon heating of the melt above the glass transition temperature and upon decompression, but only during the first 100 bar of decompression. New bubbles nucleate only {{at a distance from}} existing bubbles larger than the mean diffusive path of water in the melt. Bubbles expand and shrink instantaneously in response to any pressure change. The bubble-bubble contact induced during pressure cycling and decompression does not favor bubble coalescence, which is never observed at contact times shorter than 60 s. However, repeated pressure changes favor the diffusive coarsening of larger bubbles {{at the expense of the}} smaller ones (Ostwald ripening). Experiments with the haplogranite show that, under the most favorable conditions of volatile supersaturation (as imposed by the experiment), highly viscous melts are likely to maintain the packing of bubbles for longer time before fragmentation. In-situ observations with the new hydrothermal moissanite cell allow to carefully assess the conditions of bubble nucleation, eliminating the uncertainty given by the post mortem observation of samples run using conventional experimental techniques...|$|R

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop tooling {{and equipment to}} remotely replace gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors to reduce personnel radiation exposure {{as compared to the}} current hands-on method. It is also expected that radiation levels will continually increase with future waste streams. The equipment is operated in the Remote Equipment Decontamination Cell (REDC), which is equipped with compressed air, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and an electro-mechanical manipulator (EMM) arm for operation of the remote tools. The REDC does not provide access to electrical power, so the equipment must be manually or pneumatically operated. The MSM's have a load limit at full extension of ten pounds, which limited the weight of the installation tool. In order to remotely replace Hanford connector gaskets several operations must be performed remotely, these include: removal of the spent <b>gasket</b> and retaining <b>ring</b> (retaining ring is also called snap ring), loading the new snap <b>ring</b> and <b>gasket</b> into the installation tool and installation of the new gasket into the Hanford connector. SRNL developed and tested tools that successfully perform all of the necessary tasks. Removal of snap rings from horizontal and vertical connectors is performed by separate air actuated retaining ring removal tools and is manipulated in the cell by the MSM. In order install a new <b>gasket,</b> the snap <b>ring</b> loader is used to load a new snap ring into a groove in the gasket installation tool. A new gasket is placed on the installation tool and retained by custom springs. An MSM lifts the installation tool and presses the mounted gasket against the connector block. Once the installation tool is in position, the <b>gasket</b> and snap <b>ring</b> are installed onto the connector by pneumatic actuation. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. Extensive testing of tooling operation was performed in the DWPF manipulator repair shop. This testing allowed the operators to gain confidence before the equipment was exposed to radioactive contamination. The testing also led to multiple design improvements.

50|$|Pressure cookers are {{considerably}} {{more expensive than}} conventional saucepans of the same size. The additional <b>gasket</b> (sealing <b>ring)</b> requires special care when cleaning (e.g., not washed with kitchen knives), unlike a standard lid for a saucepan. Food debris must be cleaned from the gasket after every use. The gasket/sealing ring needs replacing with a new one about once a year (or sooner if it is damaged e.g. a small split). A very dry gasket can make it difficult or impossible to close the lid, however smearing the gasket sparingly with vegetable oil alleviates this problem (using too much vegetable oil can make the gasket swell and prevent it sealing properly). A gasket which has lost its flexibility makes bringing the cooker up to pressure difficult as steam can escape before sufficient pressure is generated to provide an adequate seal; this is usually {{a sign that the}} gasket needs replacing with a new one. Oiling the gasket with vegetable oil may alleviate the problem temporarily, but a new gasket is often required. Pressure cooker manufacturers sell replacement gaskets and recommend their replacement at regular intervals e.g. annually. If the pressure cooker has not been used for a long time, the gasket and other rubber or silicone parts will dry out and will likely need replacing.|$|R

Spiral wound gasket {{is an important component}} in the pipe system, this is because it functions as an additional component during the installation process pipe. It works to prevent the occurrence of leakage in the pipe connection system. These gaskets also have the distinct advantages that can withstand the high temperatures and pressures because the material used for manufacturing is gasket material that can withstand the high temperatures and pressures.

40|$|Tightness of flange joints {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes –Part 1 Numerical simulations Leaks occasionally occur in flange joints in plastic pipelines, predominantly large dimension ones. Such pipelines are normally {{of importance for}} e g water supply, and repair is expensive. A better understanding is vital since a clear background is missing for the existing design and mounting recommendations, which also are differing. Analysis of plastic flanges {{is more complicated than}} for metal ones since the material is time dependent, and much softer than the backing rings and bolts. The aim of this work was to be able to assess on one hand if presently standardized flange geometries mean smaller safety margins when the size of the pipe is increased, {{and on the other hand}} if the instructions for mounting have to be improved. First, an analysis was made by manual calculations, without consideration of the time dependent properties of the material, in order to assess the stresses just after tightening of the joint but before pressurizing and start of service time of the pipeline. The manualanalysis is of course misleading for assessment of the compression stresses in the flange surfaces over time, although it seems that such calculations often are used for design. The value of the manual analysis was mainly that it showed that the nominal stresses aresimilar for different sizes, except for the 630 mm pipe where they are significantly higher. Further it was established that pressurizing of the pipe means a moderate influence on the flange stresses and bolt forces, 10 - 15 %, and that the bolt and backing ring are much stiffer than the plastic flange, meaning that it is mainly relaxation that is responsible forunloading of the joint over time. Computer simulations (FEM) were then made of both the tightening and the service phase for a set of geometries, and with a material model including time dependent properties of the plastic parts of the joint using material data from in-house experiments. Although the computer simulations are approximate too, they give a much better impression both of the principal function of the joint and of the magnitude of the stresses over time. It appears that the geometry of the flange joint means that the contact is lost over large parts of the flange surfaces already at pressurizing and that a triangulardistribution of pressure covering a part of the flange surface corresponding to the width of the backing ring is developed over time which should be sufficient to keep the joint tight. The effects of gaskets and profiled, softer, backing rings are clarified, and it is indicated that re-tightening is an efficient way to improve the function of the joint over time. Further, it seems that there is no significant difference in behaviour, as regards flange pressure, between SDR 11 and SDR 17 geometries. So, the FEM investigation has revealed that intuitive thoughts about reasons for inferior functioning of large size flange joints in plastic pipes are not well founded. The most efficient way to improve the joint is to increase the bolt force and to keep it up,by re-tightening or by flexible backing <b>rings.</b> <b>Gaskets,</b> soft ones, may be beneficial for reducing unevenness of the plastic joint surfaces...|$|R
