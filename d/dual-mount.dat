25|$|The {{first version}} of the Ju 88C was the C-1 with 20 {{aircraft}} converted from A-1 airframes. Some of them entered service in the Zerstörerstaffel of KG 30 which became part of II./NJG 1 in July 1940. The C-1 {{was followed by the}} C-2 of which 20 aircraft were converted from A-5 airframes with enlarged wingspan. The C-4 became the first production version with 60 produced and 60 converted from A-5 airframes. The C-6, of which 900 aircraft were produced, was based on the A-4 airframe with more powerful engines and stronger defensive armament (single- or <b>dual-mount</b> belt-fed 7.92mm MG 81 or 13mm MG 131 instead of drum-fed MG 15 machine guns).|$|E
2500|$|The nozzles were canted {{away from}} the {{centerline}} of the car slightly, so the final effect was that the six exhausts made a [...] "V" [...] pattern to keep the car pointed straight ahead. A bat mask was incorporated onto {{the nose of the}} car, although the sculpted lines made it somewhat difficult to make out at first. The fins were unmistakable and remain as the largest set ever built into a real-world Batmobile. On the Batman & Robin version the arsenal of weaponry and gadgets is controlled by an onboard voice-activated computer which surrounds the single-seat cockpit. From behind the wheel, the driver has access to a multifunctioning key command response system which delivers immediate weapon activation during attack and defensive procedures. The Batman & Robin version of the Batmobile was equipped with <b>dual-mount,</b> subcarriage rocket launchers, front and rear grappling hooks, multipoint infrared and laser scan tracking units, anterior/posterior wheel-based axle bombs, catapult ejection seat, and disguised central carriage, which detaches to become an emergency road vehicle. The single-seat cockpit featured a two-way videoconferencing screen, radar unit, and Redbird communication switch.|$|E
50|$|Superfiring was {{not limited}} to only two turrets, for example the Atlanta-class of light cruiser, which were {{developed}} and built for service in World War II. These ships utilized a triple-overlap system both forward and astern, their armament of <b>dual-mount</b> 5"/38 cal dual-purpose main armament having a nearly unobstructed arc of fire.|$|E
50|$|The Frommer M.17 pistol {{was also}} used in a <b>dual-mounted</b> tripod that fired both pistols in full automatic. The pistols were {{inserted}} upside-down and fed from 25 round box magazines.|$|R
50|$|The HAMMER {{unmanned}} {{defense system}} by More Industries proposed to use <b>dual-mounted</b> AA-12s on the H2X-40 turret.Neural Robotics {{also wanted to}} mount the weapon on their AutoCopter unmanned aerial vehicle.|$|R
50|$|This {{type of a}} {{suspension}} system involved springing the pair of <b>dual-mounted</b> road wheels on each bogie against {{each other with a}} volute-spring. It was essentially a version of the British Horstmann suspension that replaced the Horstmann's coil-spring with a pair of volute-springs.|$|R
50|$|After Heian Maru {{returned}} to Japan in August 1941, NYK {{was informed that}} due to rising tension between Japan and the United States, the liner would be converted to military use. On 3 October the ship was formally requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy, and designated as an auxiliary submarine tender with the Yokosuka Naval District. Two weeks later conversion was begun at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Kobe. Amongst numerous other alterations, four 15 cm/50 41st Year Type naval guns, two <b>dual-mount</b> 13 mm AA guns, two searchlights, and a rangefinder were installed.|$|E

5000|$|The QF 5.25 guns {{performed}} well on [...] during Operation Halberd, but latter Prince of Wales was overwhelmed and sunk while operating {{as part of}} Force Z, due to factors unrelated to the guns performance. No Dido-class cruisers were lost from air attack, although four were sunk by submarine or surface-launched torpedoes. [...] However , a Bellona-class cruiser, was sunk at anchor in 1944 by a Luftwaffe guided missile. [...] According to postwar publications the gunhouses were cramped, and the heavy projectile and cartridge cases resulted in a reduced sustained rate of fire to seven or eight rounds per minute from the designed twelve rounds per minute. [...] However, these factors {{do not appear to}} have reduced HMS Euryaluss rate of fire, over a one-minute period, which was typical for a World War II AA engagement. [...] The <b>dual-mount</b> turrets 10 deg/s traversal speed was considered too slow to engage higher-speed aircraft at close range. [...] However these elevation and traverse rates were still higher than some contemporary weapons, such as the 10.5 cm SK C/33 twin mounts carried on the Bismarck and Tirpitz.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] "XVI" [...] {{was one of}} {{the final}} proposals; after [...] "XVI-C" [...] was rejected, a {{modified}} version of this design was chosen for the North Carolinas. There were a few major differences between this and the final plan. For example, all exhaust was eventually trunked into two funnels as opposed to one, and the 5-inch/38 caliber secondary battery was composed of all <b>dual-mounted</b> guns (no single).|$|R
50|$|The plot {{consists}} of a chase of a hijacked MBT-99A tank, designed by the United States Air Force. The hijackers, who appear inside the tank after getting away from a recently committed bank robbery, were hired by a shadowy group backed by a foreign nation seeking an edge in their military. The tank carries six ATGM launchers, three to {{each side of the}} turret, and a laser-based machine-gun-esque installment, in addition to its rifled main gun. The tank's treads are <b>dual-mounted</b> (the tread is split in half, making four sets of treads for the tank).|$|R
50|$|The V.A.M.P. (Vehicle: Attack: Multi Purpose) {{was first}} {{released}} in 1982. Packaged with the action figure Clutch, the design {{was essentially a}} Jeep, with <b>dual-mounted</b> 7.62mm machine guns that swiveled and elevated. The V.A.M.P. Mark II was released in 1984 with a tan-painted Clutch, and instead of the original's green color and twin machine guns, it too was painted tan and equipped with a quad-mount missile launcher (carrying the fictional Stinger XK-1 missile). A Sears exclusive included the V.A.M.P. four-wheeled drive vehicle with the HAL artillery laser. The design of the V.A.M.P. {{was influenced by the}} Lamborghini Cheetah prototype.|$|R

5000|$|The ACV 1.1 is {{to carry}} 10-13 Marines, have a swim {{capability}} {{similar to the}} AAV, and have equal or greater mobility to the M1 Abrams tank. Although tracks are traditionally considered better for all-terrain mobility, the Marines believe wheeled vehicle technology has advanced enough to enhance survivability and mobility in a 35-ton-class platform; the Marine Personnel Carrier technology demonstrator used [...] "in-line" [...] drive technology that enabled all four wheels on each side to pull together much like the way a track does which, combined with a higher ground clearance and central tire inflation system, substantially closes the maneuverability gap and results in equal or better maneuverability than the M1A1 and better performance over the AAV. Improved technology used to inform requirements to build ACV 1.2 vehicles will later be applied to delivered 1.1 versions to upgrade them to 1.2 standard. Each ACV 1.1 vehicle will have a 3-man crew, and two vehicles will carry a reinforced rifle squad. Armament will consist of an M2 [...]50-caliber machine gun in a remote weapons station, {{with the potential to}} install a stabilized <b>dual-mount</b> M2/Mark 19 grenade launcher turret. Potential water speeds are for a [...] ship-to-shore capability at 8 knots.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the trials}} it was {{realised}} the existing chassis was insufficiently strong or rigid {{for such a}} heavy vehicle driven cross-country. In July 1928 Twenty two Mk1 production vehicles with an improved chassis and other detail changes were ordered, eighteen with one [...]5 and one [...]303 Vickers <b>dual-mounted</b> in the turret {{and one in the}} hull position {{to the left of the}} driver, and four 'A' command variants in which communications gear replaced the hull-mounted [...]303 Vickers and the gunner's position occupied by a wireless operator. In both versions the turret featured an independently rotating cupola.|$|R
500|$|By January 1941, {{the design}} limit for the 58,000-ton (59,000-metric-ton) {{battleship}} plan had been reached, and consensus among those designing the battleship class was {{to increase the}} displacement to support the armor and weaponry on the ships. At the same time, planners decided to adopt a slightly greater length and reduce power to [...] for a better machinery arrangement, as well as improving internal subdivisions, and selecting as the secondary armament several <b>dual-mounted</b> /54 cal guns instead of the /38 cal guns used on the Iowas. At this point, the net design for the Montana class somewhat resembled the Iowa class since they would be equipped with the same caliber main guns and similar caliber secondary guns; however, Montana and her sisters had more armor, mounted three more main guns in one more turret, and were [...] longer and [...] wider than the Iowa class.|$|R
500|$|Sixteen <b>dual-mounted</b> [...] L/65 C33 Flak guns {{provided}} long-range {{defense against}} aircraft. Unlike those {{mounted on the}} Scharnhorst and Bismarck classes, these guns were armored to protect their crews from shrapnel, debris, and strafing attacks. The new turrets also provided faster rates of training and elevation {{as compared to the}} earlier open mounts. Close-range air defense was provided by a battery of sixteen [...] L/83 C33 and twenty-four [...] C38 guns. The 3.7cm guns were placed in eight twin mounts while the 2cm guns were arrayed in six Flakvierling quadruple mountings. The 3.7cm guns were closely grouped amidships and had a single, common ammunition hoist. Historians William Dulin and Robert Garzke note that the anti-aircraft battery as designed was too weak to effectively defend against the high-performance aircraft that came into service in the late 1930s and 1940s, and speculate that [...] "it would have been augmented before the ships were completed." ...|$|R
