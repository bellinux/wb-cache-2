Secondly, the synthesis needs no sophisticated equipments {{since it is}} conducted at low temperature of 100 °C under normal atmosphere.

40|$|Poultry {{breeding}} schemes permanently {{face the}} need to control the evolution of coancestry and some critical traits, while selecting for a main breeding objective. The main aims of this article are first to present an efficient selection algorithm adapted to this situation and then to measure how the severity of constraints impacted {{on the degree of}} loss for the main trait, compared to BLUP selection on the main trait, without any constraint. Broiler dam and sire line schemes were mimicked by simulation over 10 generations and selection was carried out on the main trait under constraints for coancestry and for another trait, antagonistic with the main trait. The selection algorithm was a special simulated annealing (adaptative simulated annealing (ASA)). It was found to be rapid and able to meet constraints very accurately. A constraint on the second trait was found to induce an impact similar to or even greater than the impact of the constraint on coancestry. The family structure of selected poultry populations made <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the evolution of coancestry at a reasonable cost but was not as useful for reducing the cost of controlling evolution of the antagonistic traits. Multiple constraints impacted almost additively on the genetic gain for the main trait.

40|$|For carotid ultrasonography, {{there are}} two options for the {{relative}} position between the patient and examiner. One is the overhead position, in which the examiner sits beyond the patient’s head beside {{the end of the}} examination table and use two hands for ultrasonography. In this position, the examiner should use his right hand for the right carotid artery and use his left hand for the left carotid artery. The benefit of this position is that the examiner can use both hands {{and there are plenty of}} positions possible for the ultrasonography probe. The sonic window can be made wider and offers a clear view of the carotid artery especially from the posterolateral projection. The examiner should be familiar with using both hands, which requires some practice. Another position is the usual lateral sitting position, which is used for most other ultrasonography examinations. The examiner uses his right hand for both carotid arteries. This position makes <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the machines. However, the right posterior projection is a bit more difficult. Between these two choices, the overhead position for Doppler ultrasonography of the carotid artery is recommended. A pillow is not necessary. In fact, it produces a poorer window for the carotid artery. The optimal patient head position is tilted about 45 ° away from the artery being examined. The neck of the patients should be relaxed. Contractions of the sternocleidomastoid muscle cause poor sonic penetration and make positioning of the probes difficult.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of novel molecular targeting agents against multiple myeloma has dramatically and rapidly changed the therapeutic strategies for this incurable hematologic disease. Novel agents such as thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide have significantly improved the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival compared with conventional chemotherapies, and made <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the disease {{for longer periods}} of time. Initial therapies for newly diagnosed myeloma patients depend on the individual's clinical condition. Induction therapy with novel agents and high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is a standard therapy for newly diagnosed younger myeloma patients. On the other hand, several combinations of novel agents and other drugs (melphalan, prednisone, dexamethasone, etc.) are widely used as initial therapy for transplantation-ineligible myeloma patients. Although the clinical advantage of maintenance therapy after induction therapy has been reported, it is not recommend in routine practice. Maintenance therapy would be an option for some patients. Despite the significant improvements with the use of novel agents, the majority of patients eventually relapse. A number of treatment options including novel agents, which demonstrated marked clinical effects, are reported in the setting of salvage therapy. The choice of appropriate therapy for relapsed or refractory patients must take the disease status or patient status in consideration. Furthermore, a new generation of novel agents such as pomalidomide, carfilzomib or panobinostat has recently become available for relapsed or refractory myeloma. It is necessary to determine the optimal combination of drugs, administration timing and patients to be treated in future clinical trials...|$|E

Cell suspensions of ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ have been set up in Gamborgs B 5 liquid medium with minimal organics supplemented with 30 gL- 1 sucrose, 0. 25 gL- 1 casein hydrolysate, 0. 93 M kinetin and 0. 54 M naphthaleneacetic acid by callus cultures established from young berries on the same medium solidified with and 0. 8 % (w/v) of agar. The cultures were incubated in darkness on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm. The cell suspensions were sub-cultured every 2 weeks using an initial packed cell volume (PCV) of 15 %. In a set of preliminary experiments the effect of some elicitors (abscisic acid; epibrassinolide; ethephon; mannitol; jasmonic acid, methyl-jasmonate; polyethylene glycol; salicylic acid; sorbitol; sucrose) on induction of secondary metabolites in cell suspensions were tested. Among those methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) induced the production of at least 25 compounds with sesquiterpene-like mass spectra. Sesquiterpene production was assayed in the cell cultures at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours after the addition of 500 μM MeJA. To study the interaction between MeJA concentration and PCV at the moment of elicitor addition, the production of volatile compounds was assayed in cell suspensions induced with 500 μM of MeJA added at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days after cell suspension subcultures were set up with an initial PCV of 28 %. In a subsequent experiment, different concentrations of MeJA (0, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 μM) were tested for their effect on volatile production when added to a cell suspension with a PCV of 35 %. The production of sequiterpenes began 12 hours after the addition of MeJA, and reached a maximum 72 hours after MeJA addition. The production of sesquiterpenes quickly decreased with an increase of cell suspension PCV at the moment of MeJA addition, suggesting a strong interaction between PCV and MeJA concentration. The most effective concentration of MeJA in stimulating the production of sesquiterpenes, was found to be 500 μM if added when the cell suspensions had a PCV of 35 %, and 1000 if added when the cell suspensions had a PCV of 70 %. So the optimal concentration of MeJA for induction of sesquiterpenes appeared to be 1. 43 μmol per ml of PCV. These results suggest that in the interaction elicitor/density of cell in suspension the real important parameter is the concentration of elicitor per PCV unit and not the concentration of elicitor per total cell suspension volume. The viability of cells drastically decreased after the addition of MeJA and this decrease depended of concentration of MeJA added. MeJA also induced a significantly greater amount of proanthocyanidins and stilbenes in the cell cultures. The analysis of gene expressions by real-time RT-PCR and microarray analysis revealed that the mechanism by which jasmonates induced the production of secondary metabolites in cultured grape cells varied depending on the pathway [1]...|$|E
