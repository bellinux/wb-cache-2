5|$|Vanadium(V) forms various peroxo complexes, {{most notably}} in the active site of the vanadium-containing bromoperoxidase enzymes. The species VO(O)2(H2O)4+ is stable in acidic solutions. In {{alkaline}} solutions, species with 2, 3 and 4 peroxide groups are known; the last forms violet salts with the formula M3V(O2)4 nH2O (M = Li, Na, etc.), in which the vanadium has an 8-coordinate <b>dodecahedral</b> structure.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} forms {{white crystals}} where protactinium ions {{are arranged in}} pentagonal bipyramids and coordinated by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but the color is yellow. The coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and <b>dodecahedral</b> in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement.|$|E
5|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent {{bromides}} and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure {{like those of}} zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. The other tetrahalides instead have <b>dodecahedral</b> geometry. Lower iodides ThI3 (black) and ThI2 (gold) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, barium, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid, Th4+ forms the complex anion , which precipitates as an insoluble salt, K2ThF6.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the <b>dodecahedral</b> plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
25|$|If, instead, every sphere is {{augmented}} {{with the}} points in space that {{are closer to}} it than to any other sphere, the duals of these honeycombs are produced: the rhombic <b>dodecahedral</b> honeycomb for fcc, and the trapezo-rhombic <b>dodecahedral</b> honeycomb for hcp.|$|E
25|$|Spherical {{bubbles in}} soapy {{water in a}} fcc or hcp arrangement, when {{the water in the}} gaps between the bubbles drains out, also {{approach}} the rhombic <b>dodecahedral</b> honeycomb or trapezo-rhombic <b>dodecahedral</b> honeycomb. However, such fcc or hcp foams of very small liquid content are unstable, as they do not satisfy Plateau's laws. The Kelvin foam and the Weaire–Phelan foam are more stable, having smaller interfacial energy in the limit of a very small liquid content.|$|E
25|$|A vertex-first {{cross-section}} uses some hyperplane {{orthogonal to}} a line joining opposite vertices {{of one of the}} 24-cells. For instance, one could take any of the coordinate hyperplanes in the coordinate system given above (i.e. the planes determined by x'i = 0). The cross-section of {3,4,3,3} by one of these hyperplanes gives a rhombic <b>dodecahedral</b> honeycomb. Each of the rhombic dodecahedra corresponds to a maximal cross-section of one of the 24-cells intersecting the hyperplane (the center of each such (4-dimensional) 24-cell lies in the hyperplane). Accordingly, the rhombic <b>dodecahedral</b> honeycomb is the Voronoi tessellation of the D3 root lattice (a face-centered cubic lattice). Shifting this hyperplane halfway to one of the vertices (e.g. x'i = ½) gives rise to a regular cubic honeycomb. In this case the center of each 24-cell lies off the hyperplane. Shifting again, so the hyperplane intersects the vertex, gives another rhombic <b>dodecahedral</b> honeycomb but with new 24-cells (the former ones having shrunk to points). In general, for any integer n, the cross-section through x'i = n is a rhombic <b>dodecahedral</b> honeycomb, and the cross-section through x'i = n + ½ is a cubic honeycomb. As the hyperplane moves through 4-space, the cross-section morphs between the two periodically.|$|E

25|$|The vertex-first {{parallel}} {{projection of}} the 24-cell into 3-dimensional space has a rhombic <b>dodecahedral</b> envelope. Twelve of the 24 octahedral cells project in pairs onto six square dipyramids that meet {{at the center of}} the rhombic dodecahedron. The remaining 12 octahedral cells project onto the 12 rhombic faces of the rhombic dodecahedron.|$|E
25|$|In 1904-05 Henri Poincaré {{discovered}} a graphical tool for visualizing {{different types of}} polarized light (known as Poincaré sphere). The Poincaré homology sphere, also called Poincaré <b>dodecahedral</b> space, is a particular example of a homology sphere. Being a spherical 3-manifold, {{it is the only}} homology 3-sphere, besides the 3-sphere itself, with a finite fundamental group. While it is not known the extent to which such discoveries influenced Metzinger's representation of the radiating sun in Coucher de soleil no. 1, his interest and prowess in mathematics is well documented.|$|E
25|$|As {{cleavage}} is {{a function}} of crystallography, {{there are a variety of}} cleavage types. Cleavage occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions. Basal cleavage in one direction is a distinctive property of the micas. Two-directional cleavage is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes. Minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions, at 90°; when three directions of cleavage are present, but not at 90°, such as in calcite or rhodochrosite, it is termed rhombohedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in fluorite and diamond, and sphalerite has six-directional <b>dodecahedral</b> cleavage.|$|E

Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, tetraphenylborate, − vs. triphenylborane, B(C6H5)3.

2500|$|Garnets are nesosilicates {{having the}} general formula X3Y2(Si O4)3.

They crystallize in the cubic system, having three axes that are all of equal length and perpendicular to each other.

2500|$|Another fragile {{candidate}} mineral is sphalerite (zinc blende). Gem-quality {{material is}} usually a strong yellow to honey brown, orange, red, or green; its very high RI (2.37) and dispersion (0.156) make for an extremely lustrous and fiery gem, {{and it is also}} isotropic. But here again, its low hardness (2.5–4) and perfect <b>dodecahedral</b> cleavage preclude sphalerite's wide use in jewelry. Two calcium-rich members of the garnet group fare much better: these are grossularite (usually brownish orange, rarely colorless, yellow, green, or pink) and andradite. The latter is the rarest and most costly of the garnets, with three of its varieties—topazolite (yellow), melanite (black), and demantoid (green)—sometimes seen in jewelry. Demantoid (literally [...] "diamond-like") especially has been prized as a gemstone since its discovery in the Ural Mountains in 1868; it is a noted feature of antique Russian and Art Nouveau jewelry. Titanite or sphene is also seen in antique jewelry; it is typically some shade of chartreuse and has a luster, RI (1.885–2.050), and dispersion (0.051) high enough to be mistaken for diamond, yet it is anisotropic (a high birefringence of 0.105–0.135) and soft (hardness 5.5).|$|E
