25|$|The {{question}} of which language is preferred in Singapore {{seem to have}} caused a debate among the Chinese Singaporeans recently. The {{question of}} declining standards in the command of the Chinese language amongst Chinese Singaporeans seems to cause several revisions in the government's education policies towards the Chinese language. The government of Singapore's continued policy towards bilingualism for all Chinese Singaporeans, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> pursue English as the first language while making Mandarin the lingua franca (or at least the 2nd language or home language) amongst all Chinese has drawn mixed responses. The more English-speaking Chinese Singaporeans generally prefer English as the lingua franca or their home language, while the Mandarin-speakers worry that English will replace Mandarin as the lingua franca, which would eliminate the thin thread of Chinese identity altogether. With the rising economy of China in the 21st century, {{which has led to}} more Singaporean companies requiring fluency in Mandarin, Mandarin has been viewed with greater importance amongst the Singaporean Chinese than before. Both English and Mandarin will continue to dominate the language scene among Chinese Singaporeans.|$|E

This approach continued with the Rise of Isengard expansion which included Dunland, The Gap of Rohan, and Isengard. Update 6 added the area around the Anduin south of Lothlórien. The Riders of Rohan expansion added The Eastemnet: the Wold, the East Wall, Norcrofts, Sutcrofts, Entwash Vale, and the Eaves of Fangorn.
