40|$|Mango (Mangifera indica L.) {{production}} {{is on the}} rise in various subtropical zones throughout the world. The cultivation of this fruit tree is feasible along the coast of Granada, where some 1, 500 ha are presently grown. In 2006, the EU <b>exported</b> 118 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> of mangoes at a value of 131 million euros. This study was conducted to assess the physico-chemical quality characteristics of some mango fruit cultivars growing under a Mediterranean subtropical climate in Spain. A number of twenty-five fruits from eight Florida and one Australian cultivars were collected from different trees at the preclimacteric hard-green stage, and weighed. Osteen fruits bore the greatest weight (697 ± 95 g) with their pulp:seed ratio ratios (20 : 2) significantly higher than those in the other cultivars tested. The lowest pulp:seed ratios were recorded for the cultivars Kensington (6. 3) and Sensation (7. 6). The fruits with the highest percentages of flesh belonged to cvs. Gleen, Palmer, and Osteen, each averaging 85 %. The seed-weight of the fruits of cv. Osteen proved the lowest (4. 2 %) among all the cultivars, confirming the most desirable relationship with the pulp. The highest acidity (0. 22 %) went to Valencia Prid...|$|R

40|$|In 2005 the Hungarian Exise Tax Act was amended {{regarding}} {{the sale of}} biofuels. The amendment stipulated that from July 1, 2007 fuels with a 4. 4 volume percentage bioethanol content will be sold in Hungary. It equally stipulated that from January 1, 2008 fuels with a 4. 4 volume percentage biodiesel content will also be sold. Hungary’s stated 2010 biofuel objective is 5. 75 %, which is calculated in relation to energy content. Blending requirements for this transition are 144 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> of bioethanol (or 106 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> of ETBE, due to its higher energy content) and 183 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> of biodiesel. Hungary’s planned biofuel production capacities are approximately 3 million tonnes of bioethanol and 400 <b>thousand</b> <b>tonnes</b> of biodiesel, which seems farfetched both from a raw material and market point of view.
