40|$|Abstract. The web {{is trapped}} in the “perpetual now”, and when users {{traverse}} from page to page, they are seeing {{the state of the}} web resource (i. e., the page) as it exists {{at the time of the}} click and not necessarily at the time when the link was made. Thus, a temporal discrepancy can arise between the resource at the time the page author created a link to it and the time when a reader follows the link. This is especially impor-tant in the context of social media: the ease of sharing links in a tweet or Facebook post allows many people to author web content, but the space constraints combined with poor awareness by authors often pre-vents sufficient context from being generated to determine the intent of the post. If the links are clicked as soon as they are <b>shared,</b> the temporal <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>sharing</b> and clicking is so small that there is little to no difference in content. However, not all clicks occur immediately, and a delay of days or even hours can result in reading something other than what the author intended. We introduce the concept of a user’s tempo-ral intention upon publishing a link in social media. We investigate the features that could be extracted from the post, the linked resource, and the patterns of social dissemination to model this user intention. Finally, we analyze the historical integrity of the shared resources in social media across time. In other words, how much is the knowledge of the author’s intent beneficial in maintaining the consistency of the story being told through social posts and in enriching the archived content coverage and depth of vulnerable resources?...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in neural networks have revolutionized computer vision, but these algorithms are still outperformed by humans. Could this performance gap {{be due to}} systematic differences between object representations in humans and machines? To answer this question we collected a large dataset of 26, 675 perceived dissimilarity measurements from 2, 801 visual objects across 269 human subjects, and used this dataset to train and test leading computational models. The best model (a combination of all models) accounted for 68 % of the explainable variance. Importantly, all computational models showed systematic deviations from perception: (1) They underestimated perceptual <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> objects with symmetry or large area differences; (2) They overestimated perceptual <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> objects with <b>shared</b> features. Our results reveal critical elements missing in computer vision algorithms and point to explicit encoding of these properties in higher visual areas in the brain...|$|R

40|$|The {{scaling of}} {{semiconductor}} technologies {{is leading to}} processors with increasing numbers of cores. A key enabler in manycore systems {{is the use of}} Networks-on-Chip (NoC) as a global communication mechanism. The adoption of NoCs in manycore systems requires a shift in focus from computation to communication, as communication is fast becoming the dominant factor in processor performance. Many researchers have focused on direct communication between cores in the NoC, however in a manycore processor the communication is actually between the cores and the memory hierarchy. In this work, we investigate the memory communication traffic of shared threads in a hierarchical cache architecture. We argue that the performance scalability for shared-memory applications in a hierarchical cache architecture for systems with thousands of processor cores depends on the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> threads <b>sharing</b> memory in terms of the cache hierarchy (the "memory distance"). We present latency and throughput results comparing fat quadtree, concentrated mesh and mesh topologies {{as a function of the}} "memory distance" between the threads. Our results using the ITRS physical data for 2023 show that the model of thread placement and the distance of placing them significantly affects the NoC performance, and that scale-invariant topologies perform better than flat topologies...|$|R

If modeled at the national level or even the market or DMA level, these effects may be lost in aggregation bias. On the other hand going {{all the way down to}} dealer-level may overestimate marketing effectiveness as it would ignore consumer switching between dealers in the same area. The correct albeit rigorous approach would be to determine what dealers to combine into 'addable' common groups based on overlapping 'trade-areas' determined by consumer zip codes and cross-shopping information. At the very least 'Common Dealer Areas' can be determined by clustering dealers based on geographical <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> dealers and <b>share</b> of county sales. Marketing-mix models built by 'pooling' monthly sales for these dealer clusters will be effectively used to measure the impact of dealer advertising effectively.|$|R

Fiber tracking is a standard approach for the visualization of the re-sults of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). If fibers are reconstructed and visualized individually through the complete white matter, the display gets easily cluttered {{making it difficult to}} get insight in the data. Various clustering techniques have been proposed to automat-ically obtain bundles that should represent anatomical structures, but it is unclear which clustering methods and parameter settings give the best results. We propose a framework to validate clustering methods for white-matter fibers. Clusters are compared with a manual classi-fication which is used as a gold standard. For the quantitative eval-uation of the methods, we developed a new measure to assess the difference between the gold standard and the clusterings. The mea-sure was validated and calibrated by presenting different clusterings to physicians and asking them for their judgement. We found that the values of our new measure for different clusterings match well with the opinions of physicians. Using this framework, we have evaluated different clustering al-gorithms, including shared nearest neighbor clustering, which has not been used before for this purpose. We found that the use of hier-archical clustering using single-link and a fiber similarity measure based on the mean <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> fibers gave the best results...|$|R

Of the 20 dairy farms sampled, 16 were located in a primary area and 4 were located in two other distant geographical areas. A total of 92 E. coli O 157 :H 7 isolates obtained from bovine fecal samples, water trough sediment samples, free-stall bedding, and wild-bird excreta samples were characterized. Fifty genetic subtypes were observed among the isolates using XbaI and BlnI restriction endonucleases. Most restriction endonuclease digestion profiles (REDPs) were spatially and temporally clustered. However, four REDPs from multiple sources were found to be indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis between four pairs of farms. The geographical <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> farms which <b>shared</b> an indistinguishable E. coli O 157 :H 7 REDP ranged from 9 to 50 km, and the on-farm sources sharing indistinguishable REDPs included cattle and wild bird feces and free-stall bedding.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} organs of conifers, the pollen cones and seed cones, differ in morphology from the angiosperm flower in several fundamental respects. In this report we present {{evidence to suggest}} that the two plant groups, in spite of these morphological differences and the long evolutionary <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> them, <b>share</b> important features in regulating the development of the {{reproductive organs}}. We present the cloning of three genes, DAL 11, DAL 12, and DAL 13, from Norway spruce, all of which are related to the angiosperm B-class of homeotic genes. The B-class genes determine the identities of petals and stamens. They are members of a family of MADS-box genes, which also includes C-class genes that act to determine the identity of carpels and, in concert with B genes specify stamens in the angiosperm flower. Phylogenetic analyses and the presence of B-class specific C-terminal motifs in the DAL protein sequences imply homology to the B-class genes. Specific expression of all three genes in developing pollen cones suggests that the genes are involved in one aspect of B function, the regulation of development of the pollen-bearing organs. The different temporal and spatial expression patterns of the three DAL genes in the developing pollen cones indicate that the genes have attained at least in part distinct functions. The DAL 11, DAL 12, and 13 expression patterns in the pollen cone partly overlap with that of the previously identified DAL 2 gene, which is structurally and functionally related to the angiosperm C-class genes. This result supports the hypothesis that an interaction between B- and C-type genes is required for male organ development in conifers like in the angiosperms. Taken together, our data suggests that central components in the regulatory mechanisms for reproductive organ development are conserved between conifers and angiosperms and, thus, among all seed plants...|$|R

40|$|Animals exhibit diverse {{dispersal}} strategies, including sex-biased dispersal, {{a phenomenon}} common in vertebrates. Dispersal influences the genetic structure of populations {{as well as}} geographic variation in phenotypic traits. Patterns of spatial genetic structure and geographic variation may vary between the sexes whenever males and females exhibit different dispersal behaviors. Here, we examine dispersal, spatial genetic structure, and spatial acoustic structure in Rufous-and-white Wrens, a year-round resident tropical bird. Both sexes sing in this species, allowing us to compare acoustic variation {{between males and females}} and examine the relationship between dispersal and song sharing for both sexes. Using a long-term dataset collected over an 11 -year period, we used banding data and molecular genetic analyses to quantify natal and breeding dispersal distance in Rufous-and-white Wrens. We quantified song sharing and examined whether sharing varied with dispersal distance, for both males and females. Observational data and molecular genetic analyses indicate that dispersal is female-biased. Females dispersed farther from natal territories than males, and more often between breeding territories than males. Furthermore, females showed no significant spatial genetic structure, consistent with expectations, whereas males showed significant spatial genetic structure. Overall, natal dispersal appears to have more influence than breeding dispersal on spatial genetic structure and spatial acoustic structure, given that the majority of breeding dispersal events resulted in individuals moving only short <b>distances.</b> Song <b>sharing</b> <b>between</b> pairs of same-sex animals decreases with the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> their territories for both males and females, although males exhibited significantly greater song sharing than females. Lastly, we measured the relationship <b>between</b> natal dispersal <b>distance</b> and song sharing.
