40|$|The Isle of Corsica in European legal history: Splendid {{isolation}} from the ius commune? Matthias Castelein Abstract 31 st of January 2014 The image of Corsica is blurred {{with a lot of}} myths and commonplaces. The idea that the Corsican people is reclusive and brute dates already from the descriptions of Latin commentators like Pliny the Elder and lives on until today with the hallmark of inferiority in the French political and economic sphere. Actually, there is enough empirical evidence to prove some deficiency in the social organization of the Isle. For example, one fifth of the murders in France, take place in Corsica and only 5 % of the murderers are persecuted. Another example is the bombing of luxurious vacation houses in recent years, fearing that the implantation by foreigners would disturb local culture and land. Only at very rare places in Europe, these circumstances are a daily reality. However, is Corsica for that matter really separated from the European legal tradition? In our doctoral study, we present the history of Corsica as interwoven with the European dynasties expressed their political ties and their economic connections across the Mediterranean. For the early modern times, foreign interests shifted towards {{the western part of the}} Mediterranean Sea and later on towards the Atlantic Ocean. In that period the Republic of Genoa transferred the sovereign rights over Corsica to the Genoese Banco di San Giorgio, which held these from 1453 to 1562. As a private financial institution it tried to consolidate the state debt of <b>Genoa,</b> <b>inter</b> alia by lending money in exchange for public powers in dominions overseas. In that respect, the executive branch of the Banco, represented by the Protettori, had the competence to use military force, to collect fiscal revenues and to govern by jurisprudence. In a first phase, we will investigate why the attempt to build a central state on the Isle of Corsica failed completely. Therefore, we tackle in a broader way the issue of sovereignty in Corsica’s legal history. In a second stage, we try to explain subsequently how the case law of the Banco di San Giorgio was related to the Roman ius commune of the Italian city states and to which extent this common legal tradition was intertwined with Corsican local customary law. Namely, the application, whether or not, of these principles on which modern nation states were built, is a crucial indicator for the position of regions nowadays perceived as peripheral in the European integration process. status: publishe...|$|E

In the following years Pro Vercelli remained among the best Italian teams, but fell short of achieving the top prize.

In the match against Genoa on 17 October, he started off the counter-attack {{that led to}} Inter's second goal after dispossessing a <b>Genoa</b> player. <b>Inter</b> became the first team of the season to win by a five-goal margin. On 24 October, he reached Giacinto Facchetti's record of 476 Serie A appearances when he turned out for the match against Catania, which ended in a 2–1 win for the Nerazzurri. He also currently holds a club record of 149 consecutive appearances.|$|R

Motta's agent, Dario Canovi, later revealed that his Genoa contract with the club included a buy-out fee of €10 million.|$|R
25|$|After the Second World War {{the ability}} of Genoa to finish in the upper ranks of Serie A {{declined}} in a significant manner; {{throughout the rest of}} the 1940s the club were middle-table finishers. The 1948–49 saw three highly significant results, <b>Genoa</b> beat <b>Inter</b> 4–1, the famous Grande Torino side 3–0 and Padova 7–1. The 1950s started in poor fashion for the club, they had bought Argentine Mario Boyé from Boca Juniors but he stayed only one season and the club were relegated after finishing bottom of the table, but after two seasons they achieved their return after winning Serie B, ahead of Legnano. Ragnar Nikolay Larsen was a noted player for the club during this period and they sustained mid-table finishes for the rest of the decade.|$|R
50|$|With Meazza on the squad, Inter (re-christened Ambrosiana {{while under}} Fascist law) won 3 {{national}} championships in 1930, 1938 and 1940, and helped win the team's first Coppa Italia in 1939. The 1930 championship was Inter's first since 1920 {{and they were}} considered underdogs to teams like Bologna, Torino, Juventus and Genoa. It was Meazza's dazzling form that clinched the inaugural Serie A title. In the deciding game, he scored a second half hat-trick {{to tie the game}} against <b>Genoa</b> after <b>Inter</b> had been down 3-0. He was top-scorer of Serie A 3 times (1930, 1936, 1938), top-scorer in the pre-Serie A year of 1929 and top scorer of the Mitropa Cup three times: 1930 (7), 1933 (5) and 1936 (10); he finished with a runners-up medal in the competition in 1933.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the recent}} 2008-2009 {{championship}} Genoa {{started out with}} a defeat in the sicilian away match with Catania but was then graced with the comeback of argenitinian forward Diego Milito a talent which played with Genoa in second division and was then sold after the team had been relegated to third division despite finishing at the division's top due to an alleged combine.Milito was glad to come back to Genoa and play in Italy's Serie A and greatly contributed to a very successful season which saw the red and blue genoese griffins finishing fifth and securing a UEFA placement, while winning both derbies against the striped Sampdoria [...] "cousins" [...] and managing to defeat teams like Roma, Milan and Juventus. Genoa could have aimed even higher, but an unlucky streak of defeats with Lazio and Bologna right after having won against Juventus quashed their hopes for a Champions League spot. Having sold both Milito and midfield Thiago Motta to <b>Inter</b> <b>Genoa</b> has now 40 millions euro to invest in suitable replacements to maintain a high standing in the coming Serie A season and to compete successfully in the UEFA cup.|$|R
2500|$|Palermo {{experienced}} a dismal start, with two 0–3 losses {{in a row}} (at home to Napoli, then away at Lazio) followed by a 1–1 home draw against Cagliari. These results led chairman Maurizio Zamparini to state he was [...] "afraid of relegation", and persuaded him to remove Sannino from his coaching duties on 16 September 2012, and replace him with former <b>Genoa</b> and <b>Inter</b> boss Gian Piero Gasperini. Gasperini started his stint as Palermo coach with two consecutive defeats to Atalanta and Pescara; following that, chairman Zamparini shuffled the cards once again, announcing former Catania director of football Pietro Lo Monaco as new managing director and minority stakeholder, thus effectively replacing summer appointment Giorgio Perinetti and reducing his own role at Palermo; as a consequence, Perinetti tended his resignation days after these events. In the following game, Palermo trashed Chievo 4–1 at home thanks to a hat-trick from captain Fabrizio Miccoli (including a nationally praised volley goal from 45 metres), finally winning its first three points of the season. In the same game, Miccoli also marked the goal number 1,000 {{in the story of}} the club in the Italian top flight. Despite Gasperini's appointment, Palermo kept struggling in the league and found itself involved in the relegation battle. Palermo's second win under Gasperini came in a 2–0 home win against Sampdoria thanks to a brace from 18-year-old Paulo Dybala, who effectively replaced injured Miccoli by scoring his first goals in the Italian championship. The following home game saw Palermo trashing Catania 3–1 in the Sicilian derby, with a goal from Miccoli (the 100th of his Serie A career) followed by two from Iličić. However, this was followed by a string of four winless games in a row (one draw and three losses), the last of them being a 0–3 home loss at the hands of Fiorentina that left the Rosanero in 18th place {{by the end of the}} calendar year, thus in deep relegation zone.|$|R
