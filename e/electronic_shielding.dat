50|$|Relaxation {{of nuclear}} spins {{requires}} a microscopic mechanism for a nucleus to change orientation {{with respect to}} the applied magnetic field and/or interchange energy with the surroundings (called the lattice). The most common mechanism is the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between the magnetic moment of a nucleus and the magnetic moment of another nucleus or other entity (electron, atom, ion, molecule). This interaction depends on the distance between the pair of dipoles (spins) but also on their orientation relative to the external magnetic field. Several other relaxation mechanisms also exist. The chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) relaxation mechanism arises whenever the electronic environment around the nucleus is non spherical, the magnitude of the <b>electronic</b> <b>shielding</b> of the nucleus will then be dependent on the molecular orientation relative to the (fixed) external magnetic field. The spin rotation (SR) relaxation mechanism arises from an interaction between the nuclear spin and a coupling to the overall molecular rotational angular momentum. Nuclei with spin I ≥ 1 will have not only a nuclear dipole but a quadrupole. The nuclear quadrupole has an interaction with the electric field gradient at the nucleus which is again orientation dependent as with the other mechanisms described above, leading to the so-called quadrupolar relaxation mechanism.|$|E

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that simple <b>electronic</b> <b>shielding</b> effects induced by wave function antisymmetrization tend to govern the energy ordering of singlet and triplet terms within a two-electron atomic configuration.

40|$|Nearly {{two decades}} ago, {{a few years}} after the {{introduction}} of Fourier trans-form NMR, Jeener ' was the first to point out the possibility of generating two-dimensional (2 D) NMR spectra. Since then, aided by the availability of increasingly powerful computers, stronger magnets, and improved designs of NMR spectrometers, 2 D NMR has become ividely used in thousands of lab-oratories across the world. Applications vary from studying nuclear bond distances in solids: to determination of solution protein structures 3 and non-invasive imaging of cross sections of the human body. 4 Information is derived from experiments that usually consist of a sequence of radiofrequency pulses, spaced by time delays. A very large number of such experimental schemes, often referred to as pulse sequences, have found their way into the scientific literature. From a chemical viewpoint, the NMR spectrum contains a wealth of infor-mation about <b>electronic</b> <b>shielding</b> of individual nuclei. Moreover, dihedral angles can be derived from J couplings using the well known Karplus equations and the process known as cross relaxation provides access to measuring in-terproton distances., Although, in principle. a 11 this information can be ex-tracted using one-dimensional (1 D) NMR experiments, in practice the spectra of many substances of interest are so complex that a complete analysis is impossible.
