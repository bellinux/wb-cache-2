Although {{similar to the}} budget constraint in consumer theory, {{the use of the}} <b>isocost</b> line pertains to cost-minimization in production, as opposed to utility-maximization.

50|$|Isoquants are {{typically}} combined with <b>isocost</b> lines {{in order to}} solve a cost-minimization problem for given level of output. In the typical case shown in the top figure, with smoothly curved isoquants, a firm with fixed unit costs of the inputs will have <b>isocost</b> curves that are linear and downward sloped; any point of tangency between an isoquant and an <b>isocost</b> curve represents the cost-minimizing input combination for producing the output level associated with that isoquant. A line joining tangency points of isoquants and isocosts (with input prices held constant) is called the expansion path.|$|E

50|$|With two inputs, say {{labor and}} capital, the {{optimization}} {{problem is to}} minimize the total cost (amount spent on factors of production, say labor and physical capital) subject to achieving a given level of output, as illustrated in the graph. Each of the convex isoquants shows various combinations of labor and capital usage all of which would allow a given amount of output to be produced. Each straight line segment is an <b>isocost</b> curve showing various amounts of labor and capital whose combined usage would cost a given amount unique to that <b>isocost</b> curve. Conditional on producing the amount of output consistent with, say, the middle isoquant, the lowest cost {{can be obtained by}} using amounts of labor and capital such that the point on the given isoquant is on the lowest possible <b>isocost</b> curve--that is, at the point of tangency between the given isoquant and one of the cost curves. At the tangency the marginal rate of technical substitution between the factors (the absolute value of the slope of the isoquant at the optimal point) equals the relative factor costs (the absolute value of the slope of the <b>isocost</b> curve).|$|E

50|$|The <b>isocost</b> line is {{combined}} with the isoquant map to determine the optimal production point at any given level of output. Specifically, the point of tangency between any isoquant and an <b>isocost</b> line gives the lowest-cost combination of inputs that can produce the level of output associated with that isoquant. Equivalently, it gives the maximum level of output that can be produced for a given total cost of inputs. A line joining tangency points of isoquants and isocosts (with input prices held constant) is called the expansion path.|$|E

The convex curves are isoquants, each showing various combinations of input usages {{that would give the}} particular output level designated by the particular isoquant. Tangency points show the lowest cost input combination for producing any given level of output. A curve connecting the tangency points is called the expansion path because it shows how the input usages expand as the chosen level of output expands.|$|E
5000|$|If the y-isoquant {{is smooth}} and convex to the origin and the cost-minimizing bundle {{involves}} a positive amount of each input, then at a cost-minimizing input bundle an <b>isocost</b> line is tangent to the y-isoquant.Now since the absolute value of {{the slope of the}} <b>isocost</b> line is the input cost ratio , and the absolute value of the slope of an isoquant is the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS), we reach the following conclusion:If the isoquants are smooth and convex to the origin and the cost-minimizing input bundle involves a positive amount of each input, then this bundle satisfies the following two conditions: ...|$|E

This leads to unexpected couplings among seemingly unconnected modules, which result in poorly predictable circuit behavior. In this study, we determine these interdependencies between products of different genes by characterizing the economy of how transcriptional and translational resources are allocated {{to the production of}} proteins in genetic circuits. We discover that, when expressed from the same plasmid, the combinations of attainable protein concentrations are constrained by a linear relationship, which can be interpreted as an <b>isocost</b> line, a concept used in microeconomics. We created a library of circuits with two reporter genes, one constitutive and the other inducible in the same plasmid, without a regulatory path between them. In agreement with the model predictions, experiments reveal that the <b>isocost</b> line rotates when changing the ribosome binding site strength of the inducible gene and shifts when modifying the plasmid copy number.

The problem of the risk-averse firm under price and production uncertainty is analyzed using a state-contingent production technology and general risk-averse preferences. The concept of an efficient frontier, which identifies all potentially optimal production plans for weakly risk-averse decisionmakers, is introduced and used to develop comparative static results. For constant absolute risky technologies, the efficient frontier is shown to correspond to a unique <b>isocost</b> contour...|$|E
40|$|Selectivity {{estimates}} for optimizing OLAP queries often differ sig-nificantly from those actually encountered during query execution, leading to poor plan choices and inflated response times. We propose here a conceptually {{new approach to}} address this prob-lem, wherein the compile-time estimation process is completely es-chewed for error-prone selectivities. Instead, a small “bouquet ” of plans is identified from the set of optimal plans in the query’s selec-tivity error space, such {{that at least one}} among this subset is near-optimal at each location in the space. Then, at run time, the actual selectivities of the query are incrementally “discovered ” through a sequence of partial executions of bouquet plans, eventually iden-tifying the appropriate bouquet plan to execute. The duration and switching of the partial executions is controlled by a graded pro-gression of <b>isocost</b> surfaces projected onto the optimal performanc...|$|E
40|$|Studies on lithic {{resource}} management –mainly flint– by prehistoric groups {{south of the}} western Pyrenees have significantly increased during the past decades. These studies usually focus on identifying outcrops and characterising the different varieties found at archaeological sites. However, the understanding of mobility and territorial management patterns based on raw materials is still very limited and has only been tackled in terms of lineal distance. This paper proposes a methodological approach for the territorial analysis of flint distribution with the three following aims: 1) to determine the expansion ranges of each variety of flint from its outcrop; 2) to spatially relate these outcrops with archaeological sites; and 3) to improve our knowledge on the catchment strategies of Upper Palaeolithic groups. The methodological tool chosen to fulfil these objectives is the Geographic Information System (GIS), because it allows to relate spatially the flint outcrops and flint varieties identified at archaeological sites based on: 1) <b>isocost</b> maps showing the cost of expansion for each variety of flint across the territory built on topography; 2) the quantification {{of the cost of}} expansion using Cost Units (CU); and 3) the relationship between the percentage of each variety of flint at each archaeological site and the cost of accessing its outcrop. In order to demonstrate that cost is a powerful way to relate spatially raw material distribution and archaeological sites with outcrops, we contrasted its results with the ones obtained by more classic means (Euclidean distance and distance across the most optimal route). It was therefore shown that cost is better at explaining the spatial relationship between flint outcrops and archaeological sites, which, in turn, provides new data on catchment strategies, mobility patterns and territorial management of Upper Palaeolithic groups...|$|E
