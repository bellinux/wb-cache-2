5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different dual <b>graphs,</b> testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected <b>graphs,</b> it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the <b>graphs</b> to construct a canonical form for the equivalence relation of having a shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red <b>graphs</b> in the illustration are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar <b>graphs</b> that are not biconnected, this relation is not an equivalence relation {{and the problem of}} testing mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E

5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these <b>graphs</b> are exactly the {{polyhedral}} <b>graphs,</b> the <b>graphs</b> of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar <b>graphs</b> that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual <b>graphs</b> are isomorphic.|$|E

These properties are close to being enough to characterize these graphs: the Grötzsch <b>graph</b> is an induced subgraph of the Clebsch <b>graph,</b> and every triangle-free four-chromatic -free <b>graph</b> is likewise an induced subgraph of the Clebsch <b>graph</b> that in turn contains the Grötzsch <b>graph</b> as an induced subgraph [...] The Chvátal <b>graph</b> is another small triangle-free 4-chromatic <b>graph.</b> However, unlike the Grötzsch <b>graph</b> and the Clebsch <b>graph,</b> the Chvátal <b>graph</b> has a six-vertex induced path.|$|R
