5|$|Zoran Lazarević is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Graham McTavish. He is a homicidal Serbian terrorist. The {{majority of the world}} believes he is dead after a bombing, but he survives with half of his face scarred. Lazarevic pays Flynn to betray Drake, tricking him into giving Flynn information on the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet and causing Drake's arrest. In reality, Lazarevic wants to possess the mythic Cintamani Stone, which the fleet was supposedly transporting. He discovers that the fleet never had the stone, and dispatches a group of mercenaries to Nepal for clues to the location of the legendary city of Shambhala. He incites a civil war in the region to aid in his search and distract from any possible discovery. In Nepal, Lazarevic personally executes Fisher's cameraman Jeff, and follows Drake after he discovers the location of Shambhala's entrance. Lazarevic invades the small Tibetan village harboring Drake and Elena, seeking the key to reveal Shambhala. He kidnaps Schäfer and forces him to reveal the general area of the entrance. When Drake and Fisher follow, Lazarevic apprehends them and forces Drake to reveal the entrance to Shambhala. There, <b>he</b> <b>drinks</b> the sap of the Cintamani Stone, which is made of the sap of the Tree of Life. He battles Drake with his newfound powers, but is defeated by Drake and beaten by the guardians of Shambhala and assumingly killed when the temple falls apart. He appears later along with Harry Flynn and Eddy Raja in the online co-op story in Uncharted 3. Lazarevic uses a pump-action shotgun as his main weapon.|$|E

5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, <b>he</b> <b>drinks</b> it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E

25|$|The main {{gameplay}} {{takes place}} in the Nightmare stages. In a nightmarish dreamworld inhabited by other men, who are represented as anthropomorphic sheep, Vincent must climb up giant staircases that are slowly collapsing underneath him and safely reach the top. To accomplish this, Vincent must push, pull and climb blocks as quickly as possible while avoiding various traps such as spikes and ice. Climbing up steps in quick succession increases a score multiplier, {{and at the end of}} the level, players are given an award based on their score. Each stage is split up into numerous areas, culminating in a boss stage in which a nightmarish creature also attempts to kill Vincent. Vincent can move faster depending on how much alcohol <b>he</b> <b>drinks</b> during the day and can earn pillows that allow him to retry levels. There are also several items which can be found or purchased in between stages, such as spare blocks, lightning which removes enemies and energy drinks that allow Vincent to climb more steps at a time. Vincent will die if he falls off the bottom of the level, gets caught by a trap or is killed by a boss, with the game ending if Vincent runs out of retry pillows. In between action stages, Vincent can interact with the other sheep, save his game, learn techniques or spend coins on special items. When playing on easy and normal difficulty, players can push the Select/Back button to correct a single block move.|$|E
25|$|The vagrants Varlaam and Misail, who {{are dressed}} as monks and are begging for alms, and their {{companion}} Grigoriy, {{who is in}} secular garb, arrive and enter. After exchanging greetings, Varlaam requests some wine. When the Hostess returns with a bottle, <b>he</b> <b>drinks</b> and launches into a ferocious song ("So {{it was in the}} city of Kazan") of Ivan the Terrible's siege of Kazan. The two monks quickly become tipsy, and soon begin to doze. Grigoriy quietly asks the Hostess for directions to the Lithuanian border. The Hostess mentions that the police are watching the ordinary roads, but they are wasting their time, because there is an alternative, less well-known way to get to the border. Policemen appear in search of a fugitive heretic monk (Grigoriy) who has run off from the Chudov Monastery declaring that he will become Tsar in Moscow. Noticing Varlaam's suspicious appearance and behavior, the lead policeman thinks he has found his man. He cannot read the ukaz (edict) he is carrying, however, so Grigoriy volunteers to read it. He does so, but, eyeing Varlaam carefully, he substitutes Varlaam's description for his own. The policemen quickly seize Varlaam, who protests his innocence and asks to read the ukaz. Varlaam is only barely literate, but he manages to haltingly read the description of the suspect, which of course matches Grigoriy. Grigoriy brandishes a dagger, and leaps out of the window. The men set off in pursuit.|$|E

Boyd was a child when his father introduced him to Fleming's works. As a result, Boyd found himself also becoming fascinated with Ian Fleming. He told reporters that {{he was interested in}} Bond as a human being. [...] "Bond is not just a superhero. He has flaws, he has weaknesses, he makes mistakes.... That was Fleming's genius." [...] The novel is set in 1969 when Bond is 45; Boyd intentionally picked the year, further adding that [...] "there are no gimmicks, it's a real spy story." [...] Boyd criticised how the filmmakers have portrayed Bond onscreen as a [...] "cartoon character"; he also believes that Bond should be [...] "troubled and a massive boozer." [...] The novel reflects Boyd's view, where Bond [...] "drinks enough to float a boat. <b>He</b> <b>drinks</b> so much you wonder that he ever has the time or inclination to do anything else".|$|E

500|$|All of the {{characters}} drink heavily during the fiesta and generally throughout the novel. In his essay [...] "Alcoholism in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises," [...] Matts Djos says the main characters exhibit alcoholic tendencies such as depression, anxiety and sexual inadequacy. He writes that Jake's self-pity is symptomatic of an alcoholic, as is Brett's out-of-control behavior. William Balassi thinks that Jake gets drunk to avoid his feelings for Brett, notably in the Madrid scenes at the end where he has three martinis before lunch and drinks three bottles of wine with lunch. Reynolds, however, believes the drinking is relevant as set against the historical context of Prohibition in the United States. [...] The atmosphere of the fiesta lends itself to drunkenness, but the degree of revelry among the Americans also reflects a reaction against Prohibition. [...] Bill, visiting from the US, drinks in Paris and in Spain. Jake is rarely drunk in Paris where he works but on vacation in Pamplona, <b>he</b> <b>drinks</b> constantly. Reynolds says that Prohibition split attitudes about morality, and in the novel Hemingway made clear his dislike of Prohibition.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, Beiderbecke {{enrolled at}} the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. His stint in academia was even briefer than his time in Detroit, however. When he attempted to pack his course schedule with music, his guidance counselor forced him instead to take religion, ethics, physical education, and military training. It was an institutional blunder that Benny Green described as being, in retrospect, [...] "comical," [...] "fatuous," [...] and [...] "a parody." [...] Beiderbecke promptly began to skip classes, and after he participated in a drunken bar fight, he was expelled. That summer he played with his friends Don Murray and Howdy Quicksell at a lake resort in Michigan. The band was run by Goldkette, and it put Beiderbecke in touch with another musician he had met before: the C-melody saxophone player Frankie Trumbauer. The two hit it off, both personally and musically, despite Trumbauer having been warned by other musicians: [...] "Look out, he's trouble. <b>He</b> <b>drinks</b> and you'll {{have a hard time}} handling him." [...] They were inseparable for {{much of the rest of}} Beiderbecke's career, with Trumbauer acting as a father figure to Beiderbecke. When Trumbauer organized a band for an extended run at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis, Beiderbecke joined him. There he also played alongside the clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, who praised Beiderbecke's ability to drive the band. [...] "He more or less made you play whether you wanted to or not," [...] Russell said. [...] "If you had any talent at all he made you play better." ...|$|E
