5|$|In 1766, John Gwynn {{complained in}} his work London and Westminster Improved {{that there was a}} lack of {{planning}} throughout the West End and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now Regent's Park) with the Prince Regent's Carlton House. John Fordyce was appointed as Surveyor-General to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1793 and concluded that there should be a suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park ran out and ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link Pall Mall and the Haymarket, of which has since declined in quality. A further problem was increased congestion around Charing Cross, which would benefit from road improvements.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{congestion}} in {{the areas}} around Quebec Street an extension of Highway 35 into a major highway in the eastern metropolitan Denver area has been proposed. In theory, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> alleviate traffic jams in the Quebec St. area.|$|E

Sutton based SignWriting on DanceWriting, and finally expanded the system to the complete repertoire of MovementWriting. However, only SignWriting and DanceWriting have been widely used.|$|E

25|$|Not unexpectedly, {{the idea}} came up in bureaucratic circles that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, {{including}} university professors. Not always does history repeat itself, however, because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath. Cauchy remained {{a professor at the}} University until his death at the age of 67. He received the Last Rites and died of a bronchial condition at 4a.m. on May 23, 1857.|$|E
500|$|It {{was more}} {{difficult}} for animators during the production of A Bug's Life than that of Toy Story, as computers ran sluggishly due {{to the complexity of}} the character models. Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation: Rich Quade and Glenn McQueen. The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's [...] "Flaming Wall of Death". Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was [...] "less likely to change". Lasseter thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective. Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on Lego wheels, which they dubbed as the [...] "Bugcam". Fastened {{to the end of a}} stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a stained-glass ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from Microcosmos (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world.|$|E
500|$|Locke {{does not}} {{dedicate}} much space in Some Thoughts Concerning Education to outlining a specific curriculum; {{he is more}} concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills. Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children how to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor [...] "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [...] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself." [...] But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning Latin and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language, particularly recommending Aesop's Fables. [...] Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility. So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also {{at the forefront of the}} scientific revolution and advocated the teaching of geography, astronomy, and anatomy. Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from scholastic humanism and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade. Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new bourgeois ethos that would come to define Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E

2500|$|The DDP {{was founded}} and named by StankDawg. His stated reasons were {{that he had}} made many friends in the hacking scene and thought that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> have {{everyone}} begin working together in a more organized fashion. [...] He was motivated by the fact that there had been other well-known Hacker Groups in the 1980s who had accomplished great things in the hacking world such as the LoD and the MoD. In 1988, while a junior in high school, StankDawg came up with the name {{on his way to the}} [...] "Sweet 16" [...] computer programming competition.

2500|$|Historically, Conway {{developed}} {{the theory of}} surreal numbers in the reverse order of how it has been presented here. [...] He was analyzing Go endgames, and realized that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> have some way to combine the analyses of non-interacting subgames into an analysis of their disjunctive sum. [...] From this he invented {{the concept of a}} Game and the addition operator for it. [...] From there he moved on to developing a definition of negation and comparison. [...] Then he noticed that a certain class of Games had interesting properties; this class became the surreal numbers. [...] Finally, he {{developed the}} multiplication operator, and proved that the surreals are actually a field, and that it includes both the reals and ordinals.|$|E
2500|$|Writing {{in early}} 1945 a long essay titled [...] "Antisemitism in Britain," [...] for the Contemporary Jewish Record, Orwell stated that anti-Semitism {{was on the}} {{increase}} in Britain, {{and that it was}} [...] "irrational and will not yield to arguments." [...] He argued that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> discover why anti-Semites could [...] "swallow such absurdities on one particular subject while remaining sane on others." [...] He wrote: [...] "For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald.... Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war. Their own anti-Semitism has caused this vast crime to bounce off their consciousness." [...] In Nineteen Eighty-Four, written shortly after the war, Orwell portrayed the Party as enlisting anti-Semitic passions against their enemy, Goldstein.|$|E

2500|$|They left, {{together}} with Fabian Wegmann, the German from [...] All this happened {{before the first}} climb of the day, the Col du Tourmalet. On the Tourmalet, Wegmann and de la Fuente looked to be somewhat stronger than their two companions as they both sprinted to finish first on the top. De la Fuente won the sprint and so took the most points for the polka dot jersey, but also he won the Souvenir Jacques Goddet for coming through first {{on the top of}} the highest climb in the Pyrenees of this Tour which rendered him 5000 Euros. In the peloton, the team of [...] maintained the tempo to keep the leaders within reasonable distance and thus protect their yellow jersey. Thomas Voeckler won the sprint against Michael Rasmussen for the remaining points on top of the Tourmalet and he kept going. Although the leaders were about 4 minutes ahead at that time, he thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> go after them on his own. At first, his plan appeared to be correct, as he closed the gap during the descent and managed to climb faster than the leaders on the Col d'Aspin. Halfway up the Aspin he was only 2'30" [...] behind, on top of the Aspin only 1'30". The four leaders stayed together on the Aspin, with now Wegmann sprinting faster than de la Fuente at the top. In the peloton, Rasmussen again took the points, but nothing more happened.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{of these}} factors counsel in favor of finding the {{challenge}} to the waste disposal regulations in 25524.2 ripe for adjudication. The question of pre-emption is predominantly legal, and although <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> {{have the benefit of}} California's interpretation of what constitutes a demonstrated technology or means for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste, resolution of the pre-emption issue need not await that development. Moreover, postponement of decision would likely work substantial hardship on the utilities. As the Court of Appeals cogently reasoned, for the utilities to proceed in hopes that, when the time for certification came, either the required findings would be made or the law would be struck down, requires the expenditures of millions of dollars over a number of years, without any certainty of recovery if certification were denied. 13 [...] The construction of new nuclear facilities requires considerable advance planning - on the order of 12 to 14 years. 14 [...] Thus, as in the Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 [...] U.S. 102, 144 (1974), [...] "decisions to be made now or in the short future may be affected" [...] by whether we act. [...] "`One does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief. If the injury is certainly impending that is enough.'" [...] Id., at 143, quoting Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 [...] U.S. 553, 593 [...] (1923). To require the industry to proceed without knowing whether the moratorium is valid would impose a palpable [...] and considerable hardship on the utilities, and may ultimately work harm on the citizens of California. Moreover, if petitioners are correct that 25524.2 is void because it hinders the commercial development of atomic energy, [...] "delayed resolution would frustrate one of the key purposes of the [...] Act." [...] Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 [...] U.S. 59, 82 (1978). For these reasons, the issue of whether 25524.2 is pre-empted by federal law should be decided now. 15 ...|$|E
