5|$|A 2008 {{molecular}} phylogenetic study clarified {{the relationships}} among the mushroom-forming species of the family. The authors <b>demonstrated</b> <b>the</b> existence of four distinct lineages of gilled mushrooms, {{which led to the}} description of Multifurca as a new genus separated from Russula and the segregation of Lactifluus from Lactarius.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert system}} is a program that answers {{questions}} or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They <b>demonstrated</b> <b>the</b> feasibility of the approach.|$|E
5|$|As Apollo 14 was {{an early}} Apollo mission, landing sites were {{restricted}} to equatorial regions for technical reasons. After Apollo 12 <b>demonstrated</b> <b>the</b> ability to land at a pre-specified landing zone, mission planners considered landings in rough, but geologically interesting areas of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} {{the ebb and flow of}} society, and he <b>demonstrated</b> <b>the</b> far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Countershading, like counter-illumination, {{has rarely}} been applied in {{practice}} for military camouflage, though not because military authorities were unaware of it. Both Abbott Thayer in the First World War and Hugh Cott in the Second World War proposed countershading to their countries' armed forces. They each <b>demonstrated</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of countershading, without succeeding in persuading their armed forces to adopt the technique, though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Ralph Budd met Edward G. Budd (no relation), an {{automotive}} steel pioneer who was {{founder and}} president of the Budd Company. Edward Budd was demonstrating his new Budd-Michelin rail motorcar built of stainless steel.

50|$|Musgrave House is {{important}} in <b>demonstrating</b> <b>the</b> development of health services, specifically children's health services, in Queensland. <b>The</b> building <b>demonstrates</b> <b>the</b> growth of the Sandgate-Shorncliffe area as a popular nineteenth century watering place and the custom {{of going to the}} seaside for recuperation following illness. As a convalescent home for the children's hospital, Musgrave House is significant in <b>demonstrating</b> <b>the</b> establishment and development of health services by volunteer effort in early Queensland.

5|$|In 1993, Dave Raggett, then at Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Bristol, England {{devoted his}} spare time to {{developing}} Arena on which he hoped to demonstrate new and future HTML specifications. Development of the browser was slow because Raggett was the lone developer and HP, which like many other computer corporations at the time, was unconvinced that the Internet would succeed and thus did not consider investing in web browser development. Raggett <b>demonstrated</b> <b>the</b> browser at the first World Wide Web Conference in Geneva, Switzerland in 1994 and the 1994 ISOC conference in Prague to show text flow around images, forms, {{and other aspects of}} HTML later termed as the HTML+ specification. Raggett subsequently partnered with CERN, to develop Arena further as a proof of concept browser for this work. Using the Arena browser, Dave Raggett, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, Håkon Wium Lie and others demonstrated text flow around a figure with captions, resizable tables, image backgrounds, HTML math, and other features. At the Web World conference in Orlando, in early 1995, Raggett <b>demonstrated</b> <b>the</b> different new features of Arena.|$|E
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, Podisus maculiventris {{was used as}} a predatory threat to female L. decemlineata specimens, resulting in the production of unviable trophic eggs alongside viable ones; this response to a predator ensured that additional food was available for newly hatched offspring in order to increase their survival rate. The same experiment also <b>demonstrated</b> <b>the</b> cannibalism of unhatched eggs by newly hatched L. decemlineata larvae as an anti-predator response.|$|E

5|$|In addition, isotopic {{analysis}} of exposed terrestrial rocks has <b>demonstrated</b> <b>the</b> cosmogenic (cosmic ray) production of 21Ne. This isotope {{is generated by}} spallation reactions on magnesium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and meteorites.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom at present, the {{mainstream}} approach towards representative standing is broad and liberal.

5|$|Initially, Chicago still {{preferred}} palazzo-styled {{buildings with}} large light {{courts in the}} centre, because they remained the most profitable designs.

Under the revised law, the Straus Building and the Pittsfield Building took the palazzo design and added somewhat stunted towers on top in the early 1920s, producing profitable buildings.|$|E
