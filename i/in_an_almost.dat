5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his style. Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates {{from that of the}} traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} East Anglian kings were pagans. They {{belonged to}} the Wuffingas dynasty, named after Wuffa, whose ancestors originated from northern Europe and whose descendants ruled the East Angles <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> unbroken line until after the reign of Ælfwald {{in the middle of}} the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|The attack tapered {{off with}} the coming of daylight, but that night it resumed. The North Koreans struck {{repeatedly}} at the defense line. This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September. The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops. Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> steady stream during the morning. All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points. At one time, the regimental reserve was down to six men. When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12:00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus {{seems to be on}} his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} is resolved {{in a manner}} simultaneously elegant and eccentric, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> exuberant and free syntax. The canonical orders are absent, and the collection is conceived as an imaginative blend of quasi-archaeological redeployment. For this reason, critics do not attribute the project to Cairano, which remains a formidable invention that is highly representative of antiquarian culture of the time. Surely Cairano's, however, is the hand that produced the sculptures along with anthropomorphic figures, dolphins and fantastic creatures, the artist already experimented with these in the Loggia; and once again, the artist inserted small Caesars, both on the portal {{as well as the}} overpass, which achieve the poetic zenith of some of his portraiture of old.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien's prose is unpretentious and straightforward, taking as {{given the}} {{existence}} of his imaginary world and describing its details in a matter-of-fact way, while often introducing the new and fantastic <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> casual manner. This down-to-earth style, also found in later fantasy such as Richard Adams' Watership Down and Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn, accepts readers into the fictional world, rather than cajoling or attempting to convince them of its reality. While The Hobbit is written in a simple, friendly language, each of its characters has a unique voice. The narrator, who occasionally interrupts the narrative flow with asides (a device common to both children's and Anglo-Saxon literature), has his own linguistic style separate {{from those of the}} main characters.|$|E

5|$|Two {{neptunium}} chlorides, NpCl3 and NpCl4, {{have been}} characterized. Although several attempts to create NpCl5 have been made, {{they have not}} been successful. NpCl3 is created by reducing neptunium dioxide with hydrogen and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and NpCl4 by reacting a neptunium oxide with CCl4 at around 500°C. Other neptunium chloride compounds have also been reported, including NpOCl2, Cs2NpCl6, Cs3NpO2Cl4, and Cs2NaNpCl6. Neptunium bromides NpBr3 and NpBr4 have also been created; the latter by reacting aluminium bromide with NpO2 at 350°C and the former <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> identical procedure but with zinc present. The neptunium iodide NpI3 has also been prepared by the same method as NpBr3.|$|E
5|$|Use of {{insanity}} {{as a concept}} dates from 1324, and its criminal application was used until the late 16th century <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior to the trial could not be tried for any crime, {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish between good and evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E
5|$|In December 2000, the IMF stopped aid {{disbursements}} due {{to corruption}} concerns, and many individual donors followed suit, resulting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> 80% drop in Malawi's development budget. However, in 2005, Malawi was {{the recipient of}} over US$575million in aid. The Malawian government faces challenges in developing a market economy, improving environmental protection, dealing with the rapidly growing HIV/AIDS problem, improving the education system, and satisfying its foreign donors that it is working to become financially independent. Improved financial discipline had been seen since 2005 {{under the leadership of}} President Mutharika and Financial Minister Gondwe. This discipline has since evaporated as shown by the purchase in 2009 of a private presidential jet followed almost immediately by a nationwide fuel shortage which was officially blamed on logistical problems, but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the jet purchase. The overall cost to the economy (and healthcare system) is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Once {{rebuilding}} began, {{the poor}} rebuilt their basic {{housing in the}} same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> manic orgy of building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For one thing, the Spanish viceroy spent {{six months of the}} year in Palermo and six in Catania, holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, from the middle of the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after winning}} their 14th League title, Louis Kilcoyne {{announced}} that the Kilcoynes were selling Glenmalure Park, which they had recently purchased from the Jesuits. The team played the entire 1987–88 season <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> empty Tolka Park {{as a result of}} a boycott called for by the Shamrock Rovers Supporters Club and KRAM (Keep Rovers At Milltown), which was observed by the vast majority of Hoops fans. Following the completion of the boycott season in Tolka, the Kilcoynes sold the football club to Dublin businessman John McNamara, who put forward a controversial proposal to move in with Bohemians at Dalymount Park. KRAM congregated to vote on whether to lift the boycott and on the proposal to move to Dalymount. Both motions were passed and the club spent the next two seasons at the Phibsboro venue, with an unrecognisable side playing in front of small attendances.|$|E
5|$|The Smuts {{family lived}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> {{exclusively}} Afrikaner world. Nevertheless, this cultural identity, {{unlike that of}} the Boer republics to the north, did not define itself on opposition to Britain or the British. Swartland farmers had been largely insulated from the causes of discontent of earlier years, discontent which eventually culminated in the mass Boer migrations of the Great Trek. As a result, Jacobus Smuts largely unmoved by the Afrikaner nationalism preached by such organisations as the Afrikaner Bond, founded by Rev. SJ du Toit in 1877. After 1884, having come {{under the leadership of}} Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, the Bond became more to the Smuts' taste. Hofmeyr changed the fundamental basis of the organisation, from one preaching Afrikaner separatism to one which combined a pragmatic policy of economic protectionism for Cape farmers and their produce with a call for unity between the English and Dutch-speaking populations and cooperation with the Colonial authorities. As a member of the Cape legislature Jacobus Smuts pledged his support to Hofmeyr and the reformed Bond.|$|E

5|$|In 2012–13, Benfica's {{run in the}} Champions League run was not so successful, {{and they}} dropped again to the Europa League. In this tournament, however, the team excelled and reached their ninth European final, 23 years after their last appearance. On 17 May 2013, Benfica played the final against the Champions League holders Chelsea, losing 2–1 with an injury-time header from Branislav Ivanović and {{extending}} the club's run of European final losses to seven. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> identical 2013–14 season, Benfica competed in the Europa League after failing to overcome the Champions League group stage, and advanced {{all the way into}} a second successive final. In the progress, they eliminated Juventus in the semi-finals, after a tense match in Turin, where the final was to be played. On 15 May 2014, Benfica faced the 2006 and 2007 winners Sevilla, missing usual starters Enzo Pérez, Lazar Marković and Eduardo Salvio, who were suspended due to yellow card accumulation. The match ended goalless after 120 minutes of play and was decided through a penalty shootout, which Benfica lost 4–2 after Rodrigo and Óscar Cardozo had their penalty kicks stopped by Beto. For the eight time – and second in two years – Benfica were unable to lift a European trophy. In the following season, they returned to UEFA's prime tournament, but did not progress further than the group stage for the fourth time since 2010. In 2015–16, Benfica reached their fourth knock-out stage of the Champions League. They eliminated Zenit Saint Petersburg in the last 16, and qualified for the quarter-finals for their 18th time, where they lost 3–2 on aggregate to Bayern Munich.|$|E
