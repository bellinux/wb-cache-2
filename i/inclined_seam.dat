40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of research into the potential of underground mining methods applicable to <b>inclined</b> thick <b>seams</b> (thickness greater than 3. 5 m, and seam dip of 15 - 35 degree) in the Quangninh coalfield, Vietnam. The primary objectives of this research are to investigate the most suitable underground methods applicable to <b>inclined</b> thick <b>seams</b> in the Quangninh coalfield and to improve understanding of the operational and geotechnical issues associated with the application of chosen methods in thick seams with steeply dipping conditions. From a risk and operational assessment, the Longwall Top Coal Caving (LTCC) method is considered most appropriate for <b>inclined</b> thick <b>seams</b> under the current mining conditions in Vietnam. The LTCC method offers great potential for the efficient extraction of thick seams by caving coal from the upper section during the mining of the lower section. This significantly reduces the development cost per tonne. Compared to High reach Single Pass Longwalling, the LTCC method offers a low extraction height, resulting in smaller and less expensive equipment and better face conditions. Results from this study identified that for extracting an <b>inclined</b> thick <b>seam,</b> the face retreating along the strike has better operational advantages and better cavability than the face retreating updip or downdip of the seam. The operational issues of the LTCC method when extracting <b>inclined</b> <b>seams</b> are: the stability of the support, transport in the mine, and the difficulties in roof control at the transition between face ends and the gateroads. In terms of geotechnical issues, better cavability of the top coal is anticipated for flat coal <b>seams</b> compared to <b>inclined</b> <b>seams.</b> In addition, the chain pillar for flat coal seams is subjected to a higher vertical stress distribution than that of inclined ones. An improved cavability assessment method for the categorisation of the cavability of the top coal with four categories, ranging from 1 (excellent cavability) to 4 (very poor cavability), was suggested to assist the feasibility and design stages of the LTCC application. The cavability assessment method was conducted by numerical analysis combined with back analysis from the database obtained from past LTCC practices...|$|R

In 1984, the first industrial trial of the technology at a gentle <b>inclined</b> <b>seam</b> was conducted at Northern Area 3 in Puhe mine, Shenyang Province, China (Yan and Fu 2003). Due to the problems with support design and equipment, and lack of experience in production management, the trial was not successful. However, the subsequent trials at steep inclined coal seams in the No. 2 mine of Yaojie, Meihekou mine of Liaoyuan, and Liudaowan mine in Urumqi, China, were all successful. Up until 1990, although the trials on the technology at gentle inclined coal seams continued in Northeastern China and Pingdingshan, there were no breakthroughs. In {{the second half of}} 1990, the LTCC face 8603 at the No. 1 coal mine in Yangquan produced 140, 000 t/m, doubling the production from a sub-level coal face and exceeded 80  % of coal recovery from the face. The dip of the LTCC face was 3 °– 7 °, the thickness was 6  m and the face width was 120  m. The trial at Yangquan found a way to achieve high production, high efficiency at a LTCC face, demonstrated the potential with LTCC technology, and laid a solid foundation for the development of LTCC technology.

The group has successfully developed a JBB-I steeply <b>inclined,</b> thin <b>seam,</b> conveying FMM unit that enables the automatic mining of 0.7 – 1.5  m steeply <b>inclined</b> thin <b>seams</b> with maximum dip angles of 70 °. This unit consists of a plough chain that drives a number of small heads to run in a cycle along the beam to cut coal simultaneously from various points with scattered acting force and balanced mechanical operation. The entire unit is electro-hydraulically controlled, allowing for unmanned production within the work face. In the second half of 2013, the first unit underwent industrial testing in the Taiping coal mine of the Panzhihua coal mining district, Sichuan Province.

To resolve the global technical problems in stability control of the FMM equipment used in seams with large dip angle, China Coal Technology & Engineering Group Corp. invented hydraulic supports suitable to seams with large dip angle on the basis of many years of research and development, creatively established supporting systems for the FMM/full mechanized top coal caving faces with large dip angles, and solved the key technical problems associated with anti-toppling equipment and stability control of hydraulic supports used in seams with large dip angles of 35 °– 55 °. Moreover, the company developed a coupling mechanical model for hydraulic supports used in seams with large dip angles and surrounding rock, provided stability control strategy for hydraulic supports used in seams with large dip angles, and creatively developed a “self-support, adjacent support pulling, bottom pushing, top extrusion” antitoppling and antislip mechanism coupling hardness with softness and a three-dimensional (3 D) protective device for hydraulic supports. These hydraulic supports were applied in the seam with a large dip angle of 55 ° in the Fucheng coal mine of Inner Mongolia, a daily output of 10 kt were achieved at a face shear height of 4.8  m under safe {{and efficient}} production conditions, establishing world records in terms of shear height, dip angle, and production efficiency of the FMM/fully mechanized top coal caving faces.|$|R
40|$|In mining of <b>inclined</b> coal <b>seams</b> in Tangshan {{coal mine}} of Kailuan group, {{gateways}} on {{either end of}} a panel were both typically located along the floor and a gateway pillar between adjoining panels was left unmined between adjacent panels to ensure stability, thus forming a planar mining system. According to the practice, however, {{it turned out that}} this conventional mining system has long-standing problems, such as face end support problems, coal bumps, sliding of mining equipment downhill, spontaneous combustions, support problems in development entries, etc. In view of this situation and based on the No. Y 294 panel, this paper analyzes an innovative mining technology in which the gateways on either end of a panel are located at different heights within the coal seam. For the adjacent panel, the gate development may be superposed on the development entry of the previous panel or may be offset with respect to it. Field data shows that the split-level layout of the longwall panel plays an effective role in control of overall stability of mining equipment in <b>inclined</b> coal <b>seams.</b> Physical modeling demonstrates that the new technology has many advantages in ground control. Under the condition without a pillar, development entry adjacent to the new panel is located in the de-stressed zone and stress concentration is significantly reduced with associated reduction in coal bumps, bursts and support problems which means less support and maintenance requirement and cost. Compared with the conventional rectangular pillar, the gateway pillar width in this new technology is effectively reduced when pillars have to be left unmined.

The most vital characteristic in junggar basin is coal dip angel and gas content varies a lot in different areas. This paper reveals the relationship between gas content and coal seam dip angel, bigger the coal seam dip angel lower the gas content. The target area of CBM exploration and mining in junggar basin is HEGSH-STH area, HEGSHX area, BSMY-JJM area,LJM area, KLMY area, HSTLG area and XZJQ area. Gas content is mainly influenced by tectonic movement in junggar basin, it is low in complex structure area and high in simple structure area.

40|$|The {{ground and}} surface {{subsidence}} process induced by longwall coal mining operations can cause adverse influences to subsurface and surface structures and water resources. Successful mitigation of these influences depends heavily on accurate {{assessment of the}} types, severities and locations of the subsidence-induced deformations and good knowledge of the structures. The most important step for mitigating subsidence influences is to accurately predict the dynamic and final movements and deformations {{in the area of}} interest. Based on the principle of influence function method, a series of subsidence prediction models have been developed for predicting dynamic and final surface and subsurface subsidence for longwall, room and pillar mining operations. The effects of <b>inclined</b> coal <b>seam</b> and steep surface terrains can also be considered the subsidence prediction. These prediction models have been validated with a large number of collected subsidence cases. With the accurately predicted ground deformations and good knowledge of structures, the types and severities of possible subsidence disturbances to the structures can be correctly assessed. For large and complicated structures, subsidence influences on structural stability, integrity and functionality have to be carefully considered. Once the causes and extents of the structural disturbances are identified, designing proper and cost-effective mitigation measures is often relatively easy.

40|$|To {{study the}} soft roof failure {{mechanism}} and the supporting method for a gateway in a gently <b>inclined</b> coal <b>seam</b> with a dip angle of 16 ° kept for gob-side entry retaining, {{and through the}} methodology of field investigation and numerical and analytical modeling, this paper analyzed the stress evolution law of roof strata at the working face end and determined that the sharp horizontal stress unloading phenomenon along the coal wall side did not appear after the working face advanced. Conversely, the horizontal stress along the gob side instantly decreased and the tensile stress produced, and the vertical stress in {{the central part of}} the roof had a higher reduction magnitude as well. An in-depth study indicates that the soft roof of the working face end subsided and seriously separated due to the effect of the front abutment pressure and the roof hanging length above the gob line, as well as certain other factors, including the rapid unloading of the lateral stress, tension and shear on the lower roof rock layer and dynamic disturbance. Those influencing factors also led to rapid crack propagation on a large scale and serious fracturing in the soft roof of the working face end. However, in the gob stress stabilized zone, the soft roof in the gob-side entry retaining has a shearing failure along the filling wall inside affected by the overburden pressure, rock bulking pressure, and roof gravity. To maintain the roof integrity, decrease the roof deformation, and enable the control of the working face end soft roof and the stabilization of the gob-side entry retaining roof, this study suggests that the preferred bolt installation angle for the soft roof situation is 70 ° based on the rock bolt extrusion strengthening theory...|$|R
