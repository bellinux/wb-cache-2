Others, exemplified by the eel, are catadromous, doing the reverse. The fresh water <b>European</b> <b>eel</b> migrates across the Atlantic Ocean as an adult to breed in floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea. The adults spawn here and then die, but the developing young are swept by the Gulf Stream towards Europe. By the time they arrive, they are small fish and enter estuaries and ascend rivers, overcoming obstacles in their path to reach the streams and ponds where they spend their adult lives.|$|E

25|$|Nearly every {{freshwater}} fish species of France {{can be found}} in the Loire river basin, that is, about 57 species from 20 families. Many of them are migratory, with 11 species ascending the river for spawning. The most common species are the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (Salmo trutta), shads (Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus). The <b>European</b> <b>eel</b> (Anguilla anguilla) is common in the upper streams, whereas the flounder (Platichtys flesus) and flathead mullet (Mugil spp.) tend to stay near the river mouth. The tributaries host brown trout (Salmo trutta), European bullhead (Cottus gobio), European brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), zander (Sander lucioperca), nase (Chondrostoma nasus and C. toxostoma) and wels catfish (Siluris glanis).

The anodic isoforms have low oxygen affinities (high P50) and marked Bohr effects, while the cathodic lack significant pH effects and are therefore thought to confer hypoxia tolerance.

40|$|The {{populations of}} American (Anguilla rostrata) and <b>European</b> <b>eels</b> (Anguilla anguilla) have been declining {{rapidly in the}} last decades. Organic {{contaminants}} are suspected {{to be one of}} the possible causes for the decline; however, so far there have been few investigations of the uptake of specific compounds by different life cycle stages (e. g. freshwater or marine stage) and how the contamination patterns develop throughout the eel's life cycle. In the present study we measured concentrations of polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), alternate brominated flame retardants (alternate BFRs) and Dechloranes (Decs) in different life stages of <b>European</b> and American <b>eels</b> to compare the contamination patterns and their development throughout the eel's life cycle. In general, concentrations of flame retardants (FRs) were similar to or higher in American than in <b>European</b> <b>eels,</b> and a greater number of FRs were detected. PBDE congeners that are characteristic of the Penta-PBDE formulation were the most abundant FRs in all adult eels as well as American glass <b>eels.</b> In <b>European</b> glass <b>eels</b> the alternate BFR 2, 3 -dibromopropy 1 - 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenylether (DPTE) and Dechlorane Plus were the dominating FRs, with average concentrations of 1. 1 +/- 0. 31 ng g(- 1) ww and up to 0. 32 ng g(- 1) ww respectively. Of the PBDEs BDE- 183 was the most abundant congener in <b>European</b> glass <b>eels.</b> Low concentrations (less than 10 % of the total contamination) of Tetra and Penta-PBDEs in juvenile <b>European</b> <b>eels</b> indicated that bans of technical Penta-PBDE in the European Union are effective. Enrichment of PBDEs was observed over the life stages of both <b>European</b> and American <b>eels.</b> However, a greater relative contribution of PBDEs to the sum FR contamination in American eels indicated an ongoing exposure to these substances. High contributions of alternate BFRs in juvenile eels indicated an increased use of these substances in recent years. Concentrations seemed to be driven primarily by location, rather than life stage or age. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
