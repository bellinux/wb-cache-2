We have reviewed the evidence for “causality ” with respect to infectious agents linked with cancer and estimated the fraction of all cancer cases concerned that are aUributable to it.

We estimate that 15. 6 % (1, 450, 000 cases) of the worldwide incidence of cancer in 1990 can be attributed to infection with either the hepatitis B and C viruses, the human papillomaviruses, EBV, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus I, HIV, the bacterium Helicobacter pylon, schistosomes, or liver flukes. There would be 21 % <b>fewer</b> <b>cases</b> of cancer in developing countries (1, 000, 000 <b>fewer</b> <b>cases</b> per year) and 9 % <b>fewer</b> <b>cases</b> in developed countries (375, 000 <b>fewer</b> <b>cases</b> per year) if these infectious diseases were prevented.

For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E

40|$|Background: Chronic {{hepatitis}} B (CHB) virus {{infection is}} a major global healthcare problem. The recent introduction of entecavir in Australia {{for the treatment of}} CHB patients in the naive treatment setting has triggered significant optimism with regards to improved clinical outcomes for CHB patients. Abstract: Objective: To estimate, from an Australian healthcare perspective, the cost effectiveness of entecavir 0. 5 mg/day versus lamivudine 100 mg/day in the treatment of CHB patients naive to nucleos(t) ide therapy. Abstract: Methods: A cost-utility analysis to project the clinical and economic outcomes associated with CHB disease and treatment was conducted by developing two decision-tree models specific to hepatitis B e antigen-positive (HBeAg+ve) and HBeAg-ve CHB patient subsets. This analysis was constructed using the Australian payer perspective of direct costs and outcomes, with indirect medical costs and lost productivity not being included. The study population comprised a hypothetical cohort of 1000 antiviral treatment-naive CHB patients who received either entecavir 0. 5 mg/day or lamivudine 100 mg/day at model entry. The population of patients used in this analysis was representative of those patients likely to receive initial antiviral therapy in clinical practice in Australia. The long-term cost effectiveness of entecavir compared with lamivudine in the first-line treatment of CHB patients was expressed as an incremental cost per life-year gained (LYG) or QALY gained. Abstract: Results: Results revealed that the availability of entecavir 0. 5 mg/day as part of the Australian hepatologist's treatment armamentarium should result in significantly lower future rates of compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) events (i. e. 54 <b>fewer</b> <b>cases</b> of CC, seven <b>fewer</b> <b>cases</b> of DC, and 20 <b>fewer</b> <b>cases</b> of HCC over the model's timeframe for HBeAg+ve CHB patients, and 69 <b>fewer</b> <b>cases</b> of CC, eight <b>fewer</b> <b>cases</b> of DC and 25 <b>fewer</b> <b>cases</b> of HCC over the model's timeframe for HBeAg-ve CHB patients). Compared with lamivudine 100 mg/day, entecavir 0. 5 mg/day generated an estimated incremental cost per LYG of Australian dollars ($A, year 2006 values) 5046 and an estimated incremental cost per QALY of $A 5952 in the HBeAg+ve CHB patient population, an estimated incremental cost per LYG of $A 7063 and an estimated incremental cost per QALY of $A 8003 in the HBeAg-ve CHB patient population, and an overall estimated incremental cost per LYG of $A 5853 and an estimated incremental cost per QALY of $A 6772 in the general CHB population. Abstract: Conclusion: The availability of entecavir in Australian clinical practice should make long-term suppression of hepatitis B virus replication increasingly attainable, resulting in fewer CHB sequelae, at an acceptable financial cost. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{river is}} a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a <b>few</b> <b>cases,</b> a river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the Paleozoic, around 400 Mya, the brachiopods were among the most {{abundant}} filter feeders in the ocean, and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized. By the PermianTriassic extinction event 250 Mya, bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The bivalves were hard hit by this event, but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity. The ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators may have been a major factor in their success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to swim, and in a <b>few</b> <b>cases,</b> adopting predatory habits.|$|E
