5000|$|Routes {{that begin}} with an [...] "8" [...] are Express-Circulator routes. This group can {{generally}} be considered in two categories. Route 81 operates as in express for its entire length, stopping only at transit centers. Routes 82 and 84 run as express routes between the Downtown Transit Center and NW Promenade on Rosedale, and run local beyond the NW Promemade hub. Route 83 operates as in local for its <b>enture</b> length making frequent stops. All four routes run either every 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or every hour.|$|E
50|$|Grossly, {{the tumor}} appears white, gray, or yellow, with {{irregular}} surface, often studded with small cysts. More small cysts {{may be found}} on cut sections. These cysts may break off the surface and float freely in aqueous or vitreous humour. The tumor may also contain chalky grayish white particles. The lens may be covered by a semi-translucent membrane in some case. Tumor may invade locally to involve the iris or anterior retina, or through the cornea or sclera. In advanced cases, tumor may fill the <b>enture</b> globe, similar to retinoblastoma.|$|E
40|$|Dental {{treatment}} {{can be said}} successful if the denture can restore masticatory and esthetic function and keep oral tissue in healthy condition. The success of full denture treatment depends on some factors, which are procedural techniques of full denture processin, which include clinical and laboratory phases. Besides technical aspects, there are some nontechnical aspects which include emotional characteristic of the patient, relation or communication between patient and dentist, patient's motivation and information about full denture. Thses aspects are often forgotten by dentists, because they emphasize more on technical aspects. This article describe the aspects of nontechnical procedures in making full denture and its connection {{with the success of}} full denture treatment. The conclusion of this paper is {{that it is necessary to}} communicate clearly with a patient who needs full <b>enture</b> treatment, orally with simple and understandable language, along with demonstrations and written information about diagnosis, prognosis and the treatment plan of the procedure which will be conducted according to the patient's character...|$|E
50|$|Rehan Khan was {{inspired}} early {{by his family}} to go into music. His father, Rizwan Khan was a professional sitar player but had to leave music {{to take care of}} the family by <b>enturing</b> the construction business, but always encouraged his son to venture into music. In 2005, Rehan Khan tried for Indian Idol but although making to the top 30, he failed to qualify for the finals.|$|R
25|$|The lower {{choir of}} the church is covered in slabs marked with the names of the sisters that were <b>entured</b> in the temple, with a processional image of Senhor dos Passos (Lord of Hosts) along the grid. The high choir is covered in gilded wood that {{permeates}} the structure, while the walls of the oratory (similarly covered in religious iconography) is covered in silver, likely retrieved from the old Convent of Jesus in Praia da Vitória, when the religious orders were extinguished. In the high choir are the choir stalls (or stacidia) of the congregation, with carved armrests consisting of mythical figures (including gryphons and chimeras). Within choir oculus are also a chinoiserie, a 17th-century organ and an exotic wood armoire.|$|R
40|$|In July 2016, NASA’s Juno mission {{becomes the}} first {{spacecraft}} to enter polar orbit of Jupiter and <b>enture</b> deep into unexplored polar territories of the magnetosphere. Focusing on these polar regions, we review current understanding of the structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere and summarize the outstanding issues. The Juno mission profile involves (a) a several-week approach from the dawn side of Jupiter’s magnetosphere, with an orbit-insertion maneuver on July 6, 2016; (b) a 107 -day capture orbit, also on the dawn flank; and (c) a series of thirty 11 -day science orbits with the spacecraft flying over Jupiter’s poles and ducking under the radiation belts. We show how Juno’s view of the magnetosphere evolves over the year of science orbits. The Juno spacecraft carries a range of instruments that take particles and fields measurements, remote sensing observations of auroral emissions at UV, visible, IR and radio wavelengths, and detect microwave emission from Jupiter’s radiation belts. We summarize how these Juno measurements address issues of auroral processes, microphysical plasma physics, ionosphere-magnetosphere and satellite-magnetosphere coupling, sources and sinks of plasma, the radiation belts, and {{the dynamics of the}} outer magnetosphere. To reach Jupiter, the Juno spacecraft passed close to the Earth on October 9, 2013, gaining the necessary energy to get to Jupiter. The Earth flyby provided an opportunity to test Juno’s instrumentation as well as take scientific data in the terrestrial magnetosphere, in conjunction with ground-based and Earth-orbiting assets.

40|$|Denture soft lining {{materials}} {{are used as}} a cushion between the hard denture base and the oral mucosa. Fluid sorption and solubility may contribute to material hardening, roughening, cracking or tearing, loss of adhesion to the hard denture base or contamination by extrinsic stains or yeasts. The ideal material is required to have low fluid uptake, good wettability, retain compliance and surface integrity, and not support fungal growth. Evaluation of behaviour in the oral environment is difficult {{and a number of}} materials, such as artificial saliva and food simulating liquids, have been recommended to simulate the environment. The two types of denture soft lining materials commonly used in clinical practice are methacrylate and silicone based. These together with an experimental elastomer were evaluated in this study. Fluid sorption and solubility were determined by immersion of disc specimens in food simulating fluids (distilled water, 3 % acetic acid, 10 % ethanol and 50 % ethanol) and artificial saliva at 37 ± 1 °C with weighing at set time intervals. Similar experiments were carried out using liquids representing fatty food constituents with coconut oil and 1113307 H. ardness was determined using a Shore A durometer. In order to determine wettability, contact angle was measured using a computer microscope. The surface roughness was assessed using a non-contact laser profilometer. Finally, an attempt was made to identify leachable substances from the materials investigated using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. An additional part {{of this study was to}} look at the adhesion of one yeast species Candida albicans to commercial materials using various protective coatings to determine their efficacy. The resultsd emonstratedth at the type of liquid simulating foods or artificial saliva, and immersion time significantly influenced the behaviour of the commercial denture soft lining materials and the experimental elastomer during in vitro testing. The two groups of materials behaviour were different. The two methacrylate-basedd <b>enture</b> soft lining materials showed marked absorption and solubility which may be associated with the loss of plasticisers. The two silicone-based denture soft lining materials showed much less absorption and solubility under the same conditions. The experimental elastomer showed marked swelling in oils, which was not expected, its chemical structure being similar to a methacrylate. Shore A hardness remained unchanged during the fluid immersion with the two silicone-based materials but showed measurable changes with the two methacrylate-basemd aterials and the experimentale lastomer,I ncreaseds urface roughness was also demonstrated with the two methacrylate-based materials, and decreasedc ontact angle was found with the two silicone-basedm aterials. After various surface treatment, coconut oil reduced Candida albicans adhesion in all cases. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
