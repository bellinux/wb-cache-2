500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then {{why did you want to}} do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E

In a 1985 interview with India Today, she remarked, [...] "The life and happiness in our house {{came to an end}} the day I and Rajesh got married," [...] sharing her unhappy marital experience and calling their marriage [...] "a farce". Asked in Filmfare whether she would want to marry again, Kapadia replied, [...] "I'm very happy and content. Why <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to get married again? Once was more than enough." [...] In 2010, reporter Dinesh Raheja stated that [...] "the bitterness between Rajesh and Dimple washed away", noting that they are seen together at parties and that Dimple campaigned for Khanna's election and also worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar. In a later interview she reflected back positively on her marriage, referring to it as her [...] "biggest high".|$|E

500|$|On November 6, 2013, Google {{implemented}} a comment system oriented on Google+ that required all YouTube users {{to use a}} Google+ account in order to comment on videos. The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone. The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse. In response, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the question [...] "why the fuck <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> a google+ account to comment on a video?" [...] on his YouTube channel to express his negative opinion of the change. The official YouTube announcement received 20,097 [...] "thumbs down" [...] votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days. Writing in the Newsday blog Silicon Island, Chase Melvin noted that [...] "Google+ is nowhere near as popular a social media network as Facebook, but it's essentially being forced upon millions of YouTube users who don't want to lose their ability to comment on videos" [...] and [...] "Discussion forums across the Internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system". In the same article Melvin goes on to say: ...|$|E

[...] When the fumble occurred, Moore was not aware that his buttocks had caused it; he learned of his role only after the game. When asked about the play, Moore answered, [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to talk about that? I don't understand why y’all keep asking about that play. ... I {{think it was a}} miscue with the handoff." [...] After consulting Sanchez and his assistant coaches, Jets head coach Rex Ryan echoed the analysis: [...] "My understanding is, I thought [...] reversed out the wrong way. That's what happened. It was a mental mistake and then he just tried to slide. When he did, he actually ran into Brandon." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the change}} in values imposed by {{communist}} ideology, the tradition of preservation of cultural heritage was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded {{by the end of}} the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with collectivization of peasants; destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. In 1937 several letters were written to the CCCP to rename Moscow to [...] "Stalindar" [...] or [...] "Stalinodar", one from an elderly pensioner whose dream was to [...] "live in Stalinodar" [...] and had selected the name to represent the [...] "gift" [...] (dar) of the genius of Stalin.

It felt compelled to put to rest [...] "spiteful false accusations" [...] by pointing out that Stieve had never set foot in a concentration camp, nor had he made any request to the prison administration that [...] "this or that should happen" [...] before the execution. The bodies he dissected, it claimed, were either victims of accidents or common criminals lawfully sentenced to death.|$|E
