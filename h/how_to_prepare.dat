25|$|Deeper {{insight into}} the nature of chess came with two younger players. American Paul Morphy, an {{extraordinary}} chess prodigy, won against all important competitors, including Anderssen, during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he intuitively knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> attacks. Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz later described how to avoid weaknesses in one's own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent's position. In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading Polish-German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this title for 27 years, the longest tenure of all World Champions.|$|E

25|$|The {{trial began}} on 21 April 1924. It lasted about two weeks. Near {{the end of}} the trial, Overturf testified in his own defense. He denied the charges, but {{admitted}} that several appraisals were higher than they should have been due to inaccurate measurements of the properties. In addition, Overturf testified that he had asked the veterans’ aid commission several times for instructions on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> his appraisal, but had received no answer to his queries. The jury deliberated for twelve hours before finding Overturf and other defendants guilty of mail fraud. However, after the verdict the jury petitioned the judge for leniency in sentencing, recommending that Overturf and the others be given fines rather than prison sentences. The judge agreed, giving Overturf a $1,000 fine and the others three defendants $500 fines. Overturf paid his fine and did not appeal the outcome of the trial.|$|E
25|$|In March 1941, the LAF in Berlin {{published}} a memorandum, titled Brangūs vergaujantieji broliai (Dear Enslaved Brothers), with instructions on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> {{for the war}} between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The rebels were asked to secure strategic objects (prisons, railroads, bridges, communication hubs, factories, etc.), guarding them from potential sabotage by the retreating Red Army, while Central Headquarters would organize a Provisional Government and declare independence. In April, {{a list of the}} members of the Provisional Government, which would declare Lithuanian independence, was compiled. The Prime Minister's post was reserved for Škirpa, four ministers were from Vilnius, six from Kaunas, and one from Berlin. The members represented a wide spectrum of pre-war political parties and, as such, claimed to represent a majority of the Lithuanian people. It has been suggested that not all of the designated Ministers knew about their proposed appointments in the Provisional Government. On June 14, the Nazi authorities in Berlin insisted that Škirpa and his activists not form any government or make any public declarations without their prior approval. Škirpa agreed to this, but he had very little control over the activists in Lithuania itself.|$|E
25|$|In Myanmar, the United Nations {{urged that}} {{approximately}} 70,000people evacuate {{in preparation for}} the cyclone. This prompted widespread evacuations in the country. Off the coast of Rakhine State, a large boat was towing two smaller ones to a safer area, late on May13, when one or more of them capsized after striking rocks. Authorities believed there were 100-150people total aboard the three vessels. By the following day, 42people had been rescued and 8bodies had been found. On May16, members of the Bangladeshi border guard recovered 31bodies in Teknaf Upazila from those who drowned in the accident. By May14, the government planned to have 38,000people evacuated; however, this process was reportedly moving slower than expected. With the majority of evacuees being internally displaced persons, many were hesitant to listen to orders from the military, and some refused to leave their temporary shelters. By May15, the number of displaced persons urged to evacuate rose to 140,000, with many still refusing to leave. Some told reporters that they would not listen to anything the government said unless they pointed guns at them. In Arakan State, just outside Sittwe, 393people were evacuated from low-lying areas. Field offices of the Save the Children foundation were placed on high alert. Sessions on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> for cyclones were held across Rakhine State. Ultimately, nearly 70,000people were evacuated in Rakhine State prior to Viyaru's arrival.|$|E

25|$|The {{advances}} {{made in the}} Middle East in botany {{and chemistry}} led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote {{one of the most}} valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.|$|E
25|$|Today, in the Samoa 'ava ceremony, {{the role}} of the aumaga is a {{comprehensive}} term, but in former times the 'ava makers were a much more select guild. In the preparation of the 'ava for a ceremony the services of a young woman or young man, or one or more young ladies and young men may be utilised. It is customary for the daughters of all chiefs to be taught <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> the 'ava. If the person mixing the 'ava is a young woman, it is customary for her to be the virgin daughter of a chief (matai). The 'ava mixer, sits behind the tanoa bowl and thoroughly mixes the 'ava as another member of the aumaga adds water from time to time. As the mixing proceeds, the 'ava mixer from time to time wrings the liquid from the strainer and folding the same into half its usual length passes it to another member of the aumaga standing outside or {{near the edge of the}} house who frees the strainer of the woody particles of the 'ava by several violent flicks. He then quickly passes the strainer back to the mixer who proceeds until all the particles of the dried root are removed. The stylised movements and serious concentration in the making of the 'ava are part of the ritual pattern in the ceremony. The water poured into the bowl as the mixing proceeds is done from either the left or right, not from in front. The action of mixing is one of contracting and expanding the fingers of the two hands as the strainer is slowly worked towards the mixer. When the mixing is completed the rim of the bowl is wiped to remove any water or woody material and the strainer is folded up and placed on the rim of the bowl. The mixer then places both hands on the bowl and sits quietly awaiting the next move in the ceremony.|$|E
