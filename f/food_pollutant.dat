40|$|Background: Cadmium, {{a common}} <b>food</b> <b>pollutant,</b> alters DNA {{methylation}} in vitro. Epigenetic effects might therefore partly explain cadmium's toxicity, including carcinogenicity, but human data on epigenetic effects are lacking. Objectives: To evaluate effects of dietary cadmium exposure on DNA methylation, considering other environmental exposures, genetic predisposition, and gene expression. Methods: Concentrations of cadmium, arsenic, selenium and zinc {{in blood and}} urine of nonsmoking women (N= 202) from the Northern Argentinean Andes were measured by ICP-MS. Methylation in CpG islands of LINE 1 (proxy for global DNA methylation) and promoter regions of p 16 (CDKN 2 A) and MLH 1 in peripheral blood were measured by bisulfite PCR pyrosequencing. Genotyping (N= 172) for DNMT 1 (rs 10854076, rs 2228611) and DNMT 3 B (rs 2424913, rs 2424932) was performed with SequenomTM; and gene expression (N= 90) with DirectHyb HumanHT- 12 v 3. 0. Results: Cadmium exposure was low: median concentrations in blood and urine were 0. 36 and 0. 23 µg/L, respectively. Urinary cadmium (ln transformed) was inversely associated with LINE 1 methylation (β=- 0. 50, p= 0. 0070; β=- 0. 44, p= 0. 026 adjusted for age and coca chewing), but not with p 16 or MLH 1 methylation. Both DNMT 1 rs 10854076 and DNMT 1 rs 2228611 polymorphisms modified associations between urinary cadmium and LINE 1 (p-values for interaction in adjusted models were 0. 045 and 0. 064, respectively). The rare genotypes demonstrated stronger hypomethylation with increasing urinary cadmium concentrations. Cadmium was inversely associated with DNMT 3 B (rs - 0. 28, p= 0. 0086), but not with DNMT 1 expression (rs - 0. 075, p= 0. 48). Conclusion: Environmental cadmium exposure was associated with DNA hypomethylation in peripheral blood and DNMT 1 genotypes modified this association.

Apart from occupational exposure which concerns a subset of chemicals, humans are mostly exposed to a large variety of chemicals, all life-long and at low doses. Food ingestion is a major route of exposure and it is suggested that pollutants have a worsened impact when combined with a high-fat diet. In the experimental studies described herein, we aimed to add further evidence on the metabolic impact of <b>food</b> <b>pollutants</b> using a recently set up model in which mice are life-long fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HFSD) with/without common <b>food</b> <b>pollutants</b> shown to exhibit metabolic disrupting activities. Specifically, this mixture comprised bisphenol A, dioxin, polychlorobiphenyl PCB 153, and phthalate and was added in HFSD at doses resulting in mice exposure at the Tolerable Daily Intake dose range for each pollutant. We herein focused on the 7 -week-old females which exhibited early signs of obesity upon HFSD feeding. We observed no signs of toxicity and no additional weight gain following exposure to the mixture but alleviated HFSD-induced glucose intolerance in the absence of alteration of gluconeogenesis and steatosis. It suggested that the observed metabolic improvement was more likely due to effects on muscle and/or adipose tissues rather than on the liver. Consistently, female mice exhibited enhanced lean/fat mass ratio and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. Moreover, expression levels of inflammatory markers were reduced in adipose tissue at 7 but enhanced at 12 weeks of age in agreement with the inverse alterations of glucose tolerance observed at these ages upon pollutant exposure in the HFSD-fed females. Collectively, these data suggest apparent biphasic effects of pollutants upon HFSD feeding along with obesity development. These effects were not observed in males and may depend on interactions between diet and pollutants...|$|R

We present a real time, non-invasive, label free rapid detection technique to quantify phthalates' presence in deionized water and fruit juices. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique applied to a novel planar inter-digital (ID) capacitive sensor plays a vital role to explore the presence of phthalate esters in bulk fluid media. The ID sensor with multiple sensing gold electrodes was fabricated on silicon substrate using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) device fabrication technology. A thin film of parylene C polymer was coated as a passivation layer to enhance the capacitive sensing capabilities of the sensor and to reduce the magnitude of Faradic current flowing through the sensor. Various concentrations, 0. 002 ppm through to 2 ppm of di (2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in deionized water, {{were exposed to the}} sensing system by dip testing method.

Problems {{related to}} food {{security}} in Russian Arctic (dietary imbalance, predominance of carbohydrates, shortage of milk products, vegetables and fruits, deficit of vitamins and microelements, chemical, infectious and parasitic food contamination) have been {{defined in the}} literature. But no standard protocol of food security assessment {{has been used in}} the majority of studies. Objectives. Our aim was to obtain food security indicators, identified within an Arctic collaboration, for selected regions of the Russian Arctic, Siberia and the Far East, and to compare food safety in these territories. Study design and methods. In 18 regions of the Russian Arctic, Siberia and the Far East, the following indicators of food security were analyzed: food costs, food consumption, and chemical and biological food contamination for the period 2000 &#x 2013; 2011. Results. Food costs in the regions are high, comprising 23 &#x 2013; 43 % of household income. Only 4 out of 10 food groups (fish products, cereals, sugar, plant oil) are consumed in sufficient amounts. The consumption of milk products, eggs, vegetables, potatoes, fruits (and berries) is severely low in a majority of the selected regions. There are high levels of biological contamination of food in many regions. The biological and chemical contamination situation is alarming, especially in Chukotka. Only 7 <b>food</b> <b>pollutants</b> are under regular control; among pesticides, only DDT. Evenki AO and Magadan Oblast have reached peak values in food contaminants compared with other regions. Mercury in local fish has not been analyzed in the majority of the regions. In 3 regions, no monitoring of DDT occurs. Aflatoxins have not been analyzed in 5 regions. Nitrates had the highest percentage in excess of the hygienic threshold in all regions. Excesses of other pollutants in different regions were episodic and as a rule not high. Conclusion. Improvement of the food supply and food accessibility in the regions of the Russian Arctic, Siberia and the Far East is of utmost importance.

30|$|Apart from sensing <b>food</b> <b>pollutants,</b> {{the concept}} of food safety also {{includes}} pesticide detection. In general, organophosphorus compounds (OPs) are the most broadly used pesticides in modern agriculture. However, they pose a serious health hazard and may cause death if consumed above the safety limit. Hou et al. [243] developed l-tyrosine methyl ester-functionalized CDs {{for the detection of}} methyl parathion, which is included in the OP family. In the presence of tyrosinase and oxygen, the tyrosine methyl ester was transformed into quinone complexes, thereby quenching the CD fluorescence. However, the presence of methyl parathion reduces the activity rate of tyrosinase and slows down the quenching process. Therefore, the fluorescence intensity can be measured as the concentration of available methyl parathion. Despite its extremely broad detection range, 10  nM to 0.1  mM, and low LOD of 48  pM, the study also confirmed 30 -day stability (kept at 4  °C), good reproducibility from different batches of the l-tyrosine methyl ester-functionalized CD-based sensor, and its usability for methyl parathion detection in contaminated food samples such as cabbage, milk, and fruit juice. Another class of OPs, namely dichlorvos, is also of research interest for the same research group [244]. The underlying detection scheme is very similar to that in their previous study, except that the fluorescence is quenched by FRET through the energy acceptor 5 -thio- 2 -nitrobenzoic acid anion (TNB−) with quaternized CDs as the energy donor. The presence of dichlorvos inhibits the reaction, further restoring the fluorescence of the CDs, and the concentration can be determined accordingly. Under optimal conditions, a linear detection range of dichlorvos of 50  pM to 0.1 μM with an LOD of 19  pM was achieved. A more recent study was reported by Zheng et al. [245] pertaining to phoxim detection using CD-functionalized silver nanoparticles. Theoretically, the as-prepared CDs become negatively charged in acidic medium (pH 6.0) due to the abundance of amine and carboxyl functional groups on their surface and cross-linked with the positively charged phoxim via electrostatic bonding, resulting in aggregation of the CDs. A visible color change from yellow to red is observed upon addition of phoxim due to the red-shift of the absorption band, from 400 to 525  nm, induced by the aggregation process. Hence, quantitative measurement of the phoxim concentration can be realized through the calculated absorbance ratio, A 525 nm/A 400 nm, in the detection range of 0.1 – 100 μM. In addition, the calculated LOD was found to be 0.04 μM, much lower than the maximum permissible phoxim concentration in food samples in China.|$|R

In addition, this channel appears responsible for detecting physical signals such as noxious cold and mechanical forces. Objectives: There is mounting evidence that TRPA 1 {{is involved in}} the pathophysiology of several diseases, and directly contributes to the cold and mechanical hyperalgesia present in inflammatory and neuropathic states. Therefore, TRPA 1 is an important therapeutic target for drug development. Intriguingly, however, the number of receptor antagonists reported thus far is notably low, as compared with the large number of receptor agonists. Nonetheless, known TRPA 1 antagonists display very promising in vivo activity against mechanical hypersensitivity and cold hyperalgesia, although at therapeutic doses that are still high for drug development. A significant effort is being pursued using medicinal chemistry programs to modify the initial scaffolds for evolving lead compounds for preclinical and clinical assays. Conclusion: It is anticipated that this field will blossom in the near future, and the number and therapeutic indexes of new antagonists will be significantly improved. Furthermore, it will not be surprising if TRPA 1 agonists also have some therapeutic potential, akin to capsaicin. Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation BFU 2007 - 61855, SAF 2006 - 02580.

Urban stormwater runoff is a major source of metal pollution, particularly Zn, and is a leading contributor to the degradation of receiving waters. Consequently, significant remedial efforts have focused on using constructed stormwater wetlands to reduce pollutant loads. However, no studies have examined the efficacy of water quality improvements on ecologically relevant behaviours in aquatic biota. We conducted controlled laboratory experiments to test whether untreated (100 and 400 μg L⁻¹) and treated (40 μg L⁻¹) stormwater Zn concentrations observed in constructed wetlands interfere with the foraging behaviour of the glass shrimp (Paratya australiensis). The ability of shrimp to perceive, approach and search for a chemoattractant source was used to assess foraging behaviour. Abnormal foraging behaviour was observed in shrimp exposed to Zn at untreated stormwater concentrations. The strongest change relative to the control was observed for perception, which decreased by more than 80 and 60 % in the 400 μg Zn L⁻¹ and 100 μg Zn L⁻¹ groups, respectively. The behaviour of shrimp exposed to Zn concentrations measured in treated stormwater did not differ from the controls. The results suggest that the reduction of stormwater Zn concentrations via wetland treatment can prevent abnormal contamination-induced behaviours in shrimp, leading to improved aquatic ecosystem health. This study also highlights the subtle, but biologically significant impacts arising from sublethal exposures of Zn, and emphasise the utility of behavioural toxicology.

40|$|Abstract Humans {{are exposed}} to countless foreign compounds, {{typically}} referred to as xenobiotics. These can include clinically used drugs, environmental <b>pollutants,</b> <b>food</b> additives, pesticides, herbicides and even natural plant compounds. Xenobiotics are metabolised primarily in the liver, {{but also in the}} gut and other organs, to derivatives that are more easily eliminated from the body. In some cases, however, a compound is converted to an electrophile that can cause cell toxicity and transformation leading to cancer. Among the most important xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes are the cytochromes P 450 (P 450 s). These enzymes represent a superfamily of multiple forms that exhibit marked species differences in their expression and catalytic activities. To predict how humans will metabolise xenobiotics, including drugs, human liver extracts and recombinant P 450 s have been used. New humanised mouse models are being developed which will be of great value in the study of drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in vivo, and in carrying out human risk assessment of xenobiotics.

This review assesses potential causes involving adverse effects on testis development in perinatal life (primarily effects on Sertoli cell number), which are probably irreversible, or effects {{on the process of}} spermatogenesis in adulthood, which are probably mainly reversible.

40|$|The {{notion of}} the {{perinatal}} "hormonal imprinting" has been published at first in 1980 and since that time it spred expansively. The imprintig develops at the first encounter between the developing receptor and the target hormone - possibly by the alteration of the methylation pattern of DNA - and it is transmitted to the progeny generations of the cell. This is needed for the complete development of the receptor's binding capacity. However, molecules similar to the target hormone (hormone-analogues, drugs, chemicals, environmental pollutants) can also bind to the developing receptor, causing faulty imprinting with life-long consequences. This can promote pathological conditions. Later it was cleared that in other critical periods such as puberty, imprinting also can be provoked, even in any age in differentiating cells. The central nervous system (brain) also can be mistakenly imprinted, which durably influences the dopaminergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic system and this can be manifested - in animal experiments - in alterations of the sexual and social behavior. In our modern age the faulty hormonal imprintig is inavoidable because {{of the mass of}} medicaments, chemicals, the presence of hormone-like materials (e. g. soya phytosteroids) in the <b>food,</b> and environmental <b>pollutants.</b> The author especially emphasizes the danger of oxytocin, as a perinatal imprinter, as it is used very broadly and can basically influence the emotional and social spheres and the appearance of certain diseases such as auitism, schizophrenia and parkinsonism. The danger of perinatal imprinters is growing, considering their effects on the human evolution...|$|R
40|$|Inflammation is {{a primary}} defense process against various {{extracellular}} stimuli, such as viruses, pathogens, <b>foods,</b> and environmental <b>pollutants.</b> When cells respond to stimuli for short periods of time, it results in acute or physiological inflammation. However, if the stimulation is sustained for longer time or a pathological state occurs, it is known as chronic or pathological inflammation. Several {{studies have shown that}} tumorigenesis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is closely associated with chronic inflammation, for which abnormal cellular alterations that accompany chronic inflammation such as oxidative stresses, gene mutations, epigenetic changes, and inflammatory cytokines, are shared with carcinogenic processes, which forms a critical cross-link between chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. Transforming growth factor (TGF) -β is a multi-potent cytokine that {{plays an important role in}} regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and differentiation. Most importantly, TGF-β is a strong anti-inflammatory cytokine that regulates the development of effector cells. TGF-β has a suppressive effect on carcinogenesis under normal conditions by inhibiting abnormal cell growth, but on the other hand, many GI cancers originate from uncontrolled cell growth and differentiation by genetic loss of TGF-β signaling molecules or perturbation of TGF-β adaptors. Once a tumor has developed, TGF-β exerts a promoting effect on the tumor itself and stromal cells to enhance cell growth, alter the responsiveness of tumor cells to stimulate invasion and metastasis, and inhibited immune surveillance. Therefore, novel development of therapeutic agents to inhibit TGF-β-induced progression of tumor and to retain its growth inhibitory activities, in addition to anti-inflammatory actions, could be useful in oncology. In this review, we discuss the role of TGF-β in inflammation and carcinogenesis of the GI tract related to abnormal TGF-β signaling...|$|R
40|$|Micronuclei (MN) {{are formed}} during mitosis {{and do not}} {{integrate}} in the main nucleus. They may arise from a whole lagging chromosome or an acentric chromosome fragment. An increase of MN frequency indicates genomic instability. The MN test is commonly {{used to determine the}} genotoxic effects of chemical and physical agents on somatic cells. It is applied to all types of cells reproducing by mitosis in vitro and in vivo, and it is easier and faster to perform than the chromosome aberration assay. With the development of the in vitro cytochalasin-B block method for detecting MN frequency in binuclear cells, its reliability and validity has been increased. At the same time, the test enables an estimation of cytotoxicity using the frequency of nuclear division index in in vitro studies, and the ratio between polychromatic erythrocytes and normochromatic erythrocytes in in vivo studies. Human beings and other species are exposed to a large number of chemical and physical factors in their environment. Therefore, the genotoxic studies about the adverse effects and potential risks of those factors gain importance exponentially. The MN test is a practical bio-monitoring test that provides an investigation tool on genotoxic and carcinogenic potentials and reliability of physical agents, drugs and all types of other chemical such as <b>pollutants,</b> <b>food</b> additives to which people are exposed daily, and it helps to predict and monitor the cancer risk. The MN technique, which has been used for many years due to its advantages such as simplicity, reliability, validity and applicability to different types of cells, will also carry on {{an important role in the}} future in the evaluation and prevention of mutagenicity. The aim of this review is to give information about the MN technique, which is considered to be an indirect indication for genetic damage in cells...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{methods have}} been {{developed}} in the Netherlands to assess quality standards for the environment. Maximum permissible concentrations have been derived for direct exposure to environmental media. In 1991 two simple foodchains were analyzed at the RIVM. - Water [...] > Fish [...] > Fish-eating birds and/or mammals - Soil [...] > Worm [...] > Worm-eating birds and/or mammals. A general algorithm was provided to include secondary poisoning (exposure to contaminated food) in setting quality standards for the environment. The aim of this report is to give recommendations for future research and a concept for a more complicated terrestrial food chain: Soil [...] > Plant, worm, insect, etc. [...] > Small bird, small mammal [...] > Bird and beast of prey. A more precise description {{of the effects of}} compounds in the environment and of the factors influencing ecological and toxic effects are given. An overview of existing models dealing with biomagnification is presented. It is proposed to use a food web model based on aggregated groups of animals and plants. Since many species may be present within the system, e. g. plants, worms, insects, etc. and to a less extent in the group of small mammals and birds, it is proposed to aggregate the organisms in these levels in functional groups to reduce the complexity of the system. From this report it is apparent that the following correction factors for the toxicity data {{should be part of the}} model - laboratory versus field, - normal versus extreme conditions, caloric conversion, - <b>food</b> assimilation efficiency, <b>pollutant</b> assimilation efficiency and - relative sensitivity. It is recommended to use data from laboratory studies for building the model and to use field data for the validation of the model. Although it is possible to carry out the risk assessment with for instance constant bioaccumulation factors or other parameters, it is recommended also to consider these parameters as stochastic parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{teratogenic}} and carcinogenic {{effects of}} phthalate esters on living beings are proven in toxicology studies. These ubiquitous <b>food</b> and environmental <b>pollutants</b> pose a great {{danger to the}} human race due to their extraordinary use as a plasticizer in the consumer product industry. Contemporary detection techniques used for phthalates require {{a high level of}} skills, expensive equipment and longer analysis time than the presented technique. Presented research work introduces a real time non-invasive detection technique using a new type of silicon substrate based planar interdigital (ID) sensor fabricated on basis of thin film micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) semiconductor device fabrication technology. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used in conjunction with the fabricated sensor to detect phthalates in deionized water. Various concentrations of di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) as low as 2 ppb to a higher level of 2 ppm in deionized water were detected distinctively using new planar ID sensor based EIS sensing system. Dip testing method was used to obtain the conductance and dielectric properties of the bulk samples. Parylene C polymer coating was used as a passivation layer {{on the surface of the}} fabricated sensor to reduce the influence of Faradaic currents. In addition, inherent dielectric properties of the coating enhanced the sensitivity of the capacitive type sensor. Electrochemical spectrum analysis algorithm was used to model experimentally observed impedance spectrum to deduce constant phase element (CPE) equivalent circuit to analyse the kinetic processes taking place inside the electrochemical cell. Curve fitting technique was used to extract the values of the circuit components and explain experimental results on theoretical grounds. The sensor performance was tested by adding DEHP to an energy drink at concentrations above and below the minimal risk level (MRL) limit set by the ATSDR (Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry), USA. Results showed that the new sensor was able to detect different concentrations of phthalates in energy drinks. The experimental outcomes provided sufficient indication to favour the development of a low cost detection system for rapid quantification of phthalates in beverages for industrial use. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract Digital {{technologies}} have already impacted {{on the world}} of jewellery at a surprising and rapidly increasing rate. Since the first, tentative experiments with computer-aided design in the 1970 s, through developments in computer numerically controlled manufacture in the 1980 s and, critically, since the mid 1990 s in rapid prototyping processes, the take up of all these technologies by the jewellery design and manufacturing community has accelerated {{to a degree that}} in view of the traditional values of the discipline is perhaps unexpected. It {{is fair to say that}} digital technologies now play some part, often the major part, in virtually every sector of jewellery design, manufacture and promotion, from that of the experimental artist-craftsman to that of the finest jewellery houses. The so-called ‘contemporary jewellery’ movement as a whole, however, has stood back from this development. Contextualised by the field of contemporary jewellery but recognising a world of shifting values and changing resources, the seminars aims were broad and cross-disciplinary: to stimulate debate and to open up channels of communication on a range of methods, issues and opportunities - consequent in the main on developments in digital technology - that now confront the creators of contemporary jewellery, jewellery users and others in fields allied to that of jewellery. This seminar brought together an invited group of speakers and delegates including practitioners and theorists from jewellery and the applied arts, fashion and textile designers, historians, critics, policy-makers and environmentalists, to consider new research directives for the integration of digital technologies within the field of jewellery, and for the development of new research methodologies and innovative products. The seminar’s objectives included: a review of the impact of digital technologies on jewellery design and production to date; the identifications of key issues for the future development of jewellery in relation to digital technologies, and the exploration of new working processes and methodologies. This paper explores the roles of Scentsor[ring]: digital jewellery embedded with wireless sensor networks and microfluidic devices for therapeutic, diagnostic and wellbeing applications. The development of this collection is inspired by the chemical language and interaction of organisms to dispense fragrance, triggered by sensors that react to an individual's body state (e. g. heart rate, temperature) and the environment (e. g. sound). Further sensors such as the ‘electronic nose’ will be introduced and unorthodox and innovative designs in jewellery will be examined. There is increasing interest in the effect of the environment on wellbeing and symptoms of mental illness, but until now the focus of recent intervention in this area has been in the more distant or the interpersonal environment. This paper investigates intervention in the immediate personal air-space around the individual. Combined with other forms of support for improved mental health, many patients could welcome the prospect of jewellery that offers enhanced control of their emotional state, whether by conscious control or biofeedback. Several psychiatric disorders and symptoms will be investigated for an application of such Scentsor[ring] technologies i. e. the use of scents to enhance mood and improve psychological wellbeing. This scooping will be undertaken in collaboration with experts in the area of mental health and wellbeing. The paper will conclude by proposing jewellery that mimics the sense of smell via electronic nose sensors in order to detect spoiled <b>food,</b> monitor <b>pollutant</b> chemicals in the air, or set the basis for revolutionary work in the diagnostic area such as pinpointing ovulation and diseases. By emulating a dog’s sense of smell the jewellery could sniff out explosives and narcotics, or detect the early stages of cancer. Further examples include jewellery that is pre-programmed to detect a potential partner’s pheromone profile and then send a sample of the users pheromones, or a mosquito repelling device, or an olfactive watch, or jewellery that offers wider-waves of feeling in (re) active environments...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop and apply {{ecological}} criteria for selecting marine reserve systems that effectively conserve diadromous species in enclosed and semi-enclosed seas. It addressed the problem that, while marine reserves are increasingly being used to conserve biodiversity and restore biological populations, current marine reserve selection criteria and their application do not include functional linkages and external threats which make marine and freshwater ecosystems interdependent. Without explicitly capturing these linkages, marine reserves will fail to protect important elements that maintain marine biodiversity, especially diadromous fish species. The core tenet of the thesis argues that conservation of diadromous species in the marine biodiversity context is not inclusive when these species are being caught or are losing their spawning grounds in freshwater ecosystems beyond marine reserve boundaries. It proposes that functional linkages between freshwater and marine ecosystems, critical for viable diadromous fish populations and their habitats, {{be considered as a}} new criterion in reserve site selection processes, particularly for enclosed and semi-enclosed seas. Furthermore, the effects of land-based threats on downstream marine ecosystems should be minimised. Four core principles to guide the application of this new criterion are presented: •Principle 1 : Functional ecological linkages between marine and freshwater ecosystems need to be maintained, while damaged functional linkages need to be restored. •Principle 2 : The life history attributes and critical habitat requirements and migration routes of diadromous species must be explicitly considered. •Principle 3 : Adverse land-based impacts on the ecological condition and integrity of marine reserves must be minimised. •Principle 4 : Strategies for selecting linked marine/freshwater reserves should be compatible with integrated management plans in coastal areas. The new criterion, in combination with the existing criteria used in marine reserve design, was applied using MARXAN reserve selection software, with the southern Caspian Sea selected as a case study. The application of all the criteria to the case study led to the selection of a marine reserve system that spatially linked marine and freshwater ecosystems. The selected reserve system included three major clusters of marine reserve units and 18 major river systems distributed across several biogeographic regions of the southern Caspian Sea. Endangered species’ habitats and ecologically important habitats for diadromous species were explicitly represented in the final reserve system. Areas which were identified as of great significance for traditional fishing communities were excluded from the selected reserve system, thus minimising the social and economic impacts on these communities. To provide access to unprotected areas for fishing and to leave adequate resources for local fisheries; 24. 5 % (411, 142 ha) of the sea was designated as reserve network. The outcome of analysis carried out in this thesis created a marine reserve network with combination of relatively small (100, 000 ha) reserve sites. This study is significant as it is the first attempt at selecting marine reserves in enclosed and semi-enclosed seas such as the Caspian Sea which functionally link marine and freshwater ecosystems. The results confirm the need for functional linkages between marine and freshwater ecosystems. The final marine reserve network and protected river systems have the capacity to conserve biodiversity in a spatially linked marine-freshwater reserve network. However, the functional linkages are not limited only to biological linkages (i. e. diadromous species movement) —other aspects such as <b>food</b> and <b>pollutant</b> transfer between terrestrial and marine ecosystems (through runoff) are shown as critical issues in spatially linking freshwater and marine reserve ecosystems. These aspects need to be considered in the selection of reserve systems in enclosed and semi-enclosed seas. The Caspian Sea is a unique asset of global biodiversity and its conservation should be based on sound ecological science rather than economic and political opportunism. This study could be expanded to include trans-boundary management plans to designate an appropriate fraction of the whole Caspian Sea to a marine reserves network. This would represent an important step towards achieving biodiversity conservation for the whole sea and the freshwater ecosystems that feed into the sea...|$|R
40|$|Chemical species carry {{information}} in two dimensions, in their concentrations and their isotopic signatures. The concentrations of metabolites or synthetic compounds describe {{the composition of}} a chemical or biological system, while isotopic signatures describe processes in the system by their reaction pathways, regulation, and responses to external stimuli. Stable isotopes are unique tracers of these processes because their natural abundances are modulated by isotope effects occurring in physical processes {{as well as in}} chemical reactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a prime technique not only for identification and quantification of small molecules in complex systems but also for measuring intramolecular distribution of stable isotopes in metabolites and other small molecules. In this thesis, we use quantitative NMR in three fields: in <b>food</b> science, environmental <b>pollutant</b> tracing, and plant-climate science. The phospholipid (PL) composition of food samples is of high interest because of their nutritional value and technological properties. However, the analysis of PLs is difficult as they constitute {{only a small fraction of}} the total lipid contents in foods. Here, we developed a method to identify PLs and determine their composition in food samples, by combining a liquid-liquid extraction approach for enriching PLs, with specialized 31 P, 1 H-COSY NMR experiments to identify and quantify PLs. Wide-spread pollution with synthetic compounds threatens the environment and human health. However, the fate of pollutants in the environment is often poorly understood. Using quantitative deuterium NMR spectroscopy, we showed for the nitrosamine NDMA and the pesticide DDT how intramolecular distributions (isotopomer patterns) of the heavy hydrogen isotope deuterium reveal mechanistic insight into transformation pathways of pollutants and organic compounds in general. Intramolecular isotope distributions can be used to trace a pollutant’s origin, to understand its environmental transformation pathways and to evaluate remediation approaches. The atmospheric CO 2 concentration ([CO 2]) is currently rising at an unprecedented rate and plant responses to this increase in [CO 2] influence the global carbon cycle and will determine future plant productivity. To investigate long-term plant responses, we developed a method to elucidate metabolic fluxes from intramolecular deuterium distributions of metabolites that can be extracted from historic plant material. We show that the intramolecular deuterium distribution of plant glucose depends on growth [CO 2] and reflects the magnitude of photorespiration, an important side reaction of photosynthesis. In historic plant samples, we observe that photorespiration decreased in annual crop plants and natural vegetation over the past century, with no observable acclimation, implying that photosynthesis increased. In tree-ring samples from all continents covering the past 60 – 700 years, we detected a significantly smaller decrease in photorespiration than expected. We conclude that the expected “CO 2 fertilization” has occurred but was significantly less pronounced in trees, due to opposing effects. The presented applications show that intramolecular isotope distributions not only provide information about the origin and turnover of compounds but also about metabolic regulation. By extracting isotope distributions from archives of plant material, metabolic information can be obtained retrospectively, which allows studies over decades to millennia, timescales that are inaccessible with manipulation experiments...|$|R
