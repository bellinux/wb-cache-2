50|$|Unlike {{most other}} chemicals, {{the purpose of}} a {{peroxide}} is to decompose. In doing so it generates useful radicals that can initiate polymerization to make polymers, modify polymers by grafting or visbreaking, or cross-link polymers to create a thermoset. When used for these purposes, the peroxide is highly diluted, so the heat generated by the <b>exothermic</b> <b>decomposition</b> is safely absorbed by the surrounding medium (e.g. polymer compound or emulsion). But when a peroxide is in a more pure form, the heat evolved by its decomposition may not dissipate as quickly as it is generated, which can result in increasing temperature, which further intensifies the rate of <b>exothermic</b> <b>decomposition.</b> This can create a dangerous situation known as a self-accelerating decomposition.|$|E

40|$|Even {{a single}} excess {{electron}} or ion migrating {{on the surface}} of sensitive explosives can catalyze their gradual <b>exothermic</b> <b>decomposition.</b> Mechanisms underlying such a charge-induced gradual thermal decomposition of highly sensitive explosives can be different. If sensitive explosive is a polar liquid, intense charge-dipole attraction between excess surface charges and surrounding explosive molecules can result in repetitive attempts of solvation of these charges by polar explosive molecules. Every attempt of such uncompleted nonequilibrium solvation causes local <b>exothermic</b> <b>decomposition</b> of thermolabile polar molecules accompanied by further thermal jumping unsolvated excess charges to new surface sites. Thus, ionized mobile hot spots emerge on charged explosive surface. Stochastic migration of ionized hot spots on explosive surface causes gradual <b>exothermic</b> <b>decomposition</b> of the whole mass of the polar explosive. The similar gradual charge-catalyzed <b>exothermic</b> <b>decomposition</b> of both polar and nonpolar highly sensitive explosives can be also caused by intense charge-dipole attacks of surrounding water vapor molecules electrostatically attracted from ambient humid air and strongly accelerated towards charged sites on explosive surfaces. Emission of electrons, photons and heat from ionized hot spots randomly migrating on charged surface of highly sensitive explosive aerosol nanoparticles converts such particles into the form of short-circuited thermionic nanobatteries.

Samples of TNAZ in open pans and pierced pans undergo mainly melting (∆Hfus) 27 (3 kJ mol- 1) and vaporization (∆Hvap) 74 (10 kJ mol- 1) during heating. However, when confined in sealed high-pressure crucibles, <b>exothermic</b> thermal <b>decomposition</b> is observed.

The initial value of 184 kJ mol- 1 at the start of the reaction decreases to 38 kJ mol- 1 near the end of the reaction.

The measured heat release of thermal decomposition (Q) 640 (150 kJ mol- 1) is independent of the heating rate and the sample mass.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} pyrolysis of charring material applicable to fire safety and biomass utilization is presented in this thesis. This work {{is divided into three}} parts. In the first part, thermal decomposition and pressure generation in charring solids undergoing opposed-flow flame spread is numerically studied with a detailed physics-based model. The result indicates that the char density and product yields are functions of depth due to an insulating char layer. The characteristics of various simplifying model assumptions such as global reaction, infinite rate kinetics and no convective gas transport were examined. In the second part, a method of determining the pyrolysis temperature by enforcing mass and energy balance is proposed and validated by comparison with the decomposition kinetics model and the experiments. This pyrolysis temperature has the form of pyrolysis rate weighted average temperature for the entire charring process. Heat flux, sample size, heat of pyrolysis and kinetic parameters are the most important for determining an appropriate pyrolysis temperature. A non-dimensional correlation to determine an appropriate T_p was proposed. Excellent agreement between the pyrolysis front model using the correlation and experimental data of wood cylinder pyrolysis was achieved. Finally, pyrolysis of wood sphere is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Weight loss and temperatures of the sample were measured during the experiments. Center temperature showed two distinct thermal behaviors with endothermic and exothermic reactions. The numerical study revealed the following findings: (i) Contribution of secondary tar decomposition and lignin decomposition to the temperature peak are small. (ii) <b>Exothermic</b> intermediate solid <b>decomposition</b> is responsible for the temperature peak. (iii) The temperature plateau is caused by endothermic cellulose decomposition. Based on the experimental and numerical results, a novel wood pyrolysis model is proposed. The model consists of three endothermic parallel reactions producing tar, gas and intermediate solid, followed by exothermic intermediate solid conversion to char and <b>exothermic</b> tar <b>decomposition</b> to char and gas.

Also the secondary decomposition processes of COCN and CONC radicals in their ground states and the secondary elimination of HX from CH 2 = C(OH) X have been investigated. Cyanide-isocyanide isomerization {{is found to be}} the predominant channel in the unimolecular reactions of acetyl cyanide.

The barriers for the rearrangement processes to carbenes in acetyl isocyanide are quite high in contrast to those of acetaldehyde and fluoroformaldehyde. The large magnitude of the reverse barrier from the carbenes to acetyl cyanide suggests the stability of the carbenes.

This conclusion was supported by 13 C solid state NMR and isolation of molecular heptazine anions after base hydrolysis (structural deconstruction) of the CNxHy material. Modifications to the decomposition of TCM were explored. Introduction of a solid template (NaCl or silica) led to morphological changes in the TCM–CNx product, observed by scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the sodium salts, NaBr and NaN 3, led to chloride exchange with TCM. The use of mixtures of NH 4 Cl and NaN 3 also showed changes in the morphology of the material, while leading to slight changes in the IR spectra. A series of reactions between NaBH 4 and TCM yield novel thermally stable boron carbon nitride (BCN) materials. Reactions between TCM and Li 2 C 2 or aromatic organic solids led to CNx materials with increased carbon contents. Crystalline metal–heptazine precipitates were generated by cation exchange reaction with the base hydrolysis product of TCM–CNx, potassium cyamelurate. A structure solution was attempted for the crystalline copper cyamelurate salt, KCu[C 6 N 7 O 3]· 4 H 2 O. Neutral molecular heptazines were also synthesized; these species included 2, 5, 8 –tribromo–s–heptazine (TBH), 2, 5, 8 –triphenyl–s–heptazine (TPH), 2, 5, 8 –tris(diisopropylamino) –s–heptazine (TAmH), and 2 –bis(trimethylsilyl) amido– 5, 8 –dichloroheptazine (DCAH). These materials were sublimable and showed interesting optical absorption and emission properties. A polymeric heptazine material was synthesized by thermal decomposition of DCAH.

Extended solids with C 6 N 8 and C 9 N 7 stoichiometry were made through solid state metathesis reactions between trichloroheptazine and either lithium nitride or lithium carbide.
