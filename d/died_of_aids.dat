5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs.

He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he <b>died</b> <b>of</b> <b>AIDS</b> in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of HIV/AIDS on per capita income and education. It ex- plores two {{channels}} from HIV/AIDS to income {{that have not been}} sufficiently stressed by the literature: the reduction of the incentives to study due to shorter expected longevity and the reduction of productivity of experienced workers. In the model individuals live for three periods, may get infected in the second period and with some probability <b>die</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aids</b> before reaching the third period of their life. Parents care for the welfare of the future generations so that they will maximize lifetime utility of their dynasty. The simulations predict that the most affected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa will be in the future, on average, thirty percent poorer than they would be without AIDS. Schooling will decline in some cases by forty percent. These gures are dramatically reduced with widespread medical treatment, as it increases the survival probability and productivity of infected individuals...|$|R

A victim {{of child sexual abuse}} at the hands of her bitterly widowed father, Jenny embarks on a different path from Forrest, leading a self-destructive life and becoming part of the hippie movement in the 1960s and the 1970s/1980s drug culture. She re-enters Forrest's life at various times in adulthood. Jenny eventually becomes a waitress in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives in an apartment with her (and Forrest's) son, Forrest Jr. They eventually get married, but soon afterwards she dies of an unnamed illness, but given the time period, the movie's propensity for showing the major aspects of U.S. culture, and the character's depicted actions during the 60s and 70s, it can be speculated that she <b>died</b> <b>of</b> <b>AIDS</b> or Hepatitis C.|$|E

AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagan's administration, and requests for more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were routinely denied. By {{the end of the}} first 12 months of the epidemic, when more than 1,000 people had <b>died</b> <b>of</b> <b>AIDS</b> in the U.S., the CDC had spent less than $1 million on AIDS research.

5|$|Shilts made {{comparisons}} to the government's disparate {{reaction to the}} Chicago Tylenol murders, and the recent emergence of Legionnaire's Disease in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The New York Times wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case. Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $100million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page. The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia. The National Institute of Health spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who <b>died</b> <b>of</b> <b>AIDS.</b>|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (MW)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Not only in South-Africa, but worldwide, HIVIAIDS is a {{morbidity}} {{that increases}} {{on a daily}} basis. Currently, {{it can be seen}} as the hugest health dilemma in the world. The implications <b>of</b> the <b>Aids</b> pandemic on community structures are distressful. It is estimated that just as many people will <b>die</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aids</b> as from any other cause. A positive HIV test result has an enormous impact on the life of the person. A person's whole life changes the very moment he is informed that he is HIV positive. The person who is diagnosed with HIV as well as the people around him need to make life-changing decisions. These decisions should be made to deal with demands of HIV in an effective manner. According to people with HIVIAIDS from different communities, negative responses from fellow community members have a far more negative impact on them than having to deal with the positive HIV-status itself. It therefore is essential that a supporting environment be established in which in people living with HIVIAIDS can be accepted. To be able to understand and manage the situation better it is necessary to establish which processes made it possible for people to disclose their positive HIVIAIDS-status and what the experience of a person was after disclosure. The study established which processes were present to enable him to disclose and what support systems are necessary for people to disclose a positive HIVIAIDSstatus. A case study was used.

40|$|M. A. (Community Development) The {{statistics}} on HIV/Aids {{in this study}} overwhelm the imagination. It has great social and economical consequences for individuals, families and communities. The generation of between 15 - 24 years are vulnerable to infection especially women. From the population of about 46 million in South Africa, 5. 7 million were HIV positive {{by the end of}} 2007 with about 1000 deaths every day. Sub-Saharan Africa appeared to be the most hit by this tragedy as indicated by statistics in this study. When parents <b>die</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aids,</b> the burden <b>of</b> orphaned children is left with relatives and extended families to look after those children. The number of orphans is escalating due to increasing death rate of parents. A detailed discussion on the extended families which includes their origin, roles they play as well as challenges they face in caring for orphaned children is included as well. Challenges include having to deal with grief and changing behaviour of the orphaned children. The goal {{of this study was to}} conduct an analysis of extended families affected by HIV/Aids taking care of orphans, living in the Kyasands informal settlement in order to improve service delivery. The main objectives of the study included exploring the needs of these extended families caring for orphaned children in terms of social, emotional and material aspects as well as challenges they face and how they manage to survive. A qualitative method was used in conducting this study with the use of semi-structured interviews to collect information. The main central question asked was, how do you manage to live with an additional member within your family. The main findings in this study were reported which included the strength and composition of assets and the extended families’ resources to make a living and adjust to shocks of life. Family was seen as the most trusted asset in this study by the respondents. Just to mention a few, most of the families owned shacks, battery operated radios and televisions since they live in formal settlement without any permanent infrastructures...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) HIV/AIDS {{infection}} is {{becoming one of}} the greatest threats the world has had to face the past century. opinions on the subject vary from doomsday scenarios to those that feel that it will just pass as another storm in a teacup, without having any real effect on society. since the indications are there that it is especially the economically active that are exposed to the infection, top management cannot take the chance of ignoring the issue. Unfortunately this {{seems to be the case}} in South Africa, with the awakening of the new South Africa, new economic and political opportunities are openlng up for the country. Business leaders cannot allow AIDS to jeopardise these opportunities. Because HIV/AIDS can take more than ten years before becoming visible, most societies, firms and even governments are still only paying lip service in dealing with the matter. AIDS has devastating economic consequences for affected individuals and their families. If the experience of other countries, and current trends in south Africa are any indication, there is likely to be increasing discrimination in the work place, resulting in large numbers of those who are HIV positive losing their jobs. The burden on families who have to care for, and bury people <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aids,</b> and consequently those who lose breadwinners, will be enormous. This will be aggravated by unemployment, by inadequate social support services and transfer payments, by discrimination of access to insurance and housing, and by the predicted inability of the health services to offer adequate care to affected individuals, and support of their families. HIV/AIDS is a reality for any work environment. It is therefore of vital importance for management to take cognisance of the important aspects in dealing with the problem. A formal AIDS policy is the only effective solution to prevent discriminatory practices in the workplace. Finally, and most importantly, the AIDS epidemic in south Africa will be a terrible, and enormous human tragedy, through the potentially avoidable loss of hundreds of thousands, and ultimately, millions of lives. In this study, the major implications of AIDS to be considered in company policy, dealing with the AIDS problem in the workplace and in particular the mining industry, are dealt with...|$|R
