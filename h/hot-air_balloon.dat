5|$|Paris was {{the centre}} of an {{explosion}} of philosophic and scientific activity known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and d'Alembert published their Encyclopédie in 1751–52, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a <b>hot-air</b> <b>balloon</b> on 21 November 1783, from the gardens of the Château de la Muette.

5|$|The {{new name}} Vauxhall Gardens, long in popular use, was made {{official}} in 1785. After Boswell's time the admission charge rose steadily: to two shillings in 1792, three-and-sixpence {{in the early}} 19th century, and 4/6 in the 1820s. Season tickets were also sold. Entertainment in this period included <b>hot-air</b> <b>balloon</b> ascents, fireworks, and tightrope walkers. In 1813 there was a fête to celebrate victory at the Battle of Vitoria, and in 1827 the Battle of Waterloo was re-enacted by 1,000 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|A Dongan Charter Parade {{was held}} in 1936 for the 250th anniversary celebrations, {{and as part of}} the ceremonies the United States Congress {{authorized}} the minting of an Albany Charter half dollar coin. Tricentennial celebrations held in 1986 included a re-enactment of the signing and awarding of the charter by Governor Mario Cuomo playing Governor Dongan, and Mayor Thomas Whalen playing Mayor Schuyler. Other events during the tricentennial were fireworks, music, the unveiling of a tricentennial clock, a <b>hot-air</b> <b>balloon</b> lift-off from Lincoln Park, and a cake large enough to feed thousands. Mayors from other Albanys around the world were among the visiting dignitaries who were invited to the ceremonies and given a tour of the city by Mayor Whalen.|$|E

They find Rainbow Dash {{protecting}} a cloud, believing it to be her home of Cloudsdale. They start to give chase, but Rainbow flies away. They quickly use a <b>hot-air</b> <b>balloon,</b> pulled along by Fluttershy, {{to catch up to}} Rainbow. At first, it seems that Rainbow has the upper hand, but as soon as Twilight reminds Fluttershy that if she gets away Discord will win, Fluttershy puts on an enormous burst of speed and the ponies eventually catch Rainbow and manage to tie her down long enough for Twilight to cast her memory spell. The ponies share a hug before remembering that Ponyville is still under Discord's influence.|$|E

5|$|Mad Maxs {{landscape}} {{consists of}} canyons, caves, deserts, and abandoned wastelands. The game's world {{is divided into}} several regions, with each having its own backstory and landscape. Unique landmarks and ruins can be discovered in each region. Side activities such as races, time trials, invading enemy fortresses, and eliminating enemy convoys {{can be found in}} each region. A region's threat level is lowered by completing these activities, facilitating its navigation. Each region has a boss, who can be found and defeated in their base. Some of the game's strongholds are friendly, and eliminating hostile strongholds gives Max additional quests and rewards. These strongholds can be upgraded, offering Max different benefits such as helping Max to collect scraps when the game is turned off, or restoring Max's health and shotgun ammo upon visits. Max can ascend in a <b>hot-air</b> <b>balloon</b> (permanently attached to the ground) to look for new objectives and locations. After seeing the objectives through binoculars, they are highlighted on the map. Max can be guided by Chumbucket in strategically completing his objectives. Max is accompanied by a dog companion called Dinki-Di, who can help players detect land mines. Max has limited climbing abilities, and objects that he can climb are highlighted in yellow.|$|E

25|$|Another former {{landmark}} in South Dunedin was the former Caledonian sports ground. This was located opposite the gasworks {{at the corner}} of Hillside Road and Andersons Bay Road, a site still known as Caledonian Corner. The sports field was relocated to Dunedin North, and the site is now the car park of The Warehouse - all that remains of the original sports complex is a lawn bowls club and the gymnasium, which is also South Dunedin's main war memorial (Hillside Workshops have their own separate memorial by the site's main gate). The Caledonian was the site of the first human ascent in a <b>hot-air</b> <b>balloon</b> in New Zealand — and first parachute descent — performed by travelling showman Thomas Scott Baldwin on 21 January 1889.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{organized}} baseball's earliest historical events {{took place at}} the park throughout the 1860s and early 1870s. The most notable event came on June 14, 1870, when the Atlantics defeated the Cincinnati Red Stockings to end their historic 84-game winning streak. Fred Goldsmith successfully demonstrated his curve ball at the Grounds in 1870, a pitch previously thought to have been only an optical illusion. In an 1865 game, Ned Cuthbert is credited with inventing the slide when he tried avoiding a tag when attempting to steal a base against the Athletic of Philadelphia. In addition to baseball, The Grounds hosted various events and exhibitions; most notably in 1873, when Washington Donaldson and two reporters attempted to fly a <b>hot-air</b> <b>balloon</b> across the Atlantic Ocean. The attempt turned tragic when the balloon crashed in Connecticut killing one of the reporters.|$|E
25|$|The Half-Faced Man deploys {{his escape}} pod — in reality, a <b>hot-air</b> <b>balloon</b> made of human skin—lifting the {{restaurant}} {{into the sky}} with him and the Doctor inside.

The Doctor claims that the Half-Faced Man has replaced his components so many times that he no longer exists in his original form and that he secretly wants to end his existence. He then warns him that he will either have to kill himself, or the Doctor will be forced to kill him to protect the humans. Clara and the Paternoster Gang are nearly overwhelmed by the other robots when they see them go lifeless. The Half-Faced Man is then shown to be impaled on the spire of Big Ben.|$|E
