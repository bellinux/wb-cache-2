5|$|Gnostics read John but {{interpreted}} {{it differently}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> non-Gnostics did. Gnosticism taught that salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics {{did not see}} Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge. Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.|$|E

5|$|Numerous factors {{led to the}} {{evacuation}} of St Kilda. The islands' inhabitants had existed for centuries in relative isolation until tourism {{and the presence of}} the military during the First World War led the islanders to seek alternatives to privations they routinely suffered. The changes made to the island by visitors in the nineteenth century disconnected the islanders <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of life that had allowed their forebears to survive in this unique environment. Despite construction of a small jetty in 1902, the islands remained at the weather's mercy.|$|E

It began on March 15 at the House of Blues in Dallas and concluded on June 8 at Stubb's in Austin, Texas. Some concert dates featured electronic music duo Quadron as an opening act. The tour included performances at music festivals such as South by Southwest and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, for which Saadiq played songs <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> I See It and Stone Rollin, as well as unreleased material.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which the human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E

25|$|Space, as {{an element}} of architecture, was {{utilised}} differently <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{it had been in}} the Middle Ages. Space was organised by proportional logic, its form and rhythm subject to geometry, rather than being created by intuition as in Medieval buildings.

There is also an endemic wild dog, the New Guinea singing dog, Canis lupus hallstromi, that {{is closely related to}} the Australian dingo. It arrived on the island at least 6,000 years ago. Its common name comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> these dogs harmonize during chorus howls. The New Guinea singing dogs live in the remote mountains, above human habitation level, and are the largest land predator.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic {{approach}} to Marian art is quite distinct <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> other Christians (such as the Protestant and the Eastern Orthodox) treat the {{depictions of the}} Virgin Mary. From {{the very beginning of}} the Protestant Reformation its leaders expressed their discomfort with the depictions of saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition of art developed, the depictions of the Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and view it as a Catholic excess.|$|E
25|$|The {{instrument}} has two bridges: {{the large}} bridge (badaa goraa) for the playing and drone strings {{and the small}} bridge (chota goraa) for the sympathetic strings. Its timbre results <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the strings interact with the wide, sloping bridge. As a string reverberates its length changes slightly as its edge touches the bridge, promoting the creation of overtones and giving the sound its distinctive tone. The maintenance of this specific tone by shaping the bridge is called jawari. Many musicians rely on instrument makers to adjust this.|$|E
