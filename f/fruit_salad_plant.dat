40|$|Abstract This work {{aimed to}} study the use of <b>fruit</b> <b>salads</b> as {{carriers}} for Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN 001. We evaluated the viability of this probiotic in <b>fruit</b> <b>salads</b> and the phsyico-chemical, microbiological and sensory properties of this food. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to verify microorganism adhesion on the fruit tissues. The viability of L. rhamnosus in <b>fruit</b> <b>salads</b> was 8. 49 log CFU. g- 1 after 120 hours. SEM images showed that fruit tissue provided protection for probiotic. Adhesion sites were observed in higher quantity in banana, apple and guava. The addition of L. rhamnosus did not alter texture of fruits (p > 0. 05). <b>Fruit</b> <b>salads</b> containing probiotic had different values of pH and acidity compared to the control (p 0. 05). <b>Fruit</b> <b>salads</b> containing L. rhamnosus showed counts of psychotrophic microorganisms of at least 2. 0 log CFU. g- 1 lower than control salad after 120 h of refrigerated storage. The <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> was well accepted by consumers. Therefore, this product {{can be used as}} a carrier for probiotic and an alternative to consuming functional foods...|$|R

50|$|A popular recipe in Guadalajara (Jalisco's largest city) {{was said}} to have {{originated}} from the leftover juices (mainly orange) of an equally popular regional <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> covered with fine chilli powder, usually piquin. As the <b>fruit</b> <b>salad,</b> known to jalisquillos (Guadalajara's natives) as pico de gallo, was consumed from a large bowl during breakfast, the remaining juice was saved and poured on a small and narrow clay cup, which itself would be the precursor of the tequila shot glass. In essence, the recipe of the original sangrita is thought to be that and the same recipe of the <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> from which it was strained. In almost all cases the drink took its bright red color from a mix of the fine pepper powder, spices, and pomegranate, while the base was mainly orange or sweetened lime juice. The key to a balanced sangrita recipe {{can be found in the}} <b>fruit</b> <b>salad's</b> recipes, which would have included any or all of the following: tangerine, cucumber, papaya, mango and jicama.|$|R

40|$|An {{increase}} in the consumption of fruit juices and minimally processed <b>fruits</b> <b>salads</b> has been observed in recent years all over the world. In this work, the microbiological quality of artisan <b>fruit</b> <b>salads</b> was analysed. Faecal coliforms, Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 were not detected; nevertheless, eleven strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated. By multiplex PCR, all isolates showed positive results for S. aureus 16 S rRNA gene and 63. 6 % of them were positive for sea gene. Furthermore, PCR sea positive strains were able to produce the corresponding enterotoxin. Finally, the inactivation of these strains in <b>fruit</b> <b>salads</b> by nisin, lysozyme and EDTA, was studied. EDTA produced a total S. aureus growth inhibition after 60 h of incubation at a concentration of 250 mg/L. The presence of S. aureus might indicate inadequate hygiene conditions during salad elaboration; however, the enterotoxigenicity of the strains isolated in this study, highlights the risk of consumers' intoxication. EDTA {{could be used to}} inhibit the growth of S. aureus in artisan <b>fruit</b> <b>salads</b> and extend the shelf life of these products...|$|R
