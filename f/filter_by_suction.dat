The supernatant solution was decanted and precipitate was <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> <b>suction</b> and the remaining acid residues were removed by well rinsing with hot water. The purified precipitate was then dried by gentle heating at 60 [*]±[*] 1  °C.

Bacterial cells were fixed onto membrane <b>filters</b> <b>by</b> slight <b>suction,</b> treated with 0. 5 N NaOH, and hybridized with these probes. Of 65 Bacteroides strains isolated from 19 human fecal specimens, which were identified as B. fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, B. caccae, B. uniformis, B. stercoris, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, and B. merdae by conventional phenotypic characterization, 62 (95 %) were correctly identified with this hybridization procedure...|$|R
40|$|Two {{modified}} {{designs of}} micro-pore-water samplers were tested for {{their capacity to}} collect unbiased soil solution samples containing zinc and citrate. The samplers had either ceramic or polyethersulfone (PES) suction cups. Laboratory tests of the micro-samplers were conducted using (a) standard solutions with zinc and citrate concentrations {{that can be found}} in the rhizosphere and (b) two soils with contrasting texture. The results showed that both suction cups were inert with respect to citrate and zinc: they did not affect the concentrations of the two ions in freshly prepared and directly sampled standard solutions. Both micro-suction cups removed most microorganisms by filtration, though the PES cups were more effective in this respect. This <b>filtering</b> <b>by</b> the <b>suction</b> cups allowed for relatively accurate analysis of citrate in solutions containing microorganisms. These capacities, together with their small size and small dead volume, make the two micro-pore-water samplers highly suitable for sampling of rhizosphere soil solutions although further testing with other organic acids and trace metals may be needed...|$|R
30|$|The {{synthesis}} of succinic anhydride CHS was previously reported [35]. An amount of 0.5  g pullulan sample was dissolved in 15  mL dehydrated dimethyl sulfoxide for reserve. CHS (sugar unit/CHS[*]=[*] 0.20, 0.15, 0.05  mmol/mmol), 4 -dimethylpyridine (DMAP∕CHS[*]=[*] 1  mmol/mmol), and 1 -(3 -dimethylaminop ropyl)- 3 -ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC∕CHS[*]=[*] 1.2  mmol/mmol) were separately dissolved in 10  mL DMSO, stirred at room temperature, and activated for 1  h; the activation reaction was {{dropped into the}} pullulan solution; and the reaction was stopped after 48  h. The reaction was dropped into 200  mL absolute ethanol, and then a white precipitate formed. <b>Filtering</b> was <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> and the product was washed with appropriate amounts of ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, and diethyl ether and then dried at 80  °C. Three kinds of CHP polymers with different degrees of cholesterol substitution were obtained: CHP- 1, CHP- 2, and CHP- 3 [36]. Pullulan polysaccharide and CHP polymer 10 – 20  mg were dissolved by DMSO-d 6 under ultrasonic conditions, and 1 H NMR spectra were examined. The degree of substitution of cholesterol in the CHP polymer was determined {{on the basis of}} the α- 1, 4 and α- 1, 6 glycosidic bonds and the area under the methylene peak.|$|R
30|$|The ZnFeBONP were {{synthesized}} {{according to}} a co-precipitation method followed by magnetic stirring. First, 4.5  g of ZnCl 2 and 7.4  g of FeCl 3 were added to 300  ml of DW. Then, 35  ml of 1  M NaOH solution {{was added to the}} former solution dropwise. The whole solution is then stirred with magnetic stirrer for 2  h at 60  °C temperature, leading to smaller and more homogenized particles. A brown precipitate quickly formed, which was allowed to crystallize completely for another 30  min. The precipitate was washed with DW by magnetic decantation until the pH of the suspension was less than 7.5. The suspension was <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> means of <b>suction</b> pump, after filtration precipitate was dried at about 100  °C and then crush into powder and use for further study.|$|R
30|$|The {{final product}} was {{prepared}} by dissolving {{a gram of}} glucose {{in a mixture of}} acetic acid (3  ml), water (2  ml), and methanol (50  ml). Afterwards, an equimolar amount of 2, 4 -dnitrophenylhydrazine (1.2  g) was added to the reaction vessel and the mixture was refluxed for an hour. The vessel content was cooled and then poured onto acidified water (200  ml). Subsequently, the product was extracted three times by 10 % ethanol in ethyl acetate (100  ml each) and dried by using anhydrous sodium sulfate. The organic layer was <b>filtered</b> and contracted <b>by</b> removing {{more than two-thirds of the}} ethyl acetate content with aid of Rotavapor (60  °C). The concentrated solution was left for 24  h to gradually precipitate, and product crystals were then <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> a <b>suction</b> <b>filter</b> and allowed to stand to be completely dried over the bench. Retention factor (R.f) value was determined on TLC using solvent system of chloroform and methanol (8 : 2). The R.f value of resultant product was 0.48 compared with 0.88 of 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl hydrazine reactant. The melting point of product was 116 – 122 ° which agrees with the reported melting point of 118 – 122 ° (Gerees et al. 1962; Glaser and Zuckermann 1927). Solutions of 20  mg% were prepared from the product crystals in plasma (pH[*]=[*] 7.3), basic (0.1  M NaOH, pH[*]=[*] 13), acidic (0.1  M HCL, pH[*]=[*] 1), and neutral media (water). Samples of 1  ml were withdrawn from each solution each day and up to 10  days to study the stability of the product. Each sample was diluted five times with mobile phase prior to HPLC injection. The structure details of the product were characterized by NMR (1 D and 2 D) and X-ray analysis.|$|R

30|$|Our banding {{ligation}} method can {{be employed}} for both bleeding sessile or pedunculated gastric polyps. Sessile polyps are often difficult to be captured by traditional electrocautery polypectomy. Although endoscopic mucosal resection with cap-fitted panendoscopy may capture the lesions <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> bleeding is a possible serious complication following the procedure (Inoue et al. 1993), especially in patients with bleeding tendency. In this situation, banding ligation of the lesions is possibly a good choice because {{it is easy to}} aspirate the polyps <b>by</b> <b>suction,</b> and the avoidance of resection procedure might decrease the risk of bleeding. In this reported case, 3  ml of distilled water was injected into the base of the bleeding polyp to lift the lesion off the muscle layer. Additionally, submucosal injection before banding ligation could compress the vessels in the submucosal layer and was possibly beneficial for preventing bleeding.|$|R
