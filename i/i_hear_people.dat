In an interview with the New York Daily News, Jane Krakowski, who portrays Jenna Maroney, revealed [...] "Some of the great catchphrases of 30 Rock have come from Alice. Like, 'I want to go [...] there!'– that's Alice. It's so funny because <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> say it on the street, and that was [...] daughter!" ...|$|E
500|$|Other issues {{included}} the studio's desire to substitute Montreal or Prague for Paris {{in order to}} lower costs, Liman's insistence {{on the use of}} a French-speaking film crew, and poor test audience reactions to the film's Paris finale. The latter required a late return to location in order to shoot a new, more action-oriented conclusion to the Paris story arc. In addition to Paris, filming took place in Prague, Imperia, Rome, Mykonos, and Zürich; several scenes set in Zürich were also filmed in Prague. Damon described the production as a struggle, citing the early conflicts that he and Liman had with the studio, but denied that it was an overtly difficult process, stating, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> saying that the production was a nightmare it's like, a 'nightmare'? Shooting's always hard, but we finished." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chris Carle of IGN said: [...] "One Tree Hill, like The O.C. {{is helping}} to infuse network {{television}} with a much-needed renaissance of teen drama. The series is a bit less fun and more dramatic than Fox's, and the themes and storylines hold a little more gravity than The O.C.'s sometimes soap opera dynamic, but it's a solid show." [...] Keith Helinski of Moviefreak.com disagreed with The O.C. comparisons, stating, [...] "Ever so often <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> refer to the show as The WB's version of The O.C., but I disagree. Summerland is more like The O.C. with similar scenarios and settings, while One Tree Hill is more suited as a Dawson's Creek knock off." [...] He added, [...] "In fact, story lines, characters, and even the themes are so similar that one would think One Tree Hill is like Dawson's Creek: The Next Generation." ...|$|E

I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> a PLUNKETY-PLUNK, PLUNKETY-PLUNK, and says to myself, horses coming; and next <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>people's</b> voices. <b>I</b> got {{everything}} into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out.

Ordinary life there in a hot cantonment must be pretty dull, though, from what <b>I</b> <b>hear,</b> <b>people</b> enjoy it much more than you would think possible.

6000|$|When {{the seven}} free Arts {{on which the}} old Universities were based came to be {{modified}} a little, {{in order to be}} convenient for or to promote the wants of modern society--though, perhaps, some of them are obsolete enough even yet for some of us--there arose a feeling that mere vocality, mere culture of speech, if that is what comes out of a man, though he may be a great speaker, an eloquent orator, yet there is no real substance there--if that is what was required and aimed at by the man himself, and by the community that set him upon becoming a learned man. Maid-servants, <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> complaining, are getting instructed in the [...] "ologies," [...] and so on, and are apparently totally ignorant of brewing, boiling, and baking (laughter); above all things, not taught what is necessary to be known, from the highest to the lowest--strict obedience, humility, and correct moral conduct.

60|$|December 7.--Being a blank {{day in the}} rolls, I {{stayed at}} home and wrote four leaves--not very freely or happily; I {{was not in the}} vein. Plague on it! Stayed at home the whole day. There is one thing I believe {{peculiar}} to me--I work, that is, meditate for the purpose of working, best, when I have a quasi engagement with some other book for example. When I find myself doing ill, or like to come to a stand-still in writing, I take up some slight book, a novel or the like, and usually have not read far ere my difficulties are removed, and I am ready to write again. There must be two currents of ideas going on in my mind at the same time,[89] or perhaps the slighter occupation serves like a woman's wheel or stocking to ballast the mind, as it were, by preventing the thoughts from wandering, and so give the deeper current the power to flow undisturbed. I always laugh when <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> say, Do one thing at once. I have done a dozen things at once all my life. Dined with the family. After dinner Lockhart's proofs came in and occupied me for the evening. I wish I have not made that article too long, and Lockhart will not snip away.|$|E
60|$|Thus I {{came out}} of the contest a loser, but as a {{compensation}} had the knowledge that my physicians were false prophets; that, barring accidents, I could count on thirty, forty, even fifty years with their summers and autumns and winters. And that was the life I desired-- the life the heart can conceive--the earth life. When <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>people</b> say they have not found the world and life so agreeable or interesting as to be in love with it, or that they look with equanimity to its end, I am apt to think they have never been properly alive nor seen with clear vision the world they think so meanly of, or anything in it--not a blade of grass. Only I know that mine is an exceptional case, that the visible world is to me more beautiful and interesting than to most persons, that the delight I experienced in my communing with Nature did not pass away, leaving nothing but a recollection of vanished happiness to intensify a present pain. The happiness was never lost, but owing to that faculty I have spoken of, had a cumulative effect on the mind and was mine again, so that in my worst times, when I was compelled to exist shut out from Nature in London for long periods, sick and poor and friendless, I could yet always feel that it was infinitely better to be than not to be.|$|E
