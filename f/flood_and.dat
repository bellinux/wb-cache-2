40|$|Summary Coastal {{wetlands}} of {{the southeastern}} United States are threatened by increases in <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity {{as a result of}} both natural processes and man-induced hydrologic alterations. Furthermore, global climate change scenarios sug-gest that, as a consequence of rising sea levels, much larger areas of coastal wetlands may be affected by <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity in the next 50 to 100 years. In this paper, we review studies designed to improve our ability to predict and amelio-rate the impacts of increased <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity stress on baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.), which is a domi-nant species of many coastal forested wetlands. Specifically, we review studies on species-level responses to <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity stress, alone and in combination, we summarize two studies on intraspecific variation in response to <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity stress, we analyze the physiological mechanisms thought to be responsible for the interaction between <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> salinity stress, and we discuss the implications for coastal wetland loss and the prospects for developing salt-tolerant lines of baldcypress...|$|R

5|$|According to Kaneko, {{the reason}} for {{choosing}} the Judeo-Christian god, YHVH, as the game's antagonist, was that he saw YHVH as the base for all other gods around the world: Having observed common motives throughout different mythologies, such as the <b>flood</b> <b>and</b> {{the creation of the}} world, he reasoned that they all originated in one single mythology, which had been changed as people took it with them, leading to modern-day myths. He thought the original mythology would be the Old Testament, and therefore considered YHVH the folkloristic base of all gods. Despite casting YHVH as the antagonist, Kaneko noted that he did not intend for YHVH to be evil incarnate in Megami Tensei.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Debris flows form {{deposits}} {{when they}} reach an alluvial fan until they eventually stop. However, houses located in the alluvial fan might affect the debris flow <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> deposition processes. Few previous studies have considered the effects of houses on debris flow <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> deposition. This study conducted model experiments and numerical simulations using the Kanako 2 D debris flow simulator to {{determine the influence of}} houses on debris flow <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> deposition. The model experiments showed that when houses are present, the debris flow spreads widely in the cross direction immediately upstream of the houses, especially when the flow discharge is large or the grain size is small. Houses located in the alluvial fan also influence the deposition area. The presence of houses led to <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> deposition damage in some places and reduced the damage in others. The simulation also demonstrated the influence of houses. Both the model experiment and the simulation showed that houses change the <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> deposition areas...|$|R

5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can <b>flood</b> <b>and</b> severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water repellent. In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas are more prone to flooding. Instructions on controlling erosion through outreach are also provided by telephone or the internet.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from Freeport, Texas to the United States/Mexico border; at the same time, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch southward to Rio San Fernando. Shortly before attaining tropical storm status, the watch in Texas was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. Late on August 15, the warning was extended to San Luis Pass, while the watch in Mexico was discontinued. As Erin made landfall, the warning was canceled, and several flood watches and warnings were issued for counties across southeastern Texas. Upon moving into Oklahoma, <b>flood</b> <b>and</b> flash flood warnings were issued for several counties.|$|E
5|$|In 1549 a {{grammar school}} was opened (closing again in 1739), and in 1561 Skagen's first {{lighthouse}} was constructed. In 1568, some 350 fishing boats and merchant ships were wrecked {{off the coast}} of Skagen. In the 1590s, successive storms led not only to numerous drownings but to flooding, destroying many of the houses. In 1591, 22 died in a <b>flood</b> <b>and</b> in 1593, 14 houses were washed away. In 1595, 25 farms in the area were covered in drifting sand. As a result, new housing was built in Østerby to the north east, away from the rapidly accumulating sand.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{frequency}} of droughts has been increasing in Southern Africa. In {{areas such as the}} middle Zambezi Valleyâ€™s Manyame catchment, Zimbabwe, floods are also a frequent occurrence. Increase in {{the frequency}} of drought <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> is partly linked to climate change. <b>Floods</b> <b>and</b> droughts negatively impact on livelihoods of the poor. Both drought <b>and</b> <b>floods</b> reduce crop yields and can also affect livestock, which are the main sources of livelihood in the catchment. In response to these climatic events, governments within Southern Africa have formulated policies which try to mitigate the impacts of droughts <b>and</b> <b>floods.</b> This study analyses the institutional mechanisms at the local and national level which try to mitigate the impact of <b>floods</b> <b>and</b> droughts. The study employed focus group discussions, key informant in-depth interviews, and semi structured household interviews to gather primary data. Secondary data sources such as policy and legislation documents and operational manuals were also reviewed. Data analysis was done using a thematic approach and social network analysis using UCINET 6. Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS 13. 0. The study found that the institutional framework that has been developed at the national and local level to support communities in the study area in response to the impacts of <b>floods</b> <b>and</b> droughts comprises mainly of National Civil Protection Policy, National Policy on Drought Management, Civil Protection Act of 1989 complemented by sector legislations, Civil Protection Organisation and traditional institutions. The study found that the institutional framework does not effectively strengthen disaster management mechanisms in Kanyemba. Local institutional structures in Kanyemba lack material, financial, and appropriate training and skills to undertake <b>floods</b> <b>and</b> drought management activities to effectively mitigate the impacts of <b>floods</b> <b>and</b> drought. There are inadequate observatories in Kanyemba for monitoring meteorological and hydrological conditions to accurately forecast <b>floods</b> <b>and</b> drought. In addition the community has difficulties accessing <b>floods</b> <b>and</b> drought early warning in time due inadequate communication systems. The study concludes that the capability of the institutional framework in Kanyemba to effectively support community management of <b>floods</b> <b>and</b> drought is limited.,WATERne...|$|R

40|$|Background: Malaria is {{a highly}} climate-sensitive vector-borne {{infectious}} disease that still represents a significant public health problem in Huaihe River Basin. However, little comprehensive information about the burden of malaria caused by <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> waterlogging is available from this region. This study aims to quantitatively {{assess the impact of}} <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> waterlogging on the burden of malaria in a county of Anhui Province, China. Methods: A mixed method evaluation was conducted. A case-crossover study was firstly performed to evaluate the relationship between daily number of cases of malaria <b>and</b> <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> waterlogging from May to October 2007 in Mengcheng County, China. Stratified Cox models were used to examine the lagged time and hazard ratios (HRs) of the risk of <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> waterlogging on malaria. Years lived with disability (YLDs) of malaria attributable to <b>flooding</b> <b>and</b> waterlogging were then estimated based on the WHO framework of calculating potential impact fraction in the Global Burden of Disease study.

5|$|The July 26, 1977, USCG Marine Casualty Report {{suggested}} that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures. The report concluded that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, Fitzgerald plummeted to the bottom without warning. Video footage of the wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened. As a result, ineffective hatch closure caused Fitzgerald to <b>flood</b> <b>and</b> founder.|$|E
