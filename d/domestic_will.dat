It states that unused domestic {{property is}} to be considered domestic if it appears that will be the next use.

It is possible for a hereditament to be both non-domestic and domestic in different parts, for example a shop with living accommodation. This is known as a composite hereditament, and the whole property is entered in the rating list, but the non-domestic valuation is based on the non-domestic part only.|$|E

Forgive me, if, in love to you, I see more fully than your noble heart permits you to do, the inextricable difficulties with which you are surrounded. You are strong, my lord, and powerful; yet, let me say it without offence, you are so only by the reflected light of the Queen's favour. While you are Elizabeth's favourite, you are all, save in name, like an actual sovereign. But let her call back the honours she has bestowed, and the prophet's gourd did not wither more suddenly. Declare against the Queen, and I do not {{say that in the}} wide nation, or in this province alone, you would find yourself instantly deserted and outnumbered; but I will say, that even in this very Castle, {{and in the midst of}} your vassals, kinsmen, and dependants, you would be a captive, nay, a sentenced captive, should she please to say the word. Think upon Norfolk, my lord--upon the powerful Northumberland--the splendid Westmoreland;--think on all who have made head against this sage Princess. They are dead, captive, or fugitive. This is not like other thrones, which can be overturned by a combination of powerful nobles; the broad foundations which support it are in the extended love and affections of the people. You might share it with Elizabeth if you would; but neither yours, nor any other power, foreign or <b>domestic,</b> <b>will</b> avail to overthrow, or even to shake it." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{my belief}} that social {{intercourse}} cannot long continue what it has been, {{now that we have}} subtracted from it so important and vivifying an element as firelight. The effects will be more perceptible on our children and the generations that shall succeed them than on ourselves, the mechanism of whose life may remain unchanged, though its spirit be far other than it was. The sacred trust of the household fire has been transmitted in unbroken succession from the earliest ages, and faithfully cherished in spite of every discouragement such as the curfew law of the Norman conquerors, until in these evil days physical science has nearly succeeded in extinguishing it. But we at least have our youthful recollections tinged with the glow of the hearth, and our life-long habits and associations arranged on the principle of a mutual bond in the domestic fire. Therefore, though the sociable friend be forever departed, yet in a degree he will be spiritually present with us; and still more will the empty forms which were once full of his rejoicing presence continue to rule our manners. We shall draw our chairs together as we and our forefathers have been wont for thousands of years back, and sit around some blank and empty corner of the room, babbling with unreal cheerfulness of topics suitable to the homely fireside. A warmth from the past--from the ashes of bygone years and the raked-up embers of long ago--will sometimes thaw the ice about our hearts; but it must be otherwise with our successors. On the most favorable supposition, they will be acquainted with the fireside in no better shape than that of the sullen stove; and more probably they will have grown up amid furnace heat in houses which might be fancied to have their foundation over the infernal pit, whence sulphurous steams and unbreathable exhalations ascend through the apertures of the floor. There will be nothing to attract these poor children to one centre. They will never behold one another through that peculiar medium of vision the ruddy gleam of blazing wood or bituminous coal---which gives the human spirit so deep an insight into its fellows and melts all humanity into one cordial heart of hearts. Domestic life, if it may still be termed <b>domestic,</b> <b>will</b> seek its separate corners, and never gather itself into groups. The easy gossip; the merry yet unambitious Jest; the life-like, practical discussion of real matters in a casual way; the soul of truth which is so often incarnated in a simple fireside word,--will disappear from earth. Conversation will contract the air of debate, and all mortal intercourse be chilled with a fatal frost.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} {{a comparative}} {{assessment of the}} development of competition in Botswana, Ethiopia and Nigeria. These three African countries have all sought to introduce domestic competition law since 2000. The paper identifies the different factors that have contributed to the relative success in introducing competition law in Botswana, as compared to both the Nigerian and Ethiopian experience. The paper highlights the significance of both domestic and external factors in nurturing competition and good economic governance. It concludes that effective enforcement of competition law is founded on both internal and international dynamics. While <b>domestic</b> <b>will</b> for competition is a necessary precondition, the case of Botswana indicates how domestic reforms needed to be buttressed by capacity building and expertise from external sources, for the betterment of markets, producers and consumers...|$|E

40|$|In Red Work, Rachael {{records and}} celebrates {{the joys and}} frustrations of {{everyday}} family life in new large-scale work inspired by 19 th century redwork story quilts – for her, the Instagram of their day. Red Work : Rachael Howard – Exhibition Funding Award Waterside Arts Centre has been awarded £ 13, 400 from Arts council England’s Grants for the Arts scheme {{to develop a new}} exhibition project. Red Work is a solo exhibition by textile artist Rachael Howard, curated by Jenny Waterson, that will showcase how Rachael innovates, mixing traditional craft techniques with digital printing, combining her signature figurative sketches with spontaneous mark-making and found drawings. Rachael's artworks will be further enhanced with 'sound labels' developed for the exhibition by sound artist Nigel Piper. The exhibition explores the shared joys and frustrations of daily life and takes inspiration from traditional story quilts from the 1800 s which depict everyday stories of domestic life, including family and local events. Visitors will engage with the work via sound labels and communal drawing events and social media. The project will create routes for artist development - through an artist's talk and workshop, an exhibition catalogue, development activities for curators - and for the public - through a Big Draw event led by Rachael to create a community artwork to exhibit in the show. The exhibition will be shown in Waterside’s Lauriston Gallery and will run in Autumn 2014, to coincide with the Big Draw project and as part of activities for Waterside’s 10 th year in operation. Following its run at Waterside, Digital <b>Domestic</b> <b>will</b> then transfer to the Williamson Museum & Art Gallery on The Wirral, which is also contributing £ 2000 towards the project’s development...|$|E
40|$|Low-income {{countries}} have two constraints in financing their economic development (theory of two-gap model). First, {{they do not}} have sufficient domestic savings to finance the investments required to achieve the targeted economic growth. Secondly, they have low foreign exchange earnings to finance the import of raw materials and capital goods needed in investment. These problems portray the needs for financing to cover the two-gap, the financing could come from domestic debt or foreign debt. As a developing country, Indonesia is one of the countries that still rely on loans / debt, both domestic and foreign to finance their development. The development process which is carried out to pursue economic growth with the help of financing through debt to cover these two constraints can make the government have sufficient fiscal capacity to boost development. Theoretically, good debt management (foreign and <b>domestic)</b> <b>will</b> support higher economic growth and improve people's welfare. However, debts that are not allocated and managed properly will cause problems {{in the form of a}} very high burden of payment, here's debt no longer be supporting economic growth instead they become a source of threat to macroeconomic stability, be it through the pressure of fiscal deficits, unequal social distribution in the state budget as well as the pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The question to answer in this article is whether Indonesian debt today has been well managed and provide support for economic growth and improve people's welfare ? or in the language of revenue and expenditure management, has the debt become a profitable alternative financing or a fiscal burden? The Indonesian government's debt stock is quite worrying reaching 2. 843, 25 trillion rupiah, the extent to which the government can manage the debt so that the Fiscal Sustainability can be achieved, whether there is space and opportunity for the government to address fiscal pressures, and whether the government in the implementation of the policy framework has managed debt properly?
