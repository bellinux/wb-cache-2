40|$|In 2006, China's National Bureau of Statistics {{undertook}} a benchmark revision of national income and product accounts statistics {{based on the}} findings of the 2004 economic census.

Second, at the national level, economy-wide as well as sectoral nominal values were revised but real growth rates of some sectors remained unchanged. That is not plausible, and implies that at least the secondary sector real growth rates are erroneous.
