5000|$|The {{first model}} was the four-door sedan in the trims [...] "Especial" [...] (Special) and [...] "Luxo" [...] (Deluxe). Its {{attractive}} lines used curvy {{lines from the}} windscreen to rear fender, a styling practice that {{was referred to as}} [...] "Coke Bottle styling", already in use at the time on the sporty 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird and the 1968 Chevrolet Corvette, among numerous others, but hints of the upcoming style were already clear on the more [...] "family"-oriented 1965 Chevrolet Impala fastback coup√©. A hardtop coupe was also offered with a silhouette resembling the first-generation Camaro/Firebird. The round headlamps (not squared, as in the Opel Rekord and Commodore), egg-crate grille, styling cues borrowed from the 1968 Chevy II Nova, and lamps fitted below the front bumper separated the Opala from its European Opel siblings. In the back, a chrome strip with [...] "Chevrolet" [...] in black was included with the more expensive trim. Small rectangular taillights (similar to those on America's 1967 Chevelle) were mounted on the tip of the rear overhang, and small reverse lights were mounted in the rear bumper, just below the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>cap.</b> An [...] "Opala" [...] badge (spelled in a similar font to the American Chevrolet Impala badge) was fitted on the rear fenders, and the engine badges signifying the displacement of the engine in cubic centimeters (2500 or 3800, later 4100 as well) was placed next to the front doors. Chrome hubcaps complemented the whitewall tires.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} section of the journey through the {{rainforest}} (which took three days), they were forced to make a route by slashing undergrowth and travelling along logging trails, encountering snakes and insects, and coping with the heat; Hammond suffered a poor first night, thanks to his phobia of insects. During the second day, several fan blades were broken off Clarkson's engine, which led to him cutting holes in the bonnet for additional ventilation this resulted in the roof of Hammond's Toyota catching fire. When the group encountered a small, steep gully, Clarkson tried to drive across, but failed and got his Rover stuck. May tried to winch him out, but ended up pulling his own vehicle into the gully, so Hammond had to winch both back to the starting point. Using the chainsaw and some rope, they made a bridge out of the trunks of four young trees to complete the crossing. For the third day, the cars had to undergo some minor modifications to cross a river, including non-standard use of certain products: Clarkson used Tampax tampons to waterproof his <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>cap,</b> and Vaseline and Durex condoms were used to waterproof various parts of the engines. Hammond got through the river without problems, but Clarkson stalled, and May promptly got stuck after driving round. As Hammond was winching May out, Clarkson got his car started without any problems, which seriously annoyed May. After journeying out of the rainforest, the group finally found a road, though both Hammond and May suffered from their vehicles' poor ride a few minutes later.|$|E
40|$|Known {{handling}} {{units are}} designed as headers which travel on a gantry crane for the filling process. The filling nozzle and the filling tube {{are attached to}} the header, the filling tube is pulled out of the header for filling and inserted in the fuel tank filler neck. If the vehicle moves while the filling tube is approached and inserted, there is a risk that the filling tube no longer enters into the filler neck. In order to introduce the filling tube easily into the filler neck of the vehicle, the handling unit is fitted with a docking element to which a position detector is assigned; the position detector is connected to a control unit on the handling unit. Before inserting the filling tube into the filler neck, the docking element is docked onto the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> <b>cap.</b> The docking element can be guided precisely to the tank cap and attached to it by means of the position detector. The handling unit is also suitable if there are relative movements between the vehicle and the unit while t he filling tube is approached...|$|E

5000|$|For 1936, at the 29th Paris Motor Show, in October 1935, various {{modifications}} were on show. [...] At {{the front}} painted front grilles replaced chrome ones and the headlight covers were restyled. [...] The {{changes at the}} back were more practical and involved an opening luggage hatch/lid: {{it was no longer}} necessary to clamber over the back seats to get at the luggage space {{at the rear of the}} passenger cabin (although the overall size of the luggage locker remained at this stage rather restricted). [...] The opening boot/trunk lid made it necessary to reposition the rear-license plate, previously under most circumstances centrally mounted just above the bumper, and now mounted on the rear-wing on the left side. [...] On the original cars it had been possible to access the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> using <b>capped</b> filler openings on either side, but now the left fuel filler cap was removed, and filling the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> had to be done using the filler on the right side.

In order to understand and improve the crashworthiness of the soft <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> of helicopter during the crash, this paper investigated the dynamic behavior of the nylon woven fabric composite <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> striking on the ground. A fluid‚Äìstructure interaction finite element model of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> based on the arbitrary Lagrangian‚ÄìEulerian method was constructed to elucidate the dynamic failure behavior. The drop impact tests were conducted to validate the accuracy of the numerical simulation.

The influences of the impact velocity, the impact angle, the thickness of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> wall and the volume fraction of water on the dynamic responses of the dropped <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> were studied.
