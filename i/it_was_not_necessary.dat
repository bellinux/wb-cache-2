5|$|In 1947, at age 17, Armstrong began {{studying}} aeronautical engineering at Purdue University. He {{was the second}} person in his family to attend college. He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The only engineer he knew (who had attended MIT) dissuaded him from attending, telling Armstrong that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to go all the}} way to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a good education.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 also {{introduced}} section8B(2), {{which is an}} ouster clause providing that no judicial review of orders made under the ISA shall be available save in relation to questions relating to the procedural requirements of the ISA. In Teo Soh Lung, the Court of Appeal held that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for it to decide if the subjective test in Lee Mau Seng precluded judicial review in the case. Hence, the position remains to be confirmed by the courts. In addition, the Court {{decided that it was}} unnecessary to consider the effect of section8B(2) on issues not related to national security and the constitutionality of the 1989 amendments to the ISA.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to delve into {{the validity of the}} conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{stretched}} the traditionally ceremonial position of Germany’s president to reach across political, national, and age boundaries {{to address a}} wide range of controversial issues. He is credited with being largely responsible for taking the lead on an asylum policy overhaul after the arson attack by neo-Nazis in Mölln, in which three Turkish citizens died in 1993. He also earned recognition at home and abroad for attending memorial services for the victims of neo-Nazi attacks in Mölln and Solingen. The services were snubbed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who dismayed many Germans by saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for the government to send a representative.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast {{and the federal government}} did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E

5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E
5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The Final Chapter because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to The Final Chapter, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The Final Chapter.|$|E

The Court of Appeal also rejected that there would have been any breach of a term of good faith.|$|E

25|$|While the {{government}} had a sufficient objective for infringing the right, namely working with the US cooperatively to fight crime and to keep {{good relations with the}} US, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to risk execution for these objectives to be met. Asking that the death penalty should not be sought should not hurt relations with the US because the extradition treaty allows for this. There was also a concern about keeping dangerous criminals out of Canada, but the Court replied that criminals might not find extradition with the risk of a life sentence more attractive than the risk of execution, and thus it was not proven criminals would flee to Canada.|$|E

25|$|Alan Turing, who {{had written}} a {{memorandum}} to OP-20-G (probably in 1941), was seconded to the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington in December 1942, because of his exceptionally wide knowledge about the bombes and the methods of their use. He was asked {{to look at the}} bombes that were being built by NCR and at the security of certain speech cipher equipment under development at Bell Labs. He visited OP-20-G, and went to NCR in Dayton on the 21 December. He was able to show that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to build 336 Bombes, one for each possible rotor order, by utilising techniques such as Banburismus. The initial order was scaled down to 96 machines.|$|E
25|$|The south town, Al-Binya, called Villa Nueva ("new town") by the Spaniards, {{was built}} by the Merinids of Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq in 1285. It was on a plateau that had once held the {{industrial}} neighborhood of Iulia Traducta, the Roman Algeciras. The steepness of its perimeter helped its defense, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to build such strong defenses {{as those of the}} Villa Vieja. The Villa Nueva housed the fortress and the troops who had been established in the city. Algeciras had about eight hundred horsemen and twelve thousand crossbowmen and archers, with a total population of thirty thousand people, according to information from captives given to the King of Castile {{in the early days of}} the siege.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of reciprocity, if one side is allowed to {{cross-examine}} his legal opponent at a hearing, the other party must also be given the same opportunity. In addition, when a tribunal decides a case on a basis not raised or contemplated by the parties, or decides it without regarding the submissions and arguments made by the parties on the issues, this will amount to a breach of natural justice. However, a genuine bona fide mistake by an adjudicator in omitting to state reasons for not considering a submission {{is not enough to}} be a breach of natural justice. This may occur when the submissions were accidentally omitted, or were so unconvincing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to explicitly state the adjudicator's findings.|$|E

Francisco then ordered his head boatman, Tiburcio de los Santos, and several of his men to deliver the lighters and boats to the Charleston early in the morning. The two brothers got into their buggy and started for Agana. On the road home they met several soldiers who were struggling with two small artillery pieces which had been turned back by Captain Duarte since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to salute the American cruiser.|$|E
25|$|Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661 (1994), is a United States Supreme Court case {{concerning}} the First Amendment rights of public {{employees in the}} workplace. By a 7–2 margin the justices held that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to determine what a nurse at a public hospital had actually said while criticizing a supervisor's staffing practices to coworkers, {{as long as the}} hospital had formed a reasonable belief as to the content of her remarks and reasonably believed that they could be disruptive to its operations. They vacated a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in her favor, and ordered the case remanded to district court to determine instead if the nurse had been fired for the speech or other reasons, per the Court's ruling two decades prior in Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April Medici {{explained}} to Montalto {{all that had}} been done, and advised him as to how affairs should be conducted. D'Este met with Farnese, who believed that Montalto had no voting strength, and managed to further misdirect him. During a meeting in the Pauline Chapel, d' Este recruited Guastavillani, the Cardinal Camerlengo; Giambattista Castagna, the Cardinal of San Marcello; and Francesco Sforza. When the cardinals finally assembled in the Sistine Chapel, d' Este declared that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to proceed to a ballot, since it was obvious who the new pope was. Without opposition the cardinals proceeded to do hommage ('adoration') to Felice Cardinal Peretti though, immediately afterwards, a vote was conducted by asking each cardinal to cast his vote aloud. The vote was unanimous. Cardinal François de Joyeuse arrived in Rome too late {{to participate in the}} Conclave.|$|E
