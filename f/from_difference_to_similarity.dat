40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present article is to analyse the {{suitability}} of employing travel insurance policies terms and conditions {{in the context of a}} specialised translation course at university level so as to develop translator professional competences. Instead of carrying out a text selection based only on experience, tradition or intuition, which are frequent criteria to include text types in the syllabus of this kind of courses, we present a study based on an ad hoc bilingual comparable corpus consisting of original travel insurance policies in Spanish and Italian. By means of this study we justify our selection and highlight the specific features of this kind of hybrid and legally-binding documents, which provide benefits if used as training materials in a specialised translation course. Thanks to these specific features, travel insurance policies provide students with suitable material to work on language and culture divergences and similarities in a cross-cultural environment and to practice different translation strategies in order to solve possible translation problems. By using this kind of material in a specialised translation course, the focus of translators-to-be could be shifted <b>from</b> <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> <b>similarities.</b> This would help trainees acknowledge that different realities designated by different languages are undergoing a progressive convergence due to the expansion of tourism as an increasingly transcultural market sector and would enhance their self-perception of their role as transculturally-aware communication specialists...|$|R

40|$|Past {{work has}} argued that {{comparison}} mindsets affect stereotyping: perceivers in a difference mindset stereotype less than those in a similarity mindset, contrasting their judgments of an individual away from their representation of the group. Here, we argue that the self can also act as a reference point, implying {{that the impact of}} comparison mindsets depends on what is focal. In two studies manipulating comparison mindsets and activated representations, we find support for our claims that a <b>difference</b> (compared <b>to</b> <b>similarity)</b> mindset leads <b>to</b> less stereotyping and greater social projection when group representations are focal but to more stereotyping and less projection when self representations are focal. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The main conclusion is that the differences in innovation activities come <b>from</b> <b>differences</b> in development levels. Similarities in innovation activities come from a strong convergence in the CEECs with the features of the innovation process in market economies.

Based on the experimental results, the proposed similarity measures significantly improve the prediction accuracy with respect <b>to</b> existing <b>similarity</b> measures, and we confirmed that the proposed measure is robust to sparse data sets.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate preschool and elementary school educators’ perceptions of the similarities of and differences between the two types of settings and their perceptions of how preschool-elementary collaborations could facilitate young children’s transition to kindergarten. Twelve early childhood educators from elementary and preschool settings were interviewed. All educators saw more <b>differences</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>similarities</b> between the two settings. For example, they viewed elementary school as more focused on academic domains. Educators noted that the elementary school curriculum and flow of day was generally more structured, and that preschools tended to promote greater family engagement. Participants suggested that by engaging in joint activity together, these two groups of educators could learn about each others' institutions and find ways to facilitate kindergarten transition. U.

The production of hierarchies in the arenas of governance is discussed, defending {{the hypothesis that the}} shift <b>from</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> inequality is the result of practices of justification that consolidate the sovereignty of technical competence in environmental management. Some of the more significant findings of studies about the structure and functioning of River Basin Committees in different regions of the country are taken as reference for this discussion. Based on these findings, we discuss the discursive production of the Committees, the authority of the agents that embody the new principles of management, and the implications of the process of scientification of the politics. The article concludes by pointing out the importance of diversity in {{the construction of a new}} narrative of environmental governance...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present an}} {{implementation}} of the signal theory-based approach for detection of novel types of DNA similarity {{which are based on}} physical properties of DNA. Systematic study of the sensitivity of the new similarity measure revealed qualitative <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> letter-based <b>similarity.</b> A variety of physical parameters of DNA double strands, which in a straightforward way reflect different kinds of information hidden behind the primary structure of DNA, showed a wide range of recognition power of the signal similarity measure. We applied the novel DNA similarity measure for the analysis of promoters of E. coli genes. We found that promoter similarities revealed by our approach correlate with their transcription regulatory responsivenesses to different antibiotic and osmotic treatments. Accelerated by special hardware for fast Fourier transformations, the method is easily applicable for the analysis of entire eukaryotic genomes in minutes...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to learning and tracking arbitrary image features is presented. Tracking is tackled by learning the mapping <b>from</b> image intensity <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> displacements. Linear regression is used, resulting in low computational cost. An appearance model of the target is built on-the-fly by clustering sub-sampled image templates. The medoidshift algorithm is used to cluster the templates thus identifying various modes or aspects of the target appearance, each mode is associated to the most suitable set of linear predictors allowing piecewise linear regression <b>from</b> image intensity <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> warp updates. Despite no hard-coding or offline learning, excellent results are shown on three publicly available video sequences and comparisons with related approaches made. ...|$|R
