40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{is becoming}} an increasingly viable source of low cost computing power for developers and users in diverse areas. Services from the creation of presentations, spreadsheets and text processing, to picture and video editing, and more recently high performance scientific computing are some examples of systems currently available in the cloud. While these applications are typically executed {{in the form of}} batch jobs, responsiveness or timeliness is not usually an issue. Executing <b>interactive</b> <b>applications,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> applications that require real time responsiveness in the cloud, however, is more challenging and still not so common in this environment. This work proposes and evaluates the feasibility of building a simple off-the-shelf architecture for an on demand gaming service. Our proposal consists on running an appropriate remote server in the cloud so that the client need only perform a few basic tasks, such as reading user input and displaying the resulting game screens. Consequently, even low-power computing systems, such as mobile devices or digital TV setup boxes, can have access to sophisticated graphic rich or complex games, since most of the processing is performed remotely...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} learning situated Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) to interactive virtual environments. The framework exploits the non-linguistic context, or situation, explicitly modeled in such <b>interactive</b> <b>applications.</b> This situation model is integrated with a model of word meaning in a principled manner using a noisy channel approach to language understanding. Preliminary experimentation in an independently designed <b>interactive</b> <b>application,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> the Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRE), shows that this situated NLI outperforms {{a state of the}} art NLI on both whole frame accuracy and F-Score metrics. Further, use of the situation model in the situated NLI is shown to increase robustness to the noise introduced by the use of automatic speech recognition. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R
40|$|Object {{oriented}} middleware {{provides an}} application {{with the possibility}} of distributing objects to multiple nodes in a distributed system. In this thesis, we have developed a middleware that, in addition to distributing objects, makes it possible to migrate them. As such, it becomes possible to dynamically relocate objects based on the requirements of the application. We use a distributed name service to maintain references to objects, which means that any given object is managed by the node it is currently located at. This middleware was derived from the requirements and characteristics displayed by <b>interactive</b> real-time <b>applications,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e,</b> <b>applications</b> that are time dependent and event based. To demonstrate the usability of the middleware we have implemented a test application, in form of a chat system derived from a massively multi-player online game (MMOG) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates workarounds {{occurring}} while pharmacists use {{an electronic}} prescription (ePrescription) application. ePrescription enables physicians to send prescriptions electronically to pharmacies and was recently introduced in Greece {{as a solution}} for controlling the ever-increasing medication costs and improving patient safety. The research {{was carried out in}} two phases: (i) review of the relevant documentation, (ii) fieldwork (field observations and semi-structured interviews with the pharmacists) in three pharmacies. The workarounds identified fall into five categories and namely: (a) bypass of ePrescription <b>application</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> ePrescription <b>application</b> is not used at all), (b) temporal nonconformity in the use of ePrescription <b>application</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> usage of the application, but not at the formally specified time), (c) catachresis of ePrescription <b>application</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> usage of the application, but not according to the intended way), (d) ePrescription application substitution by another electronic application, and (e) delegation of ePrescription application usage to non-authorized users. The outcome of the research can be used for the improvement of multiple work system elements such as the tools, the procedures, the organisational arrangements and the policies. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

Whereas, resource allocation is a well-known technique for improving the performance of communication system. In this paper, we design a simple and optimal EE-based resource allocation method for the orthogonal multi-user channel by adapting the transmit power and rate to the channel condition such that the energy-per-bit consumption is minimized. We present our EE framework, <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> EE metric and node power consumption model, and utilizes it for formulating our EE-based optimization problem with or without constraint. In both cases, we derive explicit formulations of the optimal energy-per-bit consumption as well as optimal power and rate for each user. Our results indicate that EE-based allocation can substantially reduce the consumed power and increase the EE in comparison with spectral efficiency-based allocation...|$|R
