50|$|Tatra {{differentials}} are {{a unique}} design that uses two opposing {{spiral bevel gears}} {{instead of the usual}} single set. The differential gears are part of the <b>input</b> <b>drive</b> shaft rather than between the output axles as in a conventional differential. All versions of the Tatra differential have locking pins that can force the differential gears to rotate together, “locking” the differential. This arrangement had two distinct advantages. The first is that the dual output bevel gears allow the axles to swing around the drive axle without the need for universal couplings. The second is that the <b>input</b> <b>drive</b> shaft goes essentially straight through the differential housing, allowing simple coupling to a second set of swing axles. This modular design enables configurations of 2, 3, 4, 5, or even 6 axles with all axles driven. The whole assembly is part of the backbone frame.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} <b>input</b> <b>drive</b> is {{a central}} hydraulic pump and final drive unit(s) is/are a hydraulic motor, or hydraulic cylinder (see: swashplate). Both components can be placed physically far apart on the machine, being connected only by flexible hoses. Hydrostatic drive systems are used on excavators, lawn tractors, forklifts, winch drive systems, heavy lift equipment, agricultural machinery, earth-moving equipment, etc. An arrangement for motor-vehicle transmission was probably used on the Ferguson F-1 P99 racing car in about 1961.|$|E
30|$|A {{device that}} is ideally suited for {{studying}} the effect of relative phases between <b>input</b> <b>drives</b> is the so called quantum optical Josephson interferometer [14], which consists of two coherently driven linear cavities connected through a central cavity with a single-photon nonlinearity. Here, the interplay between tunneling and interactions in the steady state of the system has been analyzed for regimes of weak <b>input</b> <b>drives</b> where the number of excitations in each cavity is rather small by Gerace et al. [14]. For opposite phases of the <b>input</b> <b>drives</b> one finds a destructive interference which suppresses population of the central cavity, whereas for <b>input</b> <b>drives</b> in phase the central cavity is populated with anti-bunched excitations due to its strong nonlinearity.|$|R

5000|$|Pulse {{generators}} {{capable of}} generating pulses with widths under approximately 100 picoseconds are often termed as [...] "microwave pulsers" [...] and typically generate these ultra-short pulses using Step recovery diode (SRD) or Nonlinear Transmission Line (NLTL) methods (for example http://amsacta.cib.unibo.it/archive/00001623/01/GAAS_98_081.pdf). Step Recovery Diode pulse generators are inexpensive but typically require several volts of <b>input</b> <b>drive</b> level {{and have a}} moderately high level of random jitter (usually undesirable variation in the time at which successive pulses occur).|$|E
50|$|A Single Ended Push-Pull (SEPP, SRPP or mu-follower) output stage, {{originally}} {{called the}} Series-Balanced amplifier (US patent 2,310,342, Feb 1943). {{is similar to}} a totem-pole arrangement for transistors in that two devices are in series between the power supply rails, but the <b>input</b> <b>drive</b> goes only to one of the devices, the bottom one of the pair; hence the (seemingly contradictory) Single-Ended description. The output is taken from the cathode of the top (not directly driven) device, which acts part way between a constant current source and a cathode follower but receiving some drive from the plate (anode) circuit of the bottom device. The drive to each tube therefore might not be equal, but the circuit tends to keep the current through the bottom device somewhat constant throughout the signal, increasing the power gain and reducing distortion compared with a true single-tube single-ended output stage.|$|E
5000|$|Direct-coupled {{transistor}} logic (DCTL) {{is similar}} to resistor-transistor logic (RTL) but the input transistor bases are connected directly to the collector outputs without any base resistors. Consequently, DCTL gates have fewer components, are more economical, and are simpler to fabricate onto integrated circuits than RTL gates. Unfortunately, DCTL has much smaller signal levels, has more susceptibility to ground noise, and requires matched transistor characteristics. The transistors are also heavily overdriven; {{that is a good}} feature in that it reduces the saturation voltage of the output transistors, but it also slows the circuit down due to a high stored charge in the base. [...] Gate fan-out is limited due to [...] "current hogging": if the transistor base-emitter voltages (...) are not well matched, then the base-emitter junction of one transistor may conduct most of the <b>input</b> <b>drive</b> current at such a low base-emitter voltage that other input transistors fail to turn on.|$|E
40|$|Communication in {{parallel}} computers requires a low latency router. Once a suitable routing algorithm is selected, an implementation must be designed. Issues {{such as whether}} the router should be <b>input</b> or output <b>driven</b> need to be considered. In this paper, we use simulations to compare <b>input</b> <b>driven</b> and output driven routing algorithms. Three algorithms, the Dally-Seitz oblivious router, the *-channels router, and the minimal triplex algorithm are evaluated. Each router is implemented as both an input and an output driven router. Experiments are run {{for each of the}} router implementations with seven different traffic patterns on both a 256 -node two dimensional mesh and torus networks. The results show that in almost all cases, the output driven router matches or outperforms the <b>input</b> <b>driven</b> router. Furthermore, we find that randomization of output buffer selection in the <b>input</b> <b>driven</b> algorithm increases its performance and substantially reduces the performance discrepancy between the input [...] ...|$|R
30|$|For the {{considered}} {{regime of}} low excitation numbers the approach [14] employed a full numerical analysis relying on an excitation number truncation of the Hilbert spaces. For high <b>input</b> <b>drives</b> however, the theoretical {{description of the}} system poses a challenge as conventional numerical methods quickly become computationally infeasible. Hence, such a numerical approach cannot describe regimes with more intense <b>input</b> <b>drives</b> where excitation numbers begin to grow and is therefore unable to explore a possible transition from a quantum regime with anti-bunched output photons to a classical regime with uncorrelated output photons.|$|R

50|$|The Tracta joint {{works on}} the {{principle}} of the double tongue and groove joint. It comprises only four individual parts: the two forks (a.k.a. yokes, one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue and grooved joint. When the input and output shafts are inclined at some working angle to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central tongue and groove joint are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding speed fluctuation of the driven intermediate and output jaw members exactly counteract and neutralize the speed variation of input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the <b>input</b> <b>drive,</b> providing constant velocity rotation.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} a spring-loaded stack of thin disks on a central shaft. Around this are arranged other stacked disk packs {{on a number of}} planetary shafts, usually three. These shafts are mounted on swinging arms, so that they may be moved in and out together. The central disks are thin, with a thickened rim. The planet disks are tapered across their radius, at an included angle of around 3°. When the disks are intermeshed, they thus only contact at the rim of the central pack, no matter what the spacing of the shafts. These planetary disk packs have a gear meshing with a gear on the swing arms' fulcrum shafts, which in turn meshes with a central gear, used for the <b>input</b> <b>drive.</b> The central shaft is the output shaft and the gear is used as a reduction gear. When the disks are moved outwards, the central rim drives on the outside radius of the similar-sized tapered disks and the overall ratio is around 1:1. As the swing arms are moved inwards, the tapered disks are forced between the central rims against their spring-loading. The effective radius of the tapered disks is thus reduced and the gear ratio increases. The gear is made in a variety of ratio ranges, typically from 3:1 to 10:1. Overall efficiency is good, greater than 90%.|$|E

When 5 Infantry Brigade landed, {{they were joined by}} another three Scouts from 656 Squadron. During the Falklands conflict, the Scout was engaged in CASEVAC, re-supply and Special Forces insertion roles. One aircraft, XT629, was one of two Scouts of B Flight, 3 CBAS that was attacked by two FMA IA 58 Pucarás (the only Argentine air-to-air victory in the war) of Grupo 3 near Camilla Creek House, North of Goose Green. XT629 was hit by cannon fire and crashed, killing the pilot and severing the leg of the crewman, who was thrown clear of the wreckage on impact. The second Scout evaded the Pucarás and later returned to the site to CASEVAC the survivor. Another Scout, XR628, of 656 Sqn AAC, suffered a main rotor gearbox failure whilst in a low hover over MacPhee Pond on 8 June 1982. XR628 had taken cover as two pairs of A-4 Skyhawks from Grupo 5 approached, these aircraft later attacked the RFA LSLs Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram at Bluff Cove. Once the threat had passed and the pilot began to climb away, the main gearbox failed at the main <b>input</b> <b>drive</b> and the aircraft made a forced landing at the lakeside in around four feet of water.
