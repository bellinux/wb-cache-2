5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise missiles {{in that they are}} designed to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition is intended to be expended in an attack and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> warhead.|$|E
5|$|The first {{room from}} the {{corridor}} was the living room, with a wainscot, pilasters, cornice, and door and window frames all of Spanish cedar, and a mantelpiece imported from an Italian chateau. Walls are paneled in green silk, mirroring the rug and furnishings. In its early history, the walls were inlaid with embossed Italian leather. The drawing room, {{sometimes referred to as}} the music room, salon, or parlor was at the center, with paneled walls in ivory white and gold, with gilded moldings and ornaments. There are richly interlaced panels above the doorways with paintings inserted in them. The mantle dates to around 1700, and is of mottled purple and white marble, and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> mirror above it. The room has richly gilt chandeliers hanging from ornamental reliefs in the otherwise plain ceiling. Furniture was of tapestry and gold, with a light rug and yellow and gold curtains at the windows and doors.|$|E
5|$|The Green Goblin is {{armed with}} a variety of bizarre devices. He wears a green costume {{underneath}} bulletproof chainmail with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses. The Green Goblin's trademark weapons are his pumpkin bombs and razor bats. As their name suggests, the bombs were designed with the appearance of jack-o'-lanterns. These varied in function from smoke bombs to traditional explosives, while the razor edged bat-shaped boomerangs-could cut through very durable surfaces and materials. The gloves of the Goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity at nearly 10,000 amps of an undetermined voltage. Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin. The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating the Goblin Glider. The Goblin Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman's Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed the Goblin to carry a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick.|$|E

All such tanks share the same problems as artificially-heated tanks including limestone deposit and corrosion, and suffer similar reductions in overall efficiency unless scrupulously maintained.|$|E
25|$|Signal: An instant messaging, {{voice calling}} and video calling {{application}} for iOS and Android. It uses end-to-end encryption protocols to secure all communications to other Signal users.

All calls are made over a Wi-Fi or data connection and are free of charge, including long distance and international. Signal <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> mechanism for verifying that no man-in-the-middle attack has occurred. Open Whisper Systems has set up dozens of servers to handle the encrypted calls in more than 10 countries around the world to minimize latency. The clients are published under the GPLv3 license.|$|E
25|$|Similar to Atlantis, the Destiny <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> dialing {{computer}} {{which can}} automatically dial {{the gate and}} stores a list of addresses. It locks out certain addresses, presumably because they are either dangerous or inconsequential to the current problem. Two expedition members who {{went to one of}} the locked-out addresses could not be contacted upon redialing. The Destiny also has hand-held dialing computers for those that travel through the Gate to make use of, as there {{do not appear to be}} on-site DHDs thus far. Gates on planets are each equipped with a platform, which transmits information about planet through subspace to Destiny. Since DHDs are absent, it is presumed the platforms are used to power the Gates.|$|E

It is also able to record FM radio and voice on its internal memory. This player is not considered as a descendant of the c200 series, as it only plays audio. It is more similar to the m200 series and maintains much of its design and internal software structure. It is the world's first known cable-less flash-based digital audio player, though a USB cable {{is included in the}} package if one is required to be used.|$|E
25|$|Nova wears a {{standard}} Xandarian StarCorps uniform, {{designed to accommodate}} his powers without being damaged by them. The uniform is highly resistant to damage, including outer space conditions, and is airtight. In addition, the uniform <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> life support function that can sustain Rider under the most extreme environmental conditions, including acting as a life-support suit by locking off the mouth and eyes of the helmet. The helmet contains a radio, telescopic sights, night vision sensors, and heat imaging sensors, {{as well as a}} visual heads-up display for tracking energy signatures. Nova's helmet has a rigid construction and shape when worn, but becomes as malleable as cloth when it is not, allowing Rider to hide it in his civilian clothes when desired. Nova's uniform is not only extremely malleable, but contains specific functions to aid Rider in his role as a Nova Corps Centurion. Among these features are an electromagnetic discharge that can nullify gravity and an interface to stargates that allow him to enter hyperspace, where he can move at velocities exceeding the speed of light. Rider can also alter the appearance and nature of his uniform to suit his needs. However, as Rider learns the hard way, the Nova Corps keeps a strict dress code. When he makes major cosmetic changes to his uniform after rejoining the New Warriors, Nova is summarily ordered to conform to standard.|$|E

Crystal Bowie is a humanoid cyborg with a golden skeleton and a body made from indestructible, polarizing glass. He works for the Pirate Guild led by Lord Salamander.

The claw <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> laser gun which {{can also be used}} as a grappling hook or fired as a projectile. In the Manga Entertainment dub, Crystal Bowie is renamed Lord Necron. Crystal Bowie was voiced by Gorō Mutsumi in the film, and by Kiyoshi Kobayashi in the two anime adaptations.

The central chimney is on a stone base and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>built-in</b> root cellar. At {{the time of its}} nomination, the house was using asphalt shingles on its roof. The house is historically significant for its bolection molding and around fireplaces and shallow molded shelves above the fireplaces in the front chambers.

Mary McMahon, who prepared the inventory form for the National Register of Historic Places, writes [...] "A handsome corner cabinet with butterfly shelves is also located in the east room". [...] The second floor retains its original flooring and mantels, and the post and beam construction is visible throughout the interior of the house.|$|E
