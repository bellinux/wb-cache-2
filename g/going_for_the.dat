5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were {{struggling}} when Healy {{came to the}} crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending a stand of 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Poulton ran out Laura Marsh, {{triggering}} {{the loss of}} the last four wickets without the addition of a run, in six balls, leaving 15 deliveries unused. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Poulton top-scored for Australia with 23 from 28 balls, helping to stabilise the innings after the Australians had fallen to 2/10. However, she fell at 4/45, bowled by Holly Colvin, and eventually, Rene Farrell was run out <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E

She {{departed}} on 5 May passing Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein to the pre-invasion shelling at Saipan, Guam, and Tinian after 14 June. During the shelling of Tinian on 24 July she was damaged, 43 men were killed, and 198 wounded by 22 shell hits from Japanese shore batteries; she continued shelling {{the island and}} providing fire support for the invasion troops. After undergoing extensive repairs along the West Coast, she arrived in Leyte Gulf to begin the invasion of Leyte. A week after her arrival she was struck by two kamikaze suicide bombers, which killed 19 crewmembers, injured 72, and moderately damaged the ship. Despite the damage, she bombarded Mindoro on schedule from 12 to 17 January 1945. She then proceeded to Manus Island for urgent repairs.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{played in}} every match of Australia's {{successful}} World Cup campaign, but struggled at first, {{with scores of}} 6, 14 and 0 {{in the first three}} matches against Scotland, New Zealand and Pakistan. Australia lost the latter two matches and had to avoid defeat for six consecutive matches to reach the final. Gilchrist's quick-fire 63 runs in 39 balls against Bangladesh helped the Australians into the Super Six stage of the tournament, which was secured with a win over the West Indies, although Gilchrist made only 21. Gilchrist continued to struggle in the Super Six phase, scoring 31, 10 and 5 against India, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Australia won all three matches, the last in the final over, to scrape into the semifinals. Gilchrist made only 20 in the semifinal against South Africa, but completed the final act of the match. With the scores tied, South Africa were <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> winning run when Gilchrist broke the stumps to complete the run out of Allan Donald; the match was tied, and Australia proceeded to the final as they had won the group stage match against South Africa. Gilchrist's 54 in the final helped secure Australia's first world title since 1987 with an eight wicket victory over Pakistan. It was a happy ending for Gilchrist, who had struggled through the tournament, with 237 runs at 21.54.|$|E
25|$|<b>Going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> One is {{the eighth}} studio album by the English rock band Yes, {{released}} on 15 July 1977 by Atlantic Records.

It marks the departure of keyboardist Patrick Moraz {{and the return of}} Rick Wakeman, who had left to pursue his solo career after musical differences surrounding Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973). In a departure from their previous three albums, <b>Going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> One features shorter and more direct songs written without a unifying theme or concept, and saw Yes record with new producers, engineers and cover designers.|$|E

25|$|Construction of the Monument of the Holy Mother of God was {{approved}} by the Haskovo municipal council in September 2002. The required funding of 300,000 leva (€150,000) was secured thanks to donations by the citizens of Haskovo. 10,000 postcards were printed with the image of the future monument and were sold for 5 leva (€2.50) each, with the entire collected sum <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> construction.

25|$|In late January, the British {{learned that}} the Italians were {{evacuating}} Cyrenaica along the Via Balbia from Benghazi. The 7th Armoured Division (Major-General Sir Michael O'Moore Creagh) was dispatched to intercept {{the remnants of the}} 10th Army by moving through the desert, south of the Jebel Akhdar via Msus and Antelat as the 6th Australian Division pursued the Italians along the coast road north of the Jebel Akhdar.

She {{came in at}} 4/45 in the 10th over and struggled, scoring 4 from 15 balls before being dismissed. During her time at the crease, Australia lost 3/18 in 29 balls, {{and by the time}} she left, they needed 42 runs from 34 for victory with three wickets in hand. Eventually, Australia recovered, before Rene Farrell was run out <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
25|$|Bimal Bose {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Bihar in the 1940-41 {{season as a}} left-arm medium-paced opening bowler, and was seldom out of the team for the next 23 seasons. He batted low in the order, and made his highest score of 66 against Bengal in his second match. Bihar needed 264 to take the first-innings lead, which in a drawn match, as this one seemed likely to be, effectively counted as a victory. Bose went in at 149 for seven, and was last man out, caught on the boundary <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> six that would have taken Bihar into the lead.|$|E
25|$|From Vimy Ridge to D-Day to a {{new release}} of the Victory Nickel with a {{commemorative}} booklet, the 5-cent piece became very monumental in acknowledging the contributions of Canada's military in the 20th Century. With {{the advent of the}} Lucky Loonie, the good luck charm that brought Olympic gold to Canada's hockey teams in 2002, the RCM paid tribute to that accomplishment with its <b>Going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Gold set in 2002 featuring a double-dated Loon coin packaged with MacLean's magazine and Olympic stamps.

25|$|By now, Dravid {{had been}} branded as a Test specialist. While he {{continued}} to score heavily in Test cricket, his poor strike rate in ODIs came under scanner.

However, 1999 proved to be the year of renaissance for Dravid's ODI career. Dravid worked hard and re-tooled his game by increasing his range of strokes and adapting his batting style to suit the requirements of ODI cricket. He learned to pace his innings cleverly without <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slogs.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Australia were set 105 for victory.

She made 12 from 10 balls, hitting the solitary six of the match before falling to Holly Colvin. This triggered a collapse of 3/3 {{in the space of}} 16 balls, to leave Australia at 7/63. However, Australia recovered and Rene Farrell was run out <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with {{defending}} champions England, South Africa and the West Indies.

She made 7 from 14 balls in a partnership of 34 from 33 balls—Australia's largest of the match—with Leah Poulton. However, their dismissals in consecutive overs started a collapse of 5/19 from 34 balls. However, Australia recovered, and Rene Farrell was run out <b>going</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
