40|$|In a 4 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>set,</b> echo {{may arise}} both by {{electrical}} crosstalk in the cord and by acoustical coupling between earpiece and mouthpiece in the handset. The echo loss for these paths {{has been determined}} for two analogue 2 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b> This data is used to derive the echo loss of a hypothetical 4 -wire set having SLR + RLR = 3 dB, and acoustical and electrical properties {{the same as the}} 2 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b> I. 1 Introduction It has been pointed out in several contributions that the choice of LRs for <b>digital</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> has to be made considering aspects of loudness and echo in a complete 4 -wire connection. To enable a study of the risk of objectionable echo, Study Group XVI has asked Study Group XII to present information on the subjective effect of talker echo as a function of delay, overall LR and echo path loss. In a digital 4 -wire connection, including 4 -wire subscriber lines and <b>digital</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>sets,</b> the main echo paths are found in the <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> itself: [...] - t [...] ...|$|R
50|$|MiNET is a {{stimulus}} protocol that carries keystroke {{information from a}} <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> to a call control server. It {{can also be used}} to carry information to the set for the control of simple text displays. Mitel Corporation designed it in the 1980s as a signaling protocol for its proprietary <b>digital</b> TDM <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b> Later it was used to control Mitel IP sets by being encapsulated within TCP. Mitel uses it as an alternative to the functional protocol SIP to maintain the practical life of its PBX call control software.|$|R

Bell Labs and Western Electric, the R&D and manufacturing arms of the original AT&T Bell System dominated the DLC markets with the SLC-96 and SLC series 5 systems prior to the 1984 Bell System divestiture. <b>Digital</b> <b>Telephone</b> Systems was purchased by Farinon Corporation which was subsequently acquired by Harris Corporation of Melbourne, Florida in 1980.|$|R
