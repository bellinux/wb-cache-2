5|$|Historically, {{individuals}} with MS were advised against participation <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> activity due to worsening symptoms.

Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.|$|E

5|$|As Double Dare grew messier, a green slime {{substance}} {{became more}} commonly used <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> challenges and obstacles. Slime was originally introduced on another Nickelodeon program, You Can't Do That on Television. Double Dares high viewership led to greater visibility for Nickelodeon's association with slime, and saw it featured in promotions for the network in the late 1980s. The substance proliferated further, including annual slimings on the Kids' Choice Awards, a slime geyser at Nickelodeon Studios, and slime-based segments on other game shows including Wild & Crazy Kids and Figure It Out. The relationship of Nickelodeon and slime still lasts on the network.|$|E

This paper discusses the application of multimedia technology <b>in</b> college <b>physical</b> education by documentary method, professor interview, mathematical statistics etc. It shows that multimedia technology has positive influence on college physical education, as it promotes scientific, advanced and vivid development of college physical education. However there are still problems in the application of multimedia technology <b>in</b> college <b>physical</b> education, for example, the problem in the links between multimedia teaching and traditional teaching and in the great influence of courseware on teaching effect. So it's necessary to accelerate multimedia technology development, strengthen the application of multimedia technology <b>in</b> college <b>physical</b> education, achieve a proper cooperation between traditional and multimedia teaching, enrich multimedia courseware and its effect...|$|R
50|$|This unvarying {{aspect of}} the Planck-relative scale, or {{that of any other}} system of natural units, leads many theorists to {{conclude}} that a hypothetical change <b>in</b> dimensionful <b>physical</b> constants can only be manifest as a change <b>in</b> dimensionless <b>physical</b> constants. One such dimensionless physical constant is the fine-structure constant. There are some experimental physicists who assert they have in fact measured a change in the fine structure constant and this has intensified the debate about the measurement of physical constants. According to some theorists there are some very special circumstances in which changes in the fine-structure constant can be measured as a change <b>in</b> dimensionful <b>physical</b> constants. Others however reject the possibility of measuring a change <b>in</b> dimensionful <b>physical</b> constants under any circumstance. The difficulty or even the impossibility of measuring changes <b>in</b> dimensionful <b>physical</b> constants has led some theorists to debate with each other whether or not a dimensionful physical constant has any practical significance at all and that in turn leads to questions about which dimensionful physical constants are meaningful.|$|R
