For the Austrian bread grains market, I empirically demonstrate, that given the present support level, a fully-decoupled direct income support redistributes income most efficiently as long as the MCF is lower than 1. 17. Beyond this value a floor price cum quota policy becomes more efficient. A floor price cum <b>deficiency</b> <b>payments</b> policy is never superior to the floor price cum quota. 2 1...|$|R

The analysis indicates that the tariff equivalent of the price wedge over the 1986 - 88 period was 44 %. If the tariff equivalent of the price wedge is reduced over a ten-year period, Japanese pork imports are projected to increase by over 39 % initially and by over 215 % compared to baseline projections by the year 2000.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Under the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Marketing Assistance Loan Program, the federal government accepts harvested crops as collateral for interest-bearing loans (marketing assistance loans) that are typically due in nine months. When market prices drop below the loan rate (the loan price per pound or bushel), the government allows farmers to repay the loan at a lower rate and retain ownership of their commodity for eventual sale. The difference between the loan rate and the lower repayment rate is called the "marketing loan gain. " Conversely, farmers {{who do not have}} marketing assistance loans can also receive a benefit when prices are low called a "loan <b>deficiency</b> <b>payment.</b> " The loan <b>deficiency</b> <b>payment</b> is equal to the marketing loan gain that the farmer would have received if he or she had a loan. Farmers may choose to obtain either a marketing loan gain or a loan <b>deficiency</b> <b>payment</b> [...] both of which are known as the marketing loan benefit. The increase in the payment limit and the availability of commodity certificates had only modest effects on the $ 15 billion in marketing assistance loan payments provided for crop year 1999 and for crop year 2000 through May 2001. Because of the increase in the payment limit, total payments over the two-year period were 1. 9 percent more than they would have been under the previous limit, or an additional $ 261. 1 million. Most farmers did not use commodity certificates to receive gains more than the payment limit, but a small number of farmers did benefit from the program.

Modeling risk management and nitrate leaching dynamics are useful extensions of this research, as is estimating the benefits from averting nitrate leaching. As policy makers plan for the next “farm bill ” in 1995, a growing concern is how that legislation will affect incentives to limit groundwater contam-ination and to practice crop rotations that include resource-conserving crops. Conversations with farmers and publications in the popular press (Cramer) suggest growing disaffection with the current government <b>deficiency</b> <b>payment</b> program. Academic research bears out the belief that despite some innovation in the 1990 farm bill, the com-modity price stabilization programs continue to discourage rotations including resource-conserving crops (RCC’S) (Diebel and Williams, Williams and Diebel). While the federal farm commodity programs alone may lack enough leverage to trans-form husbandry practices (Doering), they clearly have a powerful incentive effect at the margin, even as the financial benefits they offer diminish. Public concern about groundwater contamina-tion from nitrate leaching has been raised by its status as the most widespread agriculturally-related chemical appearing in groundwater samples, In re-cent studies, more than 3 % of wellwater samples tested exceeded maximum contaminant level (MCL) set by the U.
