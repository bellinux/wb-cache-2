Optimum {{communication}} {{can only}} be achieved with a very sensitive front-end section in the receiver on a satellite because the transmitted signal from the ground station must travel hundreds of kilometres through the earth's atmosphere to a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite. This dissertation presents {{the design of the}} <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>section</b> of the receiver suitable for use in a nano-satellite. Specifically, various transistor technologies are evaluated by designing five low noise amplifiers to determine the optimum performing amplifier. The bandwidth of the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>section</b> was controlled by designing coupled line microstrip filter. For consistency, the same design technique was followed in the design of each LNA. Simulations were performed and the results were compared to the actual measured results of the constructed amplifiers to facilitate conclusions to be made. Design specifications for the LNAs were obtained from the F'SATI Space CubeSat Programme Technical Specification document. To control the bandwidth of the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>section,</b> various types of band-pass filters were investigated, resulting in a coupled line band-pass filter being simulated and implemented. The simulated results were compared to the measured results of the constructed filter. In the final stage of this dissertation, comparisons of each amplifierâ€™s performance were made, resulting in the final recommendation for this project...|$|E

It is based on experience gained by designing and testing the SVX 3 128 channel silicon strip detector readout chip. The SVX 3 chip organization is shown in Fig. 1. The <b>Front</b> <b>End</b> <b>section</b> consists of an integrator and analog pipeline designed at Fermilab, and the Back End section is an ADC plus sparsification and readout logic designed at LBL. SVX 3 is a deadtimeless readout chip, {{which means that the}} front end is acquiring low level analog signals while the back end is digitizing and reading out digital signals. It is thus a true mixed signal chip, and demands close attention to avoid disastrous coupling from the digital to the analog sections. SVX 3 is designed in a bulk CMOS process (i. e., the circuits sit in a silicon substrate). In such a process, the substrate becomes a potential coupling path. This paper discusses the effect of the substrate resistivity on coupling, and also goes into a more general discussion of grounding and referencing in mixed signal designs and how low resistivity substrates can be used to advantage. Finally, an alternative power supply current conduction method for ASICs is presented as an additional advantage which can be obtained with low resistivity substrates. 1 ref., 13 figs., 1 tab...|$|E

The 8. 4 -meter telescope will be {{located on the}} El Pen peak of Cerro Pachn, a 2682 metre high mountain in Coquimbo Region, in northern Chile. The 3. 2 Giga-pixel camera will take 6. 4 GB images every 15 seconds, resulting in 15 TB of new raw image data per night. The LSST camera {{is made up of}} 21 modules designated Science Raft Towers. Each raft tower module (RTM) is an autonomous, fully testable and serviceable 144 Mega pixels imager consisting of nine highly segmented CCDs with complete readout electronics chain. To minimize noise and obscuration the RTM is housed in a compact enclosure fully contained within the camera cryostat. The RTM electronics is composed of 3 independent boards called REB (Raft Electronics Boards). Each REB controls and acquires data from 3 4 K x 4 K fully depleted CCDs with 16 outputs each and send data to a data acquisition system based on ATCA crates through a 3. 25 Gbps serial link. The readout time is 2 seconds. The <b>Front</b> <b>End</b> <b>section</b> is based on two ASICs one, the CABAC (Clock & Biases Asic for CCD), that provides CCD clocks and biases and the other, the ASPIC (Analogue Signal Processing Integrated Circuit), for the signal conditioning and amplification.

40|$|AbstractHigh {{frequencies}} {{of the order}} of hundreds of kHz to MHz are employed for underwater imaging applications. Signal to noise ratios encountered for the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> receiver <b>sections</b> are seen to be very much reduced for these applications. Hence a low noise preamplifier and filter stage is very essential prior to the conventional antialiasing and digitization functionalities of the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> receivers. In this paper, an attempt is made to design and develop a low noise pre amplifier and filter to achieve a better SNR for the system. The pre amplifier stage designed is interfaced with hydrophones directly for gain and impedance matching purposes. The noise reduction is further achieved by means of a filter following the preamplifier stage which rejects the out of the band noise to an optimum level. Thorough study and analysis is carried out in this paper for the selection of low noise opamps, associated passive components and configuration of the preamplifier sections. Acoustic measurements are carried out for a sensor array of 150 kHz for evaluating the preamplifier and filter performance in the real scenario...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of design and}} operating parameters {{on the behavior of}} a fixed-bed reactor with periodic flow reversal has been studied in a laboratory set-up for the case of catalytic total oxidation. The results are in accordance with detailed model simulations published elsewhere.

Like any other autothermal reactor, a fixed-bed reactor with periodic flow reversal has to be operated in the ignited steady state. It was shown that totally and partially ignited steady states may exist under the same operating conditions if several combustible components with different ignition temperature are present in the feed.

The experimental setup consists of two ion sources with electrostatic lens systems, a Two-Beam RFQ accelerator, a funneling deflector and a beam diagnostic system. The two beams are bunched and accelerated in a Two-Beam RFQ and the last parts of the RFQ electrodes achieve a 3 d focus at the crossing point of the two beam axis.

40|$|Three major {{facilities}} {{have been proposed}} for the precision study of neutrino oscillation parameters, the Neutrino Factory, the Betabeam and the Superbeam. Of these, the Neutrino Factory offers high precision measurement of oscillation parameters [1]. The Neutrino Factory generates neutrinos by firing protons onto a target {{in order to produce}} pions. The pions decay to muons which are captured before being accelerated to 25 GeV and stored in racetrackshaped rings where they decay to neutrinos. In this note the pion decay channel, longitudinal drift, adiabatic buncher, phase rotation and ionisation cooling system that make up the Neutrino Factory muon <b>front</b> <b>end</b> are reviewed. THE NEUTRINO FACTORY The baseline design of the International Design Study (IDS) is shown in Figure 1. Proton bunches with RMS time spread in the range 1 - 3 ns from a 4 MW proton driver are fired at kinetic energies of 5 - 15 GeV onto a target where pions are produced. The intensity of the beam may be sufficient to destroy non-moving solid targets; moving solid or liquid targets are under investigation. Pions are captured in a 20 T solenoid which is tapered along the accelerator axis. Pions decay to muons with a large energy spread. The beam is transported through a long solenoid for an energy-time correlation to develop, the muons are bunched and then the energy spread reduced using phase rotation. The beam is subsequently cooled using ionisation cooling {{to increase the number of}} muons that are accepted by the accelerating system. The beam is then accelerated as fast as possible, to minimise decay losses, in a series of 3 linacs. In order to use equipment efficiently, the latter two linacs each have recirculators that return the beam for multiple passes through the same cavities. Next, a high acceptance Fixed Field Alternating Gradient machine (FFAG) is used to take the muons up to 25 GeV. Finally the muons are stored in a large aperture racetrack-shaped ring where the muons decay to neutrinos for study in the detector system.

40|$|Should {{management}} control the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation in companies? And if so, how? This thesis examines {{the use of}} {{management control}} in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation, how the different management control mechanisms are associated with <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance, and how technology and market uncertainty influence this relationship. The <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation is generally regarded as the most troublesome phase of the innovation process {{and at the same}} time as one of the greatest opportunities to improve the overall innovation capability of a company. The <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation has been characterized as a highly uncertain and creative phase, thereby requiring considerable amounts of freedom and independence for those executing <b>front</b> <b>end</b> activities. However, a certain amount of control is necessary to secure the effective use of resources and the achievement of the company's strategic goals. The current findings on management control and its influence on performance in a new product development context in general are conflicting. For example, while many authors argue that behavioral control kills creativity, others emphasize the advantages of improved communication and coordination created by process formalization. Some authors stress the importance of setting specific and challenging strategic goals for development work, yet other articles indicate this inhibits creativity and learning. One challenge in interpreting the conflicting results of existing management control research in a new product development context is the fact that most studies treat the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation simultaneously with product development projects, thereby averaging the totally different characteristics of these two innovation phases. Studies investigating management control in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation are still scarce. This theoretical gap is the focus of this thesis. This study develops a framework for management control in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation and tests hypotheses on the relationship between different management control mechanisms and <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance. Management control is covered through seven variables: input control, <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization, outcome-based rewarding, strategic vision, informal communication, participative planning, and intrinsic task motivation. Product concept superiority and strategic renewal are used as <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance indicators, reflecting both the short-term and long-term development needs of the organization. The influence of technology and market uncertainty as potential moderators on the control mechanism-performance relationship is investigated in relation to <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization and outcome-based rewarding. Data from the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> phase of 133 new product development projects from different large and medium-sized Finnish companies have been collected and analyzed. A factor model was used to test the validity of the management control framework and a linear regression analysis used for hypothesis testing. The results show that management control mechanisms are associated with performance in different manners depending on the performance variable used. <b>Front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization, strategic vision, and intrinsic task motivation were positively associated with product concept superiority. No association was found between input control, outcome-based rewarding, informal communication, participative planning, and product concept superiority. The results show that input control and intrinsic task motivation were positively associated with strategic renewal in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation. No association existed between <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization, outcome-based rewarding, informal communication, participative planning, and strategic renewal. Three significant moderating relationships were found in the study: Market uncertainty positively moderates the positive association between <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization and product concept superiority; Technology uncertainty negatively moderates the relationship between <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization and strategic renewal, i. e. under high technology uncertainty, <b>front</b> <b>end</b> process formalization is negatively related to strategic renewal; Technology uncertainty also negatively moderates the relationship between outcome-based rewarding and strategic renewal, i. e. under high technology uncertainty, outcome-based rewarding is negatively related to strategic renewal. This study contributes to management control literature by making management control in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation the focal point - an area which is still barely touched in management control theory. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge of <b>front</b> <b>end</b> management by showing that management should be actively involved in the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of innovation and by providing evidence of the importance of this phase on a firm's dynamic capabilities. This thesis contributes to contingency theory also by demonstrating how both market uncertainty and technology uncertainty moderate the association between management control mechanisms and <b>front</b> <b>end</b> performance.

Successful planning, as the shared responsibility of a project team, is dependent on the provision of information that is complete, correct, and timely. Numerous authors have described the process and statistically validated its relevance and importance. However, few investigations have been conducted on the subject of how early project information is actually managed through the {{planning process}}. This paper summarizes a two-phased research investigation that examines how information supports the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> planning process. Based on the expertise of a group of industry members from major owner and contractor organizations, an extended <b>front</b> <b>end</b> planning process model is first developed. Based on surveyed data and through the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> planning activities in the process model, this research indicates engineers play an important and integral role in <b>front</b> <b>end</b> planning and therefore have significant influence on the likelihood of project success. Also, the information requirements for <b>front</b> <b>end</b> planning efforts leading to successful projects are indicated, and the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> planning activities for which information is commonly non-available are also identified...|$|R
40|$|Devices for {{generating}} streamwise vorticity in a boundary includes {{various forms of}} vortex generators. One form of a split-ramp vortex generator includes a first ramp element and a second ramp element with <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> and back ends, ramp surfaces extending between the <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> and the back ends, and vertical surfaces extending between the <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> and the back ends adjacent the ramp surfaces. A flow channel is between the first ramp element and the second ramp element. The back ends of the ramp elements have a height greater than a height of the <b>front</b> <b>ends,</b> and the <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> of the ramp elements have a width greater than a width of the back ends...|$|R
40|$|In {{mobile and}} {{portable}} wireless devices, {{it is important}} to have low power dissipation so as to maximize battery life. As the overall power dissipation of a device is dominated by the radio frequency (RF) <b>front</b> <b>end</b> rather than the digital circuit, low-power RF <b>front</b> <b>end</b> design has become a very hot topic in both research and implementation. In this paper, we propose a design method to minimize the power dissipation of a RF <b>front</b> <b>end.</b> Specifically, given the overall specifications of gain, linearity and noise figure of a <b>front</b> <b>end,</b> we derive the optimal specification for each building block of the RF <b>front</b> <b>end</b> such that the overall power dissipation is minimized. By using a specific example of a <b>front</b> <b>end</b> consisting of a couple of cascaded circuit blocks using 90 nm CMOS technology, we demonstrate that significant reduction in power dissipation can be achieved using the proposed design method...|$|R
