Kawamori's (2004) shows that perfect random monitoring is always better than the canonical case. Surprisingly, when the monitoring is public, the result is less clear-cut and does not generalize in a straightforward way. Unless the public signals are sufficiently informative about player's actions and/or players are patient enough. In addition to a <b>discount</b> <b>effect,</b> that tends to consistently favor the provision of incentives, we found an information effect, associated with the time uncertainty {{on the distribution of}} public signals.

40|$|I {{propose a}} general-equilibrium model with {{investment}} heterogeneity {{to investigate the}} dynamics of Tobin's q over time, and more precisely why firms tend to migrate from value to growth and viceversa. Firms are assumed to have two types of investment opportunities: i) reinvest capital in the own industry's production process and ii) trade capital with other industries. In equilibrium the sequence of both types of investment decisions determines the level of capital accumulated in the different industries of the economy, and in turn affects the market-to-book ratios of the firms. I show that firm migration can be generated endogenously as a <b>discount</b> <b>effect,</b> thus driven by consumption, and not necessarily as a cash flow effect. Using data on asset returns, I find that my model (1) captures convergence of price-to-book ratios - negative for growth stocks and positive for value stocks - (firm migration), (2) predicts a negative relationship between market-to-book ratios and risk premia and (3) generates a non-monotone relationship between Tobin's q and conditional volatility consistent with the empirical evidence.

40|$|Purpose – Interest only strips {{are created}} by {{stripping}} the interest portion of cash flows generated in mortgage-backed securities or simply by servicing portfolios of mortgages. A number of financial institutions have significant amounts of mortgage-servicing rights (MSR) which need to be delta (dynamic) hedged. Because MSR have a positive duration when prepayment effect is stronger than <b>discount</b> <b>effect,</b> {{it is possible to}} delta hedge a portfolio of MSR with other fixed income securities such that the value of the portfolio is not affected by increases or decreases in market rates. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach – The paper develops the delta-hedge-ratio of MSR within a dynamic approach, using three different securities. To lower the cost of the delta hedge, the authors compare three hedge ratios dynamically, in order to obtain the portfolio that needs the least delta hedge. Findings – The model enables the reduction of the amount of portfolio rebalancing and therefore reduces the cost of MSR portfolio hedging. Practical implications – The paper develops the gamma-hedge-ratio function for each of the three securities. The lowest gamma corresponds to the hedged portfolio that needs the least re-balancing. Originality/value – This paper is innovative with the introduction of a delta-hedge-ratio function of interest and prepayment rates. Hedging, Mortgage companies, Services...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the US experience, most international (European) real estate investments trusts (REITs) are subject to prudential regulation. This paper investigates the effects of prudential regulation on capital structures and consequently, the REIT share values of major legal and market constraints (i. e. leverage limitations, market discount on net asset value (NAV), tax controls) that affect non-US REITs. Italian market data are used for an empirical analysis. Our hypothesis {{is that in a}} constrained environment, the effects on share price significantly depend on the adopted valuation perspective, i. e. if shares are valued by following a NAV or a financial approach. The logic for this hypothesis is that the two valuation methodologies perceive leverage and implied financial risk differently. In particular, we argue that NAV valuation techniques incentivise REITs to maximize leverage regardless of the financial theory which indicates a contrasting impact of debt on the market value of shares. Differences in financial risk perception could also partially explain market price discounts on NAVs. The empirical results seem to support these expectations. Almost all Italian REITs tend to increase debt ratios over time. NAV discounts are significantly related to leverage. The <b>discount</b> <b>effect</b> is largely attributable to NAV increases that result from rising debt levels. On the contrary, share market prices tend to be independent from leverage. The latter result may indicate that the classic capital theory applies and current debt ratios do not imply bankruptcy risk. The results have significant policy implications in terms of an optimal regulatory design. REIT regulation; Leverage; NAV discount; REIT capital structure; REIT valuation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to study the effect of different marketing strategies on changing consumers' behavior {{from the perspective of}} behavioral economics. The dissertation is composed of three related studies. The first two studies investigate the effect of markdown and coupon strategies on food retail markets. The first study proposes a markdown utility based on the mental accounting theory to capture and explain an incremental utility triggered by pricing strategy without actual price variation. This solves the puzzle of markdown effect, identified as a higher markdown elasticity of demand relative to the price elasticity of demand. A demand model for spinach and lettuce is estimated based on supermarket scanner data sets to verify the markdown effect on consumption of both product categories. In the second study, a demand model for the snack chips category is estimated with household scanner data sets to identify the price-discount effect and the informational advertising effect of coupons on promoting household purchases. The conditions regarding a weekly coupon usage rate for coupon effect to exceed standard price <b>discount</b> <b>effect</b> are discussed. The third study examines the effect of a quick-service restaurant (QSR) strategy which changes default energy-dense menu items to choices with healthier options on promoting kids' healthier eating consumptions. A series of difference-in-difference (DID) models are applied to compare Mexi-Fries and Crustos purchases before and after the strategy was put into effect among treatment stores and control stores. Insignificantly negative estimates imply that the strategy of adding choices into menus might encourage health-oriented purchasing behavior in a minor way.

40|$|The Internet plays {{a growing}} {{role in the}} economy. This paper extrapolates this trend and {{analyses}} a world where most transactions take place in "cyberspace". We ask the following question: how does {{the design of the}} search engine affect the incentives to innovate and the economy’s long run growth rate? This is done {{in the context of a}} "qualitative" model where growth occurs because the number of varieties grows and consumers select a shrinking fraction of the available goods, of growing quality. They must use a search engine to locate goods. The search engine affects the market size of a good over its life cycle, and thus the incentives to innovate. Its structure has two conflicting effects. A visibility effect by which a greater hit score increases market size. A selection effect by which consumers are more picky and select higher quality goods, thus reducing the life span of any given good. While these two effects on growth cancel out for simple specifications, that is no longer the case if a firm’s score is variable along its life cycle or if he search process uses resources. It is shown that the <b>discount</b> <b>effect</b> of gradual recognition of popularity tends to reduce growth. Hence, growth is enhanced if the search engine is less sensitive to popularity. Also, growth is lower when the search engine rewards "web page quality" better because of the resources diverted away from R and D into advertising. But these mechanisms generate opposite level effects on the average quality selected by consumers. As a result the net effect on welfare is ambiguous. ...|$|E

Notes on the {{circulation}} and wider reception of Scandinavian Crime In this paper Scandinavian crime, or Nordic Noir, in its filmic and televisual incarnations, {{will be considered}} on its relative merits as a transnationally successful, but regionally based popular cultural expression. The inquiry will be conducted against a backdrop which briefly traces the history {{and some of the}} obstacles which historically have limited the transnational circulation of European popular culture. Consequently, and despite the accomplishments, it is still possible to identify how the reception abroad of Scandinavian crime is, in certain ways, simultaneously marked by lingering forms of suspicion and limited tolerance in ways traditionally associated with the reception of indigenous forms of European popular culture. What has been termed the cultural <b>discount</b> <b>effect</b> is thus very much detectable when a broader reception environment is taken into account, implying that the transnational circulation and viewing, at least of the Scandinavian version of Nordic Noir, conceivably is not as widespread as may have been assumed. Here, the remake industry and the geographically relocated adaptations that Scandinavian crime have so far propelled, must also be considered in an ambiguous light. On the one hand, remakes seem to work as some kind of acknowledgement of recognition. On the other hand, however, the Anglophone remakes are also testimony to the view point that the original Scandinavian productions are in some sense lacking or, put another way, too associated with the effect of cultural discount. Despite strategies of cultural adaptation, transculturation and attempts at making the geographic margins familiar, efforts to create transnational audiovisual popular culture beyond the Anglophone sphere still seem hard fought. Somehow, the remnants of a traditional national identity and language remain as an obstacle...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two essays on the acquisitions of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China from the agency-cost perspective. In the first essay, I examine acquisitions of SOEs in China and ask whether SOEs are being fairly valued in the transactions. To answer this question, I compare the transaction values between SOE targets and non-SOE targets using a sample of acquisitions announced {{during the period of}} 1999 - 2014. I find that compared with non-SOE targets, SOE firms are being sold at a significant discount, based on either price multiples (for both public and private target firms) or the stocks’ pre-announcement market values (for public target firms). Turning to market reaction, I further document that the stocks of SOE target firms experience lower abnormal returns at the announcement of an acquisition proposal than those of non-SOE targets. I view these findings as evidence that state owned enterprises in China are being sold at a discount. It is worth noting that this <b>discount</b> <b>effect</b> of state control is prominent for smaller target firms. To explore the reasons why SOEs are sold at a discount, in the second essay I further investigate the welfare of target firms’ CEOs surrounding acquisitions. In this examination, I first analyze the CEO turnover of listed target firms subsequent to the respective acquisition announcements within the same fiscal year. I find that CEOs of SOE targets {{are less likely to be}} replaced after an acquisition than are their non-SOE counterparts. This difference is greater when the acquisition does not lead to a change in firm control or when the CEO of the SOE target holds more stock shares. I then examine changes in CEO compensation from before to after an acquisition. While there is no meaningful difference in compensation for retained CEOs between SOE targets and non-SOE targets, the departed CEOs of SOE targets leave with significantly higher compensation than their non-SOE counterparts. Overall, my findings are consistent with the more severe agency problems in SOEs, relative to non-SOEs, which result in that SOE shares being sold at a discount while allowing the managers, who are motivated by self-interest and pursue private gains at a cost to shareholders, to benefit from reduced turnover or increased compensation upon departure. published_or_final_versionEconomics and FinanceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

By using dynamic optimization we show that an optimal strategy exists, and we provide an analytical expression for the optimal depreciation charges. Depreciation charges initially decrease over time, and after a number of periods the firm enters a steady state where depreciation is constant and equal to replacement investments. This way, the optimal solution trades off the benefits of accelerated depreciation (because of discounting) and of constant depreciation (because of the progressive tax system). We show that the steady state will be reached sooner when the initial tax base is lower or when the <b>discounting</b> <b>effect</b> is stronger. ...|$|R
40|$|Missing {{information}} (MI), if detected, {{often leads}} to alternative discounting. However, inferences reduce uncertainty of MI and thus reduce discounting. This paper suggests that discounting results not only from uncertainty of MI, but from consumer’s overall “confidence in evaluating" (CE). Confidently held inferences help resolve MI uncertainty, improve CE and attenuate discounting. This mediating role of CE suggests discounting/evaluation effects could also be observed in ‘non-MI’ contexts involving other types of uncertainty detection and resolution. An experiment demonstrates the role of CE, and a model proposes interactive effects of sources of uncertainty, and uncertainty detection and resolution on overall CE and discounting. The model extends the long observed <b>discounting</b> <b>effect</b> of MI to broader situations and highlights roles of ambiguity detection/resolution in evaluation effects. 7 page(s...|$|R
