Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} {{the relationships among}} professional efficacy, emotional exhaustion, and job characteristics (job demands and job control) {{in the context of}} a two-wave panel study among 828 Dutch police officers. Based on the demand-control model, we expected that high demands/high control would be positively related to professional efficacy, and that high demands/low control would be related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion. Moreover, we hypothesized that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion would lead to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> professional efficacy and that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy would lead to low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion. Structural equation modelling largely supported these predictions. High demands were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion; <b>high</b> control was longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy. Further, efficacy and exhaustion were indeed mutually related. Finally, <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> demands. We conclude that there are complex, yet theoretically, and practically interpretable relations among efficacy, strain and work characteristics. Â© 2010 The British Psychological Society...|$|R

5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E

5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and white sand (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> constitutive carbon-based defenses.

5|$|Brachiopod fossils show great {{diversity}} in the morphology of the shells and lophophore, while the modern genera show less diversity but provide soft-bodied characteristics. Both fossils and extant species have limitations that {{make it difficult to}} produce a comprehensive classification of brachiopods based on morphology. The phylum also has experienced significant convergent evolution and reversals (in which a more recent group seems to have lost a characteristic that is seen in an intermediate group, reverting to a characteristic last seen in an older group). Hence some brachiopod taxonomists believe it is premature to define <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> classification such as order, and recommend instead a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups.|$|E
