Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. For example, local vs non-local learning and shallow vs deep architecture.|$|E

Early explorers such as Alvaro Mexia wrote about them; other information <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>learned</b> through archeological research. The populations of all of these tribes decreased markedly during the period of Spanish control of Florida, mostly due to epidemics of newly introduced infectious diseases, to which the Native Americans had no natural immunity. The diminished population of the original natives allowed outside groups, such as the Seminoles to move into the area starting about 1700.|$|E

25|$|The Caucasian {{origin of}} the Azerbaijanis defines a link between Azeris and their pre-Turkification Caucasian past and mostly applies to the Azeris of the Caucasus, {{most of whom are}} now {{inhabitants}} of what is now the Republic of Azerbaijan. There is evidence that, despite repeated invasions and migrations, aboriginal Caucasians may have been culturally assimilated, first by Iranians, such as the Alans, and later by the Oghuz Turks. Considerable information <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>learned</b> about the Caucasian Albanians including their language, history, early conversion to Christianity, and close ties to the Armenians. Many academics believe that the Udi language, still spoken in Azerbaijan, is a remnant of the Albanians' language.|$|E
25|$|Appalachian folk {{became a}} major {{influence}} on styles like country music and bluegrass. It {{is one of the few}} regional styles of old-time music that, since World War II, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>learned</b> and widely practiced in all areas of the United States and Canada (as well as in Europe, Australia, and elsewhere). In some cases (as in the Midwest and Northeast), its popularity has eclipsed the indigenous old-time traditions of these regions. There is a particularly high concentration of performers playing Appalachian folk music on the East and West Coasts (especially in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and the Pacific Northwest). A number of American classical composers, in particular Henry Cowell and Aaron Copland, have composed works that merge the idioms of Appalachian folk music with the Old World–based classical tradition.|$|E
500|$|Mellon {{was aware}} of which artists had {{submitted}} which designs, and {{has been accused of}} discriminating against Fraser as a woman. [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen stated, [...] "it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>learned</b> that Mellon knew all along who had submitted the winning models, and his male chauvinism partly or wholly motivated his unwillingness to let a woman win." [...] Bowers, however, noted that Mellon had approved Fraser's designs for commemorative coins several times, as well as those by other women, and that no contemporary source speaks to any bias on Mellon's part. [...] Bowers called the belief [...] "modern numismatic fiction". [...] Fraser's design was used in 1999 as a commemorative half eagle issued 200 years after Washington's death.|$|E

500|$|Since {{at least}} the time of Ramon y Cajal (1852-1934), psychologists have speculated that the brain stores memory by {{altering}} the strength of connections between neurons that are simultaneously active. [...] This idea was formalized by Donald Hebb in 1949, but for many years remained unexplained. In 1973, Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo described a phenomenon in the rabbit hippocampus that appeared to meet Hebb's specifications: [...] a change in synaptic responsiveness induced by brief strong activation and lasting for hours or days or longer. [...] This phenomenon was soon referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP). [...] As a candidate mechanism for long-term memory, LTP has since been studied intensively, {{and a great deal}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>learned</b> about it. However, the complexity and variety of the intracellular signalling cascades that can trigger LTP is acknowledged as preventing a more complete understanding.|$|E
500|$|Sperm whales usually dive between , and {{sometimes}} , {{in search of}} food. Such dives can last more than an hour. They feed on several species, notably the giant squid, but also the colossal squid, octopuses, and fish like demersal rays, but their diet is mainly medium-sized squid. Some prey may be taken accidentally while eating other items. Most {{of what is known}} about deep sea squid <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>learned</b> from specimens in captured sperm whale stomachs, although more recent studies analysed feces. One study, carried out around the Galápagos, found that squid from the genera Histioteuthis (62%), Ancistrocheirus (16%), and Octopoteuthis (7%) weighing between [...] were the most commonly taken. Battles between sperm whales and giant squid or colossal squid have never been observed by humans; however, white scars are believed to be caused by the large squid. One study published in 2010 collected evidence that suggests that female sperm whales may collaborate when hunting Humboldt squid. Tagging studies have shown that sperm whales hunt upside down at the bottom of their deep dives. It is suggested that the whales can see the squid silhouetted above them against the dim surface light.|$|E

However, this view has been criticized because consciousness has yet to be shown to be a process, and the so-called [...] "hard problem" [...] of relating consciousness directly to brain activity remains elusive.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} contended that [...] "Pozzo and Lucky are simply Didi and Gogo writ large", {{unbalanced}} as their relationship is. However, Pozzo's dominance is noted to be superficial; [...] "upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that Lucky always possessed more {{influence in the}} relationship, for he danced, and more importantly, thought – not as a service, {{but in order to}} fill a vacant need of Pozzo: he committed all of these acts for Pozzo. As such, since the first appearance of the duo, the true slave had always been Pozzo." [...] Pozzo credits Lucky with having given him all the culture, refinement, and ability to reason that he possesses. His rhetoric <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>learned</b> by rote. Pozzo's [...] "party piece" [...] on the sky is a clear example: as his memory crumbles, he finds himself unable to continue under his own steam.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spectacular}} {{scale of}} a Giant eruption, combined with relatively frequent activity in recent years, {{has caused the}} geyser to be the object of much study and much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>learned</b> about its eruptive behavior. Giant steams and splashes even during inactive periods, but eruptions can happen only during so-called [...] "hot periods" [...] when there are changes in {{the activity of the}} other springs on the Giant Platform as well as more intense splashing in Giant itself. Hot periods typically last a few minutes, and most do not lead to an eruption. When the hot period ends, activity on the Platform returns to normal, and it may be tens of minutes to hours before the next hot period occurs. When Giant does erupt, the activity can be quite dramatic, lasting about an hour and sometimes reaching over 250 feet.|$|E
