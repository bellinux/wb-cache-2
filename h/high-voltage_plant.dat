40|$|Partial {{discharges}} (PD) generate wideband {{radio frequency}} interference and, consequently, can be detected using radio receiving equipment. Due to the advances in ultra-high-speed sampling equipment, {{it is possible to}} accurately measure the propagation of the PD wavefront as it passes through a 4 element antenna array. From these measurements, the three-dimensional position of the PD source can be calculated using an iterative algorithm. The locating equipment is suitable for use within the vicinity of energized <b>high-voltage</b> <b>plant</b> and can locate sources up to 15 m from the array. Results are presented showing the location ability of the equipment under laboratory and field conditions. A significant advantage is the ability to detect PD sources in energized plant without the need for outages or electrical connections...|$|E
40|$|Investigations are {{reported}} into {{a range of}} defects causing partial discharge (PD) activity in high-voltage oil-insulated equipment. The aim is to explore the relationship between radiated ultra-high frequency (UHF) signals and electric charge in a PD current pulse for PD sources in oil insulation. Experiments are performed under high-voltage AC conditions using electrode configurations that included a sharp protrusion, a bad contact, and a free metallic particle. A broadband current transformer is {{used to measure the}} PD current pulses with the UHF signals being detected using a pair of sensors mounted inside a metal tank surrounding the PD sources. Current pulses and UHF signals were recorded simultaneously using an oscilloscope with a bandwidth of 3 GHz. The level of correlation between the energy of the radiated UHF signals and the charge content of PD pulses is shown to vary depending on the defect type. Polarity-dependent UHF spectral content and ratio of UHF signal energies measured at the two sensors are shown to exhibit characteristics dependent on the discharge behaviour. These results and the analysis procedures introduced will {{contribute to the development of}} effective UHF monitoring systems for oil-insulated <b>high-voltage</b> <b>plant...</b>|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} for analyzing partial discharge (PD) signals based on ultra-high frequency (UHF) measurements is presented, using results from site tests. Signals from simultaneously active discharge sources can be mapped {{according to their}} point of origin {{in a manner that}} will simplify the interpretation of phase-resolved discharge patterns. The scheme has the potential to allow automated location and tracking of multiple discharge sources in power transformers and other metal-clad <b>high-voltage</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
50|$|Based on the {{opinions}} of Galileo Ferraris, the Italian government ordered a power transformer for Rome, which was installed in October 1886. Later, they designed a power plant for Tivoli, built by Ganz, with six water turbines and 5000 V, which were worked in parallel with the old steam engine generators. This {{was the first time}} in history two <b>high-voltage</b> power <b>plants</b> were connected.|$|R
40|$|Factory {{testing of}} a created <b>high-voltage</b> complex (<b>plant)</b> has been conducted. The complex {{consists}} of two pulse generators with the repetition rate of up to 50, 000 pulses per second and load reactors with pulsed discharges - corona and barrier ones. Transistor (IGBT) keys are used as energy switches. The efficient mode of coke gas methane conversion (steam reforming) to syngas has been obtained with application of the complex created. A unidirectional action of the pulsed discharges, the gas mixture temperature, and a nickel catalyst has reduced the specific energy consumption for synthesis gas regeneration during the conversion. A feasible mechanism of this conversion is described...|$|R
50|$|Burshtyn TES is a {{coal-fired}} power plant of Zakhidenergo located in Halych Raion 6 km south-east from Burshtyn, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Ukraine. It has two chimneys which were built in 1966 are also used as <b>high-voltage</b> pylon. The <b>plant</b> has 12 units with a total installed capacity of 2,334 MW. It has a 330 kV double-circuit connection to the 750/330 kV substation called ZahidnoUkrainska (WestUkraine).|$|R
50|$|A {{valve hall}} is a {{building}} which contains the valves of the static inverters of a <b>high-voltage</b> direct current <b>plant.</b> The valves consist of thyristors, or at older plants, mercury arc rectifiers. Mercury arc rectifiers are usually supported by insulators {{mounted on the}} floor, while thyristor valves may be either supported by insulators or hung {{from the roof of}} the valve hall. The latter required a stronger ceiling structure, however the hall and the static inverter can better survive earthquakes compared to valve structures standing on the floor.|$|R
5000|$|Town {{settlement}} in the Seyðisfjörður area started in 1848. The town was settled by Norwegian fishermen. These settlers also built some of the wooden buildings which still exist in the town. Another now-deserted settlement nearby in the fjord, Vestddalseyri was {{the site for the}} world's first modern industrialized whaling station. It was established in 1864 by the renowned American whaler Thomas Welcome Roys and run by him and his workforce until 1866. Both settlements served primarily as fishing and trading posts. The first telegraph cable connecting Iceland to Europe made landfall in Seyðisfjörður in 1906, making it a hub for international telecommunications well past the middle of last century. In 1913 a dam was made in the main river, harnessing power for the country's first <b>high-voltage</b> AC power <b>plant</b> together with a distribution network for street lighting and home use, also {{the first of its kind}} in Iceland. Seyðisfjörður was used as a base for British/American forces during World War II and remnants of this activity are visible throughout the fjord, including a landing strip no longer in use and an oil tanker [...] that was bombed and sunk. It remains a divers' wreck at the bottom of the fjord.|$|R
40|$|The plasmid pYDH 208, which confers {{the ability}} to {{catabolize}} the mannityl opines mannopine and agropine, was mobilized into the nonpathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strain Cit 7. The growth of the mannityl opine-catabolizing strain Cit 7 (pYDH 208) was {{compared with that of}} the near-isogenic non-opine-catabolizing strain Cit 7 xylE on leaves of wild-type tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) and transgenic mannityl opine-producing tobacco plants (N. tabacum cv. Xanthi, line 2 - 26). The population size of Cit 7 (pYDH 208) was significantly greater on the lower leaves of transgenic plants than on middle or upper leaves of those plants. The population size of Cit 7 (pYDH 208) on lower leaves of transgenic plants was also significantly greater than the population size of Cit 7 xylE on similar leaves of wild-type <b>plants.</b> <b>High-voltage</b> paper electrophoresis demonstrated higher levels of mannityl opines in washings from lower- and mid-level leaves than in washings from upper-level leaves. The ability of Cit 7 (pYDH 208) to catabolize mannityl opines in the carbon-limited phyllosphere increased the carrying capacity of the lower leaves of transgenic plants for Cit 7 (pYDH 208). In coinoculations, the increase in the ratio of population sizes of Cit 7 (pYDH 208) to Cit 7 xylE on transgenic plants was apparently due to a subtle difference in the growth rates of the two strains and to the difference in final population sizes. An ability to utilize additional carbon sources on the transgenic plants also enabled Cit 7 (pYDH 208) to achieve a higher degree of coexistence with Cit 7 xylE on transgenic plants than on wild-type plants. This supports the hypothesis that the level of coexistence between epiphytic bacterial populations can be altered through nutritional resource partitioning...|$|R
