40|$|Solution of {{the problem}} of {{alimentation}} structure improvement is related to creation of functional foodstuff with a balanced content of the major nutrient materials enriched in missing micronutrients and, at the same time, being daily products. Multicomponent structure of vegetable oils provides ample opportunities for developing of products preventing deficiency in essential fatty acids, vitamins andother physiologically functional ingredients. <b>Grape-seed</b> <b>oil</b> is of high bioavailability determined by a complex of biologically active substances, bioflavanoids, a group of vitamins, being the most important of them. Physiological effect of <b>grape-seed</b> <b>oil</b> includes anti-cholesterol property preventing cardio-vascular diseases. The thesis covers studies of vegetable oil mixtures {{made on the basis of}} sunflower and grape-seed oils. The study covers oxidative stability of vegetable oil mixture, based on determination of intensity of primary and secondary oxidation products formation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} fatty acids, {{emulsifiers}} and plant oils were studied {{with respect to}} their potential to support the growth and extra-cellular polysaccharide production of Tremella cinnabarina in submerged culture. The extra-cellular polysaccharide (EPS) production and mycelial growth were substantially increased by supplementation with certain fatty acids in the medium. Oleic acid, sorbitan mono-oleate and <b>grape-seed</b> <b>oil</b> significantly enhanced EPS production which were 1. 5, 1. 6 and 1. 3 folds, respectively, in comparison to the control. In case of lipids, the results indicated that the extent of stimulation or inhibition was associated with the types and levels of lipids. However, when lipids were used as sole carbon source, poor growth and lack of EPS production were observed...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{extended}} definition of “biomass” {{given in the}} EU Directive 2009 / 28 /EC (on renewable energy sources), our attention was recently focused on the assessment and quantification of the biomethane potential (BMP) of: (1) some agricultural residues having a peculiar relevance at Italian national scale, i. e., grape-seeds and plum-stones; (2) a flowering plant, scientifically classified as Isatis Tinctoria L., widely used for the indigo blue colour extraction in the Urbino dukedom (Marche Region, Central Italy, Adriatic Sea side) during the Renaissance epoch. Concerning the Isatis Tinctoria L., our research intention is to consider innovative options for its reevaluation, including the potential bioenergy recovery. The anaerobic digestion tests on the selected substrates were performed in batch mode and at mesophilic conditions. A lab-scale system representing {{a variant of the}} Owen et al. (1979) serum-bottle technique was employed in these experiments. A digested sludge from a large wastewater treatment plant was used as the inoculum. The feeding mixtures were prepared observing some precise inoculum-to-substrate (I/S) ratios as defined on a volatile solids (VS) basis. The specific methane yield (SMY) values (expressed as Nml CH 4 gVS- 1), obtained for the aforementioned residues, resulted not so strictly dependent on the I/S ratio as highly connected with the particular biochemical composition of the feeding materials. For instance, concerning the grape-seeds, the I/S ratio of 1 gave arise to a higher methane production yield as compared with the I/S ratio of 0. 5, probably because of a major presence of bacteria in the overall mixture providing a more efficient biochemical degradation of the <b>grape-seed</b> <b>oils.</b> On the contrary, the I/S ratio of 0. 5 improved appreciably the methane yield of the plum-stones, rather than the I/S of 1. The increasing of the substrate concentration, indeed, could ensure a broader availability of organic substances for the bacteria, considering that plum-stone is noticeably characterized by a consistent lignin content. Within an integrated research approach, detailed chemical-physical characterisations of the obtained digestates were also carried out, in particular: (1) chemical analyses (COD, calcium carbonate, elemental analysis, and IR spectroscopy); and (2) thermal analyses (differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis DTA/TG) ...|$|R

Within an integrated research approach, interesting chemical-physical characterizations of the final digestates were also carried out. In particular: 1) moisture and loss on ignition (LOI) analyses were executed to evaluate volatile and fixed solids; 2) chemical (calcium carbonate, elemental analysis C, N, H, S and IR spectroscopy) and thermal (differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis DTA/TGA) analyses were performed on the digestate solid component. They will be properly discussed in the paper and compared and critically evaluated with the obtained methane yields...|$|R
