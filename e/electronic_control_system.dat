5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B. It {{differed}} from the original aircraft in having a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera added {{to the top of}} the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries head-up display (HUD), provisions for night vision goggles, and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and chaff dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).|$|E

Instead, the <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of the inertial navigation system is modified to make the platform behave as if it were attached to a pendulum. The inertial platform is mounted on gimbals, and an <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> keeps it pointed in a constant direction with respect to the three axes. As the vehicle moves, the gyroscopes detect changes in orientation, and a feedback loop applies signals to torquers to rotate the platform on its gimbals to keep it pointed along the axes.|$|E

Road surface {{identification}} {{is of great}} significance in vehicle active safety <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper proposes a real-time road surface identification algorithm {{on the basis of}} the estimated instantaneous road adhesive coefficient. Based on Fuzzy-PID controller and automatic road surface identification, the actual slip ratio can be controlled at the optimal slip ratio precisely, which can promote the ABS and braking performance largely. The braking simulation tests are conducted on pre-set varying road surface conditions. And the results show that the identified results are in good agreement with the pre-set road surface, the proposed algorithm can be conveniently used for various active safety <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> of vehicles...|$|R
