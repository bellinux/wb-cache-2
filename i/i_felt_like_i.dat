5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> knew him very well.|$|E
25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. I felt the rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E
500|$|When {{comparing}} work on Batman Forever, Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, explained, [...] "It {{just felt}} like everything got a little soft the second time. On Batman Forever, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was making a movie. The second time, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was making a kid's toy commercial." [...] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable {{than the one he}} wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, [...] "Joel [...] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of {{set the tone for the}} film." [...] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from [...] "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy." [...] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.|$|E

500|$|Gravel {{took the}} 1980 defeat hard, recalling years later: [...] "I had lost my career. I lost my marriage. I {{was in the}} {{doldrums}} for ten years after my defeat," [...] and [...] "Nobody wanted to hire me for anything important. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was worthless. I didn't know what I could do." [...] By his own later description, Gravel had been a womanizer while in the Senate, and in December 1980 {{he and his wife}} Rita separated.

500|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Trent Reznor expressed his intentions to write {{material for a}} new release while on tour promoting With Teeth. He reportedly began work on the new album by September 2006. Reznor devised much of the album's musical direction on his laptop. Reznor told Kerrang! in a later interview, [...] "When I was on the [...] tour, to keep myself busy I just really hunkered down and was working on music the whole time, so this kept me in a creative mode and when I finished the tour <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> wasn't tired and wanted to keep at it." ...|$|E

500|$|Production and filming for {{the episode}} were rushed. The scene {{featuring}} The Smoking Man and Scully eating {{dinner at a}} restaurant was filmed on two different days: Anderson's side of the scene was shot on one day and Davis' side was shot on another. The short schedule resulted in some quick scene construction, most notably for the dock sequence {{near the end of}} the episode. A majority of the lake scenes were filmed at Lake Sherwood in California. A stunt actor, Danny Weselis, filled in for Anderson during the scenes that called for her to drive the motor boat. [...] "En Ami" [...] was directed by Rob Bowman and marked his last contribution to the show: [...] "Artistically <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> couldn't help any more," [...] he explained.|$|E

[...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, {{you have to get}} your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me." ...|$|E
500|$|During most of Wade's time at Marquette, {{his mother}} was either eluding the law or serving time in jail for selling crack cocaine. On October 14, 2001, JoLinda {{declared}} that she would change her life and get clean while attending a service at a Chicago church. Wade, then a sophomore at Marquette, went home for Christmas {{to be with his}} mom, who he believed was clean and sober {{for the first time in}} his life. However, [...] JoLinda admitted to him that she was actually going back to prison. Wade told ESPN, [...] "I was hurt because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was just getting my mom back, and now she had to leave again." [...] On January 2, 2002, his mother went back to prison to serve her 14-month sentence. She says she has been clean since 2003.|$|E

He {{was considered one of}} the top Canadians committing to an NCAA program that year, in a list headlined by Andrew Nicholson and Kris Joseph. As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the first day, I was accepted, as soon as I stepped on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few guys here who I knew and as soon as we came in August, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E
500|$|Gregg Allman's lyrical {{contributions}} to the band's debut album have been called [...] "remarkably mature lyrical conceptions for such a young man, expertly executed in a minimalist, almost haiku style." [...] Allman's inspiration came from his time in Los Angeles {{as a part of}} Hour Glass, [...] "getting fucked by different land sharks in the business," [...] experiencing great frustration among fierce competition. The traditional blues songs were, likewise, regarded as [...] "songs that were so good they couldn’t be left off the album." [...] On the writing of the record, Allman wrote in his memoir My Cross to Bear, [...] "I wrote most of that whole first record in that one week. I had total peace of mind. L.A. and all its changes didn’t even cross my mind. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was starting all over, which I was." [...] Most of the songs on the album were written at Rose Hill Cemetery.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, it was {{announced}} that Russell Tovey would appear in Sherlock series two in its second episode. Tovey, who liked Sherlock for staying true to the style of the novels despite its modern twist, said of the experience: [...] "It's amazing {{to be a part of}} it", adding, [...] "I got to act with Benedict and Martin which was awesome". The actor also explained that during his scenes, [...] "We did about two and a half weeks of night shoots in Cardiff and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had jetlag." [...] In terms of Henry's character, Tovey did not want him to be a [...] "jibbering wreck", but rather mature and truthful as well as damaged and haunted. Gatiss also made Henry display signs of survivor guilt. Tovey's nephew auditioned for the part of a younger Henry, but another child actor was cast for the role as the nephew was considered too young.|$|E
5000|$|During the 2015 offseason, Garrett {{decided to}} stop using his social media account on Twitter, citing: [...] "There's a lot of negativity on there I don’t need in my life. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> If <b>I</b> want to move forward {{as a person and}} as a {{football}} player, I don’t need other people's opinions and other things to stick with me or be in my mind when I have other things to keep doing." ...|$|R

Saying the same old **** and playing the same sounding music, and probably playing it a bit too safe, choosing the obvious bangers and hot promos rather than pushing myself to dig out those hidden gems <b>like</b> <b>I</b> always used to." ...|$|R
500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E
500|$|... "To Zion," [...] {{among the}} more introspective tracks on the album, spoke about how Hill's family comes before her career and her {{decision}} to have her first child, even though many at the time encouraged her to abort the pregnancy, so as to not conflict with her burgeoning career. In an interview she discussed the song's origin and significance, commenting [...] "Names wouldn't come when I was ready to have him. The only name that came to me was Zion. I was like, 'is Zion {{too much of a}} weight to carry?' But this little boy, man. I would say he personally delivered me from my emotional and spiritual drought. He just replenished my newness. When he was born, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was born again." [...] She further stated: [...] "I wanted it to be a revolutionary song about a spiritual movement, and also about my spiritual change, going {{from one place to another}} because of my son." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Redd Stylez, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Diplo, who also {{produced}} the song. Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment I had with a girl where <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It was a sad feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating with me about the idea and how many times you think things are perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E

I could not consistently depart until the downpour had ceased.|$|R
5000|$|Witness 22, who {{originally}} claimed she saw Wilson kill Brown in cold blood, admitted she lied to investigators and {{never saw the}} incident at all.

500|$|Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who {{raped and}} murdered Teena. Sarsgaard {{was one of the}} first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his {{character}} to be [...] "likable, sympathetic even", because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter. In an interview with The Independent, Sarsgaard said, [...] "I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was just like the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me." [...] Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom Roseanne, as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.|$|E
500|$|The band began touring in January 1994 in Oceania and Japan, {{areas where}} the record came out early. The band had never toured these regions before. This round of touring ended in February 1994, and then in March 1994 the band moved on to Europe. The band began a theater tour in the United States on May 27, 1994. The opening acts were Tad and Eleven. In late 1994, after touring in support of Superunknown, doctors {{discovered}} that Cornell had severely strained his vocal cords. Soundgarden cancelled several shows to avoid causing any permanent damage. Cornell said, [...] "I think we kinda overdid it! We were playing five or six nights a week and my voice pretty much took a beating. Towards {{the end of the}} American tour <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> could still kinda sing, but I wasn't really giving the band a fair shake. You don't buy a ticket to see some guy croak for two hours! That seemed like kind of a rip off." [...] The band made up the dates later in 1995.|$|E
500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to slip a bowling ball {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, [...] "This might sound odd, but I think you need another mattress. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.|$|E

I didn't have that parental guidance, and I kind of took advantage of it because I was a stupid idiot. I decided not to go to school a couple of times, go when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it. <b>I</b> always lied to my brothers and sisters. They'd ask: 'Are you going to school?' I'd say 'yeah'.
