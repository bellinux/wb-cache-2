Many foreign-born Armenians are multilingual, speaking at least one language other than Armenian and English. For instance, Armenians from Armenia might know Russian, those from Lebanon and Syria may know Arabic and French, almost all Iranian Armenians speak Persian and Istanbul Armenians speak Turkish.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the {{proclamation}} of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to Bábís <b>in</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> Iraq who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bahá'ís to be united and detached from the world. He also started to write about distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the main deployments, Southern Rhodesian servicemen served in other theatres of the war.

5|$|The Code of Hammurabi was {{inscribed on}} a stele {{and placed in}} a public place so that all could see it, {{although}} it is thought that few were literate. The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, Susa; it was rediscovered there in 1901 <b>in</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by scribes on 12 tablets. Unlike earlier laws, it was written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylon, and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the domesticated sheep goes back to between 11000 and 9000 BC, and the {{domestication}} of the wild mouflon in ancient Mesopotamia. Sheep are among the first animals to have been domesticated by humans, and {{there is evidence of}} sheep farming in Iranian statuary dating to that time period. These sheep were primarily raised for meat, milk, and skins. Woolly sheep began to be developed around 6000 BC <b>in</b> <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> cultures such as the Persians relied on sheep's wool for trading. They were then imported to Africa and Europe via trading.|$|E

5|$|C. m. soemmerringii (Fischer, 1811) {{is found}} in {{north-eastern}} Europe and north and central Asia, from the former Soviet Union to Lake Baikal and north-west Mongolia, and south to Turkey, Israel and the eastern Himalayas. Its south-western limits are Serbia and southern Romania. It winters <b>in</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> northern India (Kashmir). Johann Fischer von Waldheim described this taxon as Corvus soemmerringii in 1811, noting its differences from populations in western Europe. Its species name was given in honour of the German anatomist, Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring. It is distinguished by the nape and {{the sides of the}} neck being paler, creating a contrasting black crown and lighter grey part collar.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to divert {{attention}} from economic difficulties <b>in</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> from a growing nationalist movement, a campaign of persecution against the Bahá'ís was instituted. An approved and coordinated anti-Bahá'í campaign (to incite public passion against the Bahá'ís) started in 1955 and it included the spreading of anti-Bahá'í propaganda on national radio stations and in official newspapers. In the late 1970s the Shah's regime consistently lost legitimacy due to criticism that it was pro-Western. As the anti-Shah movement gained ground and support, revolutionary propaganda was spread which alleged that some of the Shah's advisors were Bahá'ís. Bahá'ís were portrayed as economic threats, and as supporters of Israel and the West, and societal hostility against the Bahá'ís increased.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found <b>in</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E

5|$|Robert Wesley Rackstraw is {{a retired}} pilot and ex-convict who served on an army {{helicopter}} crew and other units during the Vietnam War. He {{came to the attention}} of the Cooper task force in February 1978, after he was arrested <b>in</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> deported to the U.S. to face explosive possession and check kiting charges. Several months later, while released on bail, Rackstraw attempted to fake his own death by radioing a false mayday call and telling controllers that he was bailing out of a rented plane over Monterey Bay. Police later arrested him in Fullerton on an additional charge of forging federal pilot licenses; the plane he claimed to have ditched was found, repainted, in a nearby hangar. Cooper investigators noted his physical resemblance to Cooper composite sketches (although he was only 28 in 1971), military parachute training, and criminal record, but eliminated him as a suspect in 1979 after no direct evidence of his involvement could be found.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army under Montgomery spent February at Medinine in {{south-eastern}} Tunisia. Expecting {{an imminent}} {{attack by the}} Axis, the Eighth Army mustered every anti-tank gun it could from Egypt and Libya. The 102nd (Northumberland Hussars) Anti-Tank Regiment, including the Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery under Major Savory, duly advanced west from Benghazi and reached the front on 5 March 1943. The Germans and Italians assaulted Medinine the next day, but failed to make much progress and abandoned their attack by the evening. The Rhodesian gunners, held in reserve, did not {{take part in the}} engagement but were attacked from the air. The Rhodesians of the KRRC, now under the 7th Motor Brigade, moved up from Libya during early March. No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron, which had spent 1942 and the first months of 1943 <b>in</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> Iraq, returned to North Africa the same month, with the future Prime Minister Ian Smith in its ranks as a Hurricane pilot.|$|E
5|$|The future Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith {{served in}} the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War, {{interrupting}} his studies at Rhodes University in South Africa to join up in 1941. Following a year's pilot instruction in Southern Rhodesia under the Empire Air Training Scheme, he was posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron, then stationed in the Middle East, in late 1942. Smith received six weeks' operational training in the Levant, then entered active service as a pilot officer <b>in</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> Iraq. No. 237 Squadron, which had operated in the Western Desert from 1941 to early 1942, returned to that front in March 1943. Smith flew in the Western Desert until October that year, when a crash during a night takeoff resulted in serious injuries, including facial disfigurements and a broken jaw. Following reconstructive plastic surgery to his face, other operations and five months' convalescence, Smith rejoined No. 237 Squadron in Corsica in May 1944. While there, he attained his highest rank, flight lieutenant.|$|E

5|$|The scandal was {{compounded}} when Oliver North {{destroyed or}} hid pertinent documents between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During North's trial in 1989, his secretary, Fawn Hall, testified extensively about helping North alter, shred, and remove official United States National Security Council (NSC) {{documents from the}} White House. According to the New York Times, enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it. North's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved <b>in</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North's notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the Freedom of Information Act.|$|E
