5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} <b>four</b> <b>digits</b> on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some {{salamanders}} have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner}} of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E

50|$|The <b>four</b> <b>digit</b> system {{developed}} by the Army Military Aviation was inherited by the Air Force. Seven basic functions for the aircraft in service were defined, which corresponded to the first <b>digit</b> in a <b>four</b> <b>digit</b> serial number.

5|$|Sitakunda {{was to be}} {{the landing}} station for a {{submarine}} communications cable, but the cable now comes ashore at Cox's Bazaar. The cable has frequently been severed by miscreants, often in the Sitakunda area, since its installation on 21 May 2006. Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication (BNNRC) has brought internet services to the upazila by establishing Rural Knowledge Centres (RKC). BTTB and RanksTel run telephone services in the upazila. The telephone area code for Sitakunda is 3028, which has to be added to Bangladesh area code +880 when making overseas calls, and the subscriber numbers consist of <b>four</b> <b>digits</b> locally.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from its}} vertebrae, Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton. Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail {{counterbalancing}} {{the head and}} body, maintaining its center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus. Its feet had <b>four</b> <b>digits</b> each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was {{much smaller than the}} rest and did not make contact with the ground.|$|E
5|$|Privacy Control can warn users when sending {{confidential}} information. It {{can also}} be configured to block the transmission. It allows users to specify how the information can sent, such as via IM or e-mail. Item-specific exceptions allow users to control where there data can be sent. However, PC Pro found a flaw in the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted {{on the list of}} confidential information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of a credit card number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in <b>four</b> <b>digits.</b> PC Magazine also noted the fact anyone who can login to the computer can view the database of private information. For that reason, Symantec recommends entering only the last portion of sensitive information.|$|E

5|$|Psittacosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were basal to almost all known ceratopsians except Yinlong and perhaps the Chaoyangsauridae. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, Psittacosaurus itself was {{probably}} not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of Psittacosaurus had only <b>four</b> <b>digits</b> on the hand. In addition, the antorbital fenestra, {{an opening in the}} skull between the eye socket and nostril, was lost during the evolution of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other archosaurs. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would evolve a second time.|$|E
5|$|The {{species of}} Psittacosaurus vary {{in size and}} {{specific}} features of the skull and skeleton, but share the same overall body shape. The best-known—P. mongoliensis—can reach 2metres (6.5ft) in length. The maximum adult body weight was most likely over 20kilogrammes (44lb) in P. mongoliensis. Several species approach P. mongoliensis in size (P. lujiatunensis, P. neimongoliensis, P. xinjiangensis), while others are somewhat smaller (P. sinensis, P. meileyingensis). The smallest known species, P. ordosensis, is 30% smaller than P. mongoliensis. The largest are P. lujiatunensis and P. sibiricus, although neither is significantly larger than P. mongoliensis. Psittacosaurus postcranial skeletons are more typical of a 'generic' bipedal ornithischian. There are only <b>four</b> <b>digits</b> on the manus ('hand'), {{as opposed to the}} five found in most other ornithischians (including all other ceratopsians), while the four-toed hindfoot is very similar to many other small ornithischians.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{anatomy of}} Heterodontosaurus tucki has been well-described, {{although}} H. tucki {{is generally considered}} the most derived of the Early Jurassic heterodontosaurids, so {{it is impossible to}} know how many of its features were shared with other species. The forelimbs were long for a dinosaur, over 70% of the length of the hindlimbs. The well-developed deltopectoral crest (a ridge for the attachment of chest and shoulder muscles) of the humerus and prominent olecranon process (where muscles that extend the forearm were attached) of the ulna indicate that the forelimb was powerful as well. There were five digits on the manus ('hand'). The first was large, tipped with a sharply curved claw, and would rotate inwards when flexed; Robert Bakker called it the 'twist-thumb'. The second digit was the longest, slightly longer than the third. Both of these digits bore claws, while the clawless fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison. In the hindlimb, the tibia was 30% longer than the femur, which is generally considered an adaptation for speed. The tibia and fibula of the lower leg were fused to the astragalus and calcaneum of the ankle, forming a 'tibiofibiotarsus' convergently with modern birds. Also similarly to birds, the lower tarsal (ankle) bones and metatarsals were fused to form a 'tarsometatarsus.' There are <b>four</b> <b>digits</b> in the pes (hindfoot), with only the second, third, and fourth contacting the ground. The tail, unlike many other ornithischians, did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible. The fragmentary skeleton known for Abrictosaurus has never been fully described, although the forelimb and manus were smaller than in Heterodontosaurus. Also, the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone.|$|E
50|$|Price look-up codes, {{commonly}} called PLU codes, PLU numbers, PLUs, produce codes, or produce labels, are identification numbers affixed to produce in {{grocery stores and}} supermarkets to make check-out and inventory control easier, faster, and more accurate. The code may be a <b>four</b> or five <b>digit</b> number. The <b>four</b> <b>digit</b> PLU codes for produce are assigned randomly within the 3000 and 4000 series, identifying the type of bulk produce, and often including the variety. The <b>four</b> <b>digit</b> codes are used for conventionally grown produce.|$|R
50|$|The {{postal code}} {{has been changed}} from a <b>four</b> <b>digit</b> format to an eight digit format, which {{is shown in the}} example.
