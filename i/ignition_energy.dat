25|$|A {{relatively}} small energy, often {{as little as}} 0.2–2 millijoules, is needed to ignite a flammable mixture of a fuel and air. For the common industrial hydrocarbon gases and solvents, the minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> required for ignition of vapor-air mixture is lowest for the vapor concentration roughly in the middle between the lower explosive limit and the upper explosive limit, and rapidly increases as the concentration deviates from this optimum to either side. Aerosols of flammable liquids may be ignited well below their flash point. Generally, liquid aerosols with particle sizes below 10 micrometers behave like vapors, particle sizes above 40 micrometers behave more like flammable dusts. Typical minimum flammable concentrations of aerosols lay between 15 and 50 g/m3. Similarly, presence of foam {{on the surface of}} a flammable liquid significantly increases ignitability. Aerosol of flammable dust can be ignited as well, resulting in a dust explosion; the lower explosive limit usually lies between 50 and 1000 g/m3; finer dusts tend to be more explosive and requiring less spark energy to set off. Simultaneous presence of flammable vapors and flammable dust can significantly decrease the ignition energy; a mere 1 vol.% of propane in air can reduce the required <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> of dust by 100 times.

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{flammability}} limits have been measured for various dusts in the Fike 1 -m 3 (1000 -L) chamber {{and in the}} Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) 20 -L chamber. The first limit is the minimum explosible concentration (MEC), which was measured at several <b>ignition</b> <b>energies.</b> In addition to the three dusts studied previously (bituminous coal, anthracite coal, and gilsonite), this work continues the effort by adding three additional dusts: RoRo 93, lycopodium, and iron powder. These materials were chosen to extend the testing to non-coal materials {{as well as to}} a metallic dust. The new MEC data corroborate the previous observations that very strong ignitors can overdrive the ignition in the smaller 20 -L chamber. Recommendations are given in regard to appropriate <b>ignition</b> <b>energies</b> {{to be used in the}} two chambers. The study also considered the other limiting component, oxygen. Limiting oxygen concentration (LOC) testing was performed in the same 20 -L and 1 -m 3 vessels for gilsonite, bituminous coal, RoRo 93, and aluminum dusts. The objective was to establish the protocol for testing at different volumes. A limited investigation was made into overdriving in the 20 -L vessel. The LOC results tended to show slightly lower results for the smaller test volume. The results indicated that overdriving could occur and that <b>ignition</b> <b>energies</b> of 2. 5 kJ in the 20 -L vessel would yield comparable results to those in the 1 - m 3 vessel using 10. 0 kJ.

Ignition of a fuel/air mixture is possible only when the rate of liberation of heat near the ignition zone is greater than the heat loss by conduction.

50|$|Explosive atmospheres have {{different}} chemical properties {{that affect the}} likelihood and severity of an explosion. Such properties include flame temperature, minimum <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> upper and lower explosive limits, and molecular weight. Empirical testing is done to determine parameters such as the maximum experimental safe gap (MESG), minimum igniting current (MIC) ratio, explosion pressure and time to peak pressure, spontaneous ignition temperature, and maximum rate of pressure rise.

A means for introducing fresh air for the next explosion is also provided. Acetylene in air has the widest range of explosive limit of any common chemical and also a very low <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> a combination which very reliably produces a loud “bang” explosion compared to other vapor explosions.|$|E

5000|$|Hydrogen {{is being}} {{researched}} as a fuel for vehicles because it produces no carbon dioxide emissions. If hydrogen fuel becomes more popular, {{it has the}} potential to be less expensive than other fuels, if low-cost production via electrolysis can be implemented. Hydrogen can be used and created in fuel cells to power electric motors or burnt directly in combustion engines. BMW has developed a bivalent internal combustion engine that can switch between petroleum and liquid hydrogen fuels. In gasseous form, hydrogen is difficult to store and has a low volumetric energy density. It can be produced in many different ways, but many of the methods produce carbon dioxide. The most promising method is electrolysis. Safety of the hydrogen storage tanks in the event of an accident has been investigated, and various tests show that they do not present any problems. [...] When used as a fuel, hydrogen has a wide range of flammability and low <b>ignition</b> <b>energy.</b> These properties allow hydrogen to be burned using a wide range of air-fuel mixtures, but problems arise with premature ignition. Crankcase ventilation is very important when burning hydrogen, because of the low <b>ignition</b> <b>energy.</b> Proper ventilation is needed to prevent ignition in the crankcase and the formation of water in the engine oil. Hydrogen and natural gas are very similar as fuels, so the differences between the components needed to burn them are trivial, and interoperable systems are easily made.|$|E
