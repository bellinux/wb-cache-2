500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "the 'Good Burger' of animation... plopping us down inside a {{fast-food}} war being fought by sponges, starfish, crabs, tiny plankton and mighty King Neptune." [...] Ed Park of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "No Pixar? No problem! An unstoppable good-mood generator, the resolutely 2-D [...] SpongeBob SquarePants Movie has more yuks than Shark Tale and enough soul to swallow The Polar Express whole." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "an animated adventure that's funnier than Shark Tale and more charming than The Polar Express." [...] Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic said, [...] "Like the TV show it's based on, it's a daffy, enjoyable creation." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the feature a score of {{three out of four}}: [...] "It's not The Incredibles, or one of those animated features that spent zillions on character design, pedigree and verisimilitude. But SpongeBob is a sweet, silly thing with a child-friendly esthetic all its own." [...] Will Lawrence of Empire gave the film four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a film for kids, students, stoners, anyone who enjoys a break from reality." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B-minus grade: [...] "The best moments in his [...] first movie outing are those that feel most TV-like, <b>just</b> <b>another</b> <b>day</b> in the eternally optimistic undersea society created with such contagious silliness by Stephen Hillenburg." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film: [...] "You gotta love SpongeBob. Coolest sponge in the sea, although this one has a suspiciously manufactured look." ...|$|E
60|$|To harrow Rasmunsen's soul further, he {{discovered}} three {{competitors in the}} egg business. It was true that one, a little German, had gone broke and was himself forlornly back-tripping the last pack of the portage; but the other two had boats nearly completed, and were daily supplicating the god of merchants and traders to stay the iron hand of winter for <b>just</b> <b>another</b> <b>day.</b> But the iron hand closed down over the land. Men were being frozen in the blizzard which swept Chilkoot, and Rasmunsen frosted his toes ere he was aware. He found {{a chance to go}} passenger with his freight in a boat just shoving off through the rubble, but two hundred hard cash, was required, and he had no money.|$|E
60|$|Instead {{of going}} to bed she made as {{brilliant}} a light as she could and began to pack, working diligently, though all the while visited by the scenes that might {{take place on the}} coming day--now by the tiresome explanations and farewells, and the whirling journey toward a changed home, now by the alternative of staying <b>just</b> <b>another</b> <b>day</b> and standing again at the roulette-table. But always in this latter scene there was the presence of that Deronda, watching her with exasperating irony, and--the two keen experiences were inevitably revived together--beholding her again forsaken by luck. This importunate image certainly helped to sway her resolve on the side of immediate departure, and to urge her packing to the point which would make a change of mind inconvenient. It had struck twelve when she came into her room, and {{by the time she was}} assuring herself that she had left out only what was necessary, the faint dawn was stealing through the white blinds and dulling her candles. What was the use {{of going to}} bed? Her cold bath was refreshment enough, and she saw that a slight trace of fatigue about the eyes only made her look the more interesting. Before six o'clock she was completely equipped in her gray traveling dress even to her felt hat, for she meant to walk out as soon as she could count on seeing other ladies on their way to the springs. And happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her elbow on the back of the chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without any self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more intense because one's own little core of egoistic sensibility is a supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had a naïve delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her friends' flattery as well as in the looking-glass. And even in this beginning of troubles, while for lack of anything else to do she sat gazing at her image in the growing light, her face gathered a complacency gradual as the cheerfulness of the morning. Her beautiful lips curled into a more and more decided smile, till at last she took off her hat, leaned forward and kissed the cold glass which had looked so warm. How could she believe in sorrow? If it attacked her, she felt the force to crush it, to defy it, or run away from it, as she had done already. Anything seemed more possible than that she could go on bearing miseries, great or small.|$|E

50|$|Upon release, <b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Day</b> went {{relatively}} unnoticed commercially as {{it failed}} to chart nationally. Stricken by the demoralizing and disillusioning outcome, Bunyan began a self-imposed exile from the music industry to live a low-profile lifestyle. Over the years, the album has received more attention among record collectors and bootleggers, resulting in official reissues that sparked a revival in Bunyan's music career. Although it was largely overlooked by the public {{at the time of}} its release, the album's critical standing has improved over the years and today <b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Day</b> is now by many considered one of the best works in British folk.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Day</b> {{was officially}} issued on compact disc {{for the first}} time by Spinney Records in 2000. The reissue {{featured}} four bonus tracks, including [...] "Love Song", which had been issued as the B-side to her 1966 single. The CD release also included the previously-unreleased 1966 demos of [...] "I'd Like to Walk Around in Your Mind" [...] and [...] "Winter Is Blue" [...] (accompanied by Mike Crowther). The final bonus track on the Spinney reissue is a 1969 version of [...] "Iris's Song for Us". The demand for <b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Day</b> prompted Bunyan to return to her music career. After recording and performing {{for the first time}} in 30 years, Bunyan finally released her follow-up album, Lookaftering on Fat Cat Records.|$|R

50|$|In November 1969, Bunyan {{returned}} to England and Boyd organized recording sessions for the subsequent month. Following an extensive day of rehearsals at Sound Techniques, Bunyan completed the entire <b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Day</b> album during a work-extensive three-day period in December 1969. Bunyan {{was joined by}} a wealth of musicians, including John James, Robert Kirby, Robin Williamson of the Incredible String Band, and Dave Swarbrick and Simon Nicol of Fairport Convention. However, Bunyan's diffident approach resulted in her losing control of the songs' arrangements, and only later did she note her reservations toward the album's lack of precision and production. Music historian Richie Unterberger has remarked that despite the multiple influences of outside artists, the drum-less, acoustic arrangements on <b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Day</b> complimented Bunyan's measured and wispy vocals.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Day</b> was {{overlooked}} by the record-buying public {{at the time}} of its release, its critical stature has grown substantially over the years. Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, described the album as [...] "a pleasing yet overly dainty slice of British rock-tinged folk" [...] and goes on to say it was Bunyans most seriously-minded effort up to that point. In his 2010 book, Electric Eden: Unearthing Britains Visionary Music, author Rob Young states [...] "Vashti Bunyans still, small voice of calm, and her bold improvised trek over Britain serves as a powerful symbol of the wider panorama of non-mainstream rock and folk". Young goes on to say that <b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Days</b> themes [...] "existed not in the traditional geographical locations of the Bristish Rock scene...Instead it flowed from zones far more remote: the dual landscape/dreamscape of Britains interior".|$|R
5000|$|Critic Dave Henderson, {{writing for}} Q {{magazine}} in 2000, remarks that [...] "Bunyans voice is lonely, lovelorn and fragile, and with three tracks scored by Nick Drake arranger Robert Kirby this remains an achingly memorable outing". Peter Paphides {{in his review}} for Time Out magazine, writing that <b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Day</b> [...] "chronicle the odyssey north, which explains the unquenchable optimism". In a glowing review for the Internet publication, Pitchfork, music critic Matthew Murphy describes the album as a [...] "sonic sibling to the Boyd-produced Nick Drake albums-- albeit one that chooses fresh air and sunlight over Drakes depressive shadows", before concluding [...] "its unlikely that youll encounter another album as charming or transporting as <b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Day</b> any time soon". John Mulvey in NME magazine notes that despite the albums initial commercial failure, its contents [...] "are gifted with a beauty and purity rare even in her contemporaries".|$|R

50|$|<b>Just</b> <b>Another</b> Diamond <b>Day</b> is {{the debut}} album by the English folk singer-songwriter, Vashti Bunyan, and was {{released}} on Philips Records in December 1970.

The demands of having to care for her newborn child effectively barred Bunyan from promoting the album. Frustrated with the public's lack of response, Bunyan abandoned the music industry to live with the Incredible String Band in a vacant house at Glen Row, in Scotland.
