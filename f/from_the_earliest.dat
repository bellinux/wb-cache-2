5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel.

Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material left over <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E
