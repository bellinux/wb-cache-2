40|$|It {{is crucial}} for the firms, which aim to sustain their {{profitability}} and to survive, to reducetheir operational costs within an environment where competition kept rising. For this reason,minimisation of distribution costs has attracted a special interest as it explains a large share oftotal costs. However, minimisation of distribution costs {{is a very complex}} problem to solvebecause of the fact that distribution costs have various dimensions and thus carry a high level ofuncertainty. A large number of firms in our country try to overcome this uncertainty using theirprevious experience. But, this approach does not allow to capture all the dimensions of thedistribution {{at the same time and}} therefore, experience is an inadequate method to use in thismatter. Nevertheless, in the literature, the use of the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is oftenemphasised to be one of the most efficient way to overcome this problem. In this article, thepractical formulation of the ILP model that normally involves a very complex theoreticalstructure has been shown step by step, thereby top management of firms operating differentindustries can easily adapt for their firms. In addition, a general ILP model developed in thisarticle has applied to the data obtained from a firm operating in food industry with 24 <b>distributing</b> <b>agent</b> and the results indicated that distribution cost of the firm can be reduced about 6 % using the ILP model compared to the experience based distribution costs...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{communication}} is secured by applying cryptographic functions, most notably encryption using cryptographic keys, to prescribed sequences of messages called security protocols. Key distribution protocols are security protocols executed by agents wishing to establish cryptographic keys for future secure communication with each other. Although key distribution protocols are supposedly secure themselves, {{they may be}} attacked by intruders that forge messages by clever manipulation, tricking protocol agents into interacting with them, and violating fundamental security goals such as confidentiality and authentication. Key distribution protocols can be studied at various layers of abstraction, focusing on different aspects of security. Traditionally, such protocols are described using a standard notation that tends to leave several important details regarding the various layers implicit. This makes proving the protocols correctness difficult. Also, implementers and users of security protocol analysis tools are forced {{to fill in the}} gaps where these notations are ambiguous, a process which is errorprone. Therefore, a lack of precise detail in the protocols specifications at any of the layers can lead to protocol insecurity. Formal methods provide well-defined languages that allow precise specifications to be written and subsequent rigorous verification procedures to be performed. Hence formal methods are strongly advocated for security protocol development, especially to specify precise details that commonly-used notations leave implicit, to analyse specifications for vulnerability to attack, and to verify protocol goals and claims of security on those specifications. Previously-published approaches to formal analysis of key distribution protocols are largely based on specifications at the application layer. However, it has been shown in practice that protocols can be vulnerable to attack at any abstraction layer. In particular, by relying on application layer specifications, proofs of correctness may not be accurate with respect to the implementation of the protocol at the lower presentation layer. Motivated by this risk, we provide a general approach for formally specifying key distribution protocols at various layers of abstraction, in a way amenable to formal verification techniques such as model checking and theorem proving. We follow a structured approach in which we consider each layer of abstraction individually to avoid unnecessary complexity. Additionally, our approach allows us to perform cross-layer verification to identify whether implementationdependent type flaw attacks suspected at the application layer are actually possible given the protocols presentation layer design, and to confirm the required presentation layer defences for inclusion in the formal specification. At the trust layer we demonstrate how trust can be incorporated in specifications of key distribution for a more complete understanding of how key distribution and trust management components depend on each other. We provide an abstract specification of a key <b>distributing</b> <b>agent</b> and a hierarchy of suspicious agents based on existing trust management models. As an example, we combine a suspicious agent with the abstract specification of key distribution, and add custom behaviour to precisely describe the key validation policy taken by Pretty Good Privacy. At the authentication layer we demonstrate an approach for identifying the behaviour required by protocol agents to correctly authenticate messages they receive. We identify a series of message authentication protocols, each identifying properties and behaviours of protocol agents for achieving a particular aspect of authentication. By identifying message authentication protocols as subprotocols of a particular key distribution protocol design, we identify those messages that can be authenticated and the properties and behaviours of that design are necessary for doing so. At the application layer we demonstrate how to formalise the behaviour necessary for participating in key distribution protocols, including necessary behaviour identified by authentication layer analyses. We present a generic message structure for specifying the types of recursively-defined messages that may be needed in key distribution protocols. Verification techniques such as model checking and formal proof are applied to find attacks and to determine whether suspected attacks are actually possible given our detailed specifications. At the presentation layer the generic message structure is modified for reasoning with implementation-dependent attacks that rely on presentation layer behaviour. By making presentation layer detail transparent, our specifications are consistent with those at the application layer, thus improving readability and simplifying translation for input to off-the-shelf analysis tools...|$|E
