In a neoclassical model, for the capital-labor ratios to equalize, {{in the presence of}} <b>factor</b> <b>mobility,</b> either jobs flow to workers in the form of capital inflows or workers flow to jobs in the form of migration, in countries with relatively low capital-labor ratios.

50|$|Factor price {{equalization}} is {{an economic}} theory, by Paul A. Samuelson (1948), which states that the prices of identical factors of production, such as the wage rate, or the rent of capital, will be equalized across countries {{as a result of}} international trade in commodities. The theorem assumes that there are two goods and two factors of production, for example capital and labour. Other key assumptions of the theorem are that each country faces the same commodity prices, because of free trade in commodities, uses the same technology for production, and produces both goods. Crucially these assumptions result in factor prices being equalized across countries without the need for <b>factor</b> <b>mobility,</b> such as migration of labor or capital flows.|$|E
50|$|Trade {{in goods}} and {{services}} can to some extent be considered a substitute for factor movements. In the absence of trade barriers, even when factors are not mobile, {{there is a tendency}} toward factor price equalization. In the absence of barriers to <b>factor</b> <b>mobility,</b> commodity prices will move toward equalization, even if commodities may not freely move. However, complete substitution between factors of production and commodities is only theoretical, and will only be fully realized under the economic model called the Heckscher-Ohlin model, or the 2x2x2 model, wherein there are two-countries, two-commodities, and two factors of production. While the assumptions of that model are unlikely to hold true in reality, the model is still informative as to how prices of factors and commodities react as trade barriers are erected or removed.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Physical {{activity}} (PA) can modify cardiovascular {{and other}} health risks in people with stroke, but we know little about long-term PA in this group. This study aims to describe PA levels and investigate relationships between PA, cardiovascular risk <b>factors,</b> <b>mobility</b> and participant characteristics (eg, age, mood and fatigue) in the 2 [*]years following rehabilitation discharge after first stroke. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a longitudinal observational study with follow-up at 6, 12 and 24 months after rehabilitation discharge. Inclusion criteria are broad; excluding only those with previous stroke, palliative diagnosis, living more than 2 [*]hours from the centre or admitted less than 5 [*]days. The primary outcome of interest is duration of moderate to vigorous PA (min/day) measured by the Sensewear MF Armband (SWAB). Secondary outcomes include other PA measures measured with the SWAB; cardiovascular risk factors (eg, systolic blood pressure, fasting lipid profile and smoking status), mobility (10 m walk test), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Fatigue Severity Scale. All outcomes, except blood tests, are gathered at each time point. The target sample size is 77. We will explore associations between PA levels, cardiovascular risk <b>factors,</b> <b>mobility</b> and participant characteristics at baseline compared with 6, 12 and 24 months using random-effects regression modelling. The long-term PA of stroke survivors is largely unknown. We hope to identify factors that influence PA and cardiovascular risk in this population, which may help health professionals target the stroke survivors most at risk and implement appropriate treatment, preventative strategies and education. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval was granted from Alfred Hospital and La Trobe University Research Ethics Committees. The study results will be disseminated {{in a number of}} ways including journal publication and international conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN 12613000196741.

The change of Zn and Cu fractions with depth for non-irrigated soil showed that Zn and Cu are strongly associated with the residual fraction.

He then tests his ideas quantitatively on U.

40|$|Railway freight {{transportation}} presents {{a degree of}} complexity which frequently makes impossible to model it with sufficient precision. Currently, energetic and environmental impacts of {{freight transportation}} are usually modelled following average data, which {{do not reflect the}} characteristics of specific lines. These models allow qualitative approximations which may be used as criteria for designing high-level transportation policies: road-train modal shift, regional energetic planning or environmental policies. This paper proposes a methodology for estimating railway consumption associated to a specific railway line which yields a new degree of precision. It is based on estimating different contributions to railway consumption by a collection of <b>factors,</b> <b>mobility,</b> operation, or infrastructure-related. This procedure also allows applying the methodology for designing transportation policies in detail: evaluating impact of modal shift, consumption and pollutant emissions on a specific line, as well as the effect of building tunnels, reducing slopes, improving traffic control, etc. A comparison of the estimations given by the conventional approach and the proposed methodology is offered, as well as further comments on the results.

40|$|The paper {{surveys the}} {{theoretical}} and empirical literature on regional unemployment during transition in Central and Eastern Europe. The focus is on Optimal Speed of Transition (OST) models and on comparison of them with the neoclassical tradition. In the typical neoclassical models, spatial differences essentially arise {{as a consequence of}} supply side constraints and institutional rigidities. Slow-growth, high-unemployment regions are those with backward economic structures and constraints on <b>factors</b> <b>mobility</b> contribute to making differences persistent. However, such explanations leave the question unanswered of how unemployment differences arise in the first place. Economic transition provides an excellent testing ground to answer this question. Prefiguring an empirical law, the OST literature finds that the high degree of labour turnover of high unemployment regions is associated with a high rate of industrial restructuring and, consequently, that low unemployment may be achieved by implementing transition more gradually. Moreover, international trade, FDI and various agglomeration factors help explain the success of capital cities compared to peripheral towns and rural areas in achieving low unemployment...|$|R
