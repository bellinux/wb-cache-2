While orthogonal modulation technique is a straightforward and widely used method for digital fingerprinting, it shows limitations in computational costs, signal effectiveness, and robustness against averaging attacks. Code modulation technique that uses averaging collu-sion resilient <b>fingerprint</b> <b>code</b> derived from BIBD is a robust method against averaging attacks. The strategy described in [2] requires determining threshold values to detect embedded <b>fingerprint</b> <b>code,</b> but threshold changes frequently according to contents {{and the number}} of colluders, so {{that it is difficult to}} decide threshold.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{an efficient}} technique to embed and detect digital <b>fingerprint</b> <b>code.</b> Orthogonal modulation method is a straightforward and widely used approach for digital fingerprinting but shows several limitations in computational cost and signal efficiency. Coded modulation method can solve these limitations in theory. However {{it is difficult}} to perform well in practice if host signals are not available during tracing colluders, other kinds of attacks are applied, and the size of <b>fingerprint</b> <b>code</b> becomes large. In this paper, we propose a hybrid modulation method, in which the merits of orthogonal modulation and coded modulation method are combined so that we can achieve low computational cost and high signal efficiency. To analyze the performance, we design a new <b>fingerprint</b> <b>code</b> based on GD-PBIBD theory and modulate this code into images by our method using spread-spectrum watermarking on frequency domain. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently handle large <b>fingerprint</b> <b>code</b> and trace colluders against averaging attacks.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{two related}} combinatorial objects, namely <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> and separating hash families. <b>Fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> are combinatorial objects {{that have been}} studied for more than 15 years due to their applications in digital data copyright protection and their combinatorial interest. Four well-known types of <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> are studied in this thesis; traceability, identifiable parent property, secure frameproof and frameproof. Each type of code is named after the security properties it guarantees. However, the power of these four types of <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> is limited by a certain condition. The first known attempt to go beyond {{that came out in}} the concept of two-level traceability codes, introduced by Anthapadmanabhan and Barg (2009). This thesis extends their work to the other three types of <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes,</b> so in this thesis four types of two-level <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> are defined. In addition, the relationships between the different types of codes are studied. We propose some first explicit non-trivial con- structions for two-level <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> and provide some bounds on the size of these codes. Separating hash families were introduced by Stinson, van Trung, and Wei as a tool for creating an explicit construction for frameproof codes in 1998. In this thesis, we state a new definition of separating hash families, and mainly focus on improving previously known bounds for separating hash families in some special cases that related to <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes.</b> We improve upper bounds on the size of frameproof and secure frameproof codes under the language of separating hash families.

40|$|Identifying {{perpetrators}} via watermarking {{technology has}} proven {{of value in}} media copyright infringements. To enable tracing back unauthorizedly re-distributed media copies that were manipulated by a collusion attack, collusion secure <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> are embedded into the copies via watermarking technology. <b>Fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> are mathematical codes designed to resist collusion attacks by means of probabilistically generated codewords and suitable tracing algorithms. However, embedding <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> as watermark messages is challenging. This is because of its enormous code length in realistic parameter settings such as small error rates and resistance against large collusions, while the watermarking payload provided by the media copies is very limited. Therefore, to first enable the use of <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> in practice, a suitable compromise regarding the fingerprinting parameters must be identified. As the different media fields come with varying requirements on the <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes,</b> {{it is impossible to}} rely on one specific fingerprinting scheme. Instead, for each of the different media application scenarios separately, the suitable parameter setting is to be identified. With it, conceptuation and design of specifically tailored fingerprinting solutions for the different requirements is first possible. This thesis takes on these challenges to design and optimize various <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> each matching a certain application scenario and thereby finally enabling the application of <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> for those scenarios in need of collusion security. Hence, we identify a number of application scenarios that are potentially subject to collusion attacks. We give definitions of the different types of fingerprinting schemes, its parameters and properties as well as collusion attacks. The general structure of modern fingerprinting schemes is derived and explained with the example of the Tardos codes. With respect to these definitions, the different application scenarios are analyzed in order to identify the individual requirements. With it we are able to postulate what types of fingerprinting schemes with which parameter settings suffice these requirements. To that effect, various <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> are proposed. We developed <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> designed to resist very small collusions, while providing shortest code lengths at comparably low error rates. Moreover, different approaches are given, optimizing the generation of the <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> with respect to practical applications and appropriate parameter settings. To that, we also developed the corresponding tracing strategies, imposing improvements regarding error rates, code length, complexity and that are independent of the attacks. Besides, we also showed how <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> can be realized in hashtable database scenarios thus enabling collusion security also for this scenario. The proposed approaches all have their specific advantages, for which each is the most appropriate for a specific application scenario and use case. This allows to apply <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes</b> in practice and provides collusion security for various media scenarios...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of social {{networks}} and cloud computing, the amount of multimedia data produced and communicated within social networks is rapidly increasing. In the mean time, social networking platform based on cloud computing has made multimedia big data sharing in social network easier and more efficient. The growth of social multimedia, as demonstrated by social networking sites such as Facebook and YouTube, combined with advances in multimedia content analysis, underscores potential risks for malicious use such as illegal copying, piracy, plagiarism, and misappropriation. Therefore, secure multimedia sharing and traitor tracing issues have become critical and urgent in social network. In this paper, we propose a scheme for implementing the Tree-Structured Harr (TSH) transform in a homomorphic encrypted domain for fingerprinting using social network analysis {{with the purpose of}} protecting media distribution in social networks. The motivation is to map hierarchical community structure of social network into tree structure of TSH transform for JPEG 2000 coding, encryption and fingerprinting. Firstly, the <b>fingerprint</b> <b>code</b> is produced using social network analysis. Secondly, the encrypted content is decomposed by the TSH transform. Thirdly, the content is fingerprinted in the TSH transform domain. At last, the encrypted and fingerprinted contents are delivered to users via hybrid multicast-unicast. The use of fingerprinting along with encryption can provide a double-layer of protection to media sharing in social networks.

At present, there are phenomena of homonyms and synonyms present in the melon seed markets of China, which could cause variety authenticity issues influencing the process of melon breeding, production, marketing and other aspects. Molecular markers, especially microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are playing increasingly important roles for cultivar identification. The {{aim of this study}} was to construct a DNA fingerprinting database of major melon cultivars, which could provide a possibility for the establishment of a technical standard system for purity and authenticity identification of melon seeds. In this study, to develop the core set SSR markers, 470 polymorphic SSRs were selected as the candidate markers from 1219 SSRs using 20 representative melon varieties (lines). Eighteen SSR markers, evenly distributed across the genome and with the highest contents of polymorphism information (PIC) were identified as the core marker set for melon DNA fingerprinting analysis.

40|$|Abstract—In {{multimedia}} social networks, {{there exists}} complicated dynamics among users who share and exchange multimedia content. Using multimedia fingerprinting as an example, this paper investigates {{the human behavior}} dynamics in the multimedia social networks with side information. Side information is the information other than the colluded multimedia content that can help increase the probability of detection. We study the impact of side information in multimedia fingerprinting and show that the statistical means of the detection statistics can help the fingerprint detector significantly improve the collusion resistance. We then investigate how to probe the side information and model the dynamics between the fingerprint detector and the colluders as a two-stage extensive game with perfect information. We model the colluder-detector behavior dynamics as a two-stage game and find the equilibrium of the colluder-detector game using backward induction and show that the min-max solution is a Nash equilibrium, which gives no incentive {{for everyone in the}} multimedia fingerprint social network to deviate. This paper demonstrates that the proposed side information can significantly help improve the system performance to almost the same as the optimal correlation-based detector. Such result opens up a new scope in the research of fingerprinting system that given any <b>fingerprint</b> <b>code,</b> leveraging side information can improve the collusion resistance.

We are motivated by the observation that capturing the surface alone misses important distinctive features such as the non-even thickness, the random distribution of impurities, and different materials in the paper with varying opacities. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the embedded paper texture provides a more reliable source for fingerprinting than features on the surface. Based on the collected datasets, we achieve 0 % false rejection and 0 % false acceptance rates.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we look at}} the {{fingerprinting}} problem. Our belief is that {{it is very difficult to}} prevent illegal copying, so our solution is to mark each copy uniquely so that if it is spread illegally, the original owner of that copy can be found. The principle is the same as for a serial number on a product. However a serial number is often easy to find and remove, therefore the serial number, that we call "fingerprint", has to be embedded in the information itself without causing any change to the product. We assume that the embedding of the fingerprint can be carried out and concentrate on the <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>code.</b> We have concentrated on four specific problems in this area. First we consider the <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>code</b> in the paper by Boneh and Shaw. This code has very long code words in practice, so we reduce the length for the inner code. The code is still very long. The area of communication has many similarities with the fingerprinting area. A large number of error correcting codes are linear and binary. We show why binary linear codes can not be used as <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes.</b> A specific structure on the <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>code</b> is a sorted code. The inner code in the code by Boneh and Shaw has this structure which is easy to analyse when the number of pirates is all but one.

40|$|Leakage of a {{document}} distributed among {{a set of}} authorized recipients may result in violation of copyright or secrecy of {{a document}}. A hidden serial number in the document {{can be used for}} finding the source of the leak. A coalition attack is collusion of a set of users to generate copies of the document with a serial number (now called fingerprint) that is different from their original ones. To trace such a forged fingerprint back to one of its producers, reasonable assumptions are necessary. The marking assumption is one such assumption. It says if the i-th bits of the fingerprints of all colluders are the same, it will have the same value in the forged copy. Our first result in this thesis is a construction that achieves the highest known rate of <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes,</b> which we conjecture to be optimal. This construction combines two ideas from two earlier constructions. We use bias based code generation that was introduced by Tardos for his well-known <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>code.</b> Our accusation algorithm is based on an earlier algorithm by Anthapadmanabhan, Barg and Dumer that uses the information theoretic notion of typicality. The drawback of this construction is its slow accusation algorithm. Building upon our first construction, we construct another <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>code</b> in which the distributor may choose to have a faster accusation algorithm by sacrificing a little of the rate. A different accusation algorithm for our first code allows us to generalize it to a family of codes that show a tradeoff between rate and efficiency. This tradeoff suggests new ways to construct more efficient algorithms without losing the rate. For the case of two pirates this tradeoff can be made simpler by using Hamming distance instead of a mutual information. This allows improving quadratic running time of our first accusation algorithm to linear without lowering the rate at all. We also look at weak fingerprinting, a variant of fingerprinting for which the capacity is known. We construct a capacity-achieving weak <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>code...</b>|$|R

Digital transaction watermarking is an accepted mechanism to discourage illegal distribution of multimedia. Here copies of the same content are distributed with individual markings.

Taking into account the fact that the coalition can perform estimation errors, we update the Worst Case Attack, which minimises the mutual information between the sequence of one colluder and the pirated sequence forged by the coalition. After comparing the achievable rates of the previous and proposed Worst Case Attack according to the estimation error, we conclude this analysis by comparing the robustness of no-secure embedding schemes versus secure ones. We show that, for low probabilities of error during the decoding stage (e. g. highly robust watermarking schemes), security enables to increase the achievable rate of the fingerprinting scheme...|$|R

The key idea is that users accused in the previous iterations are used as side-information to build a more discriminative test. A fast implementation supporting millions of users is presented and compared with two recent <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>codes...</b>|$|R

In this article, partially cover-free families of sets are considered and these are employed to obtain such codes. Compared to the existing methods of construction, our methods ensure gains in terms of accommodating more users and/or reducing the number of basis vectors...|$|R
