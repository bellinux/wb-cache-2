The topical use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone was prohibited in 2002. Australia prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food production in 1992.

In Thailand, the Ministry of Health issued in 2001 Proclamation No. 231 MRL of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate MRL for nitrofurans. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all nitrofurans in 2002. Several metabolites of nitrofurans, such as furazolidone, furaltadone and nitrofurazone cause cancer or genetic damage in rats.|$|E

Functioning as a smart database, Tethys enables its users to identify key words or terms to help gather, organize and make available information and data pertaining to the environmental effects of MHK and offshore wind (OSW) energy development. By providing and categorizing relevant publications within a simple and searchable database, Tethys acts as a dissemination channel for information and data which can be utilized by regulators, project developers and researchers to minimize the environmental risks associated with offshore renewable energy developments and attempt to streamline the permitting process. Tethys also houses a separate content-related <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> data base with identical functionality to the Tethys knowledge base. <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> is a collaborative project among member nations of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Ocean Energy Systems – Implementing Agreement (OES-IA) that examines the environmental effects of ocean energy devices and projects.

Thus, for the European wildcat, being a legally protected species and of conservation concern imply that further studies on its biology are crucial (Stahl and Artois 1991; Council of Europe 1993; Lozano and Malo 2012) to guarantee improved diagnoses of conservation problems and identify potential tools for preserving wildcats in Europe (Stahl and Artois 1991; McOrist and Kitchener 1994; Lozano et al. 2007).

40|$|Pinna nobilis is {{the largest}} endemic Mediterranean marine bivalve. During past centuries various human {{activities}} led to the regression of its populations. As a consequence of stringent protection policies (P. nobilis is included <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> <b>IV</b> of the Habitat Directive and Annex II of the Barcelona Convention), demographic expansion to many sites is currently reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to test a set of four species-specific primers designed by the authors, which could prove useful for the assessment of the genetic variability in P. nobilis. The level of polymorphism of two mitochondrial (nad 3 and 12 S) and two nuclear (18 S and 28 S) primers was thus assessed in 136 specimens from 28 Mediterranean localities. Furthermore, a comparison with the level of polymorphism obtained using the mitochondrial specific primers pairs so far available (COI and 16 S) was performed. The mitochondrial gene nad 3 showed the highest level of variability, which was comparable to those obtained for COI and 16 S. Very low levels were detected for the mitochondrial 12 S and the nuclear 18 S and 28 S genes. This research also showed that the use of nad 3, COI and 16 S concatenated sequences represents a useful tool for future studies devoted to infer the genetic variability of P. nobilis populations, thus allowing the development of effective conservation plans...|$|E
