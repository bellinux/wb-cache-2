40|$|Abstract Background Sand fly saliva {{can drive}} {{the outcome of}} Leishmania {{infection}} in animal models, and salivary components have been postulated as vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis. In the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi, natural sugar-sources modulate the activity of proteins involved in meal digestion, and possibly influence vectorial capacity. However, {{only a handful of}} studies have assessed the variability of salivary components in sand flies, focusing on the effects of environmental factors in natural habitats. In order to better understand such interactions, we compared the expression profiles of nine P. papatasi salivary gland genes of specimens inhabiting different ecological habitats in Egypt and Jordan and throughout the sand <b>fly</b> <b>season</b> in each habitat. Results The majority of investigated genes were up-regulated in specimens from Swaymeh late in the season, when the availability of sugar sources is reduced due to water deprivation. On the other hand, these genes were not up-regulated in specimens collected from Aswan, an irrigated area less susceptible to drought effects. Conclusion Expression plasticity of genes involved with vectorial capacity in disease vectors may play an important epidemiological role in the establishment of diseases in natural habitats. </p...|$|E

We studied the canine humoral immune response to Phlebotomus perniciosus saliva and its potential use as a marker of sand fly exposure and consequently as a risk marker for Leishmania transmission. We also characterized major salivary antigens of P. perniciosus.

Methods: Seven localities were selected with distinct altitudinal variations between 550 meters above sea level (ma. s. l) and 2, 300 ma. s. l.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phlebotomine sand flies are blood-sucking {{insects that}} can {{transmit}} Leishmania parasites. Hosts bitten by sand flies develop an immune response against sand fly salivary antigens. Specific anti-saliva IgG indicate {{the exposure to}} the vector and may also help to estimate the risk of Leishmania spp. transmission. In this study, we examined the canine antibody response against the saliva of Phlebotomus perniciosus, the main vector of Leishmania infantum in the Mediterranean Basin, and characterized salivary antigens of this sand fly species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sera of dogs bitten by P. perniciosus under experimental conditions and dogs naturally exposed to sand flies in a L. infantum focus were tested by ELISA {{for the presence of}} anti-P. perniciosus antibodies. Antibody levels positively correlated with the number of blood-fed P. perniciosus females. In naturally exposed dogs the increase of specific IgG, IgG 1 and IgG 2 was observed during sand <b>fly</b> <b>season.</b> Importantly, Leishmania-positive dogs revealed significantly lower anti-P. perniciosus IgG 2 compared to Leishmania-negative ones. Major P. perniciosus antigens were identified by western blot and mass spectrometry as yellow proteins, apyrases and antigen 5 -related proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that monitoring canine antibody response to sand fly saliva in endemic foci could estimate the risk of L. infantum transmission. It may also help to control canine leishmaniasis by evaluating the effectiveness of anti-vector campaigns. Data from the field study where dogs from the Italian focus of L. infantum were naturally exposed to P. perniciosus bites indicates that the levels of anti-P. perniciosus saliva IgG 2 negatively correlate with the risk of Leishmania transmission. Thus, specific IgG 2 response is suggested as a risk marker of L. infantum transmission for dogs...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{potential}} vector sand flies {{was conducted in}} the neighboring suburban communities of Vake and Mtatsminda districts in an active focus of visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in Tbilisi, Georgia. Using light and sticky-paper traps, 1, 266 male and 1, 179 female sand flies were collected during 2006 – 2008. Five Phlebotomus species of three subgenera were collected: Phlebotomus balcanicus Theodor and Phlebotomus halepensis Theodor of the subgenus Adlerius; Phlebotomus kandelakii Shchurenkova and Phlebotomus wenyoni Adler and Theodor of the subgenus Larroussius; Phlebotomus sergenti Perfil’ev of the subgenus Paraphlebotomus. Phlebotomus sergenti (35. 1 %) predominated in Vake, followed by P. kandelakii (33. 5 %), P. balcanicus (18. 9 %), P. halepensis (12. 2 %), and P. wenyoni (0. 3 %). In Mtatsminda, P. kandelakii (76. 8 %) comprised over three fourths of collected sand flies, followed by P. sergenti (12. 6 %), P. balcanicus (5. 8 %), P. halepensis (3. 7 %), and P. wenyoni (1. 1 %).

40|$|The Australian sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina initiates {{more than}} 85 % of fly strikes on sheep in Australia with an {{estimated}} average annual cost of A$ 280 million to the Australian wool industry. LuciTrap® is a commercially available, selective trap for L. cuprina consisting of a plastic bucket with multiple fly entry cones and a synthetic attractant. The impact of LuciTrap on populations of L. cuprina on sheep properties in five Australian states was evaluated by comparing L. cuprina populations on paired properties with and without LuciTraps over seasons when significant fly populations could be expected. Twenty-four comparisons (trials) were conducted over four years. During times of ‘higher fly density’ (when the 48 h geometric mean of trap catches on the control property was greater than five L. cuprina), the overall geometric mean trap catches for control and trapped properties differed significantly (P< 0. 001) with mean trap catches of 19. 4 and 7. 74 L. cuprina respectively. The selectivity of the LuciTrap was confirmed with 59 % of all trapped flies being L. cuprina. Chrysomya spp. and Calliphora spp. constituted 9. 3 % and 1. 1 % of the catches {{with a variety of}} other flies (mainly Sarcophagidae and Muscidae) providing the remainder (31 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bovine besnoitiosis {{has been}} {{recently}} diagnosed in a three-parted herd of 796 Aubrac and Charolais beef cattle in Hungary. A large scale serological, histological and molecular survey was initiated {{in order to}} uncover important factors in the local epidemiology of the disease. FINDINGS: Blood samples were collected (three times from the whole herd, and repeatedly from selected animals) for serological screening by ELISA. In addition, various organs from aborted fetuses and newborn calves, skin and colostrum samples of seropositive heifers/cows, and ticks collected from the cattle were histologically and/or molecularly analysed {{for the presence of}} Besnoitia besnoiti. All fetal and calf tissues, as well as colostrum and tick samples from cows were PCR negative. Based on ELISA results, only very few local cows seroconverted after mating with imported, infected bulls, and not necessarily as a consequence of this event. Among calves that were born to seropositive, imported cows and stayed with their mother until weaning at seven months of age, seroprevalence decreased significantly, but remained high. At the same time, 28 calves born from seropositive cows, but separated from their dams immediately after receiving colostrum, were successfully reared and remained uninfected. Following a second herd-level screening, all Aubrac cattle (except for heifer calves) and all seropositive Charolais cows and bulls were culled. Manifestation of the disease is currently sporadic. Among chronically affected heifers two types of skin lesions were noted, and histological evaluation indicated marked distension of sweat gland ducts with membrane-bound structures (resembling cystozoites) in their contents. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission through natural mating, as well as transplacental, colostral and tick-borne transmission of B. besnoiti was either unlikely or did not occur. However, the risk for spreading of the infection was high, when calves stayed with their mother during suckling, and if animals were kept in the same stable (although physically separated) during the main <b>fly</b> <b>season.</b> Herd replacement and generation exchange (i. e. early weaning and artificial feeding) appear to be the successful strategies for the local eradication of bovine besnoitiosis.
