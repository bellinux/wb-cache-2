40|$|Do microtubules {{influence}} growth <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> environmental stimuli <b>in</b> plants? Microtubules (MTs) have numerous {{roles in}} plant development and these functions are assisted by Microtubule Associated Proteins (MAPs). To further explore MT function we study a MAP called END BINDING 1 (EB 1). Previous analysis of eb 1 mutants indicates root defects <b>in</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> mechanical stimulation (MS) and/or gravity. To determine whether EB 1 activity contributes <b>to</b> root <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MS or gravity or both, two approaches were taken. First, I analyze {{the effects of}} altering the type and amount of MS perceived by the root. Second, I analyzed double mutants between eb 1 b and plants carrying mutations in genes associated with <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MS and gravity. Results from both approaches suggest that EB 1 has a role <b>in</b> root <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MS and an indirect role <b>in</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> gravity...|$|R
