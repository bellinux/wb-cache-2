50|$|The European Commission {{proposed}} that, {{in addition}} to its current scope, the Fund should be able to support workers made redundant {{as a result of the}} global financial and economic crisis on 16 December 2008. In addition, it proposes to reduce the threshold of redundancies from the current 1,000 to 500, to extend the period of each case from 12 months to 24 months, and to increase its contribution from 50% of total cost to 75% (the rest being contributed by the member state). This proposal was submitted to the Council and the European Parliament in December 2008. It is expected that the amendment will be adopted in mid-2009. There is a need of this fund because the difference in labour costs at the international level remains an important determinant of the geographical distribution of production, because the large apparel companies are constantly seeking production bases lower labour costs. Additionally, the ongoing <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> has intensified this situation. The search for lower labour costs have led to significant changes in the image of global apparel industry. The production of clothing gradually moved from Europe to Asia, which now accounts for nearly 45% of global garment production.|$|E

40|$|The quality, {{traceability}} {{and safety}} of {{food of animal origin}} are affected by several factors, but animal feeding plays {{one of the most important}} roles. The basis of the relationship between animal feeding and food quality is the carry-over of some nutrients, tracers and/or contaminants from feed to tissues and, consequently, to food (meat, milk and eggs). As regard the nutrients, an increasing number of papers report the possibility of improving the proportion of some beneficial components in products of animal origin through different dietary strategies. An enrichment of food with omega 3 fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acids, vitamin A and E and selenium could be obtained including feeds with a high concentration of these nutrients in the animal diet. In addition, some specific tracers (i. e. terpenes or volatile compounds) can be identified and quantified in products of animal origin to establish their geographic origin. Finally, as the demand for safer products is growing not only in EU, but worldwide, all actions to prevent and control the contaminants along the food chain must be implemented. The mycotoxin contamination of seeds and forages represents an emergent problem that can be worsened by the <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trades</b> and global warming. The carry-over of mycotoxins from feed to food of animal origin must be monitored to maintain the content of mycotoxins under the maximum levels established by regulation. In conclusion, animal feeding can exert a great impact on the quality, traceability {{and safety of}} food products, in order to satisfy the growing requirements of consumer...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} in which communications costs determine the geographic extent of production fragmentation. The {{focus is on}} production and trade of intermediate services and components. On the production side of the model there are returns to increased specialization within plants but fixed costs which are component specific. Communication costs are modelled as a quasi public good network in which communication services are provided by an average cost pricing monopolist. The network technology is subject to increasing returns, congestion effects and network externalities. An important distinction is made between international equilibrium and global equilibrium. Fragmentation occurs as a consequence result of reductions in communications costs. The model has multiple equilibria with different welfare and comparative static properties. 3 1.

40|$|The <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> tobacco marketing, <b>trade,</b> research, and {{industry}} influence represents {{a major threat}} to public health worldwide. Drawing upon tobacco industry strategy documents prepared over several decades, this paper will demonstrate how the tobacco industry operates as a global force, regarding the world as its operating market by planning, developing, and marketing its products on a global scale. The industry has used a wide range of methods to buy influence and power, and penetrate markets across the world. It has an annual turnover of almost US$ 400 billion. In contrast, until recently tobacco control lacked global leadership and strategic direction and had been severely underfunded. As part of moving towards a more sustainable form <b>of</b> <b>globalisation,</b> a global enabling environment linked to local actions should focus on the following strategies: global information management; development of nationally and locally grounded action; global regulation, legal instruments, and foreign policy; and establishment of strong partnerships with purpose. As the vector of the tobacco epidemic, the tobacco industry's actions fall far outside of the boundaries of global corporate responsibility. Therefore, global and local actions should not provide the tobacco industry with the two things that it needs to ensure its long term profitability: respectability and predictability.    Keywords: <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> tobacco marketin...|$|R
