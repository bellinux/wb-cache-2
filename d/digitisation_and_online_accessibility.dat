40|$|Extract: This chapter {{analyses}} Directive 2012 / 28 /EU of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council of 25 October 2012 {{on certain}} permitted uses of orphan works. This Directive {{is the result of}} a legislative process that addresses the legal situation where authors or rights holders of copyright protected works cannot be identified or located. It does this by establishing the conditions under which the orphan work status can be declared throughout the EU region, and under which such works can legitimately be reproduced and made available online. Without lengthy consideration of the actual risk and commercial consequences for a cultural heritage institution to be sued by an author who has found out that his work was considered to be an orphan, the EU accepted that 'soft-law' initiatives such as the 2006 Recommendation on the <b>digitisation</b> <b>and</b> <b>online</b> <b>accessibility</b> of cultural content and preservation were not sufficient to address the orphan works issue in an appropriate manner. Despite the Recommendation, only a few Member States have implemented orphan works legislation. Moreover, developments at the national level were circumscribed by the fact that they were not capable of addressing the issues posed by the online environment as they limited online access to citizens resident in their national territories. This was ignoring the cultural and educational potential offered by cross-border access of content...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{investigate}} interest of Midwestern dietitians in online omega- 3 fatty acids information and education resources useful within their work setting. Qualitative in-depth interviews with ten registered dietitians, selected from the Nebraska Dietetic Association online membership map were used to identify themes useful in website development. Twelve overarching themes were identified. Valued online features include information that is easy to access, scan, save, print, and send. Findings highlight the need to reformat current online information to accommodate time sensitive search methods used by dietitians. Omega- 3 fatty acids learning modules were developed and pilot tested for content, clarity, <b>and</b> <b>online</b> <b>accessibility.</b> Learnomega 3 rd, Goggle website, was created to house learning modules. An online research survey questionnaire was created using Survey Monkey. These were both pilot tested for content, clarity <b>and</b> <b>online</b> access. Nebraska Dietetic Association email list serve members were invited to visit website, use information to answer their omega- 3 fatty acid questions, and provide feedback. Unique website visits resulted in 281 of 520 (54 %) visitors to learnomega- 3 website. Among those visiting website, 55 (20 %) usable survey responses were obtained. Content analysis methodology was used to analyze text responses. Three major omega- 3 fatty acid themes were identified by dietitians (known benefits, best sources, and recommendations). Of 142 questions submitted, 49 frequently asked questions were identified. These provide an online roadmap useful in streamlining quicker access to relevant information. Primary uses for online omega- 3 fatty acid information reported include: staying current (82 %), medical nutrition therapy counseling (62 %), individual education (62 %), and group education (51 %). Fifty eight percent of respondents were satisfied with time needed to find answers to their omega- 3 fatty acid questions using website resources; not being satisfied was associated with inability to locate answers using resources provided. Further exploration is recommended to test usefulness of this website to support dietitians in developing omega- 3 fatty acids evidence based guidelines for their work setting. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{dispersal}} of musicology?s {{diverse array of}} primary and secondary sources across countless libraries and archives was once an enormous obstacle to conducting research, but this has largely been overcome by the <b>digitisation</b> <b>and</b> <b>online</b> publication of resources in recent years. Yet, while the research process has undoubtedly been revolutionised, the current situation is far from perfect, as the digitisation of resources has often been accompanied by their segregation?according to media type, date of publication, subject, language, copyright holder, etc. ?into a myriad of discrete online repositories, often with little thought having been given to interoperability. Given that musicological research typically cuts across such artificial divisions, this segregation of data means that accessing basic factual information or running multi-part search queries remains endlessly complicated, needlessly time consuming, and sometimes impossible. This barrier to tractability is only exacerbated by the limited capabilities of currently deployed search interfaces. There is one seemingly obvious solution to this query dilemma: enable integrated real-time querying over all the available metadata from as many sources as possible, and allow users to use that metadata to guide their queries. This solution implies that all data that could feasibly be construed as useful, but which is buried in the records, is extracted in some way, {{and that there is}} an interaction approach that enables metadata to be explored effectively and allows for the formulation of rich compound queries. The musicSpace project has taken a dual approach towards realising this solution. At the back-end we are developing services to integrate and, where necessary, surface (meta) data from many of musicology?s most important online resources, including the British Library Music Collections catalogue, the British Library Sound Archive catalogue, Cecilia, Copac, Grove Music Online, ?axos Music Library, ??pertoire International de Litt?rature Musicale (RILM), and ??pertoire International des Sources Musicale (RISM) UK and Ireland. While at the front-end, in order to optimise the exploration of this integrated dataset, we are developing a modern web-based faceted browsing interface that utilises Semantic Web and Web 2. 0 technologies such as ?DF and AJAX, and which is based on the existing ?mSpace? codebase. Our poster outlines the approach we have taken to importing, enriching and integrating the metadata provided by our data partners, and gives examples of the real-world musicological research questions that musicSpace has enabled...|$|R

40|$|My {{research}} is a practice-based project involving documentary production and theoretical analysis of emerging forms of documentary <b>and</b> <b>online</b> co-collaboration, exploring paradigm shifts in digital technology {{particularly in the}} web-based feminist activism and feminist social praxis. The practice-led research explores new forms of production practices outside traditional methodologies and dissemination. Specifically, by utilizing cheap digital technology tools <b>and</b> working within <b>online</b> social networking platforms the research theoretically analyses what means were available towards online participatory media practices to create new documentary forms. My research aims are therefore to investigate how the new paradigm shifts in digital technology and the democratization of the filmmaking process, through online, collaborative practice, can allow women documentary filmmakers to connect to a global marketplace outside the traditional filmmaking channels. Further, looking {{at the history of}} the documentary form, as well as the feminist movement, I am interested in which of the key themes and debates that have characterized their intersection are still important at this moment of changing and emerging technologies. Can new technologies, access to cheap digital tools and collaborative modes of practice help or hinder the creative process of making a digital documentary? In examining the history of feminist filmmaking and the emerging documentary shifts in production offered the opportunity to position my own practice within these traditions and experiment further with online forms of modality. This experiment allowed me to gather empirical data using new media practices (i. e. creation <b>and</b> curation of <b>online</b> <b>and</b> repurposed content, use of new production tools within online spaces) to create a first person, auto-ethnographic narrative on the subject of feminism <b>and</b> <b>online</b> activism. Additionally, my research looks at the theoretical and historical underpinnings surrounding feminist filmmaking, new documentary practices and its implications within new technologies, and the emerging forms of collaborative online modes of practice. Each of these areas will intersect within the three key areas of debate surrounding documentary filmmaking; those of 1) narrativity, 2) witness and 3) ethics. My practice investigates these interactive, participatory modes created with emerging technologies <b>and</b> <b>online</b> audiences <b>and</b> how this is shifting narratives, audience reception and producing new ethical debates around ‘truth’ and ‘authenticity’ as these lines are continually blurred. Rethinking documentary in the virtual space brings about new challenges to the old debates around evidence, witness and ethics, as it {{is the product of a}} more democratic attitude towards practice, distribution and dissemination of its stories. New participatory audiences are now also helping to create the very product they are witnessing. Therefore, creating media within the public sphere can bring about a wealth of new tools, wider contributions to media making and a more global awareness of its dissemination. But it is not without its controversy and challenges. Further, my research looks at how working within this co-collaborative mode, the position of filmmaker as the ‘sole’ creator or ‘auteur’ comes into question. It discuses the advantages and/or the disadvantages to this approach and in doing so looks at what contributions <b>and</b> challenges an <b>online</b> audience can provide to support the filmmaker that cannot be gained through historical and traditional production and exhibition forms. What once was a higher barrier to entry into the film business is now a more open <b>and</b> <b>online</b> <b>accessibility</b> where anyone can wield a cheap camera or mobile phone device, make a movie and share it on the internet. These newfound democratic practices could potentially disrupt an already complex system of communication practices. However, it could also supply it with a much-needed collective idea bank for tackling global issues and finding sustainable solutions. Within the scope of participatory practices, a first person filmmaker can experience the greatest of democratic freedom within the confines of this process and delivery. The {{research is}} supported and conducted through a practice-led film project, web support platform (including blog and social media sites) and published case study. The final output film project around which these questions are posed is entitled: “Single Girl in a Virtual World: What does a 21 st Century Feminist Look Like?” 1. The film’s purpose is therefore to engage an online global audience of participants and contributors to the film’s narrative thread by asking for contributions within the production, creation and financing of the documentary film. The practice utilizes social networks, crowd funding initiatives, web blogs, viral video, virtual chat interaction and traditional modes of documentary practice in its methodology in an effort to collect data surrounding activity and attempt to answer my research questions at large. The overall objective is to create an online documentary film that exemplifies feminist activism in a new frame through application of documentary modes and new emerging digital media practices. 1 Single Girl in a Virtual World: What Does a 21 st Century Feminist Look Like?
