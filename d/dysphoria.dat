5|$|In July, the Federal Bureau of Prisons {{rejected}} {{a request by}} the Army to transfer Manning from the USDB to a civilian facility for treatment of her gender <b>dysphoria.</b> Instead, the Army kept Manning in military custody {{and said it would}} begin rudimentary gender treatment, which could include allowing her to wear female undergarments and possibly receive hormone treatments.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, the Kansas District Court {{granted a}} {{petition}} from Manning for a legal name change. An Army spokesman stated {{that while the}} Army would update personnel records to acknowledge the name change, the military would continue to regard Manning as a male. Manning sought hormone therapy {{and the right to}} live as a woman while confined, consistent with her gender <b>dysphoria,</b> which had been confirmed by two Army medical specialists. Such treatment is provided in civilian federal prisons when it is found to be medically necessary, but it is not available in military prisons. The Pentagon policy at the time considered transgender individuals ineligible to serve.|$|E
25|$|Gender <b>dysphoria</b> in {{children}} or gender identity disorder {{in children}} (GIDC) is a formal diagnosis used by psychologists and physicians to describe children who experience significant discontent (gender <b>dysphoria)</b> with their biological sex, assigned gender, or both.|$|E
25|$|Gender <b>dysphoria</b> is not excluded.|$|E
25|$|CNS effects: Nervousness, depression, restlessness, crying, euphoria, flushing, hostility, unusual dreams, confusion, faintness, hallucinations, <b>dysphoria,</b> {{feeling of}} heaviness, numbness, tingling, unreality. The {{incidence}} of psychotomimetic effects, such as unreality, depersonalization, delusions, <b>dysphoria</b> and hallucinations {{has been shown}} to be less than that which occurs with pentazocine.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{published}} the DSM-5 {{in which the}} GIDC diagnosis was removed and replaced with gender <b>dysphoria,</b> {{for the first time}} in its own distinct chapter. Lev states that gender <b>dysphoria</b> places the focus on distress with one's body rather than conformity with societal gender norms, and that this change was accompanied by changes to sexist language and a reduced reliance on binary gender categories. Gender <b>dysphoria</b> reframes the diagnosis as a time-limited distress of the body which is potentially rectified with access to gender transition procedures, rather than a lifetime disorder of the identity.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric/neurological: mood swings, irritability, aggression, violent behavior, impulsivity/recklessness, hypomania/mania, euphoria, depression, anxiety, <b>dysphoria,</b> suicidality, delusions, psychosis, withdrawal, dependence, neurotoxicity, {{cognitive}} impairment.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{persistent}} GID {{are characterized}} by more extreme gender <b>dysphoria</b> in childhood than children with desisting gender <b>dysphoria.</b> Some (but not all) gender diverse / gender independent / gender fluid youth will want or need to transition, which may involve social transition (changing dress, name, pronoun), and, for older youth and adolescents, medical transition (hormonal and surgical intervention). Treatment may {{take the form of}} puberty blockers such as Lupron Depot or Leuprolide Acetate, or cross-sex hormones (i.e., administering estrogen to an assigned male at birth or testosterone to an assigned female at birth), or surgery (i.e., mastectomies, salphingo-oophorectomies/hysterectomy, the creation of a neophallus in female-to-male transsexuals, orchiectomies, breast augmentation, facial feminization surgery, the creation of a neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals), with the aim of bringing oneâ€™s physical body in line with their felt gender. The ability to transition (socially and medically) are sometimes needed in the treatment of gender <b>dysphoria.</b>|$|E
25|$|The current {{diagnosis}} for transsexual {{people who}} present themselves for medical treatment is gender <b>dysphoria</b> (leaving out {{those who have}} sexual identity disorders without gender concerns). According to the Standards of care formulated by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), formerly the Harry Benjamin International Gender <b>Dysphoria</b> Association, this diagnostic label is often necessary to obtain sex reassignment therapy with health insurance coverage, and the designation of gender identity disorders as mental disorders is not a license for stigmatization or for the deprivation of gender patients' civil rights.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties {{regulating}} emotions, including {{symptoms such as}} persistent <b>dysphoria,</b> chronic suicidal preoccupation, self injury, explosive or extremely inhibited anger (may alternate), or compulsive or extremely inhibited sexuality (may alternate).|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{transsexualism}} {{has also}} {{been included in the}} American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). With the DSM-5, transsexualism was removed as a diagnosis, and a diagnosis of gender <b>dysphoria</b> was created in its place. This change was made to reflect the consensus view by members of the APA that transsexuality is not in and of itself a disorder and that transsexual people should not be stigmatized unnecessarily. By including a diagnosis for gender <b>dysphoria,</b> transsexual people are still able to access medical care through the process of transition.|$|E
25|$|Meyer-Bahlburg was President of the International Academy of Sex Research from 1990 to 1991 {{and since}} 2002 {{has served on}} the Committee on Intersexuality for the Harry Benjamin International Gender <b>Dysphoria</b> Association.|$|E
25|$|On January 21, 2014, Against Me! {{released}} Transgender <b>Dysphoria</b> Blues, their sixth full-length studio album. The {{album was}} praised for its raw quality, reminiscent of Against Me!'s earlier music. It is their highest-charting album to date, reaching no. 23 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
25|$|People {{stopping}} venlafaxine commonly experience discontinuation {{symptoms such as}} <b>dysphoria,</b> headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, {{sensation of}} electric shocks, and sleep disturbance. Venlafaxine has {{a higher rate of}} moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms relative to other antidepressants (similar to the SSRI paroxetine).|$|E
25|$|Some alexithymic {{individuals}} {{may appear to}} contradict the above-mentioned characteristics because they can experience chronic <b>dysphoria</b> or manifest outbursts of crying or rage. However, questioning usually reveals that they are quite incapable of describing their feelings or appear confused by questions inquiring about specifics of feelings.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine {{dependence}} is {{a frequent}} complication for those prescribed for or using for longer than four weeks, with physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms being the most common problem, but also occasionally drug-seeking behavior. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, perceptual disturbances, distortion of all the senses, <b>dysphoria,</b> and, in rare cases, psychosis and epileptic seizures.|$|E
25|$|She left Nigeria in 2004 {{to settle}} in the United Kingdom. Then she got a broader {{perspective}} of her Gender <b>dysphoria.</b> She started seeing doctors who helped her through her journey into Womanhood. She said her {{new life in the}} Uk was like heaven on Earth because she now lives as her true-self.|$|E
25|$|Gender dysphoria: The DSM-5 {{included}} {{a change from}} using Gender Identity Disorder to Gender <b>Dysphoria.</b> This revised code now specifically includes intersex {{people who do not}} identify with their sex assigned at birth, using the language of Disorders of Sex Development. This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent decades}} {{it has become}} {{possible}} to reassign sex surgically. Some people who experience gender <b>dysphoria</b> seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see transsexual {{for some of the}} possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity.|$|E
25|$|Growing up she famously {{said she}} never fit into the {{religious}} and conservative views of Nigeria. Living in rural Nigeria made her unaware of her medical condition known as Gender <b>dysphoria.</b> She said the constant feeling of wanting to present herself as a female made her feel lost, {{as if there was}} something inhumanly wrong with her.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone is well-tolerated {{and many}} {{clinical}} {{studies have reported}} no side effects. Side effects of progesterone may include abdominal cramps, back pain, breast tenderness, constipation, nausea, dizziness, edema, vaginal bleeding, hypotension, fatigue, <b>dysphoria,</b> depression, and irritability. Side effects including drowsiness, sedation, sleepiness, fatigue, sluggishness, reduced , dizziness, lightheadedness, decreased mental acuity, confusion, and cognitive, memory, and/or motor impairment may occur with oral ingestion and/or at high doses of progesterone, and are due to progesterone's neurosteroid metabolites (namely allopregnanolone). The same may be true for side effects of progesterone including <b>dysphoria,</b> depression, anxiety, irritability, and decreased friendliness, and both the adverse cognitive/sedative and emotional side effects of progesterone may be reduced or avoided by parenteral routes of administration such as vaginal or intramuscular injection. Also, some medical professionals may advise patients to take progesterone before bed to avoid these side effects and/or to help with sleep.|$|E
25|$|Transsexual is {{generally}} considered a subset of transgender, but some transsexual people reject the label of transgender. A medical diagnosis of gender <b>dysphoria</b> can be made if a person expresses a desire to live and be accepted {{as a member of}} their identified sex, and if a person experiences impaired functioning or distress {{as a result of their}} gender identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree to}} which {{individuals}} feel genuine, authentic, and comfortable within their external appearance and accept their genuine identity has been called transgender congruence. Many transgender people experience gender <b>dysphoria,</b> and some seek medical treatments such as hormone replacement therapy, sex reassignment surgery, or psychotherapy. Not all transgender people desire these treatments, and some cannot undergo them for financial or medical reasons.|$|E
25|$|Dysphoric milk {{ejection}} reflex (D-MER) is a newly recognized condition affecting lactating women that {{is characterized by}} an abrupt <b>dysphoria,</b> or negative emotions that occur just before milk release and continuing not {{more than a few}} minutes. Preliminary testing tells us that D-MER is treatable and preliminary research tells us that inappropriate dopamine activity {{at the time of the}} {{milk ejection}} reflex is the cause of D-MER.|$|E
25|$|Gender <b>dysphoria,</b> by {{producing}} secondary male characteristics, {{such as a}} deeper voice, increased bone and muscle mass, facial hair, and clitoral enlargement in transgender men, among females or those who develop female secondary sexual characteristics but desire to rather be read as male or look more ambiguous, such {{as a number of}} non-binary transgender people, both intersex and dyadic, and dysphoric non-transgender intersex men.|$|E
25|$|June â€“ Former stake {{president}} and church architect Laurie Lee Hall was excommunicated by her Utah local leaders for socially transitioning {{to express her}} gender identity as a transgender woman. She had experienced years of suicidal ideation and gender <b>dysphoria</b> before being released as a stake president in 2012 due to her identity and deciding {{to come out to}} her entire congregation in July 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{alleviation}} of <b>dysphoria</b> {{theory suggests}} that people with severe mental illness commonly have a negative self-image, which makes them vulnerable to using psychoactive substances to alleviate these feelings. Despite {{the existence of a}} wide range of dysphoric feelings (anxiety, depression, boredom, and loneliness), the literature on self-reported reasons for use seems to lend support for the experience of these feelings being the primary motivator for drug and alcohol misuse.|$|E
25|$|People with {{discontinuation}} syndrome {{have been}} on an antidepressant {{for at least four}} weeks and have recently stopped taking the medication, either abruptly or after a fast taper. Common symptoms include flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sweating), sleep disturbances (insomnia, nightmares, constant sleepiness), sensory/movement disturbances (imbalance, tremors, vertigo, dizziness, electric-shock-like experiences), mood disturbances (<b>dysphoria,</b> anxiety, agitation) and cognitive disturbances (confusion and hyperarousal). Over fifty symptoms have been reported.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Sparks' {{activism}} prompted Supervisor Mark Leno {{to create}} a new city work group, the Transgender Civil Rights Implementation Task Force, of which Sparks became a charter member. A year later, Sparks and Leno helped to establish broader medical benefits for municipal employees diagnosed with Gender <b>dysphoria.</b> The new law was the only governmental policy {{of its kind in the}} nation and provided medical coverage for hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery.|$|E
25|$|Ueto's {{breakthrough}} {{came when}} she was cast {{as a high school}} student suffering from gender <b>dysphoria,</b> in the sixth season of the long-running TBS drama 3-nen B-gumi Kinpachi-sensei. Her critically acclaimed performance led to several leading roles and endorsements, eventually establishing herself as one of Japan's most recognizable faces. As one of Japan's most ubiquitous celebrities, Ueto constantly appears on billboards, shop windows and train adverts, and has held the annual title of CM Queen five times since 2004.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl in {{injectable}} formulation {{is commonly}} used for analgesia and {{as a component of}} balanced sedation and general anaesthesia in small animal patients. Its potency and short duration of action make it particularly useful in critically ill patients. In addition, it tends to cause less vomiting and regurgitation than other pure-opioid agonists (morphine, hydromorphone) when given as a continuous post-operative infusion. As with other pure opioids, fentanyl can be associated with <b>dysphoria</b> in both dogs and cats.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone {{is used as}} a {{medication}} for the treatment of males with too little or no natural testosterone production, certain forms of breast cancer, and gender <b>dysphoria</b> in transgender men. This is known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), which maintains serum testosterone levels in the normal range. Decline of testosterone production with age has led to interest in androgen replacement therapy. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful.|$|E
25|$|Gender <b>dysphoria</b> {{or gender}} {{identity}} disorder (GID) {{occurs when the}} child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as transsexualism, occurs when a person has {{a strong desire to}} be the opposite sex because they feel uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross-dressing or the desire to rid of their physical characteristic. GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviours. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age.|$|E
25|$|Like other opioid drugs, {{pethidine}} has {{the potential}} to cause physical dependence or addiction. It {{may be more likely to}} be abused than other prescription opioids, perhaps because of its rapid onset of action. When compared with oxycodone, hydromorphone, and placebo, pethidine was consistently associated with more euphoria, difficulty concentrating, confusion, and impaired psychomotor and cognitive performance when administered to healthy volunteers. The especially severe side effects unique to pethidine among opioidsâ€”serotonin syndrome, seizures, delirium, <b>dysphoria,</b> tremorâ€”are primarily or entirely due to the action of its metabolite, norpethidine.|$|E
25|$|For {{some years}} after the Iranian Revolution, {{transgender}} people were classified by the Judiciary as being homosexual and were thus {{subject to the same}} laws. However, in the mid-1980s the Judiciary began changing this policy and classifying transgender individuals as a distinct group, separate from homosexuals, granting them legal rights. Gender <b>dysphoria</b> is officially recognized in Iran today, and the Judiciary permits sexual reassignment surgery for those who can afford it. In the early 1960s, Ayatollah Khomeini had issued a ruling permitting gender reassignment, which has since been reconfirmed by Ayatollah Khamenei.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} gender {{identity}} {{appeared in the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in its third edition, DSM-III (1980), {{in the form of}} two psychiatric diagnoses of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the DSM-III-R, added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder. In 2013, the DSM-5 renamed the diagnosis gender <b>dysphoria</b> and revised its definition.|$|E
