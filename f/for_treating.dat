The obtained {{data from the}} untreated and treated pulps with fungi were compared using t-test. Mean values of the chemical analysis for crude protein, ash, organic mater, NDF and ADF for untreated lemon pulp were 6. 3, 6. 2, 93. 8, 21. 3 and 17. 9; <b>for</b> <b>treated</b> lemon pulp 25. 1, 10. 6, 89. 4, 12. 7 and 6. 8; for untreated orange pulp 6. 8, 6. 5, 94. 5, 26. 1 and 20. 3; and <b>for</b> <b>treated</b> orange pulp 23. 2, 8. 1, 91. 9, 18. 5 and 15, respectively. In all cases, a significant difference (P&lt; 0. 01) between untreated pulp and treated pulp of lemon and orange was observed. Digestibility coefficient of DM, OM and DOMD of untreated lemon pulp were 79. 3, 80. 5 and 75. 5; treated lemon pulp were 91. 4, 93. 5 and 83. 5; untreated orange pulp were 81. 5, 82. 8 and 78. 2 %; and treated orange pulp were 91. 2, 94. 5 and 86. 9 %, respectively. The digestibility coefficient <b>for</b> the <b>treated</b> pulps (lemon and orange) was significantly (P&lt; 0. 01) higher than those untreated. The percentages of DM degradability of pulps in nylon bag after 48 hours of incubation with the out-flow rate of 0. 05 were as follows: 66. 3 for untreated lemon; 75. 2 <b>for</b> <b>treated</b> lemon; 68. 7 for untreated orange; and 75. 5 <b>for</b> <b>treated</b> orange. The DM degradability <b>for</b> the <b>treated</b> pulps (lemon and orange) was significantly (P&lt; 0. 01) higher than those untreated. The effective degradability of protein after 48 hours of incubation in nylon bag with the out-flow rate of 0. 05 was as follows: 12. 1 for untreated lemon; 73. 7 <b>for</b> <b>treated</b> lemon; 14. 8 for untreated orange; and 77. 8 <b>for</b> <b>treated</b> orange. The effective degradability of protein <b>for</b> the <b>treated</b> pulps (lemon and orange) was significantly (P&lt; 0. 01) higher than those untreated.

5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} <b>for</b> <b>treating</b> chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit.

5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines.

They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications <b>for</b> <b>treating</b> acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E
