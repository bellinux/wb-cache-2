25|$|Performance {{related to}} hard-disk access is also {{slightly}} slower on a Wubi install, more {{so if the}} underlying disk <b>image</b> <b>file</b> is fragmented, as the disk <b>image</b> <b>file</b> in the Windows filesystem contains a Linux filesystem whereas without Wubi only the Linux filesystem is used that has direct hardware access.|$|E

25|$|A {{file system}} can present a file of a {{particular}} type as a volume in its own right, similar to a loop device. The OS refers to this functionality as an image filing system. This allows transparent handling of archives and similar files, which appear as directories with some special properties. Files inside the <b>image</b> <b>file</b> appear in the hierarchy underneath the parent archive. It is not necessary for the archive to contain the data it refers to: some symbolic link and network share filesystems put a reference inside the <b>image</b> <b>file</b> and go elsewhere for the data.|$|E

25|$|JPEG {{compression}} {{is used in}} {{a number}} of <b>image</b> <b>file</b> formats. JPEG/Exif is the most common image format used by digital cameras and other photographic image capture devices; along with JPEG/JFIF, it is the most common format for storing and transmitting photographic images on the World Wide Web. These format variations are often not distinguished, and are simply called JPEG.|$|E
25|$|Agostino Russo then refined the loop-installation concept, {{moving from}} a simple loopmounted pre-made <b>image</b> <b>file</b> to an image created on the fly using a {{dynamically}} patched version of the Debian installer, thus providing an experience which was closer to a real installation while addressing several other issues of the early prototypes. Lupin project was thus born and Agostino Russo wrote and implemented most of its code with some contributions from Geza Kovacs.|$|E

25|$|HD Photo (previously {{known as}} Windows Media Photo) is a {{photographic}} still <b>image</b> <b>file</b> format, that is introduced with Windows Vista. It supports {{features such as}} high dynamic range imaging, lossy as well as lossless compression, up to 32-bpp fixed or floating point representation, transparency, RGB, CMYK and n-channel color spaces, Radiance RGBE, embedded ICC color profiles, multiple images per file and support for Exif and XMP metadata formats. It is the preferred image format for XPS documents.|$|E
25|$|Tagged <b>Image</b> <b>File</b> Format (TIFF) is {{a format}} that {{incorporates}} an extremely {{wide range of}} options. While this makes TIFF useful as a generic format for interchange between professional image editing applications, it makes adding support for it to applications a much bigger task and so it has little support in applications not concerned with image manipulation (such as web browsers). The high level of extensibility also means that most applications provide only a subset of possible features, potentially creating user confusion and compatibility issues.|$|E

This invokes the IL2CPU {{compiler}} which systematically scans {{through all of}} the applications CIL code (excluding the Cosmos compiler code), converting it into assembly language for the selected processor architecture. , only x86 is supported. Next, Cosmos invokes the selected assembler to convert this assembly language code into native central processing unit (CPU) opcode.

40|$|Information {{represented}} in a digitized image format (such as remote sensing, satellite, or photographic images) {{is becoming more}} readily available. These <b>image</b> <b>files</b> contain massive amounts of information requiring more efficient storage and transfer methods. The large size of these <b>image</b> <b>files</b> requires investigation of quality issues, transfer methods, and storage mechanisms. Digitized image data compression allows for faster file transfer over networks and requires less storage space for large <b>image</b> <b>files.</b> While moving over networks, compressed files are less affected by network errors because of the reduced transfer time. With data compression, however, {{the quality of the}} image is sometimes sacrificed for the sake of size and speed. This report discusses our research of digitized image data compression and transfer, including storage mechanisms used, compression techniques currently available for Macintosh and UNIX platforms, and the methods used to transfer <b>image</b> <b>files</b> over networks...|$|R
25|$|Several {{additional}} {{standards have}} evolved to address these issues. The first of these, released in 1992, was JPEG File Interchange Format (or JFIF), followed {{in recent years by}} Exchangeable <b>image</b> <b>file</b> format (Exif) and ICC color profiles. Both of these formats use the actual JIF byte layout, consisting of different markers, but in addition employ one of the JIF standard's extension points, namely the application markers: JFIF uses APP0, while Exif uses APP1. Within these segments of the file, that were left for future use in the JIF standard and aren't read by it, these standards add specific metadata.|$|E
25|$|To support {{third-party}} firmware, Linksys has re-released the WRT54G v4, {{under the}} new model name WRT54GL (the 'L' in this name allegedly stands for 'Linux'). It is also possible to replace the 2MB flash chip in the WRT54G with a 4MB flash chip. The Macronix International 29LV320BTC-90 is a suitable part although others may work as well. The user must first install a JTAG header and use a JTAG cable {{to back up the}} firmware, then replace the chip and restore the firmware with the JTAG cable. After testing for proper functionality of the modified unit, third-party firmware can be flashed using the JTAG cable and a suitable <b>image</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
25|$|Windows Imaging Component (WIC) {{is a new}} {{extensible}} imaging {{framework that}} allows applications supporting the framework to automatically get support of installed codecs for graphics file formats. Windows Presentation Foundation applications also automatically support the installed image codecs. Third party developers can write their own image codecs for their specific <b>image</b> <b>file</b> formats. By default, Windows Vista ships with the JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, BMP and HD Photo codecs. Codecs for RAW image formats used generally by high-end digital cameras are also supported in this manner. Windows Explorer, Windows Photo Gallery and Windows Photo Gallery Viewer are based on this new framework and can thus view and organize images in any format for which the necessary codecs are installed.|$|E

25|$|A GIMP plug-in for {{creating}} animations. GAP can save animations in several formats, including GIF and AVI. The animation function relies on GIMP's layering and <b>image</b> <b>file</b> name numbering capability. Animations are created either by placing each frame {{on its own}} layer (in other words, treating each layer as an animation cel), or by manipulating each numbered file {{as if it were}} a frame in the video: moving, rotating, flipping, changing colors, applying filters, etc. to the layers by taking advantage of interpolation within function calls(plug-in usage), within a specified frame range. The resulting project can be saved as an animated GIF or encoded video file. GAP also provides programmed layer transitions, frame rate change, and move paths, allowing the creation of sophisticated animations.|$|E
25|$|Windows Explorer also {{contains}} modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer is the Details pane, which displays metadata and {{information relating to}} the currently selected file or folder. Windows Vista introduces a newer IThumbnailProvider interface that shows thumbnails in the Details pane {{as well as in}} large icon views. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an <b>image</b> <b>file,</b> or a filmstrip on a video file. Thumbnails can be zoomed on. The preview panel allows you to see thumbnails of all sorts of files and view the contents of documents, similar to the way you can preview email messages in Outlook, without opening the files. There's a new intelligent algorithm for creation of Video thumbnails, which chooses a random frame inside the video and ensures the thumbnail is not black (XP showed the first frame, it was usually black).|$|E
