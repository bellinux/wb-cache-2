5|$|In 1835, Victoria became {{seriously ill}} of typhoid fever {{on the last}} of the royal tours. Exploiting her {{weakened}} state, the Duchess and Conroy unsuccessfully tried to force her into signing a document; this document would have appointed Conroy her personal secretary upon her accession. Victoria emerged from the incident more determined than ever to become self-reliant. Her increased intransigence alarmed the Duchess. At her behest, family adviser Baron Stockmar investigated, recommending to the Duchess that she dismiss Conroy and make peace with her daughter. But Conroy easily convinced the Duchess to ignore Stockmar's advice. Even after Victoria's eighteenth birthday on 24 May 1837, Conroy continued to pressure her to appoint him as her private secretary or acknowledge <b>her</b> <b>need</b> for a regent until she turned twenty-one.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first house}} burned, {{and the family}} lost its possessions. They {{moved to a new}} house {{on the other side of}} town on Rose Street, which Williams' mother soon turned into a {{boarding}} house. The house had a small garden, on which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana. At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Hank Williams met U.S. Representative J. Lister Hill while he was campaigning across Alabama. Williams told Hill that his mother was interested to talk with him about his problems and <b>her</b> <b>need</b> to collect Elonzo Williams' disability pension. With Hill's help, the family began collecting the money. Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with <b>her</b> <b>need</b> to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E

25|$|Biographers {{differ on}} what {{was the basis for}} this arrangement. Little Leopold was ill in his infancy, and perhaps needed to be kept in Salzburg for this reason, but this does not explain why he was still kept there after his recovery. Another {{possibility}} attributes the arrangement to Marianne's delicate health or <b>her</b> <b>need</b> {{to take care of her}} stepchildren. Biographer Maynard Solomon attributes the arrangement to Leopold's wish to revive his skills in training a musical genius, as he had done with Wolfgang. He also suggests that giving up her son was indicative of Marianne's total subordination to her father's wishes.|$|E
25|$|Theologically, {{one major}} {{controversy}} {{of the age}} was the Immaculate Conception. Anthony of Padua (1195–1231) supported Mary's freedom from sin and her Immaculate Conception. His many sermons on the Virgin Mary shaped the Mariological approach {{of a large number}} of Franciscans who followed his approach for centuries after his death. Gradually the idea that Mary had been cleansed of original sin at the very moment of her conception began to predominate, particularly after Duns Scotus dealt with the major objection to Mary's sinlessness from conception, that being <b>her</b> <b>need</b> for redemption. The very divine act, in making Mary sinless at the first instant of her conception was, he argued, the most perfect form of redemption possible.|$|E

40|$|The main {{theme that}} is {{analyzed}} {{in this thesis}} is the success of an Afro-American lady which {{is represented by the}} main female character, Queen, in Alex Haley's Queen. The writer views Queen's success not through what kind of survival techniques she uses in enduring the hardness of life, either during or after her bondage, instead the writer views it through Queen's ability to fulfill <b>her</b> <b>needs</b> as a healthy personality according to Maslow's Human Motivation Needs' hierarchy, which places self-actualization as the highest need, and with the fulfillment of this need, Queen can be said as a successful person. Since Queen is a mulatto, the writer is curious to know whether Queen finds herself as one of the whites or of the blacks, and whether she can fulfill all of <b>her</b> <b>needs</b> and achieve <b>her</b> self-actualization based on her self-identity and surrounding. For that reason, the writer wants to prove through the analysis that Queen can not fulfill all of <b>her</b> <b>needs</b> when she chooses {{to be one of the}} whites, whereas as one of the blacks in the right society she can; thus she can be considered as a successful Afro-American lady. In order to accomplish this, the writer uses literary tools namely character and conflict to show Queen's attitudes and struggles to gratify all of <b>her</b> <b>needs,</b> and above literary theories, the writer utilizes psychological theory for normal personality that is Maslow's theory of Human Motivation <b>Needs,</b> as <b>her</b> additional theory in order to show why Queen's selfactualization is considered as a success. Finally, the writer concludes that Queen can be considered as a successful Afro-American lady in life by being able to gratify all of <b>her</b> <b>needs</b> and being able to achieve her self-actualization among her family and the black society based on her identity as a black...|$|R

500|$|For Bhattacharya, Ahalya is {{the eternal}} woman who {{responds}} to her inner urges and the advances {{of the divine}} ruler, a direct contrast to her ascetic husband, who did not satisfy her carnal desire. The author regards Ahalya as an independent woman who makes her own decisions, takes risks and is driven by curiosity to experiment with the extraordinary and then accept the curse imposed on her by patriarchal society.
