40|$|The article {{considers}} sociological {{aspects of}} one of the most complex and urgent problems of the contemporary Russian society - the growing <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> social relationships between patients and doctors. Undoubtedly, in medicine each group - doctors and patients - is an element of poorly structured social network and an integral part of all types of interaction in the prevention and treatment of various diseases. This system of relationships is institutionalized and complex in itself, but social and economic processes can complicate or facilitate its functioning. Unfortunately, the growth of social differentiation in the Russian society in the last decades had a negative impact on all spheres of life including healthcare. Under given conditions and social stratification trends each group - doctors and patients - has developed specific value orientations as a kind of professional and personal quintessence of the current fundamental values. In particular, dissatisfaction with the financial situation in the light of work efforts and high level of education explains why doctors consider their social status inadequate and are forced to satisfy their material needs with the help of illegal means. The author proposes some measures to reduce the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> medicine and <b>society</b> relationships in the contemporary Russian society, which suggest changing traditional models of healthcare and conflict management through the purposeful influence on the subject and object of the unbalanced relationships...|$|R

Wright Mills, {{drawing from}} the {{theories}} of Vilfredo Pareto and Gaetano Mosca, contends that the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> power in <b>society</b> derives from the complete absence of countervailing powers against corporate leaders of the Power elite. [...] Mills both incorporated and revised Marxist ideas. While he shared Marx's recognition of a dominant wealthy and powerful class, Mills believed that the source for that power lay {{not only in the}} economic realm but also in the political and military arenas. During the 1950s, Mills stated that hardly anyone knew about the power elite's existence, some individuals (including the elite themselves) denied the idea of such a group, and other people vaguely believed that a small formation of a powerful elite existed. [...] "Some prominent individuals knew that Congress had permitted a handful of political leaders to make critical decisions about peace and war; and that two atomic bombs had been dropped on Japan {{in the name of the}} United States, but neither they nor anyone they knew had been consulted." ...|$|R

This paper, by using empirical method and adjusting the data of trade from 1989 to 2005, finds that the causes <b>of</b> the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> China-US trade are as follows: 1) the <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> domestic demands of US; 2) the adjustment of American economic structure, and 3) the growing of multinational enterprises.
