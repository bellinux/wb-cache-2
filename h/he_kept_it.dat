Truman {{printed a}} one trillion-dollar bill to help {{reconstruct}} post-war Europe and enlisted Montgomery Burns {{to transport the}} bill. However, it never arrived and the FBI suspects Burns still has it with him. Homer is sent in to investigate. At the Burns estate, Homer searches for the bill before Burns, who believes Homer is a reporter from Collier's magazine, reveals that <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> in his wallet. Johnson and Agent Miller burst in and arrest Burns. Burns shouts how the government oppresses the average American. Moved by Burns's speech, Homer knocks out the FBI agents and frees Burns.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with Ghanchi tradition, Modi's marriage was arranged {{by his parents}} {{when he was a}} child. He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams. Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> a secret because otherwise he could not have become a 'pracharak' in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh. Although Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career, he acknowledged his wife when he filed his nomination for a parliamentary seat in the 2014 general elections. Modi maintains a close relationship with his mother, Hiraben and often visits her on his birthday to seek her blessings.|$|E
5|$|Morris oversaw {{production}} of the League's monthly—soon to become weekly—newspaper, Commonweal, serving as its editor for six years, during which time <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> financially afloat. First published in February 1885, it would contain contributions from such prominent socialists as Engels, Shaw, Paul Lafargue, Wilhelm Liebknecht, and Karl Kautsky, with Morris also regularly writing articles and poems for it. In Commonweal he serialised a 13-episode poem, The Pilgrims of Hope, which was set {{in the period of}} the Paris Commune. From November 1886 to January 1887, Morris' novel, A Dream of John Ball, was serialised in Commonweal. Set in Kent during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, it contained strong socialist themes although proved popular among those of different ideological viewpoints, resulting in its publication in book form by Reeves and Turner in 1888. Shortly after, a collection of Morris' essays, Signs of Change, was published.|$|E

Another report said that he suggested he may coat his money in the powder, to prevent anyone stealing it. Federal officials did not believe his story about killing coyotes, equating it to using a thermonuclear device to ward off burglars.|$|E
25|$|The Dolphins had to punt {{early in}} the second quarter {{at the end of their}} next drive, once again forcing their defense to deal with the terror of Kelly, Thomas, and Reed. This time the three players would combine for 67 yards as Thomas rushed twice for eight and caught an 11-yard pass before Kelly's 43-yard {{completion}} to Reed brought up first and goal on the Miami 5-yard line. Thomas ran it across the goal line from there, giving the Bills a 20-3 lead. But on this occasion the Dolphins were ready to respond as Marino completed an 11-yard pass to Mark Duper on third and 5, and then hooked up with him again for a 64-yard touchdown completion that cut the score to 20-10. Not to be outdone, Kelly led the Bills back on a 68-yard scoring drive, starting with a 19-yard pass to Lofton on the first play and a 9-yard run on the next. Later in the drive, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> going with a 13-yard pass to Reed on fourth and 3 from the Dolphins 32, and eventually finished it off with a 7-yard touchdown toss to Lofton. With Norwood's extra point, the Bills were up by 17 at 27-10 with five minutes left in the half.|$|E
25|$|Robin, however, {{sensed the}} truth and killed her before leaving for the play. Then he planted the {{evidence}} and made the three calls {{to make it appear}} that a woman had committed the crime. At this point he still had the photo, but rather than destroy it, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> and planted it at Mrs Summerhayes' house to incriminate her. But Poirot had gone through the drawer earlier and did not see the photo, so he knew it had been planted subsequently. Further revelations are also made. Eve Carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own, which was why she didn't co-operate in the investigation. Poirot discovers that Dr Rendell may have killed his first wife, which led Mrs Rendell to talk about anonymous letters she'd received warning her of the fact. Poirot now suspects it was Dr Rendell, convinced that Poirot was in Broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife, and not that of Mrs McGinty, who tried to push him under the oncoming train, not Robin. Maude Williams {{turns out to be the}} daughter of Eva Kane's lover, and has always believed that her mother was murdered by Eva and that her father took the blame. She came to see Mrs Upward, who she thought was Eva Kane, intending to confront her, but found her dead and left quietly. She admits this to Poirot, who agrees to keep it a secret and wishes her good luck in her life.|$|E

25|$|Ching Leung – Leung is a 27-year-old renowned lawyer. He is Sum’s boyfriend {{towards the}} middle of the series. He is a moody but {{vigilant}} and caring figure who forever strives to do his best. Although he is a kind person, he has an inability to stay faithful and succumbs. At one point he had an affair with Sheung Joi Sum's best friend Shui Mak Mak, but <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> quiet and reconciled with Sheung Joi Sum without admitting anything about the matter. Eventually information would slip and Sheung Joi Sum actively demands to know who was the other woman, but Ching felt exposing this matter would ruin everything and insists for her to drop the matter since he admitted his mistakes and assures Sheung Joi Sum it would never happen again. Sheung Joi Sum wasn't satisfied with such an answer and whenever he tries to comfort her, Tong Chi On would be around and he becomes jealous. After the big secret was exposed, everyone parted ways for some time and Leung would try to patch things between him and Sheung Joi Sum. Despite the fact that they broke up, Leung continues to love Sum. This is shown when he continues to write in his blog, Days without Sheung Joi Sum, three years after the break-up. He also helps Sheung Joi Sum think of ideas to defend Ling Lei. He eventually dies of a car crash in the end, because he was thinking about Sheung Joi Sum's decision to forgive him or not. Although he could be saved, he refuses to go to the hospital, using his final moments to tell Sheung Joi Sum ways to defeat Wong Sau-Kam. Sheung Joi Sum, who forgave Leung and is willing to renew their relationship, was greatly sadden by his death.|$|E
500|$|Moran was a {{stand-up}} style goaltender. At [...] and 180lb (82kg/12 st 12lb), {{he was considered}} a big goaltender for his era. In Moran's era, goaltenders {{were not allowed to}} drop down to the ice to make saves, so his style suited him well. Moran was especially noted for his aggressive defense of the area in front of his net. He used his stick to slash opposing players within reach. Moran often chewed tobacco while on the ice, and another favorite tactic of his was to expectorate at opposing players. Moran's stick work was described as attempts to [...] "slash [...] heads off with lightning strokes of his blade". Moran often wore oversized sweaters, claiming that they kept him warm in the cold arenas; however, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> unbuttoned, and often used it to catch shots.|$|E
500|$|The new Dorchester Hotel was feted with a {{grand opening}} on 18 April (21 April also cited) 1931 by Lady Violet Astor. The Dorchester quickly gained {{reputation}} as a luxury hotel. During the 1930s it became known as a haunt of numerous writers and artists such as poet Cecil Day-Lewis, novelist Somerset Maugham, and the painter Sir Alfred Munnings. There were prestigious literary gatherings, including [...] "Foyles Literary Luncheons", an event the hotel still hosts. [...] Shortly after the opening, Sir Percival David, a leading admirer of Chinese porcelain, moved his growing collection from the Mayfair Hotel to the Dorchester, where <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> in his suites for many years. Danny Kaye began appearing in cabaret at the hotel in the 1930s, initially earning £50 a week. Many blues and jazz artists appeared at the hotel, including Alberta Hunter and the Jack Jackson Orchestra. In 1934, Hunter and her orchestra recorded Noël Coward's [...] "I Travel Alone" [...] and Cole Porter's [...] "Miss Ortis Regrets" [...] at the hotel; both Coward and Porter were fans. It also became a rendezvous for many businessmen; {{it was at the}} Dorchester that British Petroleum formed a joint Collaborate Committee with ICI in 1943.|$|E

500|$|On December 28, 2004, Mike Brown and {{his team}} {{discovered}} Haumea on images they had taken with the 1.3m SMARTS Telescope at the Palomar Observatory in the United States on May 6, 2004, while looking for what he hoped would be the tenth planet. The Caltech discovery team used the nickname [...] "Santa" [...] among themselves, because they had discovered Haumea on December 28, 2004, just after Christmas. However, it was clearly {{too small to be}} a planet, because it was significantly smaller than Pluto, and Brown did not announce the discovery. Instead <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> under wraps, along with several other large trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), pending additional observation to better determine their natures. When his team discovered Haumea's moons, they realized that Haumea was more rocky than other TNOs, and that its moons were mostly ice. They then discovered a small family of nearby icy TNOs, and concluded that these were remnants of Haumea's icy mantle, which had been blasted off by a collision. On July 7, 2005, while he was finishing the paper describing the discovery, Brown's daughter Lilah was born, which delayed the announcement further. On July 20, the Caltech team published an online abstract of a report intended to announce the discovery at a conference the following September. In this Haumea was given the code K40506A.|$|E
500|$|While at the Drunken Clam, Peter {{falls in}} love with a {{cardboard}} cutout of Kathy Ireland. He takes her home and has an 'affair' with her. Soon he is caught by Lois who calls him an idiot. Peter introduces Kathy to the kids as their new mom, but after finding that Chris took her into his room, he angrily confronts her and ends up ripping her in half. He tearfully buries her in the yard and begs Lois for forgiveness. Lois forgives him and they have sex and Lois is shocked when Peter discovers a [...] on her breast, causing her to go to the hospital the next day to have it tested for breast cancer. The test comes back negative, but while looking through her medical records, Dr Hartman discovers that Lois' mother is a Jewish Holocaust survivor, making Lois and her children Jewish by heritage. Barbara confirms her heritage, and Carter admits <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> a family secret so that they could join the country club. Despite not being Jewish himself, Peter takes to it eagerly, much to Lois' frustration. That night, Peter is visited by the ghost of his adoptive father, Francis, who warns him that he will go to Hell for not being Catholic. The next day, Peter decides to re-convert the family to Catholicism and becomes prejudiced against Lois' heritage, becoming anti-Semitic.|$|E
500|$|The second video, {{created to}} {{accompany}} the 1992 single release that was recorded at Sound City Studios, was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who had previously directed the band's videos for [...] "Come as You Are" [...] and [...] "Lithium". Cobain's original concept for the video {{told the story of}} a young girl born into a Ku Klux Klan family who one day realizes how evil they are. His concept was too ambitious, so Cobain instead decided to parody musical performances by bands on early 1960s variety shows, such as The Ed Sullivan Show. The humorous tone of the video was a result of Cobain being [...] "so tired for the last year of people taking us so seriously [...] [...] [...] I wanted to fuck off and show them that we have a humorous side to us". Kerslake filmed the video on old Kinescope cameras, and the band improvised its performance. The video begins with an unnamed variety show host (played by Doug Llewelyn, former host of The People's Court) introducing Nirvana to an in-studio crowd of screaming teenagers; their non-stop screaming is heard throughout the duration of the song. The band members, whom the host refers to as [...] "thoroughly all right and decent fellas", perform dressed in Beach Boys-style outfits; Cobain wears glasses that blurred his vision, while Novoselic cut his hair short and liked it so much <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> that way afterwards. As the video progresses, the band destroys the set and its instruments.|$|E
