5|$|Some {{species such}} as tree {{squirrels}} and New World porcupines are arboreal, while some, such as gophers, tuco-tucos, and mole rats, live almost completely underground, where they build complex burrow systems. Others <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of the ground, but may have a burrow into which they can retreat. Beavers and muskrats are known for being semiaquatic, but the rodent best-adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless water rat from New Guinea. Rodents have also thrived in human-created environments such as agricultural and urban areas.|$|E

25|$|Iqbal's six English lectures were {{published}} in Lahore in 1930, {{and then by the}} Oxford University Press in 1934 in a book titled The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. The lectures had been delivered at Madras, Hyderabad and Aligarh. These lectures <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of Islam as a religion as well as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age. In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw as morally misguided, attached to power and without any standing with the Muslim masses.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} sources tell of {{the siege of}} the city from the {{perspective}} of the besiegers. No accounts of the events as seen from inside the city have survived to modern times. There is a total absence of Muslim sources, perhaps because of the absence of good writers in the city or perhaps due to a desire not to <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> loss of such an important city. Translations of some of the few Arabic texts that refer indirectly to the loss of the city are all that is available to cover this aspect of the history of the siege.|$|E

They {{did not wish to}} <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topic [...] "because every band on the planet already has" [...] and [...] "came from a certain perspective", so felt they had to present an alternative viewpoint.

500|$|Rice's {{novels are}} popular among {{many members of}} the LGBT community, some of whom have {{perceived}} her vampire characters as allegorical symbols of isolation and social alienation. Similarly, a reviewer writing for The Boston Globe observed that the vampires of her novels represent [...] "the walking alienated, those of us who, by choice or not, <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fringe." [...] On the subject, Rice herself commented, [...] "From the beginning, I've had gay fans, and gay readers who felt that my works involved a sustained gay allegory ... I didn't set out to do that, but that was what they perceived. So even when Christopher was a little baby, I had gay readers and gay friends and knew gay people, and lived in the Castro district of San Francisco, which was a gay neighborhood." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Bouleau {{wrote of}} the tension in Bruegel's {{compositional}} rhythms. [...] The picture is divided into nine equal parts divided {{by a set of}} parallel oblique lines. [...] These are divided by another network of lines at constant angles to the first. [...] The composition invites the reader to follow the action rather than <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> individual figures. [...] The blind men resemble each other in dress and facial features, and they appear as if they succeed one another in a single movement culminating in a fall, beginning on the left with [...] "rambling, then hesitation, alarm, stumbling, and finally falling". [...] The succession of heads follows a curve, and the further the succession, the greater the space between heads, suggesting increasing speed. [...] The steep roofs of the background houses contribute to the composition's feeling of motion.|$|E

[...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend to <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E

500|$|Standing on {{the edge}} of the old town, the {{recently}} completed Churche's Mansion survived the fire of 1583 which destroyed almost all of Nantwich east of the River Weaver. The only other buildings known to have survived were Sweetbriar Hall, also on Hospital Street, and the parish church. Richard Churche willed [...] "the house ... wherein I now <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ospell Street" [...] to his second son, Rondull, Randol or Randle Church(e). The house is mentioned among the principal houses of the town in a 1622/3 account by William Webb, who describes the mansion as [...] "a fair timber-house of Mr. Randol Church, a gentleman of singular integrity." [...] Randle Church survived until 1648, outliving his son and grandson, and Churche's Mansion then passed to the Shropshire branch of the family, descended from Richard Churche's eldest son, William. The Churche family inhabited the house until at least 1691, when a rate book records Saboth Church as the resident and gives the rates as 2 shillings 8½ pence.|$|E
500|$|Of the Baltic tribes {{may have}} written Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy when {{they spoke of}} the Veneti, Venedi or Venedai people. Pliny in Natural History locates them {{in the mouth of}} the Vistula region, while Ptolemy in Geographia just east of the lower Vistula along the Bay of Gdańsk. The Western Baltic Veneti's {{territory}} may have reached east all the way to Sambia. Tacitus in Germania, describing (possibly the same) inhabitants of the south-eastern Baltic shores, mentioned the Aesti people, involved in collecting amber not for their own use but for long distance trade in a raw state. Jordanes in Getica speaks of the [...] "Aesti, who <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> farthest shore of the German Ocean" [...] (beyond the Germanic-named Vidivarii people, who occupied the mouth of the Vistula area). This [...] "Ocean" [...] he defines as where the floods of the Vistula empty, the Baltic Sea. Various versions of the Aesti name were used later for various purposes; in particular that's what in the 9th century the Baltic Old Prussian people were called and their country was then referred to as Aestland.|$|E
500|$|... "Homecoming" [...] {{serves as}} a heartfelt tribute to West's {{hometown}} of Chicago, Illinois. Using an extended metaphor that personifies {{the city as a}} childhood sweetheart named 'Windy' (a reference to Chicago's nickname of the 'Windy City'), West rhymes about his love for Chicago and his guilt over leaving [...] "her" [...] to pursue his musical dream. The song's opening lines lyrically paraphrase [...] "I Used to Love H.E.R.", a similarly metaphoric hip-hop song made by West's close friend and labelmate Common, who later appeared in the single's music video. West dedicated [...] "Big Brother" [...] to Jay Z, whom he feels so close to that he sees him as a brother. Within the song, West dually details his love and admiration as well as his envy and antagonism towards Jay Z, metaphorically equating their relationship to that of a sibling rivalry. West also uses the song's chorus as a subsidiary dedication to his mentor No I.D., who first taught him how to produce music. Similar to its musicality, the songwriting characteristics of the album-closing track, [...] "Good Night" [...] alludes to West's next musical progression. The majority of song is composed of repetitive recitations of its choruses and bridges by Mos Def and Al Be Back. West melodically raps only one single verse in which he nostalgically reminisces over taking trips to the museum with his grandparents. As his verse draws to a close, West chastises that a person can't <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> past, and charges himself with living his life like he has no tomorrow. In retrospect, with the death of his mother Donda West less than two months after the album was released in addition to the dissolution of his engagement with fiancée Alexis Phifer, the trace amounts of melancholy found scattered throughout Graduation would all but envelop West's next studio album, 808s & Heartbreak.|$|E
