All the games were published by Atlus in Japan; {{none of them have}} been released in English, but the user interface of Majin Tensei II is in English rather than Japanese. Rather than the Megami Tensei series regular Tsukasa Masuko, the soundtracks for the {{first two games}} were composed by Hidehito Aoki; he composed the Majin Tensei music on his own, and cooperated with Misaki Okibe on Majin Tensei II. He made use of ambient music, while also incorporating elements of funk, <b>electronic</b> <b>distortion</b> and sound effects; for the second game, he also introduced a focus on synthesized piano in the compositions. Music albums featuring the first two games' original soundtracks, along with new arrangements, were released by Pony Canyon: Majin Tensei Excellence Sound Collection was published on March 18, 1994, and Majin Tensei II: Spiral Nemesis Excellence Sound Collection on May 19, 1995.

In the case of coexistence of boron atoms and vacancy, the modified grapheme presents spin polarization only when B atoms locate far from vacancy. Thus, when a boron atom fills single and divacancies, it suppresses the spin polarization of the charge density. In particular, when B atoms fill a divacancy, {{a new type of}} rearrangement occurs, where a stable BC 4 unit is formed inducing important out-of-plane distortions to graphene.

50|$|Electro (or electro-funk) is a {{genre of}} {{electronic}} music and early hip hop directly {{influenced by the}} use of the Roland TR-808 drum machines, and funk.

This is the main distinction between electro and previously prominent genres such as disco, in which the electronic sound was only part of the instrumentation. It also palpably deviates from its predecessor boogie for being less vocal-oriented and more focused on electronic beats produced by drum machines.|$|E

50|$|His symphonic {{approach}} to jazz fusion {{made him a}} popular fusion artist of the 1970s. In 1972, he featured prominently on Elton John's Honky Chateau album.

He sometimes also uses a 6-string electric violin called the Violectra, with low C and F strings - {{not to be confused with}} the violectra he played from the late 1960s to the mid-80s which had 4 strings, but tuned an octave lower. Ponty was among the first to combine the violin with MIDI, <b>electronic</b> <b>distortion</b> boxes, phase shifters, and wah-wah pedals.

5000|$|Furthermore, {{the term}} Modular and/or Modular Music is often applied {{nowadays}} to Electronic Music especially: examples {{can be found}} in the Serge synthesizer, Modular synthesizer, in the work of composer and performer Scot Gresham-Lancaster, one of the early pioneers of [...] "computer network" [...] music which uses the behavior of interconnected music machines to create innovative ways for performers and computers to interact.

The music of Disc Jockey can be as well considered a modern example of modular music, where different and independent modules are mixed rather than overlapped, played simultaneously and the third modules represented by the Dj him/herself who interacts with the two ongoing modules (tracks).|$|E
5000|$|While the {{composer}} depends on his instrumental writing for providing an expressive context to the actions, {{it is his}} use of many different vocal styles that enables a musical characterization of Father Grandier and Sister Jeanne. It is thus through these vocal lines that the characters' moral, mental, and emotional states are judged. The correct literary style of Grandier is emphasized in the opera by the fluency of the recitative, its coherence with speech intonations and subdued expression. In addition, Grandier's use of speech in the second act may be interpreted as representative of the protagonist's sobriety. In contrast, Jeanne's vocal style is very pointillist. The frequent leaps, changes of character, drastic dynamic changes, and glissando, characteristic of Jeanne's vocal part, are emblematic of her hysteria and falseness. Furthermore, Jeanne's demonical possession is underscored {{by the use of}} laughter, groans, and <b>electronic</b> <b>distortion</b> of her voice.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album is}} {{littered}} with references to Byrd's obsession with old-time American music such as the Dixieland jazz intro on [...] "I Won't Leave My Wooden Wife for You, Sugar". [...] "The American Metaphysical Circus" [...] starts out with five layers of sound being heard in a collage: a calliope playing [...] "National Emblem", a ragtime piano playing [...] "At a Georgia Camp Meeting", two marching bands playing [...] "Marching Through Georgia" [...] and [...] "The Red, White and Blue" [...] switching between left and right channels. The other two tracks are of electronic sounds. The marching bands were arranged and conducted by Byrd, rather than being taken from existing recordings. [...] Whether intended or not, the record {{took the form of}} a coherent [...] "song cycle", a radical commentary on contemporary American society. The words ranged from satires on decadence ("The American Metaphysical Circus", [...] "..Wooden Wife..", (this title being a parody of the 1905 music hall song, [...] "I Wouldn't Leave My Little Wooden Hut for You" [...] by Tom Mellor and Charles Collins) to lyrical expressions of longing (the pastoral [...] "Cloud Song", the political [...] "Love Song For The Dead Che"). Musically, the songs ranged from pseudo-classical elegance ("Stranded In Time", [...] "Where Is Yesterday") to aggressive discordance and hard rock ("The Garden of Earthly Delights", [...] "Hard Coming Love"), with heavy <b>electronic</b> <b>distortion</b> and collages of music such as brass bands, in line with Byrd being heavily influenced by Charles Ives. The final suite [...] "The American Way of Love" [...] integrates most of these elements, with a dreamlike ending containing a collage of earlier tracks. According to Lillian Roxon, the three-part suite [...] "dealt most explicitly with the activities of homosexual prostitutes on New York's notorious 42nd Street".|$|E
5000|$|While {{working with}} the United States of America in 1967, Byrd {{provided}} an arrangement and electronic music for [...] "Crucifixion" [...] on Phil Ochs' album Pleasures of the Harbor. The song was taken to be a comment on the assassination of President Kennedy, but the version on the album, according to Unterberger, set Ochs' vocal against [...] "an eerie morass of loops, electric harpsichord, and washes of <b>electronic</b> <b>distortion,</b> arranged by Joseph Byrd... This made him sound {{for all the world}} like a lone voice drowning in an avant-garde thunderstorm, which in the eyes of many fans obscured the terrible beauty of the song." [...] Another critic, Mark Brend, describes the track as [...] "one of the great audacious gestures of 1960s rock". Byrd also arranged two tracks on the 1968 album by folk group the Limeliters, Time To Gather Seeds.In the early 1970s Byrd taught at California State University, Fullerton, where he introduced one of the first courses in American music (offered as part of the American Studies curriculum). He also researched the history of American popular music and, in 1974, founded the Yankee Doodle Society with Clare Spark, to research, promote and perform popular music of the mid-19th century American middle class. In 1975 Byrd was approached by Takoma Records to make a record of synthesized Christmas carols, A Christmas Yet to Come (Takoma C-1046), and in 1976, Yankee Transcendoodle (Takoma C-1051), an LP of synthesized patriotic music in conjunction with the United States Bicentennial. On the albums, Byrd worked with Don Buchla, and synthesisers again made by Tom Oberheim. The albums were followed by a third Takoma LP Sentimental Songs of the Mid-19th Century, by the American Music Consort (Joseph Byrd, Director - Takoma A-1048 - 1976), and the 6-sided LP set Popular Music In Jacksonian America (Musical Heritage Society MHS834651 - 1982).|$|E
