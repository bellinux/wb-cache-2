40|$|In modern society, {{the cell}} phone has become a virtual {{extension}} of most Americans, managing all kinds of personal and business matters. Modern cell tower technology allows cell service providers to accumulate a wealth of individuals’ location information while they use their cell phones, and such data is available for law enforcement to obtain without a warrant. This is problematic under the Fourth Amendment, which protects reasonable expectations of privacy. Under the Katz two-prong test, (1) individuals have an actual, subjective expectation of privacy in their cell site location data, and (2) society is prepared to acknowledge that expectation as reasonable. In addition, I propose that the second prong of the Katz test should be approached as a normative inquiry. Courts should ask whether society should expect privacy {{in this type of}} information. Currently, courts analyzing this issue have followed Supreme Court precedent from the 1970 s and 80 s, using shortcuts such as the third-party doctrine to decide the issue. This precedent is from an era that predates modern cell phone technology, and it fails to properly address the true privacy concerns implicated by cell site location data. A few courts have adopted the mosaic theory approach to the question of cell site location data. However this theory also fails to effectively guard against unconstitutional government intrusion in all instances. I propose that the best solution is to always require a warrant before allowing law enforcement to access cell site location data. This solution will provide a clear standard for courts, individuals, law enforcement agents, and cell service providers; also, it will ensure that millions of innocent Americans are protected from <b>intrusive</b> government <b>surveillance...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{interdisciplinary}} literature {{demonstrates that}} the built form constitutes home when people have capacity to exercise control. Consistent with normative ideas of autonomy and freedom, home {{is a place where}} we are free from surveillance; at home we expect to live of our own volition. Freedom and autonomy in the home are contrasted with the public realm, and the value of privacy in the home is central for self-determination and identity construction. In line with such reasoning, surveillance in housing is theorised, and indeed widely assumed, as antithetical to home. This paper presents empirical material to examine how surveillance in supportive housing is understood by those with firsthand experiences as tenants and service providers. The research draws on in-depth interviews with tenants (n = 28) and service providers (n = 22) in single-site supportive housing in Australia. The empirical material demonstrates how surveillance is experienced as <b>intrusive,</b> but that <b>surveillance</b> also promotes the conditions for people to feel safe and to exert control over their lives. The research shows how tenants actively used surveillance as a desirable resource, including using surveillance to restrict unwanted visitors. Surveillance achieved functions, particularly safety and security, that individuals were unable to experience as homeless or achieve in housing through informal controls...|$|R

40|$|From the Pinkerton private detectives of the 1850 s, to the closed-circuit {{cameras and}} email {{monitoring}} of the 1990 s, to new apps that quantify the productivity of workers, and to the collection of health data as part of workplace wellness programs, American employers have increasingly sought to track the activities of their employees. Starting with Taylorism and Fordism, American workers have become accustomed to heightened levels of monitoring that have only been mitigated by the legal counterweight of organized unions and labor laws. Thus, along with economic and technological limits, the law has always been presumed as a constraint on these surveillance activities. Recently, technological advancements in several fields—big data analytics, communications capture, mobile device design, DNA testing, and biometrics—have dramatically expanded capacities for worker surveillance {{both on and off}} the job. While the cost of many forms of surveillance has dropped significantly, new technologies make the surveillance of workers even more convenient and accessible, and labor unions have become much less powerful in advocating for workers. The American worker must now contend with an all-seeing Argus Panoptes built from technology that allows for the trawling of employee data from the Internet and the employer collection of productivity data and health data, with the ostensible consent of the worker. This raises the question of whether the law still remains a a meaningful avenue to delineate boundaries for worker surveillance. In this Article, we start from the normative viewpoint that the right to privacy is not an economic good that may be exchanged for the opportunity for employment. We then examine the effectiveness of the law as a check on <b>intrusive</b> worker <b>surveillance,</b> given recent technological innovations. In particular, we focus on two popular trends in worker tracking—productivity apps and worker wellness programs—to argue that current legal constraints are insufficient and may leave American workers at the mercy of 24 / 7 employer monitoring. We consider three possible approaches to remedying this deficiency of the law: (1) a comprehensive omnibus federal information privacy law, similar to approaches taken in the European Union, which would protect all individual privacy to various degrees regardless of whether or not one is at work or elsewhere and without regard to the sensitivity of the data at issue; (2) a narrower, sector-specific Employee Privacy Protection Act (EPPA), which would focus on prohibiting specific workplace surveillance practices that extend outside of work-related locations or activities; and (3) an even narrower sector and sensitivity-specific Employee Health Information Privacy Act (EHIPA), which would protect the most sensitive type of employee data, especially those that could arguably fall outside of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act’s (HIPAA) jurisdiction, such as wellness and other data related to health and one’s personhood...|$|R

40|$|Undetected {{fraudulent}} {{insurance claims}} in the United Kingdom are estimated to cost society some £ 2. 1 billion annually, and, some say, add some £ 50 to each policyholder's average annual insurance costs. The problem is manifest in several aspects: exaggerated 'first-party' insurance claims by an individual comprehensive insurance policyholder on their insurer, ‘malingering’ by a 'third-party' making a personal injury damages claim following a policyholder's alleged negligence, through to organised networks of criminal enterprises fabricating complex, intricate interconnected webs of fraudulent activities. The social media environment has given liability insurers a new, and increasingly potent, investigative weapon: a forensic analysis of an insurance claimant's social media footprint. Increasingly, evidence is acquired from a public social media space inhabited by a claimant {{in a much more}} cost-effective way than <b>intrusive,</b> expensive, video-based <b>surveillance</b> evidence. Investigators probe into a space where a claimant may expect a degree of privacy, and connected friends and contacts within social networks are increasingly targeted to identify networks and potential co-conspirators. The ethical parameters are often tested: such as where investigators 'friend' a claimant or a member of their network to acquire evidence for use in defending claims and civil proceedings by the claimant. This investigative, evidence-gathering process is situated in dealing with the private law civil litigation claims process, initiated by the allegedly fraudulent claimant. The private law regulation of the acquisition, deployment and purpose of this evidence differs from the conventional public regulatory and enforcement context, but shares some objectives, and engages issues of data sharing with law enforcement agencies. A recent trend has seen insurers increasingly ask civil courts in compensation litigation to visit sanctions, including imprisonment and fines, for civil contempt of court established against litigants proved to be dishonest using social media evidence, contrasted with their 'statements of truth' in documents filed by claimants in cases. This has implications beyond the insurance claims process – the scope for use in commercial litigation is yet to be explored. What are the tensions existing between private law and public law processes here? How well does the civil litigation process cope with this phenomenon? How do aspects of the Jackson reforms to the funding and costs of civil litigation affect behaviours? Do these investigation techniques sit well with domestic professional regulation and ethical behaviours? How do other jurisdictions deal with the issues? This paper aims to explore some of these topical issues...|$|R
