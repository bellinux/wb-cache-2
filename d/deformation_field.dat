40|$|Abstract. <b>Deformation</b> <b>fields</b> {{obtained}} from image registration are com-monly used for deriving measurements of morphological changes be-tween reference and follow-up images. As the underlying image match-ing problem is ill-posed, the exact shape of these <b>deformation</b> <b>fields</b> is often {{dependent on the}} regularization method. In longitudinal and cross-sectional studies this effect is amplified if time between acquisi-tions varies and smoothness between serial deformations is neglected. Existing solutions suffer from high computational costs, strong modeling assumptions and the bias towards a single reference image. In this pa-per, we propose a computationally efficient {{solution to this problem}} via a temporal smoothing formulation in the one-parameter subgroup of dif-feomorphisms parametrized by stationary velocity fields. When applied to modeling fetal brain development, the proposed regularization results in smooth <b>deformation</b> <b>fields</b> over time and high data fidelity. ...|$|R

50|$|In a {{continuous}} body, a <b>deformation</b> <b>field</b> {{results from a}} stress field induced by applied forces or is due {{to changes in the}} temperature field inside the body. The relation between stresses and induced strains is expressed by constitutive equations, e.g., Hooke's law for linear elastic materials. Deformations which are recovered after the stress field has been removed are called elastic deformations. In this case, the continuum completely recovers its original configuration. On the other hand, irreversible deformations remain even after stresses have been removed. One type of irreversible deformation is plastic deformation, which occurs in material bodies after stresses have attained a certain threshold value known as the elastic limit or yield stress, and are the result of slip, or dislocation mechanisms at the atomic level. Another type of irreversible deformation is viscous deformation, which is the irreversible part of viscoelastic deformation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a learning-based deformation estimation method for fast non-rigid registration. First, a PCA-based statistical deformation model is constructed using the <b>deformation</b> <b>fields</b> obtained by conventional registration algorithms between a template image and training subject images. Then, the constructed statistical model {{is used to}} generate {{a large number of}} sample <b>deformation</b> <b>fields</b> by resampling in the PCA space. In the meanwhile, by warping the template using these sample <b>deformation</b> <b>fields,</b> the respective sample images in the PCA space can be also generated. Finally, after learning the correlation between the features of the sample images and their deformation coefficients, given a new test image, we can immediately estimate its relative deformations to the template based on its image information. Using this estimated deformation, we can warp the template to generate an intermediate template close to the test image. Since the intermediate template is more similar to the test image compared to the original template, the deformable registration via the intermediate template becomes much easier and faster. Experimental results show that the proposed learning-based registration method can fast register MR brain image with robust performance. 1...|$|R
