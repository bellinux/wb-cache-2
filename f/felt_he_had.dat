5|$|Archer's visit precipitated {{a crisis}} in the colonial administration. It was <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been far too {{friendly}} to Abd al-Rahman, who was viewed with suspicion by many administrators. Archer was forced to resign, replaced by Sir John Maffey. Abd al-Rahman was placed under restriction on travel outside Omdurman and Khartoum and was told to instruct his supporters to halt their political and religious activities.|$|E
5|$|By late 1975, {{after seven}} years at the helm, Charles Perry <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{accomplished}} his goal and left the university to become {{president and publisher of}} the Sunday newspaper magazine Family Weekly (now USA Weekend), one of the country's largest magazines. When he left, there were more than 10,000 students attending classes and a campus with five major buildings and a sixth being planned.|$|E
5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska (1946–1975) was a Quarter Horse broodmare who {{produced}} eight foals, {{three of which}} would become world champion race horses. When she was a yearling, she was sold by her owner, although he had not really planned on selling her. He <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to because one of his employees had told a customer the filly was for sale.|$|E

5|$|In {{three of}} the {{previous}} five years, the legislature had {{failed to meet the}} June 30 deadline. On each of those occasions an agreement had been reached by the morning of July 2. Aides to Corzine claimed that the governor <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no choice but to order the shutdown under the state's Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Late Registration is {{the second}} of Kanye West's planned four education-themed studio albums. Following the major success of The College Dropout, the album reveals his {{progression}} in writing lyrics and an incorporation of {{a wider range of}} musical styles. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, {{due in part to the}} acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi {{trying to come up with}} a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
60|$|He {{laughed a}} little uneasily. In some vague way <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> displeased her.|$|R

6000|$|... "Universal. I don't know at least," [...] she said, [...] "what else {{to call it}} when a man's able to {{make himself}} without effort, without violence, without {{machinery}} of any sort, so intensely <b>felt.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> somehow an effect without his being in any traceable way a cause." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{next year}} the Capitols went 28–20 but were {{eliminated}} from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948–49 BAA season, the Caps won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38–22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned.|$|E
5|$|Blamey <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no choice, but his {{assumption}} of command of New Guinea Force sat uneasily with Rowell, {{the commander of}} I Corps there, who saw it as displaying a {{lack of confidence in}} him. A petulant Rowell would not be mollified, and, after a series of disagreements, Blamey relieved Rowell of his command, replacing him with Herring. More reliefs followed. Herring relieved Brigadier Arnold Potts of the 21st Infantry Brigade, replacing him with Brigadier Ivan Dougherty on 22 October. Five days later, Blamey replaced Allen as the 7th Division's commander with Vasey. Nor were generals the only ones to be removed. Blamey cancelled Chester Wilmot's accreditation as a war correspondent in October 1942 for spreading a false rumour that Blamey was taking payments from the laundry contractor at Puckapunyal. Wilmot was reinstated, but on 1 November 1942, Blamey again terminated Wilmot's accreditation, this time for good.|$|E
5|$|Donald Petrie was {{originally}} signed {{to direct the}} episode, but dropped out to direct the film Mystic Pizza. Executive producer Robert Justman brought in Rob Bowman to direct his first Star Trek episode. Justman later {{said that this was}} one of his most-significant achievements on The Next Generation. Bowman worked on storyboards and set blocking for twenty days before shooting the episode. He was initially nervous about working on the show, and <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to prove himself because of his relative inexperience as a director. Bowman said that after the second day of filming it became easier, and credited the crew with making him feel welcome. He went on to direct twelve more episodes of The Next Generation.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> demonstrated {{that he did}} not have the technical skills to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name to make money in the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than the asking price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E
5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation. He <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become a journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few of his teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his}} career with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted that he was in the early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent the}} 1964–65 season {{playing for the}} reserve side. On 1 January 1965 he became the only footballer to ever be knighted (for {{services}} to football) whilst still an active professional player; though he never thought himself worthy of such an honour. His only first team appearance of the season was also the last Football League game of his career; it came on 6 February 1965, just after his 50th birthday, and was necessitated by injuries to both Peter Dobing and Gerry Bridgwood. The opponents that day were Fulham, and Stoke won the game 3–1. Though he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> retired too early, and could have carried on playing for another two years, this brought an end to his 35-year professional career.|$|E
60|$|Urmston laughed, though <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been favoured with a hint. Mrs. Annersly, however, {{had more}} to say.|$|R
60|$|Lord Ormersfield mentally execrated Mr. Ponsonby, and <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> spoken too soon.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{looked at}} him sullenly. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been tricked; but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the promise, and Perkins would have to stand by it.|$|R
5|$|Hichens was {{recommended}} for the Victoria Cross {{for his actions}} during the night of 27/28 February. When informed by his commanding officer, Commander Kerr, of the intention to recommend him, Hichens requested that the recommendation be dropped as he now <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> endangered two of the boats in the flotilla trying to rescue his friends. Kerr, respecting his views, dropped the recommendation, only {{for it to be}} resubmitted six weeks later after his death. The recommendation was endorsed by Commander Kerr, Admiral Lyon (the Commander-in-chief at Nore) and Rear Admiral Rogers (the Flag officer in charge at Harwich). The recommendation was rejected by the Admiralty, citing the same reasons Hichens had himself given.|$|E
5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to join a faction as a hired gun, although it {{put him on the}} wrong side of the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to their disqualification, former presidents Hubert Maga and Sourou-Migan Apithy staged protests while Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, another ex-president, supported an obscure candidate named Basile Adjou Moumouni. The election was held on May 15, and was Dahomey's first since 1964. Moumouni won the election with 80 percent of the vote, but Alley declared the result void because the protest prevented nearly three-quarters of the electorate from voting. This result sparked further demonstrations, and Maga, Apithy, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and former president Christophe Soglo were forbidden to enter the country, {{in an attempt to}} crack down on dissent. Alley <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> made a mistake in disqualifying Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, as he believed that only they could bring unity to Dahomey.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Osan was {{the first}} U.S. ground action of the war. The fight showed that American forces were weak and {{unprepared}} for the war; outdated equipment was insufficient to fight North Korean armor and poorly trained and inexperienced units were no match for better-trained North Korean troops– though the disparity in number of troops engaged certainly {{had a profound effect}} on the outcome of this and future battles. Undisciplined U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely, leaving equipment and wounded for North Korean troops to capture. Smith also said he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> stayed too long in his position, allowing North Korean troops to envelop the force and cause heavy casualties as it retreated. These weaknesses would play out with other U.S. units for the next month as North Korean troops pushed them further back.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
5|$|After that season, coach Alex Hannum {{wanted to}} be closer to his family on the West Coast; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association. Chamberlain then asked for a trade, and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers. The {{motivation}} for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist close to the Lakers, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman-Chamberlain deal, but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay, who was the Sixers general manager then, Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left, and forced the trade himself. Cherry finally adds several personal reasons: the center <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> grown too big for Philadelphia, sought the presence of fellow celebrities (which were plenty in L.A.) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for a black man in L.A. but hard to imagine elsewhere back then.|$|E
