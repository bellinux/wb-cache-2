Results indicated that germination was greater for larger seed while the smallest seed germinated poorly. In addition, seedling survival in the nursery was also lower for Grade 4 Eucalyptus grandis but not for E. smithii. <b>Grade</b> 4 <b>seed</b> produced the shortest seedlings. This was attributed to a slower rate of germination within a tray of seedlings produced from <b>Grade</b> 4 <b>seed.</b> The <b>Grade</b> 4 <b>seed,</b> however, produced seedlings with larger root collar diameters due to a greater amount of empty spaces within a tray (a function of poor germination).

Cereal crops grown in these mixtures tend to accumulate more protein in their grain. At the same time they extend their growing season. The traditional oat production system in Poland is based on covered oats grown with vetch on poor and damp soils. Our objective was to determine the grain yield and quality of a naked oat cultivar grown as a pure crop and with a spring vetch companion crop. The field experiment was conducted at the Czyrna Experimental Station from 1999 to 2002. The naked oat cv. Akt was sown either as a pure crop or with spring vetch determinate cv. Ina at two seed rates. The amount of rainfall over the experimental years varied from 737 to 1040 mm, corresponding with the multiannual average of 834 mm. The effect of <b>graded</b> <b>seed</b> rates of spring vetch on yield and gross chemical composition of naked oat grain (AOAC, 1995) and ?-glucans content (the Megazyme assay kit no 995. 16) were determined. The present results confirm earlier findings indicating that total yields of wheat and triticale grown with legume companion plants were decreased with decreasing cereal seeding rates (Pisulewska, 1997). Cereal grain protein content was increased with increasing seeding rates of legume companions. We confirmed the negative relationship between oat grain protein and fat content, while ash and ?-glucans were only little, although significantly affected. In conclusion, the relative changes in grain yield and quality of naked oat grown either as a pure crop or with a spring vetch companion plant, were similar to those observed for wheat and triticale.

The potato type was Hermes (oval <b>graded</b> <b>seed</b> tubers). The forward speed was set to 2 km/h, and the amplitudes of the riddle chain of the implement were 17 and 25 mm. The study showed that average values of tubers lifting percentage were in close agreement for digging depths 17 and 22 cm. They were between 96. 9 % and 98. 0 %. But, the tubers lifting percentage was low for the depth of 12 cm (51. 3 % and 72. 8 % at the amplitudes of the riddle chain of 17 and 25 mm, respectively). At the amplitudes of 17 mm, total damaged tubers percentages ranged between 0. 76 % and 10. 96 % for the depths 22 and 12 cm, respectively, and ranged between 0. 04 % and 12. 01 % at the amplitude of 25 mm.

Objective: The {{aim of the}} research was to evaluate the effect of colour grading on the quality of milk thistle seeds. Methods: <b>Seeds</b> were <b>graded</b> manually by colour according to the Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, issued in Great Britain.

Irrigation water is provided immediately after sowing and then after 30, 70-75, 85-90, and 105-110 days; good drainage is facilitated to prevent any water-logging. Other cultivation methods of hoeing and weeding are done as required. Harvesting is done when the lower leaves of the plant start shedding and the pods turn colour. Timely manual harvesting is done by way of cutting using sickles. The harvested plants are tied in bundles and dried for 5-7 days.

40|$|Guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) is {{a natural}} rubber {{producing}} plant presently being commercialized for production in arid and semi-arid regions of the world.

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate why guayule seed and seed lots vary significantly in quality. The laboratory and greenhouse experiments involved separation of seed based on physical attributes (diameter, color and weight) and the confirmation of internal structures (embryo and endosperm) by x-ray analysis. The effect of different conditioning treatments on seed lots was also tested. Separation of seed by size (diameter) was shown to be less efficient than separation by color. Color was the most effective means of separating heavier and darker (opaque-black and gray color <b>grades)</b> <b>seed,</b> and these seed were confirmed to be filled, containing internal structures by x-ray analysis. Germination percentage and rate were greater for seed with these characteristics than for yellow and bright-black seed, which are lighter and predominately partially filled or unfilled. Conditioning treatments used for guayule seed older than two years had no effect on seed germination and emergence percentage or rate. However, differences in germination and emergence were found among lines, therefore, differences among seed lots appear to be due to variation in the number of filled seed. The quality of seed lots was significantly improved when seed were separated based on color first, then by weight. The separation of good quality seed (filled) from poor quality seed (unfilled) is crucial to lower the costs of stand establishment by direct seeding.
