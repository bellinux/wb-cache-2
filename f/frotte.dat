60|$|The unfortunate Etienne Dolet, {{perhaps the}} only {{publisher}} who was ever burned, used an ominous device, a trunk of a tree, with the axe struck into it. In publishing 'Les Marguerites de la Marguerite des Princesses, tres illustre Royne de Navarre,' Jean de Tournes employed a pretty allegorical device. Love, with the bandage thrust back from his eyes, and with the bow and arrows in his hand, has flown up to the sun, which he seems to touch; like Prometheus in the myth when he stole the fire, a shower of flowers and flames falls around him. Groueleau, of Paris, had for motto Nul ne s'y <b>frotte,</b> with the thistle for badge. These are beautifully combined in the title-page of his version of Apuleius, 'L'Amour de Cupido et de Psyche' (Paris, 1557). There is probably no better date for frontispieces, both for ingenuity of device and for elegance of arrangement of title, than the years between 1530 and 1560. By 1562, when {{the first edition of}} the famous Fifth Book of Rabelais was published, the printers appear to have thought devices wasted on popular books, and the title of the Master's posthumous chapters is printed quite simply.|$|E

50|$|Louis de <b>Frotté</b> {{was born}} in Alençon (Normandy). He joined the Royal Army in 1781, and was in command of {{infantry}} units by 1789, when the French Revolution broke out. <b>Frotté</b> joined the émigrés, and served in the combined Prussian and Austrian army of the Duke of Brunswick, which aimed to restore the monarchy in France.|$|E
50|$|The {{species were}} {{discovered}} in 2013 and were named and described by Samuel P. Iglésias and Lou <b>Frotté</b> in 2015.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frotté</b> {{soon became}} {{a leader of the}} Chouan revolt, {{organizing}} the rebels into military units and forming a staff. By 1796, however, forces under General Hoche had scored several victories, defeating the Chouans and forcing de <b>Frotté</b> to flee abroad, after repulsing his assault on Tinchebray. Returning to England, he was enlisted by Charles, Count of Artois (Louis XVI's younger brother), in an attempt to start yet another rebellion in his native Normandy.|$|E
50|$|Marie Pierre Louis de <b>Frotté</b> (August 1, 1766 - February 18, 1800) was a French {{soldier and}} an {{opponent}} of the Republic during the Revolutionary Wars.|$|E
50|$|Guerilla {{fighting}} resumed {{after the}} failure of the English royalist expedition and spread to Normandy where Louis de <b>Frotté,</b> freshly landed in France in 1795, organised the uprising.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frotté</b> {{met with}} Guidal at the Hôtel du Cygne on 15 February 1800. During the meeting, {{he was arrested}} by Republican forces and, three days later, brought before a {{military}} tribunal, which sentenced him to death by firing squad. He was executed on February 18.|$|E
5000|$|The {{surviving}} {{leaders of}} the royalist rebellions in the Vendée and Brittany, which had long been dormant, saw a new opportunity for success, and met to plan strategy on 15 September 1799. The royalist commander Louis de <b>Frotté,</b> in exile in England, returned to France to command the new uprising.|$|E
50|$|This {{rebellion}} {{was fairly}} successful, but, after Napoleon Bonaparte seized power, the tide {{began to turn}} against <b>Frotté,</b> as most of his direct subordinates were killed. When, in early 1800, many rebel soldiers deserted, he began {{to negotiate with the}} government, eventually being invited by General Guidal to a meeting in Alençon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frotté</b> fought at Valmy in 1792, and, after Brunswick's {{unsuccessful}} campaign, {{sailed to}} England. There, {{he joined the}} vicomte de Bussy's regiment of émigrés, Les Chevaliers de la couronne, venturing into Brittany several times and linking up with Chouan royalists, who had risen up against the French Republic that had evolved from the Revolution.|$|E
50|$|The Catholic and Royal Army of Normandy, {{sometimes}} simply named Royal Army of Normandy {{because it}} hosted a few protestants in its ranks, was {{an army of}} Chouans commanded by Louis de <b>Frotté.</b> In Normandy, its territory {{was limited to the}} Orne and southern Manche, and in Maine only a few zones in northern Mayenne.|$|E
50|$|In January 1796, Puisaye {{joined the}} Fougères division, the most {{important}} one in Ille-et-Vilaine, and appointed as his chief Aimé Picquet du Boisguy, chief general of the Ille-et-Vilaine and of the East of the Côtes-d'Armor. However, in practice, Boisguy only controlled the East of Ille-et-Vilaine; <b>Frotté</b> and Scépeaux acknowledged Puisaye as general-in-chief in name only.|$|E
5000|$|Guidal {{was born}} on December 31, 1764. [...] He {{may have been the}} General Guidal who, using treachery, lured Chouan rebel Louis de <b>Frotté</b> to Alençon, where the man was seized and executed. A {{supporter}} of the French Republic, Guidal disagreed with Napoleon I and, after conspiring with the British, was incarcerated in La Force prison.|$|E
50|$|In Brittany, the Chouans were {{supported}} by many nobles: Charles Armand Tuffin, marquis de la Rouerie, the Chevalier de Boishardy, Count Louis of Rosmorduc, the Picquet brothers of Boisguy, {{as well as by}} commoners (the brothers Cadoudal). In Lower Normandy, Count Louis de <b>Frotte</b> had a dominant role. One of the lieutenants in lower Maine was Guillaume Le Métayer, who was nicknamed Rochambeau.|$|E
50|$|In 1790, in {{the revolutionary}} period, Flers formed a canton in the {{district}} of Domfront, in the Orne département. The countess of Flers, Jacqueline Le Goué de Richemont, wife of Pierre-François de Paule de La Motte-Ango, supported the counter-revolutionary chouans. The castle of Flers became the headquarters of count Louis de <b>Frotté,</b> {{one of the leaders of}} the Normandic Chouannerie.|$|E
50|$|Konaré {{has written}} {{various types of}} books, from biographies (about Sunni Ali Ber) to {{philosophy}} (L'Os de la parole) and even a novel (Quand l'ail se <b>frotte</b> a l'encens), the plot of which focuses on the social gap in a fictional society similar to Mali's. For this book, her style {{has been compared to}} French authors Emile Zola and Victor Hugo's works.|$|E
5000|$|The 9th {{were also}} awarded the honour of wearing the badge of General Bourgon's French 3rd Division. A {{replica of the}} badge was worn on the sleeve of {{everyone}} serving in the 9th Battalion, and later by everyone in the 9th RTR. The 9th took their unofficial motto from this badge: [...] "Qui s'y <b>frotte,</b> s'y brule" [...] which translates as [...] "Touch me, and you burn".|$|E
50|$|Now {{that the}} Vendée was pacified, Hoche turned his {{attention}} to the Chouans. Faced by large Republican numbers, Chouan chiefs gradually surrendered. Scépeaux was the first to surrender, on 14 May. Georges Cadoudal signed a peace treaty on 19 June, Louis de <b>Frotté</b> refused to sign peace himself; he embarked for England and left his lieutenants to sign on 23 June. Aimé Picquet du Boisguy was the last to surrender, on 26 June. Puisaye returned to England.|$|E
5000|$|The kingdom's {{motto is}} [...] "Eih bennek, eih blavek!" [...] which Hergé {{translates}} as [...] "Qui s'y <b>frotte</b> s'y pique" [...] "Who rubs himself there gets stung" [...] (in fact, {{the motto of}} Nancy, from the Latin non inultus premor, referring to its emblem, the thistle; in the British edition, the translators rendered the motto [...] "If you gather Thistles, expect Prickles"). The motto can also {{be interpreted as a}} Brussels dialect rendering of the Dutch phrase [...] "Hier ben ik, hier blijf ik" [...] ("Here I am, here I stay").|$|E
50|$|Until {{the end of}} 1791, Antoine Philippe was noticed for his restless character. He joined counterrevolutionary circles (Poitou Confederation) in Poitou {{in the end of}} 1791. It was {{a failure}} which {{resulted}} in an emigration to England to secure the interests of his party. He then went to the Rhine and joined émigrés. The count Marie Pierre Louis de <b>Frotté</b> and him took some service for the Chevaliers-dragons de la couronne. He participated in a first campaign in the princes' army for the Count of Artois (later king Charles X of France). He was sent to France with a new plan of insurrection in the Western provinces.|$|E
5000|$|The thistle and {{the cross}} were used again by his grandson, René II, Duke of Lorraine, who {{introduced}} {{them in the}} region. The two symbols became hugely popular among the local people during the Battle of Nancy in 1477, during which the Lorrain army defeated Burgundy. The Duke's motto was [...] "Qui s'y <b>frotte</b> s'y pique", meaning [...] "who touches it, pricks oneself", with a similar idea to the Scottish motto [...] "Nemo me impune lacessit". Nowadays the thistle is still the official symbol {{of the city of}} Nancy, as well as the emblem of the AS Nancy football team, and the Lorraine Regional Natural Park.|$|E
50|$|Said to {{be related}} to British Prime Minister Robert Walpole, she enjoined a short career on the London stage in 1777-1779 before she married Sir Edward Atkyns and moved to France. After the {{outbreak}} of the French revolution, she was recruited as a spy and agent for the counterrevolutionary royalists by Louis de <b>Frotté.</b> Between 1791 and 1794, she was active as a spy in Paris. She became known for her attempts of trying to aid the members of the former royal family to escape from prison. In 1793, she made repeated attempts to try to help former queen Marie Antoinette on one occasion by visiting her in prison dressed as a national guard with the plan of changing clothes with her. She also tried to free the former royal children from the Temple. Her activities had no success despite her spending considerable sums of her fortune on her missions. By historians, Atkyns had often been described as an eccentric who was not taken seriously.|$|E
50|$|Again on 15 August 1940, {{in spite}} of the {{assembly}} ban imposed by the Nazis then occupying the city and the presence of many armed soldiers, nothing could prevent the citizens of Metz from showing their devotion to Our Lady of Metz and demonstrating their patriotic attachment to France. They gathered silently on the jam-packed square. The statue was surrounded by flowers in the three colors of France and a huge Cross of Lorraine embellished with thistles and a ribbon in yellow and red, the colours of Lorraine, was attached to the column on which the motto of Lorraine could be read: Qui s'y <b>frotte</b> s'y pique (who rubs himself on it pricks himself on it), a reference to the cotton thistle, the symbol of Lorraine. Suddenly in the silent crowd a chant began: Reine de France - Priez pour nous - Notre espérance - Venez et sauvez-nous (Queen of France - Pray for us - Our hope - Come and save us), and was taken up immediately by all the faithful present. The chant was started by Sister Helen Studler, a Daughter of Charity, who had the courage to express her desire to see the tricolor flag of France waving again in Metz. The crowd then returned to the cathedral in silence and many spent the whole night in prayer.|$|E
40|$|Both loop fancy yarns and <b>frotte</b> fancy yarns {{belong to}} the group of yarns with {{continuous}} effects. The difference between <b>frotte</b> and loop yarn relies {{on the fact that the}} loop yarn is constructed with two core yarns and the <b>frotte</b> yarn is constructed with only one core yarn. The differences are evident in the shape of these two types of fancy yarns. These shape differences are the functions of the tensions of component yarns during the twisting process. The shape and construction of the fancy yarn influence its properties. The properties of loop and <b>frotte</b> fancy yarns, woven and knitted fabrics are compared in this article in order to find out the optimal yarn’s and fabric’s production condition to satisfy the final user and maintain low production costs. In terms of economy aspects only, the <b>frotte</b> fancy yarns are believed to be cheaper in production due to lower quantity of components utilize for their production to compare with loop fancy yarns, under conditions of the same settings of ring twisting frame...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of Scabies. =m- former letters I {{have called}} {{attention}} to various methods employed in France {{for the treatment of}} scabies in private practice. I have spoken of the very convenient and practicable treatment by petroleum. The rapid method of treatment employed at the Hł=o^. Louis, commonly termed la <b>frotte,</b> which cures the itch in an hour and a half, is well known. This rapid treatment is exceedingly irritable, and can scarcely be utilized in the case ofchildren and in persons whose skin is irritated and presents numerous lesions. In this class of persons Messrs. Vidal and Fournier recommend the employment of a mixture of two parts of styrax with one part of olive-oil; with this preparation two frictions are made=m- in the morning and one at night. I think it preferable to employ a mixture of twenty parts of oil and ten parts of styrax, and one or two parts of balsam of Peru. In the great majority of cases these applications are admirably well borne by the most irritable skins, even by infants at the breast. Under its use the itching ceases, the eruption gradually disappears, even when it presents a markedly inflammatory character. Nevertheless, one must distrust this application somewhat; quite recently I had occasion to order daily fric¬ tions of the above mixture {{in the case of an}} eczematous young man suffering from scabies, and in forty-eight hours there developed an intense artificial eruption, characterized by a most vivid redness, a marked tumefaction of the integument, with an innumerable quantity of small vesico-pustules. It is probable that the substances which entered into the composition of the ointment were adulterated, since it is the only time in ten years ' experience that I have observed an artificial eruption in a patient with scabies treated with styrax.
