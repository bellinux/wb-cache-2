25|$|The aim of an {{accurate}} <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> power calculation {{is to provide}} an <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> (IOL) that fits the specific needs and desires of the individual patient. The development of better instrumentation for measuring the eye's axial length (AL) {{and the use of}} more precise mathematical formulas to perform the appropriate calculations have significantly improved the accuracy with which the surgeon determines the IOL power.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{assess the}} {{biocompatibility}} of hydrophobic acrylic <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> after anterior surface modification with monomer vinyl pyrrolidone by studying cell adhesion using light microscopy. METHODS: Twenty-six eyes of 13 rabbits {{were divided into}} 3 groups randomly. Nine eyes were implanted into vinyl pyrrolidone modification <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses,</b> 8 eyes were implanted into titanium oxide modification <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses,</b> 9 eyes were implanted into unmodified <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> following <b>lens</b> extraction. The <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> implanted eyes were enucleated in 90 d of post operation and cell adhesion on surface of different <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> were compared under light microscopy. RESULTS: The cells' size, number and protein films of <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> on anterior surface of vinyl pyrrolidone modification group were significantly less than that in two control groups. CONCLUSION: The uveal biocompatibility of hydrophobic acrylic <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> after single surface modification by monomer vinyl pyrrolidone is significantly improved...|$|R
50|$|Multifocal and Accommodating <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> are {{artificial}} <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> (IOLs) {{that are}} designed to provide focus of both distance and near objects, in contrast to monofocal <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> which only have one focal point and correct distance vision. The issue of restoring accommodation following cataract surgery or through refractive lens exchange is becoming an increasingly important topic in ophthalmology.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were: You summarize and clarify the existing development and potential implantation of <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> {{with an emphasis}} on the use of multifocal <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> in patients with refractive defects, You collect data on intraocular pressure measured in the preoperative and postoperative examination in patients with implanted multifocal <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> You evaluate and compare the results of postoperativeexaminations with the results acquired in the preoperative examination focus on the size of intraocular pressure, depending on implantation of multifocal <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> You evaluate the importance of preventing an increase inintraocular pressure in the treatment of refractive errors and cataracts using multifocal <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> in patients You compare the results obtained from own studies have published studies in the Czech Republic and abroad...|$|R
25|$|In {{all types}} of surgery, the cataractous lens is removed and {{replaced}} with an artificial lens, known as an <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens,</b> which stays in the eye permanently. Intraocular lenses are usually monofocal, correcting for either distance or near vision. Multifocal lenses may be implanted to improve near and distance vision simultaneously, but these lenses may increase the chance of unsatisfactory vision.|$|E
25|$|LASIK is most {{similar to}} another {{surgical}} corrective procedure, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), and both represent advances over radial keratotomy in the surgical treatment of refractive errors of vision. For patients with moderate to high myopia or thin corneas which cannot {{be treated with}} LASIK and PRK, the phakic <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> is an alternative. As of 2011, over 11 million LASIK procedures had been performed in the United States and as of 2009 over 28 million have been performed worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s, the microkeratome and keratomileusis {{technique}} {{were developed}} in Bogotá, Colombia, by the Spanish ophthalmologist Jose Barraquer. In his clinic, he would cut thin (one hundredth of a mm thick) flaps in the cornea to alter its shape. Barraquer also investigated {{how much of the}} cornea had to be left unaltered in order to provide stable long-term results. This work was followed by that of the Russian scientist, Svyatoslav Fyodorov, who developed radial keratotomy (RK) in the 1970s and [...] designed the first posterior chamber implantable contact lenses (phakic <b>intraocular</b> <b>lens)</b> in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Intraocular</b> <b>lens</b> power {{calculation}} formulas {{fall into}} two major categories: regression formulas and theoretical formulas. Regression formulas are now obsolete and modern theoretic formulas are used instead. [...] The regression formulas are empiric formulas generated by averaging large numbers of postoperative clinical results (i.e. from retrospective computer analysis of data obtained from a great many patients who have undergone surgery). The most common regression formulas are the SRK and SRK II. In the 1980s SRK and SRK II were popular because they were simple to use. However, power error often resulted {{from the use of}} these formulas.|$|E

2500|$|PMMA {{has a good}} {{degree of}} {{compatibility}} with human tissue, and it {{is used in the}} manufacture of rigid intraocular lenses which are implanted in the eye when the original lens has been removed in the treatment of cataracts. This compatibility was discovered by the English ophthalmologist Sir Harold Ridley in WWII RAF pilots, whose eyes had been riddled with PMMA splinters coming from the side windows of their Supermarine Spitfire fighters – the plastic scarcely caused any rejection, compared to glass splinters coming from aircraft such as the Hawker Hurricane. Ridley had a lens manufactured by the Rayner company (Brighton & Hove, East Sussex) made from Perspex polymerised by ICI.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Quantificar e comparar a aderência {{in vitro}} das bactérias Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} e Pseudomonas alcaligenes em diferentes tipos de lentes intra-oculares (LIOs). MÉTODOS: Quatorze lentes intra-oculares foram usadas no experimento. Quatro de polimetilmetacrilato (PMMA), quatro de silicone, quatro de hidrogel e duas de acrílico. Oito lentes intra-oculares foram colocadas em oito tubos de ensaio contendo 4 ml de suspensão de Pseudomonas alcaligenes, e seis lentes intra-oculares foram colocadas em seis tubos de ensaio contendo 4 ml de suspensão de Staphylococcus epidermidis. A concentração do caldo utilizada para o teste de aderência foi de 10 (8) unidades formadoras de colônias por mililitro (CFU/mL) que corresponde a 0, 5 na escala de McFarland. As lentes foram incubadas a 37 ° por duas horas. Após, foram removidas dos caldos e enxaguadas em água destilada estéril por duas vezes. As lentes foram cultivadas em placas de ágar-sangue a 35 - 37 ° e evaliadas a cada 24 h por um período de 72 h. Nas amostras que tiveram crescimento bacteriano, foram contadas as colônias utilizando os métodos convencionais de laboratório. Todos os ensaios foram executados em duplicata. RESULTADOS: A aderência do Staphylococcus epidermidis nas lentes de PMMA foi menor se comparada com as de silicone e de hidrogel. A aderência daPseudomonas alcaligenes nas lentes de hidrogel foi menor se comparada com as de silicone, PMMA e acrílico. CONCLUSÃO: Os resultados sugerem que a aderência do Staphylococcus epidermidis e da Pseudomonas alcaligenes nas lentes intra-oculares é influenciada pelo tipo de material da lente e pela espécie do microorganismo. A aderência bacteriana pode ter papel importante na patogenicidade da endoftalmite pós-cirurgia de catarata. PURPOSE: To quantify {{and compare the}} in vitro adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas alcaligenes to different <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> (IOLs). METHODS: Fourteen <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> {{were used in the}} experiment. Four of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), four of silicone, four of hidrogel and two of acrylic. Eight <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> were placed in eight test tubes containing 4 ml of Pseudomonas alcaligenes suspension, and six <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> were placed in six test tubes containing 4 ml of Staphylococcus epidermidis suspension. The bacterial suspension used for adherence tests was 10 (8) colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) which corresponds to 0. 5 in the scale of McFarland. The lenses were incubated at 37 ° for two hours. After this, <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> were removed from the test tubes and dried twice with the use of distilled and sterile water. The material was spread on blood-agar for cultivation at 35 - 37 °C and was evaluated every 24 hours up to 72 hours. In the samples where there was bacterial growth, the colonies were counted using the conventional laboratory methods. All assays were performed in duplicate. RESULTS: Adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis to PMMA <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> was lower than to hydrogel and silicone <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses.</b> Adherence of Pseudomonas alcaligenes to hydrogel <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> was lower than to PMMA, acrylic and silicone <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that in vitro adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas alcaligenes to <b>intraocular</b> <b>lenses</b> is influenced by type of material of the lens and by microorganism species.
