This strain was synchronized in G(1) or in G(2), irradiated with X-rays to induce DNA damage, and monitored for levels <b>of</b> <b>recombination.</b> <b>Cells</b> irradiated in G(1) were found to repair recombinogenic damage primarily by homolog recombination, whereas those irradiated in G(2) repaired such damage preferentially by sister chromatid recombination. We found, as have others, that G(1) diploids were much {{more sensitive to the}} lethal effects of X-ray damage than were G(2) diploids, especially at higher doses of irradiation. The following possible explanations for this observation were tested: G(2) cells have more potential templates for repair than G(1) cells; G(2) cells are protected by the RAD 9 -mediated delay in G(2) following DNA damage; sister chromatids may share more homology than homologous chromosomes. All these possibilities were ruled out by appropriate tests. We propose that, due to a special relationship they share, sister chromatids are not only preferred over homologous chromatids as substrates for recombinational repair, but have the capacity to repair more DNA damage than do homologs...|$|R

Specifically, it attempts to address the role <b>of</b> homologous <b>recombination</b> in the viral life cycle and to identify host enzymes that take part in viral DNA metabolism. We investigated the effects of ICRF- 193, an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, on the replication of HSV- 1. Then we examined mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>recombination</b> in <b>cells</b> infected with HSV- 1 to establish the mechanism of circularization of HSV- 1 genome. Finally, we investigated the coupling between HSV- 1 DNA replication and homologous recombination as well as requirements for cellular gene products in homologous recombination. Plasmids containing HSV- 1 oriS were constructed as the substrates for viral replication and recombination. Uninfected and HSV- 1 infected cells with different genetic backgrounds were used. Transient replication assays were utilized to detect virus-dependent DNA replication and recombination. Furthermore, two other assays were developed for detecting homologous recombination: recombination-dependent expression <b>of</b> luciferase and <b>recombination</b> between HSV- 1 tsS and tsK strains. To study the enzymatic background <b>of</b> homologous <b>recombination</b> HSV- 1 amplicons were used to express recombination genes in human cells. We found that HSV- 1 replication was specifically inhibited by ICRF- 193 early in infection suggesting that topoisomerase II decatenates early replication intermediates. We have seen that linear DNA provided with directly repeated HSV- 1 a sequences at the ends replicated as efficiently as circular DNA. The results indicate that linear HSV- 1 DNA might be circularized by a sequences-mediated homologous recombination before replication. The reaction was not dependent on XPF/ERCC 4 protein, suggesting that it does not proceed by a single strand-annealing pathway. Homologous recombination occurred also in absence of HSV- 1 dependent DNA replication and viral gene products, which implies that DNA replication and homologous recombination may be coordinated but mechanistically independent events. We also demonstrated that homologous <b>recombination</b> was <b>cell</b> type dependent. Linear DNA with non-homologous ends induced p 53 dependent apoptosis and failed to recombine in Balb/c 3 T 3 cells. It appears that homologous recombination is controlled by p 53. Furthermore, homologous recombination may protect HSV- 1 -infected cells from initiating apoptosis and stimulate viral DNA replication. Finally, homologous <b>recombination</b> <b>of</b> replicating HSV- 1 genomes was profoundly reduced by overexpression of a non-functional RAD 51 in human primary fibroblasts. Our results suggest that RAD 51 dependent homologous recombination is an important, but not necessarily exclusive, mechanism for promoting <b>recombination</b> <b>of</b> replicating HSV- 1 DNA...|$|R

Intermolecular recombination between viruses, tsS and tsK, harboring genetic markers gave rise to ∼ 17 % recombinants in both cell lines.

40|$|Skeletal muscle {{satellite}} cells (SCs) are tissue-specific {{adult stem}} cells responsible for muscle growth and regeneration. The lack of specific markers for progenitors of SCs during their early embryonic development {{made it impossible to}} determine SCs 2 ̆ 7 developmental origin. Here, we have developed the MyoDiCre knock-in mouse line and used the Cre/lox lineage analysis to determine whether satellite cell progenitors express MyoD, a marker of myogenic commitment. An extensive survey of hind limb, intercostal, diaphragm, and extraocular muscle in adult and neonatal mice showed that almost all SCs were labeled and derived from MyoD-positive committed myogenic progenitors. ^ Previously, the absence of a permanent and specific labeling method of activated adult SC in vivo resulted in controversies regarding the mechanisms of renewal of SCs upon muscle injury. To address this issue, we developed the MyoDCreER knock-in mouse line, a ligand-dependent inducible Cre-expressing mouse, to control the timing <b>of</b> <b>recombination</b> <b>of</b> MyoD-positive <b>cells</b> and investigate whether activated MyoD-positive SC progeny can transition back to become quiescent SCs in the regenerated muscle. Using this method, recombined SCs were found to reoccupy the SC niche after regeneration is complete, which revealed a possible mechanism for SC repopulations and maintenance by self-renewal in spite of MyoD expression. Furthermore, with stage-specific induction, we demonstrated that self-renewal occurs within two days after injury, suggesting a rapid down regulation of MyoD expression to prevent terminal myogenic differentiation due to MyoD expression. ^ In conclusion, these findings bring new insight to the role of MyoD. We demonstrated that transient MyoD expression during embryonic development commits SC precursors to the myogenic fate. We also showed that transient MyoD expression in activated SCs does not necessarily result in terminal differentiation, but can be reversed or suppressed, and activated MyoD-positive SCs can self-renewal. ...|$|R

We show that this pathway is toxic when the Smc 5 / 6 complex is defective, because mph 1 Δ and its helicase mutations suppress multiple defects in mutants of the Smc 5 / 6 complex, including their sensitivity to replication-blocking agents, growth defects, and inefficient chromatid separation, whereas MPH 1 overexpression exacerbates some of these defects.

The sequential activation and destruction of CDK–cyclin activities controls progression through the cell cycle. Here we provide evidence that the major Schizosaccharomyces pombe CDK, Cdc 2 –cyclin B, influences recombinational repair of radiation-induced DSBs during the G 2 phase at two distinct stages. At an early stage in HR, a defect in Cdc 2 kinase activity, which {{is caused by a}} single amino acid change in cyclin B, affects the formation of Rhp 51 (Rad 51 sp) foci in response to ionizing radiation in a process that is redundant with the function of Rad 50. At a late stage in HR, low Cdc 2 –cyclin B activity prevents the proper regulation of topoisomerase III (Top 3) function, disrupting a recombination step that occurs after the assembly of Rhp 51 foci. This effect of Cdc 2 –cyclin B kinase on Top 3 function is mediated by the BRCT-domain-containing checkpoint protein Crb 2, thus linking checkpoint proteins directly with recombinational repair in G 2.

40|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair and translesion DNA synthesis are two processes that operate at arrested replication forks {{to reduce the}} frequency <b>of</b> <b>recombination</b> and promote <b>cell</b> survival following UV-induced DNA damage. While nucleotide {{excision repair}} is {{generally considered to be}} error free, translesion synthesis can result in mutations, making it important to identify the order and conditions that determine when each process is recruited to the arrested fork. We show here that at early times following UV irradiation, the recovery of DNA synthesis occurs through nucleotide excision repair of the lesion. In the absence of repair or when the repair capacity of the cell has been exceeded, translesion synthesis by polymerase V (Pol V) allows DNA synthesis to resume and is required to protect the arrested replication fork from degradation. Pol II and Pol IV do not contribute detectably to survival, mutagenesis, or restoration of DNA synthesis, suggesting that, in vivo, these polymerases are not functionally redundant with Pol V at UV-induced lesions. We discuss a model in which cells first use DNA repair to process replication-arresting UV lesions before resorting to mutagenic pathways such as translesion DNA synthesis to bypass these impediments to replication progression. Irradiation of cells with 254 -nm UV light induces lesions that block DNA polymerases. Lesions that block polymerases are thought to either arrest the progress of the replication machinery or produce nascent-strand gaps depending on whic...|$|R
