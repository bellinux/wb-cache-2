Lovins published a 10,000-word essay [...] "Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?" [...] in Foreign Affairs, in October 1976.

The importation of petroleum has crucial economic and security implications for America. As such, it is generally held that the United States must curb substantially its heavy dependence on foreign petroleum sources. This study examines {{short and long term}} strategies to lessen imported oil, as part of the continuing national debate about increasing American energy requirements. A bright vision of a future <b>ethical</b> <b>energy</b> landscape can be realized. This moral imperative requires us to work together in the spirit of cooperation between the public, businesses, governments, and academia toward the common interests of environmental, energy, and economic security. ^ Some believe that science and technology alone can not solve all the world 2 ̆ 7 s problems, and as a result, they argue for a holistic approach to energy and ecological challenges, like climate change, that includes a spiritual and <b>ethical</b> dimension. <b>Energy</b> production and usage raise important questions for ethics and religion. <b>Ethical</b> assessment of <b>energy</b> issues must transcend mere economic motives. This multidisciplinary study also examines diverse religious and ethical perspectives that could assist in increasing public awareness about essential environmental and <b>energy</b> matters. Fundamental <b>ethical</b> ideals like clean air and water ought to play an essential role in determining public <b>energy</b> <b>policy.</b> Ethics offers moral vision to decision makers to formulate public <b>energy</b> <b>policy</b> that enhances the human condition and the natural environment. ^ Market forces (corporate profits) do not always account for critical ecological and human costs. Perspectives in ethics and spirituality, as a response, help balance the cost-benefit energy equation. ^ Sustaining public health and conserving energy coincides with indispensable environmental integrity. Bridging the partisan divide in the U. S. could help further deploy domestic renewable energy technologies. These cornerstone technologies can aid to wean the country from adverse oil imports, thus bolstering the American economy. Moreover, clean energy fosters stewardship of the earth. As a nation, we need to come together to seek sustainable energy solutions to proactively resolve the longstanding critical quest of realizing oil independence. ...|$|R

30|$|While it {{is widely}} {{understood}} that <b>energy</b> <b>policy</b> is a cornerstone of renewable <b>energy</b> deployment, the <b>policy</b> frameworks most suitable to support renewable energy deployment differ based on context. <b>Energy</b> <b>policy</b> in general is concerned with political decisions for implementing programs that achieve energy related societal goals, including universal access to reliable and affordable energy sources that spur economic development. However, the specific formulation of regional, national or local <b>energy</b> <b>policy</b> must be tailored to context. For example, <b>energy</b> <b>policy</b> in the United States is aimed at ensuring the availability of secure, affordable and reliable <b>energy</b> while <b>energy</b> <b>policy</b> in the European Union specifically targets energy security, affordability and environmental sustainability [7]. The observed differences in <b>energy</b> <b>policy</b> objectives between the US, EU and other regions and countries are derived from contextual differences in the interrelated social, economic and political factors that shape policy formation. Hence, {{in the design of}} optimal policies to stimulate renewable energy deployment in the GCC, it is essential to first assess global renewable <b>energy</b> <b>policy</b> trends and then consider how these trends can be optimally tailored to meet underlying regional interests in the adoption of renewable energy.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{emergence}} {{of climate change}} and energy security as increasingly important issues has amplified the need for <b>energy</b> <b>policies</b> that manage these issues. While policy-makers adopt <b>energy</b> <b>policies</b> that address climate change and <b>energy</b> security, these <b>policies</b> often include broad strategy statements and may not include specific implementation plans. Accordingly, effectiveness of these <b>energy</b> <b>policies</b> is also evaluated at the strategic level, which may not appropriately evaluate the policies beyond how the policy met its strategic goal(s). This paper assesses the feasibility of mapping <b>energy</b> <b>policies</b> to their strategic, tactical, and operational (STO) levels through two case studies. The first case study assesses the European Union (EU) 2020 <b>energy</b> and climate <b>policy</b> known as EU 20 - 20 - 20 {{as well as the}} United States’ Executive Orders 13514 and 13423 that mandate energy and greenhouse gas reductions for federal buildings.
