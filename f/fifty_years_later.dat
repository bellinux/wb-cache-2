5|$|In 1842 England, a {{young boy}} builds a snowman, but refuses {{to play with the}} other children. The snowman starts {{speaking}} to the boy, repeating his assertions that the other children are silly. <b>Fifty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later,</b> the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter Simeon, proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute. He hires men to collect samples of snow, which he places in a large snow-filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen. The Doctor, still despondent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams, has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds.

5|$|The {{situation}} that arose after the incapacity of President Wilson, for which Marshall's vice-presidency is most remembered, revived {{the national debate}} {{on the process of}} presidential succession. The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson's incapacity during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue. The constitutional flaws in the process of presidential succession had been known since the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem. Nearly <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later,</b> the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers and duties any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers and duties of the office.|$|E
5|$|A {{husband and}} wife who had lost their son {{as a result of}} the war offered {{themselves}} as the raw material of the final Master, but the woman's unknown pregnancy caused an imbalance that transformed the Masters into monsters. The husband and baby were rescued using the Oraclos Chain, but the wife became Zeron, a dark monster consumed with a want to reunite with her descendant and bring 'peace' to the land. The Vestra sealed the Masters in the Towers and guarded them, while the wife's child eventually became Aeron's ancestor. The wife's jealous want of her descendants caused her to curse people who grew close to them, with Elena being the latest victim of the curse. The Vestra brought each afflicted person to the Towers in the hopes that the Masters would be destroyed and Experiment Zero ended: Mavda was the latest guardian of the Towers. Four hundred and <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later,</b> the Elyrian Army recreated the Masters as living weapons: without the knowledge and help of the Vestra, the Elyrians instigated a drastic geological upheaval that created the Scar, which acted as a portal to the netherworld.|$|E
5|$|St. Regulus Chapel at St. Andrews {{dates from}} around 1150 and was {{probably}} {{built as a}} reliquary church. Only the aisless choir and tall square tower survive. Its detailing derives from work on a church at Wharram-le-Street in England {{and it may have}} been carried out by the same Yorkshire masons. The first monastic establishment built in the Romanesque style was Dunfermline Abbey, begun at the behest of Queen Margaret about 1074. An existing small chapel was expanded with a square choir and rounded apse. About <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later</b> it was replaced by a grander cruciform church of which only the nave now survives. The chevron pattern in the detailing on the piers was modelled on that at Durham Cathedral. Similarly, St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons who had worked at Durham, with which it shares a similar pattern of great round arches based on thick cylindrical pillars. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, St Andrews and Jedburgh, one of the most complete Romanesque buildings to survive.|$|E
50|$|An illustrative aspect in the {{evolution}} of Muir's positions is his stance on the Crusades. In his writings of the 1840s, he goaded Christian scholars to verbal warfare against Muslims using aggressive crusader imagery. <b>Fifty</b> <b>year</b> <b>later,</b> Muir redirected the invective hitherto reserved for the Muslims to the crusading leaders and armies, and while still finding some faults with the former, he praised Saladin for knightly values. (Muir's anti-Catholic animus may {{have played a role in}} this too.) Despite his later writings, Muir's reputation as an unfair critic of Islam remained strong in Muslim circles. Powell finds that William Muir deserves much of the criticism laid by Edward Said and his followers against 19th century Western scholarship on Islam.|$|R

5|$|Pivljanin's tactics {{included}} quick raids {{and destroying}} bridges as he retreated. For example, the stone bridge on the Tara in Šiplje was destroyed after his band had raided Kolašin. In 1664, Pivljanin is {{mentioned as a}} hajduk commander active in the Republic of Ragusa. At the beginning of August 1664, hajduk leaders Stevo and Nikola Popović, Vukosav Puhalović, Pivljanin, Dijete, Čauš, and others, destroyed a merchant caravan {{on the border with}} Ragusa, and took 150 cargoes of very expensive goods; Armenian merchants, to whom the goods belonged, complained to the Doge of Venice. The Venetian government warned the hajduks against further provocations of the Ottomans, fearing new attacks from Sohrab Mehmed Pasha, the sanjak-bey of Herzegovina. In ca. 1665, Pivljanin suffered a great defeat by the Ottomans at the village of Grdijevići, losing most of his band and being forced to leave his home region. One hundred and <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> <b>later,</b> rebels on the Tara used this event, among others, as justification for a revolt. At the beginning of May 1666, Pivljanin raided a Ragusan ship off the coast of Koločep that was bound for Venice with merchandise, unloading eight wagons of wax and freeing captured merchants, among whom were four Turks, in return for a high payment and a written statement that the wax and money had been given to him voluntarily. The Ragusans claimed {{that at the time of}} the raid, Pivljanin had shouted that the provveditore (district governor) of Venetian Dalmatia had given him the order to take all that he came across, both on the sea and the land. Five days later, Pivljanin raided a large and unusually rich caravan carrying Venetian merchandise through Ottoman territory. In September 1666, Pivljanin and Mato Njegošević attacked an Ottoman caravan in Mosko then retreated to Banjani.|$|E

In a stormy scene, Sarfaraz destroys Javed's pigeon coops and sets his pets free after he finds out that Indian forces have lost the Battle for Delhi.

40|$|Increased {{cardiac output}} was first {{described}} {{in patients with}} cirrhosis more than <b>fifty</b> <b>years</b> ago. <b>Later,</b> various observations have indicated {{the presence of a}} latent cardiac dysfunction, which includes a combination of reduced cardiac contractility with systolic and diastolic dysfunction and electrophysiological abnormalities. This syndrome is termed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Results of experimental studies indicate the involvement of several mechanisms in the pathophysiology, such as reduced β-adrenergic receptor signal transduction, altered transmembrane currents and electromechanical coupling, nitric oxide overproduction, and cannabinoid receptor activation. Systolic incompetence in patients can be revealed by pharmacological or physical strain and during stressful procedures, such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion and liver transplantation. Systolic dysfunction has recently been implicated in development of renal failure in advanced disease. Diastolic dysfunction reflects delayed left ventricular filling and is partly attributed to ventricular hypertrophy, subendocardial oedema, and altered collagen structure. The QT interval is prolonged in about half of the cirrhotic patients and it may be normalised by β-blockers. No specific therapy for cirrhotic cardiomyopathy can be recommended, but treatment should be supportive and directed against the cardiac dysfunction. Future research should better describe the prevalence, impact on morbidity and survival, and look for potential treatments...|$|R
