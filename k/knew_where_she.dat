500|$|King {{states the}} cover was odd; [...] "It {{took me a}} minute and a half to find a spot in the song where I <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was. It's so weird. If she had never told us, we would have never known. You could have played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a}} half through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!" [...] In response, Slayer sent some T-shirts to Amos, which she said was appreciated. Hanneman echoed similar sentiments as King, but noted that a few years later when Slayer was playing a festival before Amos, Amos would allow Slayer to play a full set when the band was late.|$|E
500|$|... "Raining Blood" [...] {{was covered}} by Tori Amos on her 2001 album Strange Little Girls. King has {{admitted}} that he thought the cover was odd: [...] "It took me {{a minute and a}} half to find a spot in the song where I <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was. It's so weird. If she had never told us, we would have never known. You could have played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a half}} through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!'". The band, however, liked the cover enough to send Slayer T-shirts to her. The song was also covered by Malevolent Creation, Chimaira, Vader, Dokaka, Reggie and the Full Effect and Killick Erik Hinds, who covered the entire album on a H'arpeggione. [...] "Raining Blood" [...] was also covered by the New Zealand drum and bass band Concord Dawn on their 2003 album Uprising, and by Nashville, Tennessee band Asschapel on their 7" [...] "Satanation". A medley of [...] "Raining Blood" [...] and [...] "Postmortem" [...] appears on Body Count's 2016 album Bloodlust, preceded by a short monologue by lead singer Ice-T where he names Slayer as both a major influence on Body Count and as one of his favorite bands of all time [...] "and always will be"; a video for Body Count's version was released in August of 2017.|$|E
2500|$|One threat a {{journalist}} faced {{was a note}} placed on her car by someone belonging to the Tupamaros. The note was titled, [...] "Operation Defense of the Socialist Revolution, Anti-Imperialist, and Madurista Chavista" [...] said that her actions [...] "promote destabilizing actions of fascist groups and stateless persons who seek to overthrow the legitimate government of President Nicolas Maduro, probably financed and paid by the squalid and bourgeois right have burned the country". They gave the reporter and ultimatum saying they <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> and her family stayed telling her to [...] "immediately stop communication" [...] or she would suffer consequences in order to [...] "enforce the Constitution and keep alive the legacy of our supreme commander and eternal Hugo Chavez".|$|E

2500|$|Ferry favours {{the opinion}} that Voyager misjudged the {{manoeuvring}} room she had. He claims that the destroyer <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was in relation to Melbourne and that the turn to starboard then reversal to port {{was intended to be}} a [...] "fishtail" [...] manoeuvre. Voyager was to swing out wide of the carrier, then turn back towards her, cross the stern and assume her position without having to do a loop. However, insufficient time was allowed for Voyager to get clear of Melbourne before turning back to port, so instead of passing behind Melbourne, the destroyer passed in front. Ferry's theory eliminates the need for a double error in the communications signals, and the need for all on the destroyer's bridge to have such a vastly incorrect assumption of where Voyager was in relation to the carrier.|$|E
