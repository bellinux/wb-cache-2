40|$|International audienceCapsule Clutch {{size and}} female body mass play major roles in duck <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Aims To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} incubation stage, clutch size, body size, body mass and weather on incubation attentiveness. Methods <b>Incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> was monitored with Temperature Data Loggers (TDLs). Nest temperature fluctuations were recorded both {{in the field in}} Common Pochards Aythya ferina and in aviaries in Mallards Anas platyrhynchos using TDLs deposited either in the nest (Pochards) or in a dummy egg placed in the clutch (Mallards). Both methods allowed data collection on incubation attentiveness. Results Incubation attentiveness increased over the incubation period and with clutch size for both species. Body size appeared to affect incubation rhythms in Mallards only. Female Pochards were found to reload their nest with fresh material in response to precipitation events, presumably owing to the rise in water level. Conclusions Clutch size and female body mass play major roles in duck <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Climatic events can also be prominent factors influencing <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour.</b> We describe {{for the first time the}} nesting behaviour of Pochard females and show that they have the capacity to adjust nest topology in response to a rise in water level following rain...|$|E
40|$|An organism's {{reproductive}} success {{may be affected}} by choice of breeding habitats and subsequent investment in offspring. Nest microclimate may profoundly influence energetic costs of incubation or embryonic survival, but few studies have evaluated whether birds select nest-sites based on microclimate. Likewise, increased investment of nutrients in eggs may have costs in terms of future survival and reproduction. These ideas have received only limited testing, particularly behavioural and physiological responses to clutch size variation of precocial birds. Therefore, I evaluated whether: (1) ducks select nest-sites for thermal features; and, (2) <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviours,</b> <b>incubation</b> periods, or energetic costs of incubation are related to clutch size. Blue-winged teal (A. discors; hereafter teal) nested most often in grass or short shrub habitats, while mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) nested in all habitats. Within nesting habitats, microclimate followed a gradient from hot and sunny in grass-dominated sites to cool and shaded sites in aspen (Populus spp.) groves. I measured microclimatic conditions at mallard and teal nests and randomly located nonnest sites, to evaluate thermal consequences of nest-site selection. Duck nests received on average less solar insolation than nonnest sites, producing more moderate thermal conditions than at nonnest sites. When mallard and teal nests were concurrently monitored, teal selected warmer nest-sites than mallards. Thus, teal may choose warmer nests to offset costs of incubation, a hypothesis {{which has not been}} tested. Apart from egg formation costs, processes occurring during incubation may also limit clutch size of precocial birds. I tested if incubation periods were positively correlated with clutch size and found that incubation periods of captive mallards and wild teal, but not wild mallards, were longer for females incubating clutches enlarged by 50 %. Incubating females may respond to increased energetic costs of incubation by: (1) losing more mass, (2) decreasing nest attendance, or (3) some combination of both. Mass loss and mass at hatch were unrelated to clutch enlargement, however, mass loss was positively correlated with mass at the start of incubation. While controlling for effects of weather, I found no change in <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviours</b> of mallards incubating enlarged clutches, but, teal increased overall recess frequency. Finally, I evaluated effects of clutch enlargement on incubation strategies, representing an integration of behaviour and body mass dynamics. When controlling for weather and body mass dynamics, clutch enlargement produced significant, yet subtle changes in <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Mallards took slightly shorter recesses, but maintained constancy, whereas teal increased recess frequency and decreased nest attendance. Energetic costs of incubation are controversial. I tested if incubation metabolic rates (IMR) were greater than resting metabolic rate (RMR). Incubation caused an increase in metabolic rate by mallard and red junglefowl (Gallus gallus spadiceus). I tested the assumption that IMR is positively correlated with clutch size and found that IMR of junglefowl within thermoneutrality was unrelated to clutch mass. Further work is needed to evaluate metabolic responses of precocial birds to clutch size variation. Overall, clutch size of precocial birds (particularly small species) may be limited by costs in terms of extended laying and incubation periods, as well as by subtle changes in <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Further integration of incubation costs with those associated with egg formation and brood-rearing, would provide a comprehensive and powerful analysis of factors limiting clutch size in precocial birds...|$|R
5000|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} 7 and 15 white-tan eggs that incubate {{for an average}} of 30 days. However, if nesting boxes are placed too close together, females may lay eggs in the nests of their neighbours, which may lead to nests which may contain as many as 30 eggs and unsuccessful <b>incubation,</b> a <b>behaviour</b> known as [...] "nest dumping".|$|R
40|$|The {{energetic}} {{costs associated}} with nest construction are becoming increasingly apparent, yet we still know remarkably little about how those costs affect parental care during the subsequent egg laying, incubation, nestling provisioning and fledgling stages of reproduction. Here we describe a study where we provided experimental pairs of Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) with supplementary food throughout the nest-building period and then quantified nest characteristics, <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviours</b> and nestling provisioning rates at experimentally fed and unfed control nests. We have already reported that experimental females built heavier nests than unfed females and here we extend that study by showing that whilst hatching asynchrony and brood sizes at hatching did not differ between treatments, males at experimental nests provisioned their offspring at significantly higher rates than did males at control nests. As female provisioning rates {{did not differ significantly}} between treatments, total parental provisioning rates were higher at experimental nests, although brood sizes and the mass of nestlings at pre-fledging did not differ between treatments. This implies that when the energetic costs of nest construction were indirectly reduced via the provision of supplementary food, females responded by constructing larger nests. Females did not alter their <b>incubation</b> or provisioning <b>behaviours</b> but males did increase their provisioning rates. Unfortunately, our experimental design means that we are unable to disentangle the relative contributions of the provision of supplementary food {{and the size of the}} female-built nest in causing male provisioning rates to be higher at experimental nests. In summary, our study suggests that the energetic costs of nest construction are carried over into future stages of reproduction in a sex-specific and complex manner...|$|R
40|$|Birds can {{influence}} the embryonic development through <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> because avian embryos develop using parent’s body heat. Although previous studies assumed that <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> influences hatching patterns, few studies have studied the effect of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> during egg-laying and early incubation on hatching patterns due to difficulties to determine onset of incubation during egg-laying. I investigated whether <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> during egg-laying and early incubation affects hatching patterns in gulls using measurements of mean nest attendance and daily change of nest attendance. Hatching patterns were influenced by <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> during egg-laying and early <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour.</b> As parents spent more time in their nests, a brood hatched more synchronously and hatching success of the first-laid eggs increased when gulls laid relatively smaller first-laid eggs than other pairs. Within-clutch variation in eggshell colour related to daily change of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour.</b> This might relate to hormonal change during egg-laying. Increase of prolactin initiates incubation and accompanies decline of steroid hormones which relate to accumulation of eggshell pigments. Hatching patterns may also be influenced by accelerated development of last-laid eggs. When eggs were swapped to increase interval between eggs, last-laid eggs of herring gulls accelerated their development to catch up. Accelerated development may increase the survival of chicks from last-laid eggs by reducing the disadvantage of small size within a clutch. However, the costs of accelerated development seem to appear during the embryonic period. Hatching success was low in eggs with accelerated development, although {{there were no differences}} in growth rate and early nestling survival between accelerated and control last-laid eggs. Eggshell characteristics might be a factor affecting hatching patterns because they are related to embryonic metabolism. Hatching duration was not related to eggshell thickness and total functional area, but chicks which hatched from eggs with higher proportion of mammilllary cone contact area took longer to hatch. Chicks hatched from thicker eggshells showed longer “head plus bill” at hatching and grew faster in skeleton size after hatching. Diet during egg-laying and early incubation affected nest attendance. Females which consumed more marine food during egg formation had lower nest attendance during egg-laying and early incubation. This may relate to longer foraging time required to obtain marine food. In conclusion, this thesis suggests that parents {{can influence}} hatching patterns by altering <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> during egg-laying and early incubation and hatching patterns also may be affected by accelerated development of last-laid eggs, diet during egg-laying and early incubation and eggshell characteristics (proportion of mammillary cone contact area) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground A {{major step}} towards {{the success of}} {{chickens}} as a domesticated species was the separation between maternal care and reproduction. Artificial incubation replaced the natural maternal behaviour of incubation and, thus, in certain breeds, it became possible to breed chickens with persistent egg production and no incubation behaviour; a typical example is the White Leghorn strain. Conversely, some strains, such as the Silkie breed, are prized for their maternal behaviour and their willingness to incubate eggs. This is often colloquially known as broodiness. ResultsUsing an F 2 linkage mapping approach and a cross between White Leghorn and Silkie chicken breeds, we have mapped, for the first time, genetic loci that affect maternal behaviour on chromosomes 1, 5, 8, 13, 18 and 19 and linkage group E 22 C 19 W 28. Paradoxically, heterozygous and White Leghorn homozygous genotypes were {{associated with an increased}} incidence of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour,</b> which exceeded that of the Silkie homozygotes for most loci. In such cases, {{it is likely that the}} loci involved are associated with increased egg production. Increased egg production increases the probability of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> occurring because egg laying must precede incubation. For the loci on chromosomes 8 and 1, alleles from the Silkie breed promote <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> and influence maternal behaviour (these explain 12 and 26  % of the phenotypic difference between the two founder breeds, respectively). ConclusionsThe over-dominant locus on chromosome 5 coincides with the strongest selective sweep reported in chickens and together with the loci on chromosomes 1 and 8, they include genes of the thyrotrophic axis. This suggests that thyroid hormones may play a critical role in the loss of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> and the improved egg laying behaviour of the White Leghorn breed. Our findings support the view that loss of maternal <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the White Leghorn breed is the result of selection for fertility and egg laying persistency and against maternal <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|E
40|$|Short {{breeding}} {{period and}} harsh climatic conditions are major limiting factors to which birds {{have to adapt}} in northern tundra regions. Despite this fact, dozen species of birds annually migrate into these regions to increase their chances to breed successfully. My diploma thesis focuses on <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea). The research for my thesis {{took place on the}} Norwegian archipelago Svalbard, in two particular locations: Adolfbukta and Longyearbyen. By using the method of continuous video recording, I described <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> of this specie in detail. Human activity is very different on each of Adolfbukta and Longyearbyen. On site Adolfbukta study was conducted during seasons 2012 and 2014, both with different predation pressure. Having known that, I could evaluate the impact of human activity as well as the impact of different predation pressure on <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> and breeding ecology of Arctic tern. The presence of human close to the colony had significant effect on <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Due to higher disturbances, incubating birds tended to leave their nests more often, attention paid to the nest was smaller and calm incubation (sleeping on the nest) was shorter by a half. Human activity had no effect on other displays such as average clutch size or [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Nest {{predation}} is {{the main}} cause of nest failures in many bird species. To counter this, birds have evolved different behavioural strategies to decrease the visibility of their nests, thus reducing the probability of nest detection. We manipulated the long-term perception of nest predation risk in pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) by experimentally increasing the nest vulnerability to predators. We placed treatment and control nest-boxes for breeding pied flycatchers that appeared identical during the initial phase of breeding. But after the removal of a front panel, treatment boxes had an enlarged entrance hole, almost twice the initial diameter. This treatment increases actual predation risk and presumably parental perception of risk. Control boxes presented instead an entrance hole of the same size {{both before and after the}} manipulation. When breeding in enlarged entrance holes, females doubled the vigilance at the nest while males reduced the time spent at the nest, compared to pied flycatchers breeding in control boxes. Increased vulnerability of the nest site to predation risk, thus, induced pied flycatcher parents to increase nest vigilance while reducing their activity at the nest. These results highlight the existence of plasticity in <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviours</b> under long-term experimentally increased nest predation risk.

We {{have observed that}} the products from veratryl alcohol degradation by Lentinus edodes are quite different from those isolated from incubations with other white-rot fungi which have veraraldehyde as the major product, in fact, this compound is not produced as final metabolite in L. edodes <b>incubations.</b> This <b>behaviour</b> could explain the apparent absence of lignin peroxidase and veratryl alcohol oxidase activities in L. edodes cultures, since such activities are usually measured by monitoring veratraldehyde formation during the veratryl alcohol oxidation; thus, {{it is suggested that}} additional assay methods should be developed, with preferably direct observation of aromatic ring oxidation products...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effects and {{mechanisms}} of pre-hatch stress in hens {{it is important}} to have reliable methodology that can be used to illuminate effects of embryonic hormonal exposure without seriously compromising the viability of embryos. This experiment aimed to develop methods that can be used for injecting corticosterone into eggs prior to incubation without greatly reducing hatchability. The injection method involved application of a small amount of silicone sealant to the apical end of eggs, insertion of a needle through this seal to a depth of 5 mm into the albumen and injection of a sesame oil vehicle with or without corticosterone. It is shown that corticosterone can be injected with a resulting mortality of 38 %. The applicability of these methods are discussed and will be further used to test for effects of corticosterone injections prior to <b>incubation</b> on <b>behaviour</b> and morphology in laying hens...|$|R
40|$|Both nest {{survival}} and <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> are highly variable among shorebirds (Charadrii), and we tested whether more conspicuous <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> increased {{the risk of}} nest predation. During 2000 - 2006, we monitored nest fate at 901 shorebird nests at three study sites across the circumpolar Arctic. Using miniature video recorders and nest temperature sensors, we obtained 782 days of behavioural data for 161 nests of 11 species. We related nest fate to the rate and duration of adults' nest absences or restless movements on the nest, {{as well as the}} total proportion of each day that adult birds engaged in these activities. Nest predation was positively related to the proportion of time that each species left the nest unattended. After controlling for species effects, the likelihood of a successful nesting attempt was lower for individuals that spent more time off the nest, but among failed nests, the number of days that a nest survived prior to depredation was not significantly predicted by measures of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour.</b> To control for weather or seasonal effects, we paired observations from nests that were ultimately depredated with observations from successful nests of the same species on the same day. In this paired sample (dominated by two species: red phalaropes, Phalaropus fulicarius, and little stints, Calidris minuta), both incubation recesses and restless movements were more numerous among failed versus successful nests. Our results suggest that more conspicuous <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> is indeed related to a higher risk of nest predation, and that this relationship may underlie patterns of nest survival within and among shorebird species.

40|$|The thyroid {{stimulating}} {{hormone receptor}} (TSHR) has been suggested to be a "domestication locus" in the chicken, due to a strong selective sweep over the gene found in domesticated chickens, differentiating them from their wild ancestor the Red Junglefowl (RJF).

The d/d genotype showed a longer incubation time, less fearful behaviours, lower number of aggressive behaviours and decreased levels of the thyroid hormone T 4, in comparison to the w/w genotype.

40|$|Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is {{the second}} most popular poultry species in Europe with about 15 % of this market. This {{position}} is, in part, the consequence of moderate production costs originating from rapid growth rates and effective feed efficiency. Unfortunately, selection on growth traits may impair reproductive performances including fertility and laying rates. In fact, one of the major problems is the decrease in egg production which is mainly due to broodiness, an <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> that is still present in modern turkey breeder strains (up to 20 % to 30 % of breeder hens). Broodiness is generally expressed during the first weeks of the reproductive season. It is generally characterized by a marked reduction up to a total arrest of feed consumption during the days preceding broodiness. One of the objectives of our study was to collect field information from a relatively high population (47, 000) of turkey breeder hens in order to possibly anticipate or, at least limit broodiness and therefore facilitate flock management. Birds used were from two commercial strains, one defined as ‘‘heavy’’ (Big 6, Aviagen-BUT, Cheshire, UK, n ¼ 3; 360 females) while the other is considered as a ‘‘medium’’ type (BUT 9, Aviagen-BUT, 4, 200 females). Each strain was housed within two barns divided into 42 laying pens. Each broody female was individually identified and referenced by a coloured wing tag. The incidence and pattern of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> along with the delay to return in lay were recorded throughout the period of reproduction. The results of this study indicate the possibility to develop a model of broodiness. A higher percentage of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> was observed in the Big 6 hens compared to the BUT 9 (16 % versus 12 %). In both strains, the average duration of stay in broody pens increased with hen’s age. Hens expressing <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> after 18 – 20 weeks of lay tended not to return to egg production. Among females having experienced broodiness, those having experienced it twice stayed longer in broody pens than those having experienced it once. Among hens getting broody once, 17 – 19 % (BUT 9) or 23 % (Big 6) went back to broodiness a second time and among the latter ones, 15 – 22 % (BUT 9) or 20 – 26 % (Big 6) went back to broodiness a third time...|$|E
40|$|In birds, {{different}} types of predators may target adults or offspring differentially and {{at different times of}} the reproductive cycle. Hence they may also differentially influence <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> and thus embryonic development and offspring phenotype. This is poorly understood, and we therefore performed a study to assess the effects of the presence of either a nest predator or a predator targeting adults and offspring after fledging on female <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> in great tits (Parus major), and the subsequent effects on offspring morphological traits. We manipulated perceived predation risk during incubation using taxidermic models of two predators: the short-tailed weasel posing a risk to incubating females and nestlings, and the sparrowhawk posing a risk to adults and offspring after fledging. To disentangle treatment effects induced during incubation from potential carry-over effects of parental behaviour after hatching, we cross-fostered whole broods from manipulated nests with broods from unmanipulated nests. Both predator treatments lead to a reduced on- and off-bout frequency, to a slower decline in on-bout temperature as incubation advanced and showed a negative effect on nestling body mass gain. At the current state of knowledge on predator-induced variation in incubation patterns alternative hypotheses are feasible, and {{the findings of this study}} will be useful for guiding future research...|$|E
40|$|Broodiness in the {{domestic}} hen is characterized by incubation of eggs and subsequent care of the young. <b>Incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> is initiated by increased plasma progesterone and oestrogen from maturing ovarian follicles that induce nesting behaviour. This is subsequently transformed into <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> by increased plasma prolactin in association with decreased gonadotrophin and ovarian steroid secretion. Gonadotrophin secretion is under the stimulatory and inhibitory control, respectively, of gonadotrophin releasing hormone-I (GnRFI-I) and gonadotrophin inhibitory hormone (GnIH). Prolactin secretion {{is controlled by the}} stimulatory action of the hypothalamic neuropeptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The aim {{of this study was to}} increase understanding and knowledge of the interactions between these hormones and neuropeptide in the neuroendocrine control of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> in {{the domestic}} hen. Observations were made using fluorescence immunocytochemistry with additional data on progesterone receptor mRNAs, using PCR to localize the receptor. Hypothalamic progesterone receptor immunoreactivity (PR-ir) was seen in several hypothalamic nuclei and areas including the organum vasculoswn terminalis (OVLT) and basal hypothalamic tuberal region (TU). The density of cells containing PR-ir in the OVLT and TU, but not at other hypothalamic loci, was lower in incubating than in laying hens. In the anterior pituitary gland, PR-ir was localised in luteinizing hormone (LH) but not prolactin cells, and the density of cells containing LH and PR-ir was lower in incubating than in laying hens. The density of prolactin cells was higher in incubating than in laying hens. Progesterone receptor B mRNA was found in It the TU and pituitary gland in both laying and incubating hens. Prolactin receptor, but not progesterone receptor, was co-localised in VIP neurones in the TU. The number of visible VIP-ir cell bodies containing prolactin receptor was greater in incubating than in laying hens. Nerve fibres containing VIP did not contact GnRH-I-ir cell bodies, but potential contact between those VIP and GnRJ-I-I fibres was seen in the median eminence. GnIH was localized in cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in incubating and laying hens did not contain PR-ir and had terminals in the median eminence. The density of GnIH neurones did not differ between laying and incubating hens, but their size of the cell bodies was significantly larger in incubating hens. Although GnRFI-Iir and GnIH-ir fibres were abundant in the PVN, they were not observed to come into close contact. It is concluded that <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> and associated changes in either prolactin or gonadotrophin secretion could be mediated through progesterone receptor B in the OVLT and TU. Progesterone is likely to exert feed-back control of LH secretion at the level of the pituitary gland in laying, but not in incubating hens through progesterone receptor B. Prolactin may act directly on basal hypothalamic VIP neurones to regulate it own secretion. Increased GnIH release in incubating hens may contribute to depressed gonadotrophin secretion...|$|E

Enhanced mobility, solubility, and/or potential availability of Mn and Zn from fluid fertilisers were observed in comparison to Mn or Zn from granular fertilisers in both soils after 5 weeks of <b>incubation.</b> Differential <b>behaviour</b> of fluid and granular fertilisers for Mn and Zn appeared to be independent of their effects on soil pH.

40|$|Increased embryo {{mortality}} {{is the most}} commonly cited cause of reduced fitness in inbred organisms. Reduced embryo survival {{may be the result}} of reduced parental expenditure by inbred individuals and here we tested the hypothesis that inbreeding results in impaired <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> in captive zebra finches. We compared incubation attentiveness of inbred female zebra finches (derived from full-sibling mating) with that of control females (derived from unrelated parents) and found a statistically significant inbreeding depression of 17 % in incubation attentiveness. This shows that inbreeding can significantly influence parental behaviour. Despite a reduction in the amount of time inbred females spent incubating, their partners were able to compensate for the reduced incubation attentiveness. Incubation temperature also did not differ between inbred and control females. To test for the effect of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour,</b> we fostered eggs laid by control females to either inbred or control females at the end of laying. Eggs that were incubated by inbred females had an 8. 5 % lower hatching success than eggs incubated by control females and, although based on a relatively small sample and not statistically significant, the magnitude of the difference was consistent with differences in hatching success observed in the wild under relatively benign environmental conditions. Thus, under more challenging environmental conditions usually encountered in the wild, the reduced incubation attentiveness of inbred females could provide one proximate explanation for the consistent finding of decreased hatching success with increasing maternal inbreeding in birds...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies are}} documenting {{the extent to}} which the mass and {{construction}} of bird nests varies between individuals and locations. In the Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) and Great Tit (Parus major), temperatures experienced by females during nest construction are inversely related to nest mass. Moreover, Mainwaring et al. (Journal of Biogeography, 2012) showed that nests constructed at high latitude are heavier and better insulated than nests built by conspecifics in the south. Although mean spring temperature was used as a proxy for latitude in the Mainwaring et al. study, it remains untested whether individual birds build nests in response to a narrower range of temperatures experienced at the start of the breeding season. Our study showed that irrespective of latitude nest mass, and in particular nest cup mass, of Blue Tits and Great Tits was significantly affected by the temperature experienced by the birds for the seven days preceding clutch initiation. Similar results were seen with the insulatory properties of nests. The potential impact of variation in nest construction and insulation on subsequent <b>incubation</b> and chick-rearing <b>behaviour</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIndividuals {{differ in}} their ability to cope with energetically {{demanding}} situations while caring for the current brood, and they can signal this ability by their colouration. We examined the impact of handicapping (clipping of wing and tail feathers) on an energetically demanding care <b>behaviour</b> (<b>incubation)</b> in female Great Tits (). We hypothesised that the intensity of carotenoid-based breast feather colouration signals the ability to cope with impaired flight ability and the consequent increased energetic demands. If this is the case, females with more intensely coloured feathers should cope better with the handicap compared with less intensely coloured females, i. e. the impact of handicapping on mass loss and nest attentiveness should be negatively correlated with colouration. Handicapped females lost more weight than control females but did not decrease nest attentiveness to a greater extent, suggesting that females take the costs of handicapping on themselves. Females in poor condition were more severely influenced by handicapping. Intensity of female breast feather colouration did not correlate with either change in nest attentiveness or body mass loss during incubation. Intensity of breast feather colouration therefore does not appear to signal female ability to cope with this energetically demanding situation during incubation...|$|R
40|$|Birds with uniparental {{incubation}} {{may face}} a time allocation problem between incubation and feeding. Eggs need regular warming to hatch successfully, but the parent must leave the nest {{to feed and}} safeguard its own survival. Time allocation during incubation is likely to depend on factors influencing egg cooling rates, parental energy requirements and feeding intake rate. How this allocation problem is resolved was subject of this study on arctic-breeding shorebirds. We compared incubation rhythms between four uniparental shorebird species differing in size and expected to find both species differences and weather effects on the organisation of <b>incubation.</b> Attentive <b>behaviour</b> and responses to variation in weather showed a remarkable consistency across species. All species alternated feeding bouts (recesses) with brooding bouts throughout the day. Recesses were concentrated in the warmer parts of the day, while recess duration showed little diurnal variation. Despite continuous daylight, a pronounced day-night rhythmicity was apparent. The four species in this study spent a similar proportion (13 - 19 %) of the time off their nest. After correction for weather effects, the number of recesses was largest in the smallest species, while recess duration was longest in the largest species. Total recess time per day increased on cold days through an increase of mean recess length, {{while the number of}} recesses decreased. Comparing our observations to predictions derived from criteria that birds might use to organise their attentive behaviour, showed that the limits are set by parental requirements, while the energy stores of adults provide some leeway for short-term adjustments to environmental variability. If breeding birds trade off feeding time against incubation time, energy stores are expected to be influenced by weather. We expected uniparental species to be more likely to show weather effects on condition than biparentals, as in the latter 'off duty' time is much larger and independent of weather. This prediction was tested by comparing energy stores in two uniparental species and a biparental congener. While body mass of uniparental incubators decreased after a period with low temperatures, body mass of the biparental species did not...|$|R

Males incubated at night, the period of highest activity of cats, which {{are likely to be}} predators of breeding birds. In spite of behavioural differences between the sexes, adult survival was not significantly different between males and females, suggesting that sex-biased behaviour need not lead to sex-related survival, and thus behavioural differences may not impact upon the adult sex ratio...|$|E
40|$|For organisms {{living in}} {{seasonal}} environments, synchronising the peak energetic demands of reproduction with peak food availability {{is a key}} challenge. Understanding {{the extent to which}} animals can adjust behaviour to optimise reproductive timing, and the cues they use to do this, is essential for predicting how they will respond to future climate change. In birds, the timing of peak energetic demand is largely determined by the timing of clutch initiation, however, considerable alterations can still occur once egg laying has begun. Here, we use a wild population of great tits (Parus major) to quantify individual variation in different aspects of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> (onset, duration and daily intensity), and conduct a comprehensive assessment of the causes and consequences of this variation. Using a 54 -year dataset, we demonstrate that timing of hatching relative to peak prey abundance (synchrony) is a better predictor of reproductive success than clutch initiation or clutch completion timing, suggesting adjustments to reproductive timing via incubation are adaptive in this species. Using detailed in-nest temperature recordings, we found that post-laying, birds improved their synchrony with the food peak primarily by varying the onset of incubation, with duration changes playing a lesser role. We then used a sliding time window approach to explore which spring temperature cues best predict variance in each aspect of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Variation in the onset of incubation correlated with mean temperatures just prior to laying, however incubation duration could not be explained by any of our temperature variables. Daily incubation intensity varied in response to daily maximum temperatures throughout incubation, suggesting female great tits respond to temperature cues even in late stages of incubation. Our results suggest that multiple aspects of the breeding cycle influence the final timing of peak energetic demand. Such adjustments could compensate, in part, for poor initial timing, which has significant fitness impacts...|$|E
40|$|The {{ring dove}} (Streptopelia risoria) expresses a stereotyped {{breeding}} cycle {{and has been}} used extensively as a laboratory animal model for studies of avian parental behaviour. Studies were undertaken to identify brain regions of the ring dove involved in the exprcssion of these behaviours, and to determine the central nervous function of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin and the neuropeptide VIP in <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Quantitative 2 -deoxyglucose (2 DG) autoradiography {{at the onset of}} incubation revealed an increase in uptake in the nucleus preopticus medialis (POM), nucleus tuberis (NT) and nucleus ovoidalis (Ov). Quantitative 2 DG autoradiography at late incubation and following treatment with exogenous prolactin revealed a generalised increase in 2 D 0 uptake in all areas of the brain studied. This effect may be explained by the proliferation of glial cells in response to an increase in the metabolic requirements of neurones involved in the co-ordination and execution of behaviours associated with the breeding cycle. A quantitative analysis of prolactin binding sites at late incubation demonstrated an increase in binding in the NT and a decrease in binding in the nucleus preopticus anterior (POA). Increases in prolactin binding in the NT may control prolactin secretion by the anterior pituitary and may be influenced by the down-regulation of binding sites in the POA. Intracerebroventricular treatment with VIP antiserum following nest deprivation failed to inhibit the resumption of incubatory behaviour after nest replacement, but was found to decrease food consumption. A study of the neuronal bonnections of the POA and NT revealed connections between these two nuclei and visual and auditory relay areas of the brain. These studies demonstrate that the POA and NT are involved in the onset and continuation of <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the ring dove, and that VIP is not the centrally acting factor responsible for the expression of this behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Nesting {{behaviour}} {{is critical}} for reproductive success in oviparous organisms with no parental care. In organisms where sex is determined by <b>incubation</b> temperature, nesting <b>behaviour</b> may be a prime target of selection in response to unbalanced sex ratios. To produce an evolutionary change in response to sex-ratio selection, components of nesting behaviour must be heritable. We estimated the field heritability of two key components of nesting behaviour in a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with temperature-dependent sex determination by applying the ‘animal model’ to a pedigree reconstructed from genotype data. We obtained estimates of low to non-detectable heritability using repeated records across all environments. We then determined environment-specific heritability by grouping records with similar temperatures for the winter preceding the nesting season, a variable known to be highly associated with our two traits of interest, nest vegetation cover and Julian date of nesting. The heritability estimates of nest vegetation cover and Julian date of nesting were qualitatively highest and significant, or nearly so, after hot winters. Additive genetic variance for these traits was not detectable after cold winters. Our analysis suggests that the potential for evolutionary change of nesting behaviour may be dependent on the thermal conditions of the preceding winter, a season that is predicted to be especially subject to climate change...|$|R
40|$|Many shorebird {{populations are}} rapidly declining {{and a high}} nest {{predation}} rate {{is one of the}} threats facing these populations. Thus, factors that affect predation and how to manage it in an effective way are receiving increased attention. This thesis deals with nest predation in two ground-nesting shorebirds (waders) : the Northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus, and the redshank Tringa totanus nesting in coastal pastures. I study how habitat structures affect nest predation and distribution. I also test the effectiveness of two non-lethal methods for managing predation, and survey public attitudes towards predator control and animal conservation. Predators that hunt by sight often search for prey from elevated perches, such as trees, stone walls and fences. Theory suggests that prey visibility depends strongly on predator perch height and distance. I estimated how prey (a mounted bird) visibility depends on predator perch height, distance and vegetation height in coastal pastures. Visibility increases strongly with observer perch height and proximity. For example, from the lowest perch (0. 2 m), visibility of the target bird declines to < 5 % beyond 20 m distance, but 40 % of it remains visible from the highest perch (8 m), even as far as 120 m. The strong increase of prey visibility with predator search height suggests that the removal of predator perches can improve the survival of endangered prey populations in open habitats. Predators such as the hooded crow Corvus cornix use raised structures for perching and to elude lapwing attacks. I find that crows spent more time at or near raised structures than expected and that wader nests were placed farther away from these structures than expected in two out of three years. Waders thus tend to avoid breeding close to raised structures, which therefore reduces the suitable breeding area and probably also the local wader population size. Habitat management is just one technique for reducing nest predation, and apart from lethal predator control, there are several non-lethal methods. I tested the effect of nest exclosures to protect individual wader nests from predation. Protected nests had a higher hatching success than unprotected nests. Protected redshanks suffered increased predation on incubating adults, which often sit on the nest until a predator is close by. These results emphasize the need for caution in the use of nest exclosures, particularly in redshanks and other species with similar <b>incubation</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Exclosures can, however, be a useful management tool in shorebirds that leave their nests early, when an approaching predator is still far away. I also tested predator avoidance of wader eggs by placing mimic eggs injected with an illness-producing substance in artificial nests. Compared to control areas, the daily survival rate was higher for wader nests during the first three weeks in areas with aversive eggs, but there was no difference for the nesting season as a whole. Egg predation by foxes and other nocturnal mammals may have masked a greater aversion effect in avian predators. I suggest that the dose of the illness-producing substance should be increased and the aversion-learning period prolonged in future tests of this potentially useful technique. Predation management sometimes includes lethal predator control, which can be controversial, and knowledge of public attitudes is essential for successful conservation measures. Using a mail survey sent to a representative sample of the Swedish public (1 751 replies) I found that there is support for protecting threatened animals. Although the support for a general control of animals was low, a majority supported several specific reasons for control, including control of animals that pose a risk to threatened species or to traffic. The support for control varied depending on species, being the lowest for raptors and the highest for mice and rats. A majority did not support the use of more costly non-lethal control in place of lethal methods, but urban residents and animal rights supporters were more positive than the others. 	I conclude that available perches can have significant effects on prey detection and distribution of wader nests. It is possible to reduce nest predation in some shorebird species using non-lethal techniques such as nest exclosures. When using lethal predator control, I suggest that information about the reasons for control as well as the species involved is highly important, especially as in regard lethal control in urban regions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnderstanding {{variations}} in individual trajectories {{is a crucial}} evolutionary issue. Terrestrial ectotherms from temperate regions typically face thermal constraints and limited activity periods. Developmental conditions (i. e. embryonic life) and reproductive timing (laying date) should induce phenotypic variations and influence subsequent ontogenetic trajectories (growth and survival). We studied these combined influences in an oviparous squamate, the wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), comprising a multiple clutch species with natural {{variations in}} laying date for the first clutch. We experimentally manipulated maternal basking opportunities during gravidity (3, 6 or 9 h per day) and incubation temperature (23 or 29 °C). Early laying date positively influenced winter survival in both incubation treatments. Survival was significantly lower in cool than warm-incubated individuals (14. 8 % and 73. 6 %, respectively) because of delayed hatching date and reduced activity period before winter. Individuals from cool incubation temperature were slightly smaller but had a higher body condition and grew faster during {{the first month of}} life. Offspring behaviour was driven by complex interactions between gravidity and incubation treatments. Under cool <b>incubation</b> temperature, defensive <b>behaviour</b> was high, independently of gravidity treatment. Warm incubated individuals showed low defensive response except when maternal basking opportunities were restricted to 3 h. Defensive behaviour at birth had a positive influence on survival in cool-incubated individuals.
