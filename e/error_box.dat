5000|$|BeppoSAX {{detected}} {{its first}} gamma-ray burst on July 20, 1996 [...] from an X-ray burst in a Wide Field Camera (WFC), {{but it was}} only discovered in the data six weeks later, by a duty scientist systematically checking BATSE-triggers coinciding with WFC-bursts from the same direction. Follow-up radio observations with the Very Large Array by Dale Frail did not find an afterglow at the derived position from the deconvolved data, but a routine procedure for finding gamma-ray bursts with BeppoSAX could be established. This led to the detection of a gamma-ray burst on January 11, 1997, and one of its Wide Field Cameras also detected X-rays at the same moment coinciding with a BATSE-trigger. John Heise, project scientist for BeppoSAX's WFCs, quickly deconvolved the data from the WFCs and, in less than 24 hours, produced a sky position with an accuracy of about 10 arcminutes. Although this level of accuracy had already been surpassed by the interplanetary networks, they were unable to produce the data as quickly as Heise could. In the following days, Dale Frail, working with the Very Large Array, detected a single fading radio source within the <b>error</b> <b>box,</b> a BL Lac object. An article was written for Nature stating that this event proved that GRBs originated from active galaxies. However, Jean in 't Zand, a former gamma-ray spectroscopist at the Goddard Space Flight Center, rewrote the WFC deconvolution software to produce a position with an accuracy of 3 arcminutes, and the BL Lac object was no longer within the reduced <b>error</b> <b>box.</b> Despite BeppoSAX having observed both X-rays and a GRB and the position being known within that same day, the source of the burst was not identified.|$|E

Between May 10 and May, Charles Steidel recorded the spectrum of the variable object from the W. M. Keck Observatory. Mark Metzger analyzed the spectrum and determined a redshift of z=0.835, placing the burst at a distance of roughly 6 billion light years.

40|$|The {{nature of}} most of the ~ 300 high-energy gamma-ray sources {{discovered}} by the EGRET instrument aboard the Gamma-ray Observatory (GRO) between 1991 and 1999 {{is one of the greatest}} enigmas in high-energy astrophysics. While about half of the extragalactic sources have been optically identified with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), only a meagre 10 % of the galactic sources have a reliable identification. This low success rate has mainly to be ascribed to the local crowding of potential optical counterparts and to the large gamma-ray <b>error</b> <b>boxes</b> (of the order of one degree in radius) which prevented a straightforward optical identification. Indeed, a multi-wavelength identification strategy, based on a systematic coverage of the gamma-ray <b>error</b> <b>boxes,</b> has been the only do-able approach. The situation is now greatly improving thanks to the observations performed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope which, thanks to the LAT instrument, provides a factor of 50 improvement in sensitivity and a factor of 10 improvement in positional accuracy. However, while the smaller <b>error</b> <b>boxes</b> will make the multi-wavelength follow-ups easier, the larger sensitivity will enormously increase the number of detected gamma-ray sources, requiring an even larger effort in the multi-wavelength follow-ups.

None of the six <b>error</b> <b>boxes</b> reveals the {{presence}} of a plausible nearby host galaxy. This allows us to set lower limits on the distances and, hence, the isotropic-equivalent energy of these GRBs. Our lower limits are around 1 × 10 49 erg (at 2 σ confidence level); as a consequence, some of the short-hard GRBs we examine would have been detected by BATSE out to distances greater than 1 Gpc and therefore constitute a bona fide cosmological population. Our search is partially motivated by the December 27, 2004 hypergiant flare from SGR 1806 − 20, and the intriguing possibility that short-hard GRBs are extragalactic events of a similar nature. Such events would be detectable with BATSE to a distance of 50 Mpc, and their detection rate should be comparable to the actual BATSE detection rate of short-hard GRBs. The failure of our search, by contrast, suggests that such flares constitute less than 15 % of the short-hard GRBs (< 40 % at 95 %-confidence). We discuss possible resolutions of this discrepancy.
