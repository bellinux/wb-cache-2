The Stones considered their own performance lacklustre, and the project was never broadcast. The Who had not released an album in over a year, and had not completed the recording of Tommy, which continued well into 1969, interspersed with gigs at weekends. Lambert was a key figure in keeping the group focused and getting the album completed, and typed up a script to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> the story and how the songs fitted together.|$|E

King has become a national icon in the history of American liberalism and American progressivism. King also influenced Irish politician and activist John Hume.

500|$|While {{attending}} the Friedrichstadt Teacher College, Maeser {{was exposed to}} Pestalozzian educational theory, which greatly influenced his educational philosophy. Pestalozzian educational theory recognizes the potential of each individual. Pestalozzi encouraged teachers to treat their students with kindness and respect, and to show love to their students, instead of evoking fear. Pestalozzi was also in favor of universal education and opposed separately educating different social classes. Maeser adopted many of his ideas. He supported the education of women. Maeser believed that students {{should be allowed to}} express themselves freely and choose their own careers. His lectures tried to engage students and <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> concepts through their own experiences. He also included many object lessons to coach students to observe their surroundings and make connections. Maeser admired Prestalozzian teachers Adolph Diesterweg and Friedrich Fr√∂bel Maeser also agreed that [...] "education should be balanced head, heart and hand." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{designing}} the costumes for the Pashtun people and Taliban forces, Stofsky aimed {{to create a}} visual distinction between the villagers and Taliban fighters. [...] "Luttrell survived because of the age-old tradition of the Pashtun culture in providing hospitality and safety to those that enter their home", she explained. [...] "We dyed the Taliban's costumes black, charcoal, wine, and indigo and kept the villagers light. Their humanity prevails. This is what we hoped to get across." [...] Stofsky utilized a North Hollywood-based Afghan vendor, Moe Noorzai, for traditional Afghan clothing including vests, pants, dresses and Kashmir scarves. Stofsky also had a New Mexico-based tailor produce all of the turbans featured in the film. Zarin Mohammad Rahimi, an Afghan refugee who fled to the United States to avoid the Taliban, and his sons, Muhammad Nawroz Rahimi and Nawaz Rahimi, were hired to act as technical advisors during production. The Rahimis collaborated with Stofsky, {{as well as the}} wardrobe and casting departments, to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> the language, customs and fighting methods of the Pashtun villagers and Taliban fighters. The eldest Rahimi also played the role of an elderly shepherd in a crucial scene.|$|E

Its {{goal is to}} effect enough change in the alcoholic's {{thinking}} [...] "to bring about recovery from alcoholism" [...] through [...] "an entire psychic change," [...] or spiritual awakening. A spiritual awakening {{is meant to be}} achieved by taking the Twelve Steps, and sobriety is furthered by volunteering for AA and regular AA meeting attendance or contact with AA members. Members are encouraged to find an experienced fellow alcoholic, called a sponsor, to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>understand</b> and follow the AA program. The sponsor should preferably have experience of all twelve of the steps, be the same sex as the sponsored person, and refrain from imposing personal views on the sponsored person.
