40|$|The {{complete}} synthetic Mycoplasma genitalium genome (âˆ¼ 583 kb) {{has been}} assembled and cloned as a circular plasmid in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Attempts to engineer the cloned genome by standard genetic methods involving the URA 3 / 5 -fluoroorotic acid (5 -FOA) counter-selection {{have shown a}} high background of 5 -FOA resistant clones derived from spontaneous deletions of the bacterial genome maintained in yeast. Here, we report a method that can seamlessly modify the bacterial genome in yeast with high efficiency. This method requires two sequential homologous recombination events. First, the target region is replaced with a mutagenesis cassette that consists of a <b>knock-out</b> <b>CORE</b> (an 18 -bp I-SceI recognition site, the SCEI gene {{under the control of}} the GAL 1 promoter, and the URA 3 marker) and a DNA fragment homologous to the sequence upstream of the target site. The replacement generates tandem repeat sequences flanking the CORE. Second, galactose induces the expression of I-SceI, which generates a double-strand break (DSB) at the recognition site. This DSB promotes intra-molecular homologous recombination between the repeat sequences, and leads to an excision of the CORE. As a result, a seamless modification is generated. This method can be adapted for a variety of genomic modifications and may provide an important tool to modify and design natural or synthetic genomes propagated in yeast...|$|E
