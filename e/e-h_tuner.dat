40|$|A one-port load-pull {{measurement}} {{has been}} carried out in order to investigate the effect of loading on the RF power performance of a planar Gunn diode operating in the transit-time mode at 102 GHz. A W-band manual <b>E-H</b> <b>tuner</b> was applied between a waveguide mixer and a wafer probe to vary the load impedance on the Gunn diode. It has been found that more than 25 dB variation of output power was obtained by systematically adjusting the tuner. By de-embedding the S-parameters of the probe, <b>E-H</b> <b>tuner</b> and mixer, the relationship between RF power and load impedance for the planar Gunn diode was derived. This method is extremely useful for assisting the design of matching networks to improve power output of one-port oscillator devices...|$|E
40|$|This study {{integrates}} intelligent {{remote monitoring}} and control technology into microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) system with the reflected microwave power as the main feedback signal. An automatic fuzzy control scheme is used to adjust electromagnetic field distribution, plasma density, and reflected microwave power of the MPCVD system. The intelligent control includes establishment of database, fuzzification of principal component, membership function, fuzzy inference rules, and defuzzification. An (X, Y) position of (19. 3 cm, 10 cm) for <b>E-H</b> <b>tuner</b> adjustment is found to have the lowest average reflected power. The averaged films thickness is 15. 44 µm, the averaged tube diameter is 42 nm, and the ID/IG ratio is 1. 12 for as-grown carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film. With the as-obtained CNT films as the field emission, which area is 0. 33 cm 2, the turn-on voltage is 1. 3 V/µm and the threshold voltage is 4. 7 V/µm...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} {{and experimental}} results for a magic tee with movable choke plungers in - and -arms for the tuning the coupling-factor and RF phase of high-power accelerating cavities are presented. The investigations {{were carried out}} at 2. 797 GHz and 1. 3 GHz. The so-called <b>E-H</b> <b>tuner</b> shall provide the possibility of independent adjustment of external Q-factor and RF phase for the TESLA cavity structures. The QEXT of the cavity structures must be tuneable {{in the range from}} 0. 9 * 106 to 9 * 106 to match the RF system under different beam conditions. For matching the waveguide power distribution system to cavities with different quench thresholds, adjustable directional couplers are necessary. A hybrid coupler with a coupling factor of 3. 0 dB and an adjustable range of ± 1 dB at more than 25 dB directivity was calculated. The adjustment elements of this coupler are variable choke plungers in two additional H-arms opposite the coupling-slot. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{external}} {{magnetic field}} was generated with an electromagnet. Pairs of <b>E-H</b> <b>tuners</b> were connected {{before and after the}} waveguide containing the NIM composite. The tunability was demonstrated from 18 to 23 GHz. Theoretical analysis, which followed, closely matched the experimental results.|$|R
40|$|The RF loss {{properties}} and thermal capability of brazed helix circuits and interference fitted circuits were evaluated. The {{objective was to}} produce design circuits with minimum RF loss and maximum heat transfer. These circuits were to be designed to operate at 10 kV and at 20 GHz using a gamma a approximately equal to 1. 0. This represents a circuit diameter of only 0. 75 millimeters. The fabrication of this size circuit and the 0. 48 millimeter high support rods required considerable refinements in the assembly techniques and fixtures used on lower frequency circuits. The transition from the helices to the waveguide was designed and the circuits were matched from 20 to 40 GHz since the helix design is a broad band circuit and at a gamma a of 1. 0 will operate over this band. The loss measurement was a transmission measurement and therefore had two such transitions. This resulting double-ended match required tuning elements to achieve the broad band match and external <b>E-H</b> <b>tuners</b> at each end to optimize the match for each frequency where the loss measurement was made. The test method used was a substitution method where the test fixture {{was replaced by a}} calibrated attenuator...|$|R
