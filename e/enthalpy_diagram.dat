40|$|International audienceAromatic {{substitution}} {{reactions of}} selected ionized benzenes derivatives (chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, dimethylphtalates) and phenoxy cation using neutral methyl isocyanide as a nucleophile are shown to efficiently {{occur in the}} gas phase. Nitrilium ions are produced in high abundance during these processes. These reactions have been performed in the hexapole collision cell of a large-scale hybrid tandem mass spectrometer. Computed 298 K <b>enthalpy</b> <b>diagrams</b> at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G(d,p) level of theory confirm the exothermic formation of the N-methylbenzonitrilium ions starting with ionized chloro- and nitrobenzene molecular ions. In this last case, two other exothermic processes are also detected: (i) an oxygen atom transfer yielding ionized nitrosobenzene and neutral methyl isocyanate and (ii) a loss of carbon monoxide from the ion/molecule reaction product generated when metastably generated phenoxy cations (produced in the hexapole collision cell) react with methyl isocyanide. Using extended theoretical calculations, several reaction pathways have been derived. The behavior of the three isomeric dimethyl phthalates has been investigated in the same way...|$|R

The oxide system has a wide miscibility gap on the Gd-rich side but forms ordered compounds on the Eu-rich side, exhibiting a deep asymmetric convex hull in the formation <b>enthalpy</b> <b>diagram.</b> The sulfide system has no stable compounds. The large difference in the formation enthalpies of the oxide and sulfide compounds is attributed to the contribution of local lattice relaxation, which is sensitive to the anion size. The solubility of Gd in both EuO and EuS is {{in the range of}} 10 %– 20 % at room temperature and quickly increases at higher temperatures, indicating that highly doped disordered solid solutions can be produced without the precipitation of secondary phases.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{continue}} our study of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability in relativistic planar jets following the long-term evolution of the numerical simulations which were introduced in Paper I. The models have been {{classified into four classes}} (I to IV) with regard to their evolution in the nonlinear phase, characterized by the process of jet/ambient mixing and momentum transfer. Models undergoing qualitatively different non-linear evolution are clearly grouped in well-separated regions in a jet Lorentz factor/jet-to-ambient <b>enthalpy</b> <b>diagram.</b> Jets with a low Lorentz factor and small enthalpy ratio are disrupted by a strong shock after saturation. Those with a large Lorentz factor and enthalpy ratio are unstable although the process of mixing and momentum exchange proceeds to a longer time scale due to a steady conversion of kinetic to internal energy in the jet. In these cases, the high value of the initial Lorentz seems to prevent transversal velocity from growing far enough to generate the strong shock that breaks the slower jets. Finally, jets with either high Lorentz factors and small enthalpy ratios or low Lorentz factors and large enthalpy ratios appear as the most stable. Comment: Paper II, 16 pages.

40|$|The Carnot factor versus <b>enthalpy</b> {{variation}} (heat) <b>diagram</b> {{has been}} used extensively for the second law analysis of heat transfer processes. With enthalpy variation (heat) as the abscissa and the Carnot factor as the ordinate the area between the curves representing the heat exchanging media on this diagram illustrates the exergy losses due to the transfer. It is also possible to draw the paths of working fluids in steady-state, steady-flow thermodynamic cycles on this diagram using the definition of “the equivalent temperature” as the ratio between the variations of enthalpy and entropy in an analyzed process. Despite the usefulness of this approach two important shortcomings should be emphasized. First, the approach is not applicable for the processes of expansion and compression particularly for the isenthalpic processes taking place in expansion valves. Second, {{from the point of}} view of rigorous thermodynamics, the proposed ratio gives the temperature dimension for the isobaric processes only. The present paper proposes to overcome these shortcomings by replacing the actual processes of expansion and compression by combinations of two thermodynamic paths: isentropic and isobaric. As a result the actual (not ideal) refrigeration and power cycles can be presented on equivalent temperature versus <b>enthalpy</b> variation <b>diagrams.</b> All the exergy losses, taking place in different equipments like pumps, turbines, compressors, expansion valves, condensers and evaporators are then clearly visualized. Moreover the exergies consumed and produced in each component of these cycles are also presented. The latter give the opportunity to also analyze the exergy efficiencies of the components. The proposed diagram is finally applied for the second law analysis of an ejector based refrigeration system...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{targeting}} and optimal utility placement {{are among}} the key steps in the cost-effective design of a process utility system. Composite Curves (CCs) and Grand Composite Curves (GCCs) are the popular Pinch Analysis tools for multiple utility targeting and placement. Although the CCs and GCCs can provide useful insights and yield acceptable utility targets, {{they could not be}} used to design a heat recovery network and to perform heat allocation involving the process and utility system. The Stream Temperature versus Enthalpy Plot (STEP) that was introduced in 2010 has the ability to overcome these limitations. Apart from giving the pinch points and energy targets, STEP can also graphically represent the maximum heat allocation (MHA) that can be converted into a maximum energy recovery (MER) network on a temperature versus <b>enthalpy</b> <b>diagram.</b> STEP has also been used for targeting closed-loop utilities having fixed supply and return temperatures that include steam, hot oil, refrigerants and cooling water circuits. However, the available STEP technique is unable to handle cases involving the "once-through" utility such as flue gas where the target temperature and flowrate needs to be simultaneously optimised in order to minimise fuel consumption. This paper presents a new approach to further extend STEP's capability for the simultaneous energy targeting, optimal placement of process utility systems that include flue gas streams with variable-temperatures and flowrates, and design of heat recovery networks featuring such targeted utilities...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{temperature}} gradients in cold stores and containers {{is a critical}} issue in the food industry for the quality assurance of products during transport, as well as forminimizing losses. The objective of this work {{is to develop a}} new methodology of data analysis based on phase space graphs of temperature and enthalpy, collected by means of multidistributed, low cost and autonomous wireless sensors and loggers. A transoceanic refrigerated transport of lemons in a reefer container ship from Montevideo (Uruguay) to Cartagena (Spain) was monitored with a network of 39 semi-passive TurboTag RFID loggers and 13 i-button loggers. Transport included intermodal transit from transoceanic to short shipping vessels and a truck trip. Data analysis is carried out using qualitative phase diagrams computed on the basis of Takens?Ruelle reconstruction of attractors. Fruit stress is quantified in terms of the phase diagram area which characterizes the cyclic behaviour of temperature. Areas within the <b>enthalpy</b> phase <b>diagram</b> computed for the short sea shipping transport were 5 times higher than those computed for the long sea shipping, with coefficients of variation above 100 % for both periods. This new methodology for data analysis highlights the significant heterogeneity of thermohygrometric conditions at different locations in the container...|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} of different effects observed in nature {{by only one}} general equation is the "Holy Grail" for all physicists. This goal has been achieved for characteristic temperatures through a top-down approach (studying size effects from macroscopic laws) and is presented in this chapter. Here, we show the general equation based on the surface {{area to volume ratio}} of nanostructures and statistics (Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein) followed by the particles involved in the investigated phenomena. From the distinction between fermions and bosons, so-called particles which follow a Fermi-Dirac or a Bose-Einstein statistics respectively, this equation indicates the universal behaviour of size and shape effects on different material properties like melting, ferromagnetism, vibration and superconduction. The same shape parameter used in this universal equation can be used to determine the melting <b>enthalpy,</b> the phase <b>diagrams</b> of alloys, the energy bandgap and also the creep behavior of nanomaterials. Theoretical predictions show satisfactory agreement with experimental data taken from literature. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R

50|$|There is a {{physical}} quantity closely linked to free energy (free enthalpy), with a unit of entropy and isomorphic to negentropy known in statistics and information theory. In 1873, Willard Gibbs created a diagram illustrating the concept of free energy corresponding to free <b>enthalpy.</b> On the <b>diagram</b> {{one can see the}} quantity called capacity for entropy. This quantity is the amount of entropy that may be increased without changing an internal energy or increasing its volume. In other words, it is a difference between maximum possible, under assumed conditions, entropy and its actual entropy. It corresponds exactly to the definition of negentropy adopted in statistics and information theory. A similar physical quantity was introduced in 1869 by Massieu for the isothermal process (both quantities differs just with a figure sign) and then Planck for the isothermal-isobaric process. More recently, the Massieu-Planck thermodynamic potential, known also as free entropy, has been shown to play a great role in the so-called entropic formulation of statistical mechanics, applied among the others in molecular biology and thermodynamic non-equilibrium processes.|$|R

Total miscibility was observed in liquid and liquid crystalline phases but essentially total immiscibilty among crystalline phases. The phase behavior exhibits: (1) Formation of two intermediate compounds which dissociate in the solid state at low temperature; (2) A eutectic reaction at salt molar fraction χ = 0. 08 about 3 K below the acid melting point; (3) Unimolecular salt:acid association by very strong hydrogen bonding, which undergoes a crystal/crystal transition prier to incongruent melting at 295. 5 K, occurring by a highly energetic peritectic reaction in which the compound evolves more then {{the sum of the}} total transition enthalpies of both components; (4) Lyotropic mesophase formation at 390. 0 K over the χ ≤ 0. 66 composition range by aggregation of a solid and a liquid phase to yield, on heating, a continuous series of liquid crystalline solutions with mixed-lamellar structure and interlamellar spacings around 20 Å as determined by powder X-ray diffractometry, their texture being focal conic, consistent with the neat thermotropic mesophase of the pure salt.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{takes place}} in the {{framework}} of a CRAFT European project gathering three universities, three companies who produce rings through the ring rolling process and a manufacturer of temperature and dimension measurement devices. The final goal of the project is to develop and set up a system, integrated in the industrial process, capable of predicting the geometrical characteristics of final pieces just after the ring rolling stage and to allow the rolling process to avoid dimensional defects through online adaption. In fact, ring rolling production does not imply only the rolling process, but also the cooling and quench stages of steel rings. During all these phases, the dimensions of the pieces change dramatically. In particular, {{due to the lack of}} symmetry in the cooling conditions, ring distortions include contraction and rotation of the ring section. The modeling of the cooling phase requires taking into account a large number if phenomena resulting from the coupling of thermal, mechanical and metallurgical effects. A numerical model has been implemented in the non-linear finite element code LAGAMINE, developed by the University of Liège. Such a model can help to better understand the evolution of the geometry during the cooling phase and also the effects of each physical and microstructural parameter implemented in the model on the ring final shape. Effectively, several parameters can affect the ring distortions and the model should take them into account; in particular, the mechanical and thermal behavior of each phase present in the material (metastable austenite, ferrite, pearlite, bainite and martensite). Phase transformation modeling implies the integration of a wide data base of material properties (thermo-physical and mechanical properties of the phases, TTT and CCT <b>diagrams,</b> <b>enthalpy</b> and strain of phase transformation, strain of transformation plasticity [...] .) but only a few of these data are available in literature. Some of them have been found for the reference material (42 CrMo 4 steel), but additional laboratory experiments have been performed at the Universities of Padua and Liège in order to characterize thermal, mechanical and plastic behaviour of phases. Finally, this paper presents the model validation on an industrial case (measurements of temperature and dimensions of rings have been provided by the manufacturer). Then, some applications are presented, demonstrating the importance of some factors such as some material properties, the shape of the rings, the type of cooling (and the cooling rate) or the symmetry of the cooling scheme on final ring distortion...|$|R
