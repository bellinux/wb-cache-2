40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} novel and {{practical}} techniques to accurately detect IP prefix hijacking attacks {{in real time}} to facilitate timely mitigation responses. There are strong evidences that <b>IP</b> <b>hijacking</b> is common on today’s Internet. Attackers may hijack victim’s IP address space to perpetrate malicious activities such as spamming and launching DoS attacks without worrying about disclosing their identity through source IP addresses. More seriously, they can disrupt network services or regular communication by temporarily stealing actively used addresses. Unintentional network misconfigurations can also have similar effects, possibly leading to severe impact on reachability. We propose novel ways to much more accurately detect <b>IP</b> <b>hijacking</b> by combining analysis of passively collected BGP routing updates and data plane fingerprints of suspicious prefixes. The key insight is to use data plane information {{in the form of}} edge network fingerprinting to disambiguate potentially numerous suspect <b>IP</b> <b>hijacking</b> incidences based on routing anomaly detection. Previous work on identifying <b>IP</b> <b>hijacking</b> solely relies on control plane information in the form of anomalous routing updates or external data such as stale address registries. Such an approach is inaccurate, suffering from too many false positives to be useful in practice. In our proposed scheme, real-time fingerprinting provides confirming evidence for hijacking, while incurring little overhead. More importantly, we provide mechanisms to perform online mitigation rather than post-mortem analysis. Utilizing real-time BGP data from multiple feeds as well as RouteViews, we demonstrate the ability of our system to distinguish between legitimate routing changes and hijacking attacks. I...|$|E

40|$|<b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking</b> {{remains a}} major threat to the {{security}} of the Internet routing system {{due to a lack of}} authoritative prefix ownership information. Despite many efforts in designing <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijack</b> detection schemes, no existing design can satisfy all the critical requirements of a truly effective system: real-time, accurate, light-weight, easily and incrementally deployable, as well as robust in victim notification. In this paper, we present a novel approach that fulfills all these goals by monitoring network reachability from key external transit networks to one’s own network through lightweight prefix-owner-based active probing. Using the prefix-owner’s view of reachability, our detection system, ISPY, can differentiate between <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking</b> and network failures based on the observation that hijacking is likely to result in topologically more diverse polluted networks and unreachability. Through detailed simulations of Internet routing, 25 -day deployment in 88 ASes (108 prefixes), and experiments with hijacking events of our own prefix from multiple locations, we demonstrate that ISPY is accurate with false negative ratio below 0. 45 % and false positive ratio below 0. 17 %. Furthermore, ISPY is truly real-time; it can detect hijacking events within a few minutes...|$|R
40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), {{the main}} {{component}} of core Internet connectivity, suffers vulnerability {{issues related to}} the impersonation of the ownership of IP prefixes for Autonomous Systems (ASes). In this context, {{a number of studies have}} focused on securing the BGP through several techniques, such as monitoring-based, historical-based and statistical-based behavioural models. In spite of the significant research undertaken, the proposed solutions cannot detect the <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijack</b> accurately or even differentiate it from other types of attacks that could threaten the performance of the BGP. This research proposes three novel detection methods aimed at tracking the behaviour of BGP edge routers and detecting <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacks</b> based on statistical analysis of variance, the attack signature approach and a classification-based technique. The first detection method uses statistical analysis of variance to identify hijacking behaviour through the normal operation of routing information being exchanged among routers and their behaviour during the occurrence of <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking.</b> However, this method failed to find any indication of <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking</b> because of the difficulty of having raw BGP data hijacking-free. The research also proposes another detection method that parses BGP advertisements (announcements) and checks whether IP prefixes are announced or advertised by more than one AS. If so, events are selected for further validation using Regional Internet Registry (RIR) databases to determine whether the ASes announcing the prefixes are owned by the same organisation or different organisations. Advertisements for the same IP prefix made by ASes owned by different organisations are subsequently identified as hijacking events. The proposed algorithm of the detection method was validated using the 2008 YouTube Pakistan hijack event; the analysis demonstrates that the algorithm qualitatively increases the accuracy of detecting <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacks.</b> The algorithm is very accurate as long as the RIRs (Regional Internet Registries) are updated concurrently with hijacking detection. The detection method and can be integrated and work with BGP routers separately. Another detection method is proposed to detect <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking</b> using a combination of signature-based (parsing-based) and classification-based techniques. The parsing technique is used as a pre-processing phase before the classification-based method. Some features are extracted based on the connectivity behaviour of the suspicious ASes given by the parsing technique. In other words, this detection method tracks the behaviour of the suspicious ASes and follows up with an analysis of their interaction with directly and indirectly connected neighbours based on a set of features extracted from the ASPATH information about the suspicious ASes. Before sending the extracted feature values to the best five classifiers that can work with the specifications of an implemented classification dataset, the detection method computes the similarity between benign and malicious behaviours to determine to what extent the classifiers can distinguish suspicious behaviour from benign behaviour and then detect the hijacking. Evaluation tests of the proposed algorithm demonstrated that the detection method was able to detect the hijacks with 96 % accuracy and can be integrated and work with BGP routers separately.

40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was {{designed}} without security in mind. Until today, this fact makes the Internet vulnerable to hijacking attacks that intercept or blackhole Internet traffic. So far, significant {{effort has been}} put into the detection of <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking,</b> while AS hijacking has received little attention. AS hijacking is more sophisticated than <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking,</b> and is aimed at a long-term benefit such as over a duration of months. In this paper, we study a malicious case of AS hijacking, carried out in order to send spam from the victim’s network. We thoroughly investigate this AS hijacking incident using live data from both the control and the data plane. Our analysis yields insights into how an attacker proceeded in order to covertly hijack a whole autonomous system, how he misled an upstream provider, and how he used an unallocated address space.

Every 30 seconds, StrobeLight probes Microsoft’s entire corporate network, archiving the ping results for use by other networked services. We describe two such services, one offline and the other online. The first service uses longitudinal data collected by our StrobeLight deployment to analyze large-scale trends in our wired and wireless networks. The second service draws live StrobeLight measurements to detect network anomalies like <b>IP</b> <b>hijacking</b> in real time.

40|$|The Internet {{has become}} an {{indispensable}} resource for today's society. It {{is at the center}} of the today's business, entertainment, and social world. However, the core of our identities on the Internet, the IP addresses that are used to send and receive data throughout the Internet, are insecure. Attackers today are able to send data purporting to be from nearly any location (IP spoofing) and to reroute data destined for victims to the attackers themselves (<b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking).</b> Victims of these attacks may experience denial of service, misplaced blame, and theft of their traffic. These attacks are of the utmost importance since they affect the core layer of the Internet. Although the mechanisms of the attacks are different, they are essentially different sides of the same coin; spoofing attacks forge the identity of the sender, while hijacking attacks forge the identity of the receiver. They revolve around the same underlying lack of a secure identity on the Internet. This research reviews the existing state of the art IP spoofing and <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking</b> research and proposes new defenses to close the missing gaps and provide a new level of security to our identities on the Internet.

Our work is the first to critically examine the visibility constraints imposed by the deployment of route monitors on various applications.

40|$|As {{more and}} more Internet <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking</b> {{incidents}} are being reported, the value of hijacking detection services has become evident. Most of the current hijacking detection approaches monitor IP prefixes on the control plane and detect inconsistencies in route advertisements and route qualities. We propose a different approach that utilizes information collected mostly from the data plane. Our method is motivated by two key observations: when a prefix is not hijacked, 1) the hop count of the path from a source to this prefix is generally stable; and 2) the path from a source to this prefix is almost always a super-path of the path from the same source to a reference point along the previous path, {{as long as the}} reference point is topologically close to the prefix. By carefully selecting multiple vantage points and monitoring from these vantage points for any departure from these two observations, our method is able to detect prefix hijacking with high accuracy in a light-weight, distributed, and real-time fashion. Through simulations constructed based on real Internet measurement traces, we demonstrate that our scheme is accurate with both false positive and false negative ratios below 0 : 5 %...|$|R

40|$|Part 4 : SecurityInternational audienceThe {{vulnerability}} of the Internet has been demonstrated by prominent <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking</b> events. Major outages such as the China Telecom incident in 2010 stimulate speculations about malicious intentions behind such anomalies. Surprisingly, almost all discussions in the current literature assume that hijacking incidents are enabled {{by the lack of}} security mechanisms in the inter-domain routing protocol BGP. In this paper, we discuss an attacker model that accounts for the hijacking of network ownership information stored in Regional Internet Registry (RIR) databases. We show that such threats emerge from abandoned Internet resources (e. g., IP address blocks, AS numbers). When DNS names expire, attackers gain the opportunity to take resource ownership by re-registering domain names that are referenced by corresponding RIR database objects. We argue that this kind of attack is more attractive than conventional hijacking, since the attacker can act in full anonymity on behalf of a victim. Despite corresponding incidents have been observed in the past, current detection techniques are not qualified to deal with these attacks. We show that they are feasible with very little effort, and analyze the risk potential of abandoned Internet resources for the European service region: our findings reveal that currently 73 / 24 IP prefixes and 7 ASes are vulnerable to be stealthily abused. We discuss countermeasures and outline research directions towards preventive solutions...|$|R
40|$|Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the {{backbone}} of routing infrastructure in the Internet. In its current form, it is an insecure protocol with potential for propagation of bogus routing information. There have been several high-profiles Internet outages linked to BGP in recent times. Several BGP security proposals have been presented in the literature; however, none has been adopted so far and, as a result, securing BGP remains an unsolved problem to this day. Among existing BGP security proposals, Secure BGP (S-BGP) is considered most comprehensive. However, it presents significant challenges in terms of number of signature verifications and deployment considerations. For it to provide comprehensive security guarantees, it requires that all Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet to adopt the scheme and participate in signature additions and verifications in BGP messages. Among others, these challenges have prevented S-BGP from being deployed today. In this thesis, we present two novel lightweight security protocols, called Credible BGP (C-BGP) and Hybrid Cryptosystem BGP (HC-BGP), which rely on security mechanisms in S-BGP but are designed to address signature verification overhead and deployment challenges associated with S-BGP. We develop original and detailed analytical and simulation models to study performance of our proposals and demonstrate that the proposed schemes promise significant savings in terms of computational overhead and security performance in presence of malicious ASes in the network. We also study the impact of <b>IP</b> prefix <b>hijacking</b> on control plane as well as data plane. Specifically, we analyze the impact of bogus routing information on Inter-Domain Packet Filters and propose novel and simple extensions to existing BGP route selection algorithm to combat bogus routing information...|$|R
40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is {{globally}} used by Autonomous Systems (ASes) {{to establish}} route paths for IP prefixes in the Internet. Due {{to the lack}} of authentication in BGP, an AS can <b>hijack</b> <b>IP</b> prefixes owned by other ASes (i. e., announce illegitimate route paths), impacting thus the Internet routing system and economy. To this end, a number of hijacking detection systems have been proposed. However, existing systems are usually third party services that -inherently- introduce a significant delay between the hijacking detection (by the service) and its mitigation (by the network administrators). To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose ARTEMIS, a tool that enables an AS to timely detect hijacks on its own prefixes, and automatically proceed to mitigation actions. To evaluate the performance of ARTEMIS, we conduct real hijacking experiments. To our best knowledge, {{it is the first time}} that a hijacking detection/mitigation system is evaluated through extensive experiments in the real Internet.

In this dissertation, we introduce email spam filtering using network-level features of spammers. Network-level features are based on lightweight measurements that can be made in the network, often without processing or storing a message. These features stay relevant for longer periods, are harder for criminals to alter at will (e. g., a bot cannot act independently of other bots in the botnet), and afford the unique opportunity to observe the coordinated behavior of spammers. We find that widely-used IP address-based reputation systems (e. g., IP blacklists) cannot keep up with the threats of spam from previously unseen IP addresses, and from new and stealthy attacks [...] -to thwart IP-based reputation systems, spammers are reconnoitering IP Blacklists and sending spam from <b>hijacked</b> <b>IP</b> address space. Finally, spammers are "gaming" collaborative filtering by users in Web-based email by casting fraudulent "Not Spam" votes on spam email. We present three systems that detect each attack that uses spammer behavior rather than their IP address. First, we present IP blacklist counter-intelligence, a system that can passively enumerate spammers performing IP blacklist reconnaissance. Second, we present SpamTracker, a system that distinguishes spammers from legitimate senders by applying clustering on the set of domains to which email is sent.
