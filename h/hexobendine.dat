40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} a range of natural and synthetic derivatives of adenosine on the antigen-induced release of histamine and slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) from human lung has been studied. The nucleotides ATP, ADP and AMP appear to act by being converted to adenosine. The rank order of inhibitory potency of the synthetic analogues indicates that these compounds act at an extracellular A 2 /Ra purinoceptor. The xanthines, 1, 3 -diethyl- 8 -phenylxanthine, 8 -phenyltheophylline and theophylline antagonized the inhibitory action of N-ethyl-carboxamideadenosine competitively. Theobromine was inactive. This supports the view that the inhibitory receptor is of the A/R type. <b>Hexobendine</b> and dipyridamole, reported to antagonize the uptake of adenosine, failed to modify the response of human lung fragments to adenosine. The P site agonist 2 ', 5 ' dideoxyadenosine inhibited the release of histamine and SRS-A. This effect was not prevented by the inhibitors of uptake, <b>hexobendine</b> and dipyridamole, nor was it antagonized by 8 -phenyltheophylline...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the effects}} of dipyridamole, <b>hexobendine</b> and {{lidoflazine}} on mechanical responses in rabbit duodenum have been investigated. In concentrations known to inhibit tissue accumulation of adenosine and its metabolites, none of these agents potentiated inhibitory responses to intramural nerve stimulation or to application of adenosine, adenosine triphosphate or phenylephrine. These results neither support nor dispute the suggestion that adenosine or a related nucleotide is the intramural inhibitory transmitter but do show that tissue accumulation in rabbit duodenum is not an important feature in the termination of the action of adenosine...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine {{enhanced}} histamine {{release and}} prolonged the adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) response in purified rat peritoneal mast cells following immunological challenge. The {{effect on the}} cyclic AMP response, which was blocked by 8 -phenyltheophylline, probably results from an interaction with A 2 -purinoceptors. Enhancement of histamine release showed different characteristics. It was not inhibited by dipyridamole or <b>hexobendine,</b> thereby indicating an action at the cell surface. However, the relative potencies of adenosine analogues and nucleotides, together with the observation that this effect was not antagonized by 8 -phenyltheophylline or theophylline, {{suggest that it is}} not mediated by a previously recognised purinoceptor. Thus, enhancement of histamine release may represent a novel cell surface action of adenosine which is independent of its effects on adenylate cyclase...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of [3 H]adenosine (10 microM) into neonatal-rat heart cell nucleotides was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, such that 50 % inhibition was obtained with 0. 75 microM-dipyridamole, 0. 26 microM-hexobendine or 0. 22 microM-dilazep. Adenosine formation was accelerated 2. 5 -fold to 2. 1 +/- 0. 3 nmol/ 10 (7) cells in 10 min when cells were incubated {{with a combination}} of 30 mM- 2 -deoxyglucose and 2 micrograms of oligomycin/ml. Of the newly formed adenosine, 6 +/- 2 % was in the cells. Dipyridamole, <b>hexobendine</b> or dilazep (10 microM) increased the amount of adenosine in the cells and decreased that in the medium such that 45 - 50 % of the newly formed adenosine was in the cells. Antibodies which inhibited ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase by 98. 7 +/- 0. 3 % did not alter the rate of adenosine formation or its distribution between cells and medium. We conclude that adenosine was formed in the cytoplasm during catabolism of cellular ATP and was released via the dipyridamole-sensitive symmetric nucleoside transporter...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine {{triphosphate}} (ATP) caused {{contraction of}} the resting isolated rat anococcygeus muscle. Non-phosphorylated purines {{did not cause}} contraction of the resting muscle but did so in muscles in which the tone was raised by carbachol or guanethidine. Adenosine, (-) N 6 -phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) and 5 '-N-ethyl-carboxamide adenosine (NECA) were approximately equipotent, and these responses were not prevented by theophylline, quinidine, 2, 2 '-pyridylisatogen tosylate, phentolamine, methysergide, dipyridamole, <b>hexobendine</b> or indomethacin. The contractions became smaller as muscle tone progressively declined, and {{it is suggested that}} this effect may explain the apparent blockade of ATP responses by indomethacin reported previously. Adenosine, 2 -chloroadenosine, ATP, PIA and NECA inhibited contractile responses of the anococcygeus to field stimulation of the excitatory adrenergic innervation. This inhibitory action was blocked by theophylline, and as PIA was easily the most potent purine tested, it may involve activation of an A 1 /Ri receptor. It is also argued, however, that the A/R scheme of classification may be inappropriate for the description of responses of intact tissues. As response to noradrenaline were not changed by the purines, the inhibitory effect on stimulation-evoked contractions is probably mediated at a presynaptic site. None of the purines tested had any effect on the neurally mediated inhibition of the anococcygeus which is seen when intrinsic tone is raised and the excitatory adrenergic nerves are blocked...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine {{produced}} a concentration-related enhancement of antigen-induced 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) release from rat serosal mast cells. This potentiation was maximal following the simultaneous addition of adenosine with antigen. Enhancement of 5 -HT release {{was accompanied by}} potentiation of the adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) response to challenge. The cyclic AMP response, which was antagonized by 8 -phenyltheophylline, was characterized as an A 2 -purinoceptor-mediated effect {{by the use of}} 5 '-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine (NECA) and L-N 6 -phenylisopropyladenosine (L-PIA). Enhancement of 5 -HT release, conversely, was not blocked by 8 -phenyltheophylline suggesting it to be mediated by a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism. The effect of adenosine on 5 -HT release was not reduced by the inhibition of the facilitated uptake of adenosine with dipyridamole, <b>hexobendine</b> or p-nitrobenzylthioguanosine, therefore, suggesting it to be mediated by a cell surface receptor. The receptor mediating enhancement of 5 -HT does not appear to belong to the P 2 -purinoceptor subtype as adenosine was more potent than both adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and alpha, beta-methylene ATP was inactive. Furthermore, the effects of AMP were blocked by alpha, beta-methylene ADP, which inhibits the conversion of AMP to adenosine. Adenosine, NECA, L- and D-PIA were all of equal potency in enhancing 5 -HT release. Inosine and 3 -deazaadenosine were also active. The rank order of potency of these adenosine analogues is not consistent with an effect at A 1 - or A 2 -purinoceptors. There appear to be two adenosine receptors on rat mast cells, an A 2 -purinoceptor which stimulates adenylate cyclase and a separate purinoceptor, stimulation of which produces enhancement of mediator release by an unknown mechanism. The effects mediated by these receptors appear to be independent of each other...|$|E
