5|$|Because the {{faithful}} {{are obliged to}} attend Mass {{unless there is a}} grave impediment, pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept.... Yet more than a precept, the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of Christian life. It is crucially important that all {{the faithful}} should be convinced that they cannot live their <b>faith</b> <b>or</b> share fully {{in the life of the}} Christian community unless they take part regularly in the Sunday Eucharistic assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{author has}} {{attenuated}} Natrum muriaticum (common table-salt) {{until there was}} not a single saline property left... and yet, with one drop of that attenuation in a goblet of water, and a teaspoonful of the water administered at intervals of three hours, she has cured a patient sinking in the last stage of typhoid fever. The highest attenuation of homœopathy and the most potent rises above matter into mind. This discovery leads to more light. From it may be learned that either human <b>faith</b> <b>or</b> the divine Mind is the healer and that there is no efficacy in a drug.|$|E

5|$|Cameron and Comfort {{participated in}} a {{televised}} debate with atheists Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Conner of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church, in Manhattan, on May 5, 2007. It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on Nightline. At issue was the existence of God, which Comfort stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on <b>faith</b> <b>or</b> the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that Comfort violated the rules by talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show that {{the rules of the}} debate did not say that the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that Comfort simply {{had to come up with}} one argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E
5|$|Charles, however, decreed on 22 September {{that all}} reformers must {{reconcile}} with the Catholic <b>faith,</b> <b>or</b> {{he would use}} military force to suppress them. This prompted Melanchthon to call a meeting with Bucer and after lengthy discussions they agreed on nine theses, which they sent to Luther and to Strasbourg. The Strasbourg magistrates forwarded them to Basel and Zürich. Bucer met Luther in Coburg on 26–28 September. Luther still rejected Bucer's theses, but he encouraged him to continue the search for unity. Bucer then traveled to several southern German cities, including Ulm, Isny, Konstanz, Memmingen, and Lindau, and to the Swiss cities of Basel and Zürich. In Zurich on 12 October, he presented the articles to Zwingli, who neither opposed him nor agreed with him.|$|E
5|$|Even after publication, the book's status {{remained}} vague {{because the}} king had not given his full support to it. In a draft letter, Henry noted {{that he had not}} read the book, but supported its printing. His attention was most likely occupied by the pregnancy of Jane Seymour and the birth of the male heir, Edward, that Henry had sought for so long. Jane died shortly after giving birth and her funeral was held on 12 November. That month Henry started to work on the Bishops' Book; his amendments were sent to Cranmer, Sampson, and others for comment. Cranmer's responses to the king were far more confrontational than his colleagues' and he wrote at much greater length. They reveal unambiguous statements supporting reformed theology such as justification by <b>faith</b> <b>or</b> sola fide (faith alone) and predestination. However, his words did not convince the king. A new statement of faith would be delayed until 1543 with the publication of the King's Book.|$|E

5|$|George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester who {{had earlier}} praised Lang's work for church unity, said that Lang's failure {{to take a}} lead after the Prayer Book {{rejection}} of 1928 meant that the Church of England {{had been unable to}} revise its forms of worship or take any effective control of its own affairs. Others have argued that Lang's laissez-faire approach to the Prayer Book controversy helped to defuse a potentially explosive situation and contributed to an eventual solution. Lang himself was gloomy about his legacy; he believed that since he had not led his country back into an Age of <b>Faith,</b> <b>or</b> marked his primacy with a great historical act, he had {{failed to live up to}} his own high standard. Others have judged him more charitably, praising his industry, his administrative ability and his devotion to duty.|$|E
5|$|The Governor would {{consult the}} Executive Council in the {{exercise}} of all his functions (except on trivial or urgent matters or where the public interest made it undesirable). He would not be required to consult in cases where he was specifically authorised by the Constitution to act in his discretion or on the advice of, or after consultation with, some other person or authority. He would in general act in accordance with the advice of the Executive Council but could act against such advice, where he considered it necessary {{in the interests of the}} public order, public <b>faith</b> <b>or</b> good government; in such cases he would be required to seek approval of the Secretary of State for India.|$|E
5|$|Religion {{has always}} been closely tied to European {{political}} affairs, and as such it {{played an important role}} during marriage negotiations. The 1572 wedding in Paris of the French princess Margaret of Valois to the leader of France's Huguenots, Henry III of Navarre, was ostensibly arranged to effect a rapprochement between the nation's Catholics and Protestants, but proved a ruse for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. After the English Reformation, matches between English monarchs and Roman Catholic princesses were often unpopular, especially so when the prospective queen consort was unwilling to convert, or at least practice her faith discreetly. Passage of the Act of Settlement 1701 disinherited any heir to the throne who married a Catholic. Other ruling houses, such as the Romanovs and Habsburgs, have at times also insisted on dynastic marriages only being contracted with people of a certain <b>faith</b> <b>or</b> those willing to convert. When in 1926 Astrid of Sweden married Leopold III of Belgium, it was agreed that her children would be raised as Catholics but she was not required to give up Lutheranism, although she chose to convert in 1930. Some potential matches were abandoned due to irreconcilable religious differences. For example, plans for the marriage of the Catholic Władysław IV Vasa and the Lutheran Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine proved unpopular with Poland's largely Catholic nobility and were quietly dropped.|$|E

5|$|While {{both the}} Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons {{with three or}} more Jewish {{grandparents}} would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one (Mischlinge of the second degree) would not, a debate arose as {{to the status of}} persons with two Jewish grandparents (Mischlinge of the first degree). The NSDAP, especially its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to Mischlinge of both the first and second degree. For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the <b>faith</b> <b>or</b> had a Jewish spouse. The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did {{not have the right to}} vote. Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the Anschluss. Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date. A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.|$|E
