5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, rescue workers spent days <b>digging</b> <b>through</b> mud to find victims of the hurricane until the search was disbanded on October6. The government received criticism for the tragedy, citing that the dam that broke had been poorly built. Overall, at least 1,263fatalities and $100million (1976USD) in damage are attributed to the hurricane, {{making it one of the}} deadliest tropical cyclones on record in the eastern Pacific, as well as one of the few Pacific hurricanes to kill more than 1,000people.|$|E
25|$|A {{flattened}} head {{allows for}} <b>digging</b> <b>through</b> the substrate {{as well as}} perhaps serving as a hydrofoil. Some have a mouth that can expand to a large size and contains no incisiform teeth; catfish generally feed through suction or gulping rather than biting and cutting prey. However, some families, notably Loricariidae and Astroblepidae, have a suckermouth {{that allows them to}} fasten themselves to objects in fast-moving water. Catfish also have a maxilla reduced to a support for barbels; this means that they are unable to protrude their mouths as other fish such as carp.|$|E

25|$|Because {{they are}} insects, Grass Grub {{fall prey to}} almost all bird species present in the same areas, some {{examples}} of avian predators are; Larus marinus, Great black backed gull, especially when the areas inhabited by Grass Grub, undergo cultivation, Starlings Sturnus vulgaris and Black Birds Turdus merula seem to favour Grass Grub larvae in their third instar phase, {{as well as the}} adult beetle, and are often seen actively <b>digging</b> <b>through</b> the soil in areas with a high Grass Grub population. Another common predator of the Grass Grub is the Hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus whose intake of Grass Grub can be up to 40% of the total diet of an adult hedgehog. There are few invertebrate predators but they are not common in pastures.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who were}} rescued first {{were taken to}} another {{building}} for treatment, as the ambulances were trapped inside the collapsed tower. The hospital {{did not have an}} emergency plan but nonetheless, surviving hospital workers and neighbors quickly improvised, under the management of the hospital, setting up aid stations and scavenging supplies. Rescue workers soon arrived to start <b>digging</b> <b>through</b> the rubble. A second quake made rescue work slower, because of fear of further collapse. Most bodies were identified by personal effects, some by dental records and some were so mangled that they wound up being cremated without ever being identified, {{due to the lack of}} morgue facilities. 561 bodies were found and 188 were never identified. 266 were hospital workers and 44 were medical residents. The majority who were rescued were found in the first five days. The number of bodies recovered was high during those first days as well but the numbers dramatically increased between days 17 and 31.|$|E
500|$|Mari was {{discovered}} in 1933, on the eastern flank of Syria, near the Iraqi border. A Bedouin tribe was <b>digging</b> <b>through</b> a mound called Tell Hariri for a gravestone {{that would be used}} for a recently deceased tribesman, when they came across a headless statue. After the news reached the French authorities currently in control of Syria, the report was investigated, and digging on the site was started on December 14, 1933 by archaeologists from the Louvre in Paris. The location of the fragment was excavated, revealing the temple of Ishtar, which led to the commencing of the full scale excavations. Mari was classified by the archaeologists as the [...] "most westerly outpost of Sumerian culture".|$|E

500|$|The newly {{constructed}} Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad across northern Illinois used trackage {{rights on}} the Illinois Central Railroad between Dubuque, Iowa and Stockton, Illinois in 1886 before construction {{on its own}} line through the isolated wilderness could commence. Engineers quickly realized that a tunnel {{would need to be}} constructed in order to traverse the rugged landscape. The Sheppard, Winston and Company (for which the tunnel would be named) and more than 350 laborers worked by hand, <b>digging</b> <b>through</b> the silty and unstable shale for nine months starting in the spring of 1887. The work was both strenuous and dangerous, and at least one worker, a thirty-two-year-old Finnish immigrant named John Hill, was killed. [...] When complete, the total cost of the tunnel, $600,000, had exceeded expectations.|$|E
500|$|While on tour as Mos Def's in-concert DJ, Preservation {{began to}} remix some of The Ecstatics songs for their live routine. He {{challenged}} himself to remix {{the rest of}} the record, taking more than a year, as a project called The REcstatic, working with Jan Fairchild, the original album's mixing engineer. Preservation revisited sources for the original beats to find similar recordings that would correspond to each song's particular aesthetic while preserving Mos Def's vocals for the remixes. He wanted them to be sample-based and consistent in key, pitch, and tone to the first album, which he found difficult to achieve because of the original music's unorthodox instrumentals and singing. [...] "It's the result of countless hours of <b>digging</b> <b>through</b> records to sample", he recalled. [...] "Constructing the beat, wrapping it around the vocal, adjusting the tempo, and so on". The REcstatic was released as a free download on June 12, 2013, by Preservation's imprint label, Mon Dieu Music. Reviewing the remix album in Tiny Mix Tapes, Samuel Diamond said the rapturous energy of the original record was given a [...] "slightly rougher texture" [...] on what he deemed [...] "a respectful contribution to the canon of remix-based art, something that can be said for very few modern rap 'remixes'".|$|E

50|$|As the shrew-mole {{continues}} to <b>dig</b> <b>through</b> the soil, {{the amount of}} prey in the soil is significantly less than the amount present in soil {{that has not been}} dug through by them. In addition, it spends a lot of its energy to <b>dig</b> <b>through</b> the soil. Due to these factors, it is common for shrew-moles to forage through tunnels that have been dug by other shrew-moles because it is more energetically efficient and more prey might be present in tunnels that have been abandoned.|$|R

[...] Most of the subspecies, Rangifer tarandus caribou are now only found in Canada. A distinctive characteristic of all caribou is large crescent-shaped hooves that change shape with {{the season and}} that are adapted to walking in snow-covered and soft ground such as swamps and peat lands, and assist in <b>digging</b> <b>through</b> snow to forage on lichens and other ground vegetation. The subspecies ecotype, boreal woodland caribou, have a shoulder height of approximately 1.0-1.2 m shoulder height and weigh 110–210kg.|$|E
2500|$|As a Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies at UCLA from 1963 to 1989, Gimbutas {{directed}} major excavations [...] of Neolithic {{sites in}} southeastern Europe between 1967 and 1980, including Anzabegovo, near Štip, Republic of Macedonia, and Sitagroi and Achilleion in Thessaly (Greece). <b>Digging</b> <b>through</b> layers of earth representing {{a period of}} time before contemporary estimates for Neolithic habitation in Europe– where other archaeologists would not have expected further finds– she unearthed a great number of artifacts of daily life and of religious cults, which she researched and documented throughout her career.

Later during the morning, the 3rd Battalion advanced towards the east and north-east of the wood and by [...] Tanner reported to Lukin that he had secured the wood except for a strong German position in the north-western corner adjoining Longueval. The South African Brigade began to dig in around {{the fringe of the}} wood, in groups forming strong–points supported by machine–guns. The brigade occupied a salient, in contact with the 26th Brigade only along the south-western edge of the wood adjoining Longueval. The troops carried spades but <b>digging</b> <b>through</b> roots and remnants of tree trunks, made it impossible to dig proper trenches and only shallow shell scrapes could be prepared before German troops began to counter-attack the wood.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{the street}} was legally [...] "opened" [...] with the {{approval}} by the court of the commission's figures, the city collected the assessment from the landowners along the street, and once the assessment was totally collected, the streets could be built, or [...] "worked".

Many years could pass between when a street was [...] "opened" [...] and when it finally began to resemble a city street, having been cleared, leveled, graded and paved. [...] The grading was often difficult because of the rocky nature of the island, especially on the West Side. In 1843, Isaacher Cozzens described the ground as [...] "a tough cement of clay, gravel, and boulders, very hard to dig. In <b>digging</b> <b>through</b> 42nd Street, the pickaxes had to be used for every shovelful of this clayey cement which formed what is called, a hard-pan, of about fourteen feet or more." ...|$|E
