40|$|The {{use of an}} {{automatic}} analyzer for blood chemistry has become widespread since {{the latter half of}} the 1970 s. This medical equipment conserved while improving accuracy. This technology has had a greater impact upon the structure of medical practice, management of medical institutions and medical economics, than previous diagnostic tests such as the X-ray, electrocardiograph and manual laboratory tests. This report analyzes the nationwide use of blood chemistry automatic analyzer, based on statistics from the Ministry of Health and Welfare. First, attempts are made to evaluate the significance of the provision of the multiple-channel auto-analyzer. Second, we review the impact of this technology on medical care and its background in three phases: (1) medical institutions, (2) clinical Laboratory Test Centers and (3) national medical expenditure and the response of the government. These phenomena are common to the fruits of the technological revolution centered on ME (Medical Engineering or Medical Electronics), such as CT, ultrasonograph, <b>hemodialyser.</b> The rational utilization of this equipment will require the cooperative efforts of both economists and medical technologists. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Almost 600, 000 {{people in}} the United States were treated for End Stage Renal Disease in 2010. A {{majority}} of those people received hemodialysis from central medical facilities. It has been reported a better treatment option for these patients would be realized if the patients had more frequent hemodialysis treatments. A major limiting factor in realizing home hemodialysis treatments is the capital cost of hemodialysis systems and the unit cost of hemodialysers. Microchannel hemodialysers show promise for reducing the size and cost of hemodialysis systems. Cost-effective and reliable sealing techniques for microchannel hemodialysers are required. This paper develops a reliable compression sealing method using sealing bosses in conjunction with an AN 69 ST hemodialysis membrane for enabling microchannel hemodialysis. The mechanical properties of the AN 69 ST membranes are determined and used to establish limits on the dimensional tolerances of the polycarbonate laminae and sealing bosses needed to hermetically seal a microchannel <b>hemodialyser.</b> A mathematical relationship is derived for determining the clamping force needed to seal the laminae for a given set of operating parameters and experiments are {{used to evaluate the}} model. The method is used to incorporate sealing bosses into a dialysis device and performance is validated using urea mass transfer experiments...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] than 1. 2 million people worldwide require regular hemodialysis therapy to treat end stage renal failure. Current hemodialysis systems are too expensive to support at-home hemodialysis where more frequent and longer duration treatment can lead to better patient outcomes. The key cost driver for <b>hemodialysers</b> is the cost of the hemodialysis membrane. Microchannel <b>hemodialysers</b> are smaller providing the potential to use significantly less membrane. Prior work has demonstrated the use of sealing bosses to form compression seals in microchannel <b>hemodialysers.</b> In this paper, estimates show that the percentage of the membrane utilized for mass transfer is highly dependent on the design and registration accuracy of adjacent blood and dialysate laminae. Efforts here focus on the development of a self-registration method to align polycarbonate laminae compatible with compression sealing schemes for membrane separation applications. Self-nesting registration methods were demonstrated with average registration accuracies of 11. 4 ± 7. 2 μm measured over a 50 mm scale. Analysis shows that the registration accuracy is constrained by tolerances in the embossing process. A dialysis test article was produced using the self-nesting registration method showing a measured average one-dimensional misregistration of 18. 5 μm allowing a potential 41. 4 % of the membrane to be utilized for mass transfer when considering both microchannel and header regions. Mass transfer results provide evidence of a twofold to threefold increase in membrane utilization over other designs in the existing literature...|$|R
40|$|A two-layered {{magnetohydrodynamic}} {{model for}} parallel plate <b>hemodialysers,</b> {{under the influence}} of a uniform transverse magnetic field has been investigated. Analytical expressions for velocity profiles in the core region and peripheral plasma layer alongwith flow rate, effective viscosity and effective Reynolds number have been obtained. Some interesting limitng cases have also been discussed. It may be noticed that the flow of suspensions has the tendency to leave a particle free layer near the wall, thereby decreasing the effective viscosity. This may be used in reducing the dialysis time. Because of the movement of red cells towards the centre, plasma exposure area to the membrane increases. Further, due to reduced blockage of membrane pores by the red cells, the membrane exposure area further increases. These two factors further help in reducing the cell injury and the dialysis time...|$|R
40|$|A {{clinical}} {{evaluation of the}} new dialysers. Seventeen <b>hemodialysers,</b> studied by one team using the same techniques throughout, are compared {{in terms of their}} clearance of urea and creatinine, priming volume, residual blood volume, ultrafiltration rate, handling and cost. Data on clearance of higher molecular weight substances are also presented for six of the dialysers. The Meltec 1 m 2 Multipoint dialyser has a considerable superiority over the Kiil of the same surface area in clearance of all molecules studied, a higher ultrafiltration rate and similar priming volume, residual blood volume, handling characteristics and cost. Of the disposable dialysers the EX- 03, Nephravon, Ultraflo 100 and Ultraflo 2 coils and the Dasco SP 400, Gambro Lundia and Rhone Poulenc 1 D parallel flow dialysers all have urea and creatinine clearances superior to the Kiil. There are small differences in performance between members of this group but they are counterbalanced by differences in priming volume, flexibility of ultrafiltration, ease of handling, leakage rate and cost. Thus there is no single disposable dialyser which has a clearcut superiority over its rivals. The Cordis HFAK has a considerably higher urea and creatinine clearance than any other disposable dialyser but its clearance of large molecules is lower and its residual blood volume higher when compared to the Kiil...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from 9 - 17 - 2012 - 9 - 17 - 2013 More than 1. 2 million people worldwide require regular hemodialysis therapy to treat end stage renal failure. In the United States alone, there are 300, 000 patients and the National Kidney Foundation predicts that this number will double in the next 10 years. Currently most dialysis patients receive treatment at a dialysis center and need three 4 - 5 hour treatments each week. While these treatments are useful, more frequent and longer duration dialysis better simulates natural kidney function. Consequently, at-home hemodialysis is expected to provide patients {{a better quality of}} life. Current hemodialysis systems are too expensive to support at-home hemodialysis. Cost drivers include the capital costs of the hemodialysis equipment and the raw material costs of expensive hemodialysis membranes. Microchannel <b>hemodialysers</b> have smaller form factors requiring significantly less membrane while enabling reductions in the size and cost of capital equipment. Microchannel devices are typically made by microchannel lamination methods involving the patterning, registration and bonding of thin laminae. Findings in this paper show that membrane utilization is highly dependent on registration accuracy with membrane utilization often dropping below 25...|$|R
