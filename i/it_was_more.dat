5|$|The Los Angeles Timess Agustin Gurza {{described}} {{the creative process}} between the pair as Chan creating the instrumental first, followed by Chana crafting the lyrics and melodies alongside him. Chana based her lyrics on her previous relationships and break-ups, while Chan found inspiration in the music of Manu Chao. Chana reported that she had some difficulties during the production process due to the personal nature of the lyrics. Although she said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> challenging to write lyrics in Spanish, Chana expressed a preference for it as she felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> poetic than English. She often consulted a Spanish-English dictionary to translate her ideas.|$|E
5|$|Written by Godfrey Harrison, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} by Letts on 19 July 1971. Feeling <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> fantastical than appropriate for Doctor Who, Letts dropped the story on 25 February 1972.|$|E
5|$|Design of {{the bridge}} was awarded to Aas-Jakobsen and Det Norske Veritas, the former who also {{performed}} dynamic analysis and structural engineering. Architects were Hindhammer–Sundt–Thomassen, Lund & Løvseth, and Lund & Slaatto. An H pylon was chosen instead of an A pylon both because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> functional, and would be more aesthetic {{in conjunction with the}} other bridges in the area, particularly three suspension bridges.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, Boletus pinophilus {{is found}} in Britain, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> common in Scotland, and in France, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> common in the south.

5|$|Despite its popularization {{in later}} times, the phrase is not {{recorded}} elsewhere in Roman history.

5|$|Filming for Live Free or Die Hard {{started in}} {{downtown}} Baltimore, Maryland on September 23, 2006. Eight different sets were {{built on a}} large soundstage for filming many scenes throughout the film. When recording the sound for the semi trailer used {{in one of the}} film's final scenes, 18 microphones were used to record the engine, tires, and damage to the vehicle. Post-production for the film only took 16 weeks, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> common for similar films to use 26 weeks.|$|E
5|$|I. lakotaensis was {{described}} by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork in 1989. The only well-accepted North American species of Iguanodon, I. lakotaensis {{was described}} from a partial skull from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota. Its assignment has been controversial. Some researchers suggest that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> basal than I. bernissartensis, and related to Theiophytalia, but David Norman has suggested {{that it was a}} synonym of I. bernissartensis. Gregory S. Paul has since given the species its own genus, Dakotadon.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero spawned {{an annual}} {{publication}} called G.I. Joe: Yearbook. G.I. Joe: Yearbook {{differed from the}} typical comic book annual publication in that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> like a magazine. Each issue contained articles about the animated TV program, {{a summary of the}} comic book's plot to date, and one or two original stories written by Larry Hama. G.I. Joe: Yearbook ran until 1988.|$|E
5|$|Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, {{were not}} a threat to the Puerto Rican parrot {{population}} when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> readily self-maintaining, but {{as a result of the}} fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now a threat as well. Hurricane Hugo passed through the species' range in September 1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Pioneers 10 and 11 {{and both}} Voyager probes carry {{messages}} from the Earth to extraterrestrial life. Communication can be difficult with deep space travel. For instance, it took about three hours for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> than halfway to Pluto. Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.|$|E

5|$|Roger's and his fellow-bishops' {{stories to}} Henry are {{often cited as}} the spark that touched off the king's anger at Becket and led to his martyrdom. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{probably}} the stories of Becket's behaviour upon arrival in England that caused Henry's anger, and which indirectly led {{to the death of}} Becket. Roger was suspended by Pope Alexander III because he was implicated in Becket's death, but was restored to office on 16 December 1171.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{intermarriage}} is {{the practice}} of members of ruling dynasties marrying into other reigning families. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> commonly {{done in the past}} as part of strategic diplomacy for national interest.

5|$|Stout, {{a kind of}} porter beer, {{particularly}} Guinness, {{is typically}} associated with Ireland, although historically <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly Magners (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.|$|E

5|$|The Restaurant {{was later}} {{seen as the}} start of a {{movement}} in London wherein high-end restaurants were moved into hotels. This was followed in 1999 by Koffman moving La Tante Claire from its Royal Hospital Road location into The Berkeley hotel.

5|$|The current stellar {{classification}} system {{originated in the}} early 20th century, when stars were classified from A to Q based {{on the strength of}} the hydrogen line. It thought that the hydrogen line strength was a simple linear function of temperature. Rather, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> complicated; it strengthened with increasing temperature, it peaked near 9000K, and then declined at greater temperatures. When the classifications were reordered by temperature, it more closely resembled the modern scheme.|$|E
