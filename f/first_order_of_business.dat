5|$|Many pre-Code films {{dealt with}} the {{economic}} realities of a country struggling to find its next meal. In Blonde Venus (1932), Marlene Dietrich's character resorts to prostitution to feed her child, and Claudette Colbert's character in It Happened One Night (1934) gets her comeuppance for throwing a tray of food onto the floor by later finding herself without food or financial resources. Joan Blondell's character in Big City Blues (1932) reflects that as a chorus girl she regularly received diamonds and pearls as gifts, but now must content herself with a corned beef sandwich. In Union Depot (1932), Douglas Fairbanks Jr. puts a luscious meal as the <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> on his itinerary after coming into money.|$|E
5|$|At first, the revolutionaries {{used the}} {{constitutional}} machinery {{of the old}} confederal republic. They resumed where they had left off after the purge in 1787 of Patriot regents, taking over {{the offices of the}} Orangist regents that were now purged in their turn. Though the political make-up of the States-General changed appreciably because of this change in personnel, it retained a number of defenders of the old particularist interests. The <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> of the revolutionaries therefore was to strive for the reform of the confederal state, with its discrimination of the Generality Lands, and of particular minorities (Catholics, Jews), {{in the direction of a}} unitary state, in which the minorities would be emancipated, and the old entrenched interests superseded by a more democratic political order. As a first step the representatives of Brabant were admitted to the States-General.|$|E
5|$|Legislation for a Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Massachusetts' Joseph Walsh on March 23, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 13227. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, {{as well as on the}} coinage proposal that would become the Alabama Centennial half dollar, which was the <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Once the committee voted to favorably recommend the Alabama bill, which provided for 100,000 half dollars, it proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to Treasury Secretary David F. Houston, and Houston responded that while his department had not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters.|$|E
25|$|One <b>of</b> the <b>first</b> <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> Blackwell's {{administration}} {{as mayor of}} Cincinnati was {{the establishment of a}} crowd control task force stemming from the deaths of 11 concert fans at a concert by the British rock group The Who at Riverfront Coliseum on December 3, 1979.|$|R

5|$|The Democratic nominating {{convention}} {{began on}} June 20, at the Music Hall on Market Street in Louisville. The <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was to nominate a convention chairman. Ollie M. James, {{a supporter of}} Stone, nominated Judge David Redwine. When Woodson seconded the nomination, the deal between Stone and Goebel became apparent to all. Hardin supporters nominated William H. Sweeney, but the Stone-Goebel alliance elected Redwine. The membership of several county delegations was challenged; these cases would {{be decided by the}} credentials committee. This committee was also stacked against Hardin; his supporters made up just four of the thirteen members. Prolonged deliberations by the credentials committee caused the delegates to become restless, and hundreds of people—both delegates and non-delegates—entered the Music Hall attempting to disrupt the convention. When Redwine summoned Louisville city police to the hall to maintain order, Hardin supporters accused him of using intimidation tactics. The credentials committee finally issued its report on June 23. Of the twenty-eight cases where delegates were contested, twenty-six of them were decided in favor of Goebel or Stone supporters.|$|E

25|$|After Charles I {{had fled}} London to raise an army {{at the start}} of the Civil War, the {{destruction}} of the cross was almost the <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> for Harley's commission. Though less well known than the Charing Cross, the downfall of the Cheapside Cross is one of the most interesting and arguably important examples of iconoclasm in English history.|$|E
25|$|After {{yet another}} first round exit, the Mavericks began an {{unexpectedly}} early off-season. The <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> for Mark Cuban and the Mavericks was to re-sign Dirk Nowitzki, {{and they did}} so on July 4, 2010, when the Mavericks and Nowitzki agreed to a four-year deal worth $80 million. On July 13, the Mavericks, after losing the opportunity to sign LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, or Amar'e Stoudemire, acquired centers Tyson Chandler and Alexis Ajinca from the Charlotte Bobcats for center Erick Dampier, forward Eduardo Nájera and guard Matt Carroll.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Ten Year Crusade, {{planned by}} Shoghi Effendi and {{concluding}} in 1963, the Universal House of Justice was first elected. As its <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> the Universal House of Justice evaluated the situation caused {{by the fact that the}} Guardian had not appointed a successor. It determined that under the circumstances, given the criteria for succession described in the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá, there was no legitimate way for another Guardian to be appointed. Therefore, although the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá leaves provisions for a succession of Guardians, Shoghi Effendi remains the first and last occupant of this office.|$|E
50|$|Among Roberts' <b>first</b> <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was {{to certify}} the state's {{ratification}} of the 18th Amendment, which implemented nationwide prohibition.

25|$|Garfield {{had been}} {{approached}} by Hollywood studios before—both Paramount and Warners offering screen tests—but talks had always stalled over a clause he wanted inserted in his contract, one {{that would allow him}} time off for stage work. Now Warner Bros. acceded to his demand, and Garfield signed a standard feature-player agreement—seven years with options—in Warner's New York office. Many in the Group were livid over what they considered his betrayal. Elia Kazan's reaction was different, suggesting that the Group did not so much fear that Garfield would fail, but that he would succeed. Jack Warner's <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was a change of name to John Garfield.|$|E
25|$|Realising {{that she}} and K-9 are {{effectively}} on their own, she tries {{to figure out how}} to stop the sacrifice. Her <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> is determining the when of it. Using Lavinia's books on witchcraft, she and K-9 deduce it must occur at midnight on the winter solstice, now just a few short hours away. The where of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo to drive around the shire looking at all the churches. As the last few minutes before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there's an abandoned chapel on Lavinia's property. Rushing home, K-9 and Sarah are briefly upset at missing something that was right under their noses all along.|$|E
25|$|By {{evening the}} entire city of Mecca had been evacuated. Prince Sultan {{appointed}} Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, head of the Al Mukhabaraat Al 'Aammah (Saudi Intelligence), {{to take over the}} forward command post several hundred meters from the mosque, where Prince Turki would remain for the next several weeks. However, the <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was to seek the approval of the ulema, which was led by Abdul Aziz bin Baz. Islam forbids any violence within the Grand Mosque, to the extent that plants cannot be uprooted without explicit religious sanction. Ibn Baz found himself in a delicate situation, especially as he had previously taught al-Otaybi in Medina. Regardless, the ulema issued a fatwa allowing deadly force to be used in retaking the mosque.|$|E

25|$|John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry sent a {{shock wave}} across the South. When the Thirty-sixth Congress met in December 1859 the <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was the {{selection}} of a speaker. Already in turmoil over the Brown raid, Southerners were further aggravated by the nomination of Ohio Republican John Sherman for the post. Sherman was one of 68 Republicans who had endorsed Hinton Helper’s book, The Impending Crisis and How to Meet It, which Southerners believed would ignite class warfare between slaveholders and non-slaveholders in the South. Republicans proposed buying 100,000 copies of the book and distributing it throughout the country. Miles conspired with South Carolina's governor to send a regiment of militia to Washington to break up the Congress in the event of Sherman's election, but the withdrawal of Sherman's nomination prevented action.|$|E
25|$|Since {{very early}} on, the {{publishing}} duties and design duties {{had actually been}} split, with the Amarillo Design Bureau (ADB) handling all of the product design, while TFG had published, and indicated {{what they wanted to}} produce. The end of TFG put everything under one house again, and ADB, Inc. spent some time picking up the pieces of nearly three years without SFB. The <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> in fact, was to reprint Basic Set and Advanced Missions which had been out of stock for about three years at this point. While they were at it, all the errata and questions were evaluated, and many sections of the rules were re-written {{in an effort to make}} the game clearer. These editions featured new cover colors and a '1999' legend at the bottom of the cover to show when they were printed.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, The Band {{released}} Moondog Matinee, {{an album}} of old songs written by non-Band members. There was no tour {{in support of the}} album, which garnered mixed reviews. However on July 28, 1973, they played at the legendary Summer Jam at Watkins Glen, a massive concert which took place at the Grand Prix Raceway outside Watkins Glen, New York. The event, which was attended by over 600,000 music fans, also featured the Grateful Dead and The Allman Brothers Band. It was during this event that discussions began about a possible tour with Bob Dylan, who had along with Robertsonmoved to Malibu, California. By late 1973, Danko, Helm, Hudson and Manuel had joined them, and the <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was backing Dylan on the album Planet Waves. The album was released concurrently with their joint 1974 tour, in which they played 40 shows in North America during January and February 1974. Later that year, the live album Before the Flood was released, which documents the tour.|$|E

25|$|For these reasons, Kranz {{chose the}} {{alternative}} circumlunar option, using the Moon's gravity {{to return the}} ship to Earth. Apollo 13 had left its initial free-return trajectory earlier in the mission, as required for the lunar landing at Fra Mauro. Therefore, the <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was to re-establish the free-return trajectory with a 30.7-second burn of the DPS. The descent engine was used again two hours after pericynthion, the closest approach to the Moon ("PC+2 burn"), to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. A more aggressive burn could have been performed at PC+2 by first jettisoning the Service Module, returning the crew in {{about the same amount}} of time as a direct abort,p.III-20 but this was deemed unnecessary given the rates at which consumables were being used. The 4-minute, 24-second burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{set out to}} turn Taiwan into a Dutch colony. The <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> was {{to punish}} villages that had violently opposed the Dutch and unite the aborigines in {{allegiance}} with the VOC. The first punitive expedition was against the villages of Baccloan and Mattauw, north of Saccam near Tayowan. The Mattauw campaign had been easier than expected and the tribe submitted after having their village razed by fire. The campaign {{also served as a}} threat to other villages from Tirossen (modern Chiayi) to Lonkjiaow (Hengchun). The 1636 punitive attack on Lamay Island in response to the killing of the shipwrecked crews of the Beverwijck and the Golden Lion ended ten years later with the entire aboriginal population of 1100 removed from the island including 327 Lamayans killed in a cave, having been trapped there by the Dutch and suffocated in the fumes and smoke pumped into the cave by the Dutch and their allied aborigines from Saccam, Soulang and Pangsoya. The men were forced into slavery in Batavia (Java) and the women and children became servants and wives for the Dutch officers. The events on Lamay changed the course of Dutch rule to work closer with allied aborigines, though there remained plans to depopulate the outlying islands.|$|E
500|$|On October 6, {{members of}} the Texian militia in Matagorda convened {{at the home of}} Sylvanus Hatch. As their <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> they elected George Collinsworth as their captain; Dr. William Carleton was then named first {{lieutenant}} and D.C. Collinsworth became the unit's second lieutenant. After appointing their leaders, the men decided to march on La Bahía. They intended to kidnap Cos and, if possible, steal the estimated $50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. [...] The Texians sent messengers to alert nearby settlements of their quest. By afternoon, 50Texians were ready to march from Matagorda. During the march, for unknown reasons the men fired Carleton and appointed James W. Moore as the new first lieutenant.|$|E
