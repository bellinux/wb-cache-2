50|$|Excitation of the {{membrane}} is via a loudspeaker (Ø = 45 cm.) and an 11 cm-long wave guide (designed to convey maximum acoustic pressure between {{the center and}} 1/3 of the radius); that is, fairly short {{as far as the}} form factor is concerned. It proved fairly easy to obtain, in addition to the 30 Hz basic frequency, the 68.9 Hz frequency corresponding to the mode (0,2). It was on the contrary impossible to obtain the frequency of 47.8 Hz corresponding to the mode (1,1). At these frequencies, the behavior of the air excited by the loudspeaker can presumably be schematized with a piston motion, which exercises an almost uniform pressure on {{the membrane}}. A uniform excitation is poorly compatible with the modal form (1,1).The loudspeaker was driven by an electric power signal, generated by a <b>feed-back</b> <b>system</b> that sampled the signal issued by a piezoceramic sensor placed on the rim and detecting deflection of the membrane. In this way a “multimodal” oscillator was obtained generating a feed-back on a resonant element, the membrane. The loop gain was controllable by a pedal.|$|E

Nonlinear block parameters bounds are computed {{in the first}} stage exploiting steady-state measure-ments.

In this case, the charge density modulation or the micro-bunching can be observed due to the strong azimuthal quadrupole mode oscillation.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{quadratic surface}} Lyapunov func-tions {{in the study}} of global stability analysis of on/o systems (OFS), including those OFS with unstable non-linearity sectors. In previous work, quadratic surface Lyapunov functions were successfully applied to prove global asymptotic stability of limit cycles of relay <b>feed-back</b> <b>systems.</b> In this work, we show that these ideas can be used to prove global asymptotic stability of equi-librium points of piecewise linear systems (PLS). We present conditions in the form of LMIs that, when sat-is ed, guarantee global asymptotic stability of an equi-librium point. A large number of examples was success-fully proven globally stable. These include systems with an unstable aÆne linear subsystem, systems of relative degree larger than one and of high dimension, and sys-tems with unstable nonlinearity sectors, for which all classical fail to analyze. In fact, existence of an exam-ple with a globally stable equilibrium point that could not be successfully analyzed with this new methodol-ogy is still an open problem. This work opens the door to the possibility that more general PLS can be sys-tematically globally analyzed using quadratic surface Lyapunov functions. ...|$|R

If we choose the delay τ = np to be an integer mul-tiple n = 1, 2, 3, [...] . of the minimal period p, then Γ remains a periodic orbit of (2) because the time-delayed feedback control g vanishes. Therefore the feedback control (2) is noninvasive on Γ. Neverthe-less the linearized stability properties of Γ in the dif-ferential delay system (2) may differ markedly from (1), and in fact some unstable periodic orbits Γ of (1) may be stabilized by suitable choices of f and g.

40|$|Both the HER and LER of PEP-II use {{broadband}} longitudinal multi-bunch <b>feed-back</b> <b>systems</b> which process all coupled-bunch modes in {{the machine}} spanning a 119 MHz bandwidth. Roughly 1 MHz of this bandwidth includes modes driven by impedance related to the RF cavity fundamental. The longitudinal modes within the cavity bandwidth are processed by the all-mode broadband systems, though the correction signal {{is applied to the}} beam via a path through the broadband kicker, as well as through a special woofer channel which uses the RF system to apply low-mode correction signals to the beam. As there are two correction paths, with differing group delay and frequency response, yet only one adjustable processing channel, it is difficult to get an optimal low-frequency (“woofer”) response if the broadband feedback path is configured to best control HOM driven instabilities. A new low-mode processing channel has been designed to provide an indepen-dent means of providing the low-mode correction signal. It is a digital channel, operating at a 10 MHz sampling rate, and incorporating programmable 12 tap FIR control filters. This channel, implemented using EPLD technology, allows more optimal gain and phase adjustment of the woofer control path, with lower group delay allowing higher gain. This extra flexibility and higher gain will be useful in future high-current PEP-II operation.

For the expression profiles, cultured cells of rat suprachiasmatic nucleus were measured by Affimetrix GeneChip system. Folskolin stimulus {{was used as a}} phase-reset agent, causing irregular shift characteristic to oscillatory transcripts.

40|$|Using a {{qualitative}} approach, this study {{looks into the}} experiences of refugees during settlement in Britain, their perceptions and expectations of community associations and refugee agencies and the services these provide. Focused on the Colombian and the Somali refugee communities in London, the research is based on eight in depth interviews with personnel from refugee organisations and 31 with refugees themselves: 16 with Colombians and 15 Somalis. One mixed-sex group discussion with Colombian refugees and two, one male and one female, with Somalis were also conducted. This was complemented with direct observation and an extensive review of the existing literature. The research shows that English language skills, transferability of previous skills and employment experience, circumstances of flight, racism and discrimination, cultural differences between the country of origin and the UK, and availability of adequate health-care services and accommodation are key factors affecting refugee settlement. The findings also show that word of mouth {{was the most common}} medium of gaining awareness of refugee organisations for both the Colombian and the Somali refugees, followed by printed material. Whilst the Somali refugees were generally satisfied with the organisations they had approached, the Colombians expressed a high level of dissatisfaction. The findings lead to the conclusion that refugees' socio-cultural background and the reasons behind their flight are likely to shape both their settlement and their attitudes towards refugee organisations in the country of exile. Whilst the research suggests that there is {{a long way to go}} before refugee organisations can satisfactorily meet the needs of refugees in Britain, it also shows a pervasive lack of <b>feed-back</b> <b>systems</b> in those organisations.
