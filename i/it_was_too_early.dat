5|$|In 1995 {{the group}} {{released}} a report, Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting in Australia, containing the preliminary {{conclusions of the}} group. It found that premature regulation of the new platform might stifle the market-driven development of the service, {{that it should be}} based upon existing standards, and should not restrict the ability of broadcasters to tailor local content. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> at the time to make decisions relating to what standard should be used, when transmissions should commence, and whether analog television should be phased out.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lawrence {{introduced}} Mars to {{his future}} A manager at Atlantic Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck. After hearing him play {{a couple of}} songs on the guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because they felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> and that he still needed to develop as an artist.|$|E
5|$|Rupert Murdoch {{announced}} in early February 2007 that Baron Cohen had {{signed on to}} do another Borat film with Fox. However, this was contradicted by an interview with Baron Cohen himself in which Baron Cohen stated that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too well known to avoid detection {{as he did in}} the film and on Da Ali G Show. A spokesman for Fox later stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.|$|E

5|$|Seattle Transit {{general manager}} Lloyd Garber said that demand for parking {{was higher than}} {{expected}} and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> to analyze ridership; after {{the first week of}} service, Seattle Transit began surveying riders to determine whether motorists had been lured by the new service. The study determined that 75 percent of surveyed patrons had switched from their personal automobiles, and that Blue Streak was responsible for a decrease of 400 vehicles on Interstate 5 at rush hour. By late October, demand at the Northgate park and ride prompted the State Highway Department to offer funding for an auxiliary lot.|$|E
5|$|What {{happened}} next is uncertain. Legend says that Vienne and Perez promised a mass would {{be said for}} the riders in a chapel 200m from the start, in the boulevard Maillot. This story is repeated by Pascal Sergent, the historian of the race, and by Pierre Chany, historian of the sport in general. Sergent goes as far as saying that Victor Breyer, who he says was there, said the service, scheduled for 4am, was cancelled because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early.</b> Neither Chany nor Sergent mentions if the date of the race was subsequently changed, however the first Paris–Roubaix (according to Sergent) was held on 19 April 1896, whereas Easter Sunday in 1896 occurred two weeks earlier, on the 5 April.|$|E
5|$|The F-111 program {{experienced}} {{significant problems}} {{during the late}} 1960s. As a result of delays {{to the development of}} the RF-111 reconnaissance variant of the F-111, of which Australia had ordered four, the RAAF considered purchasing eight RF-4C or RF-4E reconnaissance aircraft and two tankers in early 1968. The Air Force and government eventually concluded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> to make a decision on this matter, and no action was taken. The RAAF accepted all 24 F-111Cs at a ceremony held at Fort Worth, Texas, on 4September 1968. At this time the F-111 program was in crisis owing to technical problems with the design of the aircraft's wing assembly, and all F-111s were grounded after an American F-111 crashed on 23September. Subsequent testing revealed further problems with F-111 components not meeting their intended lifespan, and the Australian aircraft were placed in storage at Fort Worth until these flaws could be rectified. The RAAF subsequently evaluated the F-4E PhantomII, Blackburn Buccaneer, LTV A-7 Corsair II and Grumman A-6 Intruder as possible replacements for the F-111. Only the F-4E was considered to come close to meeting the RAAF's requirements, though its relatively short range and lack of terrain-following radar and electronic countermeasures were considered problematic.|$|E

5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its then owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. President Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the its introduction, enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{of the one}} cent {{campaign}} {{said that}} it was losing support, citing declining petition signatures and no federal politicians on side, and suggested that residents have become desensitized to Miller's frequent calls for outside funding to fix the city's problems.

25|$|Tension existed {{within the}} Cuban revolutionary {{committee}} between Martí and his military compatriots. Martí feared a military dictatorship would {{be established in}} Cuba upon independence, and suspected Dominican-born General Máximo Gómez of having these intentions. Martí knew that the independence of Cuba needed time and careful planning. Ultimately, Martí refused to cooperate with Máximo Gómez and Antonio Maceo Grajales, two Cuban military leaders from the Ten Years' War, when they wanted to invade immediately in 1884. Martí knew that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> to attempt to win back Cuba, and later events proved him right.|$|E
25|$|A {{meeting of}} {{the heads of the}} army—including Kawashima, Kashii and Sugiyama—had been held from the early morning onward (Araki and Mazaki had {{attempted}} to attend but had been told to leave, as the SMC had no authority). Kawashima and Kashii attempted to convince the group to avoid violence, but when 10:00 passed without any word of movement by the rebel officers, they approved the use of force. However, when Hori and Kofuji came to see Kashii at 10:40, the three agreed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> to enact the imperial command. It has also been suggested that a lack of preparedness on the part of government forces was another factor. Either way, the action was delayed.|$|E

25|$|Western {{press reports}} {{asserted}} that the Israeli air strike followed a shipment delivery to Syria by a North Korean freighter, and that North Korea was suspected to be supplying a reactor to Syria for a nuclear weapons program. On 24 October 2007 the Institute for Science and International Security released a report which identified a site in eastern Syria's Deir ez-Zor Governorate province as the suspected reactor. The report speculated about similarities between the Syrian building and North Korea's Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, but said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> to make a definitive comparison. On 25 October 2007, Western media said the main building and any debris from it following the air strike had been completely dismantled and removed by the Syrians.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the 2DS using one physical display divided to emulate two, Kyle Orland of Ars Technica believed that Nintendo had missed an opportunity to produce a full-screen gaming tablet using the 2DS's form factor; which would have enabled future games and apps to use the entire screen area (which he estimated to be around the 5-inch range used by phablets), still allow backwards compatibility with games designed for the folding 3DS and DS, and enhance the ability to port existing smartphone games to the platform. However, Orland also noted that introducing such a product could fragment Nintendo's portable gaming ecosystem for existing 3DS users—and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> in the 3DS's life for Nintendo to introduce a successor.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear {{accidents}} Chris Huhne, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, {{wrote to}} Dr Mike Weightman, {{head of the}} HSE's Nuclear Directorate, on March 12, asking for a report 'on {{the implications of the}} situation and the lessons to be learned for the UK nuclear industry. The report is to be delivered within 6 months, with an interim report by mid-May, 'prepared in close cooperation with the International nuclear community and other nuclear safety regulators'. On March 15, Huhne expressed regret that some European politicians were 'rushing to judgement' before assessments had been carried out, and said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> to determine whether the willingness of the private sector to invest in new nuclear plants would be affected. In the wake of the accident the Government was criticised for having colluded with EDF Energy, Areva and Westinghouse in order to manage communications and maintain public support for nuclear power.|$|E

500|$|GCC members {{questioned}} {{the efficacy of}} climate change denial and shifted their message to highlighting the economic costs of proposed greenhouse gas emission regulations and the limited effectiveness of proposals exempting developing nations. In 1995, after the United Nations Climate Change conference in Berlin agreed to negotiate greenhouse gas emission limits, GCC's executive director said the agreement gave [...] "developing countries like China, India and Mexico a free ride" [...] and would [...] "change the relations between sovereign countries and the United Nations.

500|$|The philosopher of {{politics}} Roger D.

In his view, the book [...] "has the indisputable merit of showing that the existence of complex societies is a biological phenomenon. By emphasizing the relationships between animal behavior and population genetics, Wilson compels us to recognize the evolutionary significance of events which social scientists often treat without reference to Darwinian biology." [...] But there was [...] "a large gap" [...] between that and the work of most political scientists, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> to attempt to apply sociobiology directly to human social issues in practice.
