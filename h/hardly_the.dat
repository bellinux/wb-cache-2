25|$|UCLA {{is located}} on the Westside of Los Angeles and is nestled between many several of the most {{affluent}} and desirable communities in southern California: Brentwood, Bel-Air, Beverly Hills and Westwood. Although this area was relatively remote and unsettled at the time of UCLA's founding, decades of growth in the area around campus means that UCLA is <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> suburban location it once was.|$|E
25|$|The {{victory was}} {{important}} {{for the preservation of}} the French Quarter, but it was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> only challenge. Throughout the 1960s, new hotels opened regularly, often replacing large sections of the French Quarter. The VCC approved these structures as long as their designers adhered to prevailing exterior styles. Detractors, fearing that the Vieux Carré's charm might be compromised by the introduction of too many new inns, lobbied successfully for passage in 1969 of a municipal ordinance that forbade new hotels within the district's boundaries. However, the ordinance failed to stop the proliferation of timeshare condominiums and clandestine bed and breakfast inns throughout the French Quarter or high-rise hotels just outside its boundaries. In the 1980s, many long-term residents were driven away by rising rents, as property values rose dramatically with expectations of windfalls from the planned 1984 World's Fair.|$|E

25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} from Australia, Cowdrey decided {{to drop out of}} Oxford so he could {{concentrate}} on his career with Kent and England. No longer an undergraduate he was called up for national service, but discharged after two weeks in the Royal Air Force due to a hereditary disability of rigid toes on which he previously had an operation. This caused some controversy as he promptly made 44, 101, 5, 139, 48, 44, 115 not out and 103 not out, <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> scores of an invalid. The press suggested that strings had been pulled on his behalf and questions were asked in the House of Commons by Gerald Nabarro MP, though he apologised after the true facts became known. Cowdrey received hate mail from the parents of national servicemen, and took great care to answer them personally. He was called up for the Third Test against South Africa, but was battered by the fast bowlers Peter Heine and Neil Adcock making 1 and 50, which he considered to be the worse bruising of his career and Cowdrey pulled out of the series rather than add to his injuries.|$|E
500|$|Catesby and Tresham met at {{the home}} of Tresham's {{brother-in-law}} and cousin, Lord Stourton. [...] In his confession, Tresham claimed that he had asked Catesby if the plot would damn their souls, to which Catesby had replied it would not, and that the plight of England's Catholics required that it be done. [...] Catesby also apparently asked for £2,000, and the use of Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire. [...] Tresham declined both offers (although he did give £100 to Thomas Wintour), and told his interrogators that he had moved his family from Rushton to London in advance of the plot; <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> actions of a guilty man, he claimed.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary press {{reaction}} to 2K and their Barbican performance was mixed but mostly negative. Since then, however, The Observer have {{held up the}} Barbican show as the model of a pop performance. [...] "At one unfortunately memorable Stereophonics gig ...", the paper said, [...] "the extent of Richard Jones' showmanship was to play his bass while standing on a rug.... this is <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> pyjama-clad KLF, horns strapped to their heads, whizzing around the Barbican in wheelchairs with Zodiac Mindwarp in a pulpit and hundreds of sacked Liverpool dockers yelling [...] "Fuck the millennium!" [...] at the tops of their voices ..." [...] Likewise, a 1999 feature on Drummond and Cauty in The Irish Times reported their millennium activities with some warmth. [...] "As {{a critique of the}} sponsor-saturated multi-million pound Millennium Dome," [...] the editorial ran, [...] "the 'people's pyramid' is unsurpassed." ...|$|E
500|$|In a brief dissent, Evans {{argued that}} Oppenheimer's {{security}} clearance should be reinstated. He {{pointed out that}} most of the AEC charges had been {{in the hands of the}} AEC when it cleared Oppenheimer in 1947, and that [...] "to deny him clearance now for what he was cleared for in 1947, when we must know he is less of a security risk now than he was then, seems to be <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> procedure to be adopted in a free country." [...] Evans said that his association with Chevalier did not indicate disloyalty, and that he did not hinder development of the H-bomb. Evans said he personally thought that [...] "our failure to clear Dr. Oppenheimer will be a black mark on the escutcheon of our country," [...] and expressed concern about the effect an improper decision might have on the country's scientific development.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Cruz {{appeared}} in the Christmas film Noel as Nina, the girlfriend of Paul Walker's character and as Mia in the romantic drama, Head in the Clouds, set in the 1930s. Head in the Clouds performed poorly at the box office. For Head in the Clouds, Bruce Birkland of Jam! Canoe said, [...] "The story feels forced and the performances dreary, with the notable exception of Cruz, {{who seems to be}} in a different film {{from the rest of the}} cast." [...] Desson Thompson of The Washington Post was more critical; his comment about the character's [...] "pronounced limp" [...] was that [...] "Cruz (<b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> world's greatest actress) can't even perform without looking fake". She also starred in Sergio Castellitto's melodrama Don't Move. Cruz, who learned Italian for the role, earned critical acclaim for her performance and won the David di Donatello. She was also awarded the European Film Award for Best Actress for the film in 2004.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} for the DVD single, Alex Castle of IGN gave the music {{a score of}} 9 out of 10, writing [...] "the thing sounds fantastic" [...] and that the song is [...] "pretty good". However, he {{admitted}} that he [...] "would probably not have been particularly impressed" [...] if he hadn't seen the music video. James Oldham of NME described it as [...] "magnificent, sultry, pneumatic trip-soul ballad, which gently blooms into a magical garden of fluttering harps and shivering strings." [...] He also added that the track [...] "is no mere soundtrack" [...] for the video. AllMusic's Heather Phares gave the DVD single four out of five stars, considering it [...] "a necessary addition to the collections of dedicated Bjork fans". Douglas Wolk of CMJ New Music Monthly also gave the single a positive review, commending its B-sides and writing it [...] "was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> most striking piece at the time—but the tune turns out to have been something of a sleeper." ...|$|E
500|$|Sitting in the {{audience}} after serving as a guest mentor, Twain herself was moved to tears listening to Lynche's rendition. [...] Eric Ditzian of MTV News desired for the contestant to tap into his R and soul music roots further and concluded, [...] "Last night's performance was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> stuff of Luther Vandross, as Randy Jackson and Simon Cowell maintained, but it's a comparison that Mike should take to heart." [...] Leslie Grey Steeler of The Palm Beach Post acknowledged Lynche was usually cheesy in his performances, but favored his rendition of [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing", saying, [...] "I loved it" [...] and calling it [...] "awesome". Mary T. Kelly of Salon.com commented, [...] "Big Mike went back to good, ole country basics and sang the song sweet, simple and pure. Tammy Tyree would have been proud." [...] Lynche {{was placed in the}} bottom three that week, and later eliminated.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{found some}} of Stargate's {{succeeding}} works {{a replica of}} Irreplaceables musical formula. Sheffield commented that, in the song [...] "Tattoo" [...] by Sparks, the team [...] "have no shame about churning out 'Irreplaceable' replicants forever", reprising the acoustic guitar-drum loop formula. The New York Times music critic Kelefa Sanneh deemed it [...] "sounds like a cousin" [...] of [...] "Irreplaceable". The release of R singer Chris Brown's 2007 single [...] "With You" [...] produced similar impressions: Sheffield, in his review for Brown's album, noted that [...] "Stargate {{was just trying to}} roll out 'Irreplaceable' one more time". Hillary Crosley of Billboard magazine wrote that [...] "With You" [...] "leans a bit too heavily" [...] toward [...] "Irreplaceable". Stylus Magazine also noted that Rihanna's Stargate produced single, [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] was a rehash of Ne-Yo and Stargate's previous works saying, [...] "Here you've got the 'Sexy Love' drums, the 'Irreplaceable' strum, and a bit of the synth and chorus melody from 'So Sick'... is <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> new twist all these old bits need to sound fresh." ...|$|E

500|$|Also seeing {{improvement}} was Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad, commenting [...] "Tonight's episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science, {{and this is}} the first time I can really say I'm looking forward to the next episode. It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment." [...] Less impressed was Noel Murray of The Onions A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, [...] "'The Arrival' was the weirdest episode of Fringe yet–a deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't think of any questions that [...] "The Arrival" [...] satisfactorily answered–not even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The shock and awe factor of [...] "The Arrival" [...] was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be." ...|$|E
500|$|The death scenes {{attracted}} over 250 complaints, 154 {{of them to}} {{the television}} watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. In the wake of the complaints, BBC insiders had admitted that the scenes [...] "clearly disturbed" [...] some of the viewers, but also defended their decision to show the scene as it would show the audience [...] "the kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in the fight against terrorism." [...] The Broadcasting Standards Commission stated that despite the shocking content; [...] "in the context was acceptable and important for the later narrative," [...] however the watchdog still criticised the BBC for failing to warn viewers of the violence to come. Garrett refuted this, stating: [...] "Not only was there a clear warning before the programme began, but for anyone who missed that, {{the subject matter of the}} episode (a conspiracy to stir up inter-racial violence perpetrated by a man who clearly beat his wife) was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> stuff of which chirpy little bucolic fantasies are made." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to Galileo's {{construction}} of {{his version of}} a telescope, Thomas Harriot, an English mathematician and explorer, had already used what he dubbed a [...] "perspective tube" [...] to observe the moon. Reporting his observations, Harriot noted only [...] "strange spottednesse" [...] in the waning of the crescent, but was ignorant to the cause. Galileo, {{due in part to}} his artistic training and the knowledge of chiaroscuro, had understood the patterns of light and shadow were, in fact, topographical markers. While not being the only one to observe the moon through a telescope, Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters. In his study, he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> first [...] "planet", an [...] "eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian", as put forth by Dante.|$|E

500|$|... "Oceania" [...] was [...] "spoilt by some overenthusiastic vocal whoopings", {{according}} to David Hooper from BBC Music. The Guardians writer David Peschek {{said that when}} the singer sings in the song, [...] "choral swoops [...] like fireworks behind her". AllMusic's Heather Phares noted that the song, along with Medúllas lead single [...] "Who Is It", [...] "have an alien quality {{that is all the}} stranger considering that nearly all of their source material is human (except for the odd keyboard or two)". Dominique Leone of Pitchfork thought [...] "Oceania" [...] was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> most obvious choice for a promotional single release, despite its [...] "bizarre, swooping soprano lines and cyclical chord progression outlined by a chorus of Wyatt vocal samples". Jeremy D. Larson from Time magazine provided a mixed review to the song, stating that it was the best Olympic theme song, but during the Olympics performance, [...] "when she sang 'Every pearl is a lynx is a girl' we think you could hear the world collectively sigh, 'Where's Celine Dion?'". In 2005, the song was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 47th Grammy Awards but lost out to Norah Jones' [...] "Sunrise".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to hold your breath on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a solid example of the show’s mid-period form". However, {{he noted that the}} episode {{is not one of the}} series bests, unlike the way many fans portray it—due largely to the fact that [...] "it allows us to see what it would be like if Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple"—and that [...] "the episode’s monster is a little hard to figure out". Other reviews were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more mixed review, writing [...] "after {{watching}} 'Arcadia', I feel like I just had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not bad, but <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> feast I have come to expect." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris, despite praising David Duchovny's performance during the scenes wherein he [...] "rebels against the rules", called the episode's main villains [...] "stereotypes of self-indulgent, insulated suburbanites." ...|$|E
