5|$|The Other <b>Hand</b> <b>reached</b> number 13 on the 2009 Sunday Times bestseller list, and was {{the only}} {{literary}} title on the list without a Richard and Judy Book Club recommendation, a literary award or a film adaptation. It also topped The New York Times Best Seller list for paperback trade fiction in 2010. The novel was nominated at the 2008 Costa Book Awards, though lost to The Secret Scripture by Sebastian Barry. It was nominated for the 2009 Commonwealth Writers' Prize as the best book originating from Europe and South Asia, but lost to Unaccustomed Earth by Jhumpa Lahiri. In 2010, The Other Hand was longlisted for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, nominated by Cleveland Public Library, Seattle Public Library and Dunedin Public Libraries, New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Not to be outdone, Harriman now {{came up with}} a crafty plan: Buy a {{controlling}} interest in the Northern Pacific and use its power on the Burlington to place friendly directors upon its board. On May 3, 1901, Harriman began his stock raid which would become known as the Northern Pacific Corner. By {{the end of the day}} he was short just 40,000shares of common stock. Harriman placed an order to cover this, but was overridden by his broker, Jacob Schiff, of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Hill, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>reached</b> the vacationing Morgan in Italy and managed to place an order for 150,000shares of common stock. Though Harriman might be able to control the preferred stock, Hill knew the company bylaws allowed for the holders of the common stock to vote to retire the preferred.|$|E

He also invented many devices, including a Roman numeral computer called THROBAC, juggling machines, and a flame-throwing trumpet. One of his more humorous devices was a box kept on his desk called the [...] "Ultimate Machine", based on an idea by Marvin Minsky. Otherwise featureless, the box possessed a single switch on its side. When the switch was flipped, {{the lid of the}} box opened and a mechanical <b>hand</b> <b>reached</b> out, flipped off the switch, then retracted back inside the box. Renewed interest in the [...] "Ultimate Machine" [...] has emerged on YouTube and Thingiverse. In addition, he built a device that could solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle.|$|E
50|$|The {{realization}} of this vision started when Frankl met Dr. Stephen R. Covey, educator, businessman, and bestselling {{author of the}} The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. They {{decided it was time}} to move past conversation. Covey contacted world-renowned sculptor Gary Lee Price and asked him to sculpt the concept of the Statue of Responsibility. Gary, an award-winning sculptor and Fellow of the National Sculpture Society, envisioned a statue depicting a <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> up for help with another <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> down in a clasping position. The hands are symbolic of Responsibility: in different times of our lives we are the <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> up for help or the <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> down to lift others.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} the after-reach hazard using a power press simulator. The after-reach hazard occurs when a worker reaches into the point of operation on a power press after initiating the downstroke of the press ram. The <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> capabilities of industrial power press operators were measured to quantify <b>hand</b> <b>reach</b> speed and to determine variables which may affect after-reach movement times. The results of this study identified three variables which may be important in characterizing a worker's ability to make rapid <b>hand</b> <b>reach</b> movements: age, gender, and the location of the dual palm button workstation. Another key finding was that male workers, 30 years of age and younger, had the fastest <b>hand</b> <b>reach</b> speed of all groups tested and appear to be at the greatest risk of sustaining a traumatic injury due to the after-reach hazard...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} a system with two-link arm can obtain <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> {{movement}} to a target object projected on a visual sensor by reinforcement learning using a layered neural network. The reinforcement signal, which is an only signal from the environment, {{is given to the}} system only when the <b>hand</b> <b>reaches</b> the target object. The neural network computes two joint torques from visual sensory signals, joint angles, and joint angular velocities considering the arm dynamics. It is known that the trajectory of the voluntary movementofhuman <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> is almost straight, and the hand velocitychanges like bell-shape. Although there are some exceptions, the properties of the trajectories obtained by the reinforcement learning are somewhat similar to the experimental result of the human <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> movement. Key Words: Direct-Vision-Based Reinforcement Learning, Neural Network, Hand-Eye Coordination, Reaching Task, Trajectory Planning...|$|R

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that grasping with the left hand is more vulnerable to visual size illusions than grasping with the right hand. The present study investigated whether this increased sensitivity of the left hand for visual context extends to reaching. Left- and right-handed participants reached for targets embedded in two different visual contexts with either left or right hands. Visual context was manipulated by presenting targets either in a blank field or within an array of placeholders marking possible target locations. Regardless of handedness, the presence of placeholders affected left hand, but not right <b>hand,</b> <b>reaching</b> by improving end-point accuracy and reducing movement speed. Furthermore, left <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> was more accurate for far than near targets, whereas right <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> showed the opposite pattern. We discuss two possible hemispheric lateralization accounts of these findings...|$|R
60|$|After I {{had eaten}} I was greatly invigorated, but feeling {{the need of}} rest I {{stretched}} out upon the silks and was soon asleep. I must have slept several hours, as it was dark when I awoke, and I was very cold.

Suddenly a <b>hand</b> <b>reached</b> out and pulled the fur over me, shortly afterwards adding another to my covering.|$|E
