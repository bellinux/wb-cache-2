5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but <b>eventually</b> <b>we</b> found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and <b>eventually</b> <b>we</b> all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E

The principal horn, Alan Civil, recalled, [...] "We did about eighty percent modern and twenty percent classical. The awful tragedy, for the orchestra, was that <b>eventually</b> <b>we</b> {{were not able to}} play the standard classics. We could sight-read the most fearsome contemporary piece, but a Brahms symphony – embarrassing!" [...] The bassoon player William Waterhouse who joined the BBC SO from the LSO found the BBC's repertory refreshing, but the music making less impressive: [...] "There were no potboilers, but also, I'm afraid, no world-ranking soloists either." ...|$|E

[...] In 1998, Radio and TV host Bryan Burton-Lewis explained [...] "In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase. They put their life into being X fans: they dress like it, they breathe it."

He said, [...] "you see Kelly doing her thing and then me on the other side doing mine. <b>Eventually</b> <b>we</b> come together just like how we recorded the song. It's all about sharing the love from this record and making a big party". These reflections and more behind the scenes footage were revealed in the video clip [...] "Making of When Love Takes Over" [...] which was uploaded to Guetta's official YouTube channel on 1 June 2009. The music video itself premiered on 8 June 2009 on Guetta's YouTube channel. The video premiered after the European and United States digital release but just before the single's UK digital release on 10 June 2009.|$|E

[...] A few weeks later, he wrote to Maund again: with the royal charter in place, [...] "whatever [...] does now will not affect {{the fact that when}} there is a white occupation of the country our concession will come into force provided the English and not Boers get the country". On 29 October 1889, nearly a year to the day after the signing of the Rudd Concession, Rhodes's chartered company, the British South Africa Company, was officially granted its royal charter by Queen Victoria. The concession's legitimacy was now safeguarded by the charter and, by extension, the British Crown, making it practically unassailable.|$|E

500|$|For Filipinos, {{music and}} dancing {{is said to}} be a way of life. Natives of the Philippines are {{reported}} to have a tendency to [...] "sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations". Thomeczeck stated, [...] "The Filipinos love music and they love to sing and dance. Whatever they are in a natural way, they can continue that habit in prison." [...] Despite other colleagues' enthusiasm about the dancing, chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing, as CPDRC was undermanned. Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center's Operations Manual, Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen. [...] "As a jail officer, I got worried when I saw it", Rubio commented. The inmates were not fond of the idea either, pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison. Prisoners eventually agreed to dance, but admitted that the routines took awhile to master. [...] "It was difficult at first, but <b>eventually</b> <b>we</b> inmates got used to it", inmate Mario Benito revealed. [...] The program began as an experiment and, after six months, prison chiefs concluded that it was a successful one.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then <b>eventually</b> <b>we</b> kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E

[...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "It takes everything that's made Pixar shorthand for animation excellence -- strong characters, tight pacing, spot-on voice casting, a warm sense of humor and visuals that are pure, pixilated bliss -- and carries them to the next stage." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "The truest measure of the movie is that <b>eventually</b> <b>we</b> forget we're watching a bunch of vehicles with faces and start to think of them as individual characters. It's quite an accomplishment, and perhaps one only possible by Pixar." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "What's surprising about this supremely engaging film is the source of its curb appeal: It has heart." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's the latest concoction from the geniuses at Pixar, probably the most inventive of the Computer Generated Imagery shop -- and the film's great fun, if well under the level of the first Toy Story." [...] Jessica Reaves of the Chicago Tribune gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying [...] "While it's a technically perfect movie, its tone is too manic, its characters too jaded and, in the end, its story too empty to stand up to expectations." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "While Cars may cross the finish line ahead of any of 2006's other animated films, it's several laps behind its Pixar siblings." ...|$|E

But I was totally wrong. And <b>eventually,</b> <b>we</b> morphed into the monster we were addressing."

2500|$|... "Like the {{previous}} game's hotel sequence, the cruise ship segment is impressive {{because of how}} it exploits our perception of both the game's rules and our character's surroundings. As the boat lurches downward, we have to maneuver Drake upwards through hallways and staterooms that tilt sideways, climbing up through doors and over bed frames. Our horizontal axis turns vertical as a wall of water surges towards us and suicidal pirates continue to attack, forcing us to quickly adapt to this new perspective. <b>Eventually</b> <b>we</b> fall into a grand chamber whose skylight is fully submerged. The art deco decor, underwater lighting, and skewed angles recall both Bioshock and The Poseidon Adventure. Sadly there are no cameos from Red Buttons or Shelley Winters.

2500|$|For The Veronicas, Jessica and Lisa {{wanted to}} create a [...] "progressive pop" [...] album drawing on {{inspiration}} from genres such as blues, trip hop, rock and roll, grunge, classical music, classical rock, pop and rap. Wanting to make an album which differed from their more familiar pop rock sound, Lisa said that this album would be [...] "eclectic" [...] and not [...] "predictable in any way." [...] Lisa said [...] "We go from something like “Sanctified,” which, to be honest, wasn’t written with the idea of being a Veronicas track. That was very much written when I was in Nashville and I was immersing myself in the blues and roots-y, swampy soul singing. Then we were working with Billy Corgan we did a “fuck you” kind of track “Did You Miss Me,” which we rap on, which is a completely different thing. We get poppy with “Cold,” and bring it back to an acoustic song like “You and Me” which could be considered a little bit folk-y, country" [...] " [...] Lisa said [...] "I remember we really got into trip hop and decided we were going to make a trip hop album. I then got on a bluesy-rock-swampy-soul kick after we'd spent some time in Nashville. <b>Eventually</b> <b>we</b> came back around to songs like Cruel – the stuff people identify with The Veronicas." [...] In an interview with Stephanie Anderson of BuzzFeed, the duo elaborated on the change from their first two albums, with Jessica saying: [...] "If things were one dimensional on the first and second record, like, we would say exactly how we felt, and it was all just, total passion, we really didn’t overthink it, we just put down what we were feeling, [...] is more, 3D-4D...

2500|$|He {{resigned}} from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel ("It wasn’t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy" [...] DeLillo has said of this time), and began work on his first novel. Reflecting on {{the early days of}} his writing career, he remarked: [...] "I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. I was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month. And I was becoming a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time." [...] His first novel, Americana, was written over the course of four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. Americana concerned [...] "a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture". DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback re-printing. Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he admitted, [...] "I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and <b>eventually</b> <b>we</b> all did some work on the book and it was published." [...] Later still, DeLillo still felt a degree of surprise at Americana being published, noting [...] "I was working on my first novel, Americana, for two years before I ever realized that I could be a writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because I knew that there were elements that I simply didn't know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn’t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn't have a representative. I didn’t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing." ...|$|E
