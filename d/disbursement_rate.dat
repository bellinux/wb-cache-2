5000|$|In 2017 the {{military}} government has budgeted more than 76 billion baht for SRT infrastructure investments. The funding {{is to be used}} for double-track rail expansions, an extension of Bangkok's elevated railway, and construction of bridges, fences, and track improvements. In the fiscal year ending 30 September 2016, however, the SRT had managed to disburse only 53 percent of its allotted investment budget of 60 billion baht. This compares with an average <b>disbursement</b> <b>rate</b> of 80 percent by Thailand's 55 state-owned enterprises (SOEs). <b>Disbursement</b> <b>rate</b> is seen as an indicator of efficient management. [...] "If you look at the SRT they are a bit like a patient in care and everyone is saying to him 'you are the future' and trying to kick him out of bed when he is still moaning and groaning," [...] said Ruth Banomyong, a logistics and transport expert at Thammasat University.|$|E
5000|$|From 1960 to 2009, Canada {{committed}} {{a total of}} US$1.2 billion (constant 2008 dollars) in bilateral (country-to-country) development assistance to the D.R. Congo, of which $0.9 bn. (76%) was actually disbursed. This was a lower <b>disbursement</b> <b>rate</b> than for Canada's aid to all recipient countries, 87% ($99bn. out of $113 bn.). [...] Although exact multilateral aid figures (to the African Development Bank, International Development Association, various UN agencies, etc.) from donor to recipient countries are not reported, the OECD has imputed these values, and they suggest that {{a higher proportion of}} Canadian aid to the DRC has gone through the latter channels than for most donor countries (29% vs. 26%). Total OECD Development Assistance Committee disbursements exceeded commitments by 13% over these five decades mainly because commitment figures were not reported until the year 1966 (and imputed multilateral data began in 1975). Canada reportedly provided US$10,000 in grants to Congo (Kinshasa) in each of the years 1960 and 1964 (approximately 0.1% of the total aid), in addition to financing faculty posts and university bursaries, and providing twelve Canadian technical assistance staff in the field of education. [...] Although only 7% of total Canadian bilateral aid to the DRC has been in the form of loans, Canada has until recently carried higher tied aid ratios than most OECD DAC members, such that {{a large portion of the}} total Canadian aid volume was spent on Canadian goods and services; only in the last decade has the tying status declined, from 75% in 2000, to just 2% in 2009.|$|E
40|$|FDI inflows have {{substantially}} {{declined in}} recent years, ignited by the Asian financial crisis. A number of foreign-invested firms withdrew from Vietnam. Long before the FDI retreat happened, {{the number of}} jobs in the foreign-invested firms had been small. The FDI sector has experienced a substantial trade deficit. The <b>disbursement</b> <b>rate</b> is low. The prices of utilities and land-use right are high. The personal income tax rate applied to foreigners is ranked top in the Asian region. The auto industry is near bankruptcy. These are strong indications that the FDI policy is not right. Academia, business community, international agencies, and foreign governments have carried out numerous studies on FDI in Vietnam and a number of host countries in Asia and South America. Long lists of recommendations have been sent to the Vietnamese government for consideration. They point out numerous problems that Vietnam encounters: FDI has been concentrated in import-substitution, capital-intensive industries rather than export-oriented and labor-intensive industries; the FDI legislation is vague, restricting and outdated; and market access is rather limited. After a decade, Vietnam is still struggling to determine what FDI policy is right for the country...|$|E
40|$|Meeting {{the goal}} of {{universal}} access to modern energy services by 2030 will require dramatically increasing, as well as re-orienting, the current flows of energy investments in developing countries. While the mobilization of such capital is consistently presented as a major challenge, other {{issues such as the}} predictability and volatility of financing flows and absorption capacity will also play a crucial role. This paper examines the issues of predictability and absorption of development finance {{in the context of the}} U. N. "Sustainable Energy for All" initiative, by presenting analysis of the critical points that could limit the effectiveness of committed and future funds. In doing so, we also present analysis of the predictability of the financial assistance for the energy sector and how it relates to the funding in other sectors. We observe that the energy sector is characterized by lower than average <b>disbursement</b> <b>rates,</b> with considerable variability between countries, and is well correlated with government effectiveness figures and the <b>disbursements</b> <b>rates</b> of other sectors...|$|R
40|$|Summaries This {{study is}} an {{analysis}} of Danish Balance of Payments Support (BOP) covering the period 1988 – 94. This aid instrument was not as significant in Denmark as in other like minded donor countries. Danish BOP was mainly used in a residual manner to keep up <b>disbursement</b> <b>rates</b> and promote procurement from Danish suppliers. Commodity Import Support (CIS) {{was by far the}} dominant modality used, although fundamental changes have been on the way since 1991. Nonetheless, despite the macroeconomic nature of BOP assistance existing evaluation studies and reviews have focused on microeconomic and administrative issues. Very little can therefore at this stage be concluded about the macroeconomic impact of Danish BOP aid...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which aid disbursement delays could be used as an indicator of the aid unpredictability and absorptive capacity in recipient countries. Since many recipient countries are dependent on aid, disbursement delays might matter for its effectiveness. The emphasis is put on the so-called pipeline approach, according to which, in the short run, disbursement constraints may lead to huge delays and weak <b>rates</b> of aid <b>disbursement</b> relative to commitments. After the literature review on disbursement delays, we use the framework of programmable aid to run some econometric estimations through a dynamic model, an ARDL, for a panel of 48 African countries during the period of 1975 – 2008. We find disbursement constraints mainly at the short-run level, while the main donor's specific factors seem to be the selectivity and the degree of aid fragmentation. <b>Disbursement</b> <b>rates</b> and rhythms are also influenced by the economic performance and governance quality of the recipient countries and the share of grants in aid modalities. Bilateral donors are found to under-perform in comparison with multilateral donors in terms of the rhythm of aid disbursement. Foreign aid, absorptive capacity, disbursement delays, panel ARDL...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss aid and the {{environment}} in Ghana. Our analysis indicates that expenditure {{by the government of}} Ghana has increased consistently since 2000, with seven sectors weakly linked to the environment taking about 78. 9 per cent of all government expenditure. Also, the rate of increase of environmental expenditures has not kept pace with overall expenditure. External aid disbursement to environmental sectors has expanded and efforts are being made by the development partners to steer more grants instead of loans to environment-related activities. A 19 -sector analysis of data from the AidData dataset from 1993 to 2009 indicates that the environmental sector ranks 11 th in terms of project numbers, commitments and disbursements. A worrying phenomenon is the average <b>disbursement</b> <b>rate</b> of 27. 8 per cent which is lower than the average rate of disbursements for all the 19 sectors (29 per cent), indicating the poor implementation of environmental projects. Also, cross-cutting issues such as climate change, biodiversity and desertification appear to be important only for the environmental sectors even though some of these, such as education, can be used to combat environmental degradation. Poor commitment of aid to the environmental sectors reflects the views of the development partners that the non-environmental sectors require more aid than the environmental sectors, even though donors recognize that non-environmental sectors have environmental impacts and are addressing them in their activities...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. IDLC Finance limited one of renowned non-banking financial institution in Bangladesh. It started its operation in 1985 {{and it is the}} pioneer financial institution in Bangladesh. I have done my temporary position in IDLC Finance Limited Consumer division Department in Mirpur branch. Being an intern in the Consumer division, I got the chance to perceive how the Consumer Division functions with Corporate Division to accomplish targets. Later, I will talk about the different products and services of IDLC finance limited also talk about different department and their basic works. I will also talk about the consumer’s behavior process, I will compare the <b>disbursement</b> <b>rate</b> between 2013 and 2014 whether it expand or diminish. Not only that I will discuss about the number of consumers which is very important because it will show you whether the consumer rate is growing or not. Later I will show most recent couple of year’s portfolios of IDLC Finance limited. In my report, I could also provide the latest interest rate and the overall information about this Company. IDLC provides best services with very short period of time. That makes them top position from any other NBFI and banks. They maintain their position by giving very fast and smooth service. In future they come up with new technology, strategy, and more skill man power so that they can hold the number one position in the market. I belief that my report would give an exhaustive understanding about the IDLC finance limited and also about the consumer division. With constrained access to information because of classification, I have attempted to give as much data as being conceivable about the works including Consumer Division in IDLC Finance Limited. Md.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{accurate}} {{forecast of}} global demand {{is essential to}} stabilize the market for artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and to ensure access to high-quality, life-saving medications at the lowest sustainable prices by avoiding underproduction and excessive overproduction, each of which can have negative consequences for the availability of affordable drugs. A robust forecast requires {{an understanding of the}} resources available to support procurement of these relatively expensive antimalarials, in particular from the Global Fund, at present the single largest source of ACT funding. Methods Predictive regression models estimating the timing and <b>rate</b> of <b>disbursements</b> from the Global Fund to recipient countries for each malaria grant were derived using a repeated split-sample procedure intended to avoid over-fitting. Predictions were compared against actual disbursements in a group of validation grants, and forecasts of ACT procurement extrapolated from disbursement predictions were evaluated against actual procurement in two sub-Saharan countries. Results Quarterly forecasts were correlated highly with actual smoothed <b>disbursement</b> <b>rates</b> (r = 0. 987, p Conclusion This analysis derived predictive regression models that successfully forecasted disbursement patterning for individual Global Fund malaria grants. These results indicate the utility of this approach for demand forecasting of ACT and, potentially, for other commodities procured using funding from the Global Fund. Further validation using data from other countries in different regions and environments will be necessary to confirm its generalizability. </p...|$|R
40|$|Even {{though both}} {{contract}} failure and consumer control theories of nonprofits stress {{the need for}} monitoring {{the performance of the}} firms, these models fail to offer any guidelines on how to do so. In general, the performance of poverty-reduction projects are assessed on amounts of loan <b>disbursement,</b> repayment <b>rates,</b> area of coverage, and financial sustainability. However, performance assessment based on the efficiency of service delivery has in the past been ignored even though the importance of efficient service delivery in poverty-reduction programs is well recognized in the literature and in the theories of nonprofits. Due to this specific lacuna, benchmarking in the aspects of efficient service delivery has never been applied. Based on primary data collected from 78 villages in Bangladesh from September to December 2009, this article develops a two-dimensional multi-item service delivery index to compare the efficiency of participating organizations in the stated programs in order to set industry benchmark values for each item of the index. 26 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background: Since its {{founding}} in 2002, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund) has become the dominant multilateral health financier in low- and middle-income countries. The health impact of the Global Fund remains unknown because existing evaluations measure intermediate outcomes or do not account for preexisting and counterfactual trends. Methods: We conducted an econometric analysis of data from all countries eligible to receive Global Fund grants from 1995 to 2010, prior to and during the Global Fund's activities. We analyzed three outcomes: all-cause adult (15 - 59 years), all-cause under-five, and malaria-specific under-five mortality. Our main exposure was a continuous longitudinal measure of Global Fund disbursements per capita. We used panel fixed effect regressions, and analyzed mortality trends controlling for health spending, health worker density (a measure of health system capacity), gross domestic product, urbanization, and country fixed-effects. Results and discussion: We find that following Global Fund <b>disbursements,</b> adult mortality <b>rate</b> declined by 1. 4 % per year faster with every $ 10 per capita increase in disbursements (p∈=∈ 0. 005). Similarly, malaria-specific under-five mortality declined by 6. 9 % per year faster (p∈=∈ 0. 033) with every $ 10 high per capita Global Fund disbursements. However, we find no association between Global Fund support and all-cause under-five mortality. These findings were consistent after subanalyses by baseline HIV prevalence, adjusting for effects of concurrent health aid from other donors, and varying time lags between funding and mortality changes. Conclusions: Grants from the Global Fund {{are closely related to}} accelerated reductions in all-cause adult mortality and malaria-specific under-five mortality. However, up to 2010 the Global Fund has not measurably contributed to reducing all-cause under-five mortality...|$|R
6000|$|When the {{parliament}} reassembled in 1867, parties and groups were [...] curiously distributed. The two great bodies were the regular [...] {{supporters of the}} Tory ministry, and those grouped around us who [...] had been expelled. The first {{did not know what}} course they would [...] have to take; that depended on the secret counsels of another [...] mind. To keep to the drapeau was the guiding motive, as has been [...] since the creed and practice of Peel were subverted by the [...] opposite principles of Disraeli, who on a franchise question had [...] his peer colleagues at his feet. Besides these, other divisions [...] had to be recognised. The Salisbury secession from the government, [...] supported by Sir W. Heathcote and Beresford Hope, was high in [...] character, but absolutely insignificant in numbers. There was [...] Lowe, so great among the Adullamites of 1866, but almost alone [...] among them in the singleness and strength of his opposition to [...] reform. There was the bulk of the Adullamite body, unable to place [...] themselves in declared opposition to the liberal mass, but many of [...] them disposed to tamper with the question, and to look kindly on [...] the tory government as the power which would most surely keep down [...] any enlargement of the franchise to its minimum. It would be idle [...] to discuss the successive plans submitted by the government to the [...] House of Commons with an unexampled rapidity. The governing idea [...] of the man who directed the party seemed to be not so much to [...] consider what ought to be proposed and carried, as to make sure [...] that, whatever it was, it should be proposed and carried by those [...] now in power. The bill on which the House of Commons eventually [...] proceeded was a measure, I should suppose, without precedent or [...] parallel, as, on the other hand it was, for the purpose of the [...] hour, and as the work of a government in a decided minority, an [...] extraordinary stroke of parliamentary success. Our position, on [...] the other hand, was this: (1) We felt that if household suffrage [...] were to be introduced into the boroughs, it ought to be a real [...] household suffrage. (2) The existing state of our legislation, [...] under which a large majority of the householders made no [...] <b>disbursement</b> of <b>rates,</b> but paid them without distinction in their [...] rent, showed that a bill professedly for household suffrage, but [...] taking no notice of compounding, would be in the first place a [...] lottery, and in the second an imposture. Some towns would have [...] large enfranchisement, some none at all, and no principle but the [...] accidental state of local law would determine on which side of the [...] line any town was to be found. And the aggregate result would be [...] ludicrously small as a measure of enfranchisement. Of such a [...] measure we could not approve. We did not wish to make at once so [...] wide a change as that involved in a genuine household suffrage [...] (always in our minds involving county as well as town), and we [...] could not fairly separate ourselves from Bright on such a point. [...] (3) So we adhered to our idea of an extension, considerable but [...] not violent, and performing all it promised.|$|R
