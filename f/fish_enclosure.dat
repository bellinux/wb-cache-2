Obvious suppression of phytoplankton biomass (PB) only occurred during the first 14 days regardless of the fish stocked. Adding <b>fish</b> to the <b>enclosure</b> clearly alters phytoplankton community structure and introducing piscivorous <b>fish</b> to an <b>enclosure</b> stocked with filter-feeding fish changed the relative densities of dominant algae species.

Each enclosure measured 21 m x 21 m with an approximate net height of 3. 5 m. The stocking densities per cubic meter were 1 fingerling for Thai sharputi monoculture (enclosure 1), and 2 fingerlings for the polyculture systems (enclosure 2 and 3).

40|$|International audienceSedimentation is a {{key process}} in lake functioning, and plays an {{important}} role in nutrient and carbon cycles at both regional and global scales. Several biological processes have been shown as quantitatively affecting sedimentation, but very few works have tried to relate the structure of aquatic communities and the quality of sinking organic matter. We tested in a mesocosm study how food-web structure affects quantitatively and qualitatively sedimentation in eutrophic systems. We carried out a long-term experiment (14 months) in large replicated enclosures either dominated by planktivorous fish or fishless. Food-web structure modified the specific composition of zooplankton communities and phytoplankton biomass, as expected by the trophic cascade theory. Planktivorous fish had a strong positive effect on gross sedimentation rate, but the fraction of suspended particulate material that sank only slightly differed between treatments. The density of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) was a good descriptor of sedimentation rate, highlighting the key role of these polysaccharidic particles in sinking processes. In <b>fish</b> <b>enclosures,</b> sediment elemental ratios were positively related to seston elemental ratios, suggesting the dominance of algal sedimentation. In fishless mesocosms, N/P ratios of sinking material and of zooplankton showed a strong negative relationship, indicative of a major contribution of zooplankton-egested material to sinking particles. Analyses of free lipids in sediments confirmed the distinct origins of sinking material.

The project began in 2005 and was completed in March 2010. The seasonally flooded depressions in the Inner Niger Delta (known as mares) represent a critical fishery resource for the inhabitants of the village of Komio, and at present, access is open to all residents. A proposal to build stocked <b>fish</b> <b>enclosures</b> in the main village mare presents potential benefits and risks.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to {{identify}} problems, find general patterns, and extract recommendations for successful management using nontraditional biomanipulation to improve water quality. There are many obstacles that prevent traditional biomanipulation from achieving expectations: expending largely to remove planktivorous fish, reduction of external and internal phosphorus, and macrophyte re-establishment. Grazing pressure from large zooplankton is decoupled in hypereutrophic waters where cyanobacterial blooms flourish. The original idea of biomanipulation (increased zooplankton grazing rate {{as a tool for}} controlling nuisance algae) is not the only means of controlling nuisance algae via biotic manipulations. Stocking phytoplanktivorous fish may be considered to be a nontraditional method; however, it can be an effective management tool to control nuisance algal blooms in tropical lakes that are highly productive and unmanageable to reduce nutrient concentrations to low levels. Although small enclosures increase spatial overlap between predators and prey, leading to overestimates of the impact of predation, microcosm and whole-lake experiments have revealed similar community responses to major factors that regulate lake communities, such as nutrients and planktivorous <b>fish.</b> Both <b>enclosure</b> experiments and large-scale observations revealed that the initial phytoplankton community composition greatly impacted the success of biomanipulation. Long-term observations in Lake Donghu and Lake Qiandaohu have documented that silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) (two filter-feeding planktivorous species commonly used in management) can suppress Microcystis blooms efficiently. The introduction of silver and bighead carp could be an effective management technique in eutrophic systems that lack macrozooplankton. We confirmed that nontraditional biomanipulation is only appropriate if the primary aim is to reduce nuisance blooms of large algal species, which cannot be controlled effectively by large herbivorous zooplankton. Alternatively, this type of biomanipulation did not work efficiently in less eutrophic systems where nanophytoplankton dominated...|$|R

May through October survival was 0. 8 - 1 1. 5 %. We assessed stresses associated with transportation and handling by holding <b>fish</b> in small <b>enclosures</b> 5 - 10 d poststocking. Enclosure mortality varied greatly (18. 9 - 63. 5 %). and because enclosures inadequately mimicked the reservoir environment, transportation and handling mortality were likely overestimated. Mortality resulting from resident piscivores was calculated via population estimates and poststocking sampling. Predation on age- 0 saugeyes was minimal during poststocking sampling, ranging from 0 to 28. 3 % of the stocked population. Saugeye survival was statistically unrelated to zooplankton or ichthyoplankton (i. e., larval gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum) densities, although both ichthyoplankton density at stocking and saugeye growth showed positive trends with saugeye survival. Ichthyoplankton avail-ability likely influences growth and survival of saugeyes; therefore, saugeye slocking should coincide with peak ichthyoplankton densities.

The experiment {{was performed in}} 12 enclosures (3 mi), which initially were identical with respect to all components except fish. At {{the start of the}} experiment, caged fish not able to feed on zooplankton were added to four of the enclosures (excretion treatment), and free swimming <b>fish</b> to four <b>enclosures</b> (excretion plus predation treatment).

Our results suggest that in eutrophic lakes fish predation on zooplankton may be more important than nutrient excretion by fish for the structure and dynamics of planktonic communities. Fish predation on zooplankton was the most important mechanism accounting for fish effects on nutrient concentrations in the water, on phytoplankton biovolume, on rotifers and total zooplankton biomass, as well as on protozoan densities. However our results suggest that nutrient excretion by fish may have important indirect effects on zooplankton.

Cryptomonads spp. (54, 083 cells/mL) and Anabaena spp. (47, 983 cells/mL) increased significantly (63 and 23 fold, respectively) in carp enclosures, possibly because of physiological adaptation to low light, high turbidity, total phosphorus concentrations (TP) and low TN: TP ratios (N-limitation); a consequence of carp benthic grazing. Carp and gambusia caused an unconventional shift from smaller to medium sized zooplankton (e. g. Boeckella sp., Bosmina meridionalis), possibly a result of copepod nauplius grazing.

The statistics of homing adults caught in a fish ladder as well as individually tagged trout caught in the fishery were evaluated. Stocked anadromous trout migrated only short distances since > 95 % of the recaptured tagged fish was caught < 200 km from the home river. A 50 % loss of fish was seen when they were released upriver (and above a dam) compared to released more downstreams. Relative size of survival for smolts (recapture rate) {{was more important than}} their absolute size. Few trouts migrated to smaller forest rivers {{in the vicinity of the}} larger Umeälven. Upstream migrating trouts counted in a fish-ladder showed that 42. 7 % of all passing fish from 1974 to 1997 were of wild origin and that the annual average was 29 individuals per year. It is concluded that the wild anadromous trout in these rivers are near extinction despite the effort with stocking programs. Growth and survival of stocked 1 -year old brown trout were analysed in a field study where the effect of acclimatisation by keeping the <b>fish</b> in <b>enclosures</b> before stocking, increased the number and size of the fish recaptured within the stocked area, two month after the release. The first period after stocking is of vital importance for the juvenile fish stocked into a natural habitat. Growth of stocked 1 -year old brown trout released into artificial stream tanks was strongly effected by individual characteristics, density, prior residents and food level. Competitive ability, defined as a behavioural profile is an important growth determinants. The two most dominant behavioural profiles differed in profitability depending on density and size of the fish. Large size combined with aggressive behaviour were beneficial at low competitive levels (densities), while large size and non-aggressive behaviour were beneficial at high densities. Prior residence was beneficial at intermediate and high-competitive levels but had no impact at low densities of fish. The mean growth rate of all fish decreased with increasing density. Both food abundance and behaviour profile of juveniles affected growth. Food abundance had no effect on the number of territorial individuals. Instead, the proportions of the alternative behavioural strategies, i. e. a floating behaviour (individuals that occasionally displayed a territorial behaviour) and a non-territorial (shoaling) behaviour changed with food abundance. In the lowest food regime, more individuals displayed a non-territorial than a floating behaviour...|$|R

As part of a larger study of its life history, we conducted an experiment designed to determine the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) of Oriental Weatherfish collected from water bodies near Boise, Idaho, USA. In each of three experimental trials, 16 fish were placed into individual tanks in an environmental chamber where over the course of 20 d the ambient air temperature was lowered to 0 °C. Air temperature was then held at 0 °C for 102 – 134 h. Individual tank temperatures decreased over the course of each trial such that fish were exposed to temperatures ranging from 20 °C to − 3. 64 °C. Tank temperatures reaching below the ambient air temperature set-point were attributed to cold air currents within the environmental chamber. Six of 48 fish died due to temperature-related factors.

Marked <b>fish</b> placed in <b>enclosures</b> were measured for length and weight weekly in natural pools and pools created using ditch plugs. Benthic invertebrates were sieved and sorted from soil cores to characterize invertebrate community structure, and stable isotopes were used to posit diets and trophic pathways associated with each pool type.

Likewise, invertebrate species richness, biomass, and caloric value were all significantly greater in natural pool habitat than in ditch plugs. Stable isotope mixing models identified distinct resource utilization and trophic structure for natural and created pools. We attribute these differences to flooding and plant loss in response to ditch-plugging, which reduces habitat quality (as measured by resource availability, community structure, and trophic transfer) for fish and invertebrates.

The arrival by the first Europeans in 1778 led to further introductions of plants and animals that radically changed the landscape. Subsequent development of a plantation agricultural system led to increased human immigration, population growth and an end to traditional land and water management practices. The reefs were devastated by extensive dredge and fill operations as well as rapid growth of human population, which led to extensive urbanization of the watershed. By the 1960 ’s the bay was severely impacted by increased sewage discharge along with increased sedimentation due to improper grading practices and stream channelization, resulting in extensive loss of coral cover. The reefs of Kāneʻohe Bay developed under estuarine conditions and thus have been subjected to multiple natural stresses. These include storm floods, a more extreme temperature range than more oceanic reefs, high rates of sedimentation, and exposure at extreme low tides. Deposition and degradation of organic materials carried into the bay from the watershed results in low pH conditions such that according to some ocean acidification projections the rich coral reefs in the bay should not exist. Increased global temperature due to anthropogenic fossil fuel emmisions is now impacting these reefs with the first “bleaching event” in 1996 and a second more severe event in 2014. The reefs of Kāneʻohe Bay have developed and persist under rather severe natural and anthropogenic perturbations. To date, these reefs have proved to be very resilient once the stressor has been removed. A major question remains to be answered concerning the limits of Kāneʻohe Bay reef resilience in the face of global climate change...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{and precise}} {{estimates}} {{of age and}} growth rates are essential parameters in understanding the population dynamics of fishes. Some of the more sophisticated stock assessment models, such as virtual population analysis, require age and growth information to partition catch data by age. Stock assessment efforts by regulatory agencies are usually directed at specific fisheries which are being heavily exploited and are suspected of being overfished. Interest in stock assessment {{of some of the}} oceanic pelagic fishes (tunas, billfishes, and sharks) has developed only over the last decade, during which exploitation has increased steadily in response to increases in worldwide demand for these resources. Traditionally, estimating the age of fishes has been done by enumerating growth bands on skeletal hardparts, through length frequency analysis, tag and recapture studies, and raising <b>fish</b> in <b>enclosures.</b> However, problems related to determining the age of some of the oceanic pelagic fishes are unique compared with other species. For example, sampling is difficult for these large, highly mobile fishes because of their size, extensive distributions throughout the world's oceans, and for some, such as the marlins, infrequent catches. In addition, movements of oceanic pelagic fishes often transect temperate as well as tropical oceans, making interpretation of growth bands on skeletal hardparts more difficult than with more sedentary temperate species. Many oceanic pelagics are also long-lived, attaining ages in excess of 30 yr, and more often than not, their life cycles do not lend themselves easily to artificial propagation and culture. These factors contribute to the difficulty of determining ages and are generally characteristic of this group-the tunas, billfishes, and sharks. Accordingly, the rapidly growing international concern in managing oceanic pelagic fishes, as well as unique difficulties in ageing these species, prompted us to hold this workshop. Our two major objectives for this workshop are to: I) Encourage the interchange of ideas on this subject, and 2) establish the "state of the art. " A total of 65 scientists from 10 states in the continental United States and Hawaii, three provinces in Canada, France, Republic of Senegal, Spain, Mexico, Ivory Coast, and New South Wales (Australia) attended the workshop held at the Southeast Fisheries Center, Miami, Fla., 15 - 18 February 1982. Our first objective, encouraging the interchange of ideas, is well illustrated in the summaries of the Round Table Discussions and in the Glossary, which defines terms used in this volume. The majority of the workshop participants agreed that the lack of validation of age estimates and the means to accomplish the same are serious problems preventing advancements in assessing the age and growth of fishes, particularly oceanic pelagics. The alternatives relating to the validation problem were exhaustively reviewed during the Round Table Discussions and are a major highlight of this workshop. How well we accomplished our second objective, to establish the "state of the art" on age determination of oceanic pelagic fishes, will probably best be judged {{on the basis of these}} proceedings and whether future research efforts are directed at the problem areas we have identified. In order to produce high-quality papers, workshop participants served as referees for the manuscripts published in this volume. Several papers given orally at the workshop, and included in these proceedings, were summarized from full-length manuscripts, which have been submitted to or published in other scientific outlets-these papers are designated as SUMMARY PAPERS. In addition, the SUMMARY PAPER designation was also assigned to workshop papers that represented very preliminary or initial stages of research, cursory progress reports, papers that were data shy, or provide only brief reviews on general topics. Bilingual abstracts were included for all papers that required translation. We gratefully acknowledge the support of everyone involved in this workshop. Funding was provided by the Southeast Fisheries Center, and Jack C. Javech did the scientific illustrations appearing on the cover, between major sections, and in the Glossary.
