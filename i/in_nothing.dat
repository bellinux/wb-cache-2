5|$|Ben Stiller as Tugg Speedman: Once the highest-paid, highest-grossing action {{film star}} ever {{due to his}} Scorcher franchise, his career has stalled, and he now has a {{reputation}} for appearing <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> but box office bombs. After a failed attempt at portraying a serious role in Simple Jack, in which he plays a mentally-challenged farm boy, he takes the role of Four Leaf Tayback in an attempt to save his career. The first faux trailer at the film's start is a preview for Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown, the latest in his series.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester {{and one of}} the king's main supporters, had {{recently}} been appointed papal legate. Henry objected to Stephen's actions in arresting the bishops and confiscating their property, as they were in contravention of canon law. Henry called a legatine council, a church council convened by a papal legate, at Winchester to discuss the issue, which ended <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> being done, although both sides threatened excommunication and stated they would appeal to Rome and the papacy for support. Alexander did not attend the council of Winchester, but his uncle did. He seems to have borne Stephen no ill will over the arrest, and worked with the king during Stephen's later reign.|$|E

25|$|A 1966 Esquire cover gained Dickinson {{additional}} {{fame and}} notoriety, her having posed <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> but a sweater {{and a pair}} of panty hose. The photo became so iconic, that while celebrating the magazine's 70th anniversary in 2003, the Dickinson pose was recreated for the cover by Britney Spears.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{striking}} conclusions {{to emerge from}} ecological footprint accounting {{is that it would}} be necessary to have 4 or 5 back-up planets engaged <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> but agriculture for all those alive today to live a western lifestyle. The Footprint analysis is closely related to the I=PAT equation that, itself, can be considered a metric.|$|E
25|$|Morton Smith {{indicates}} that in Clement's letter, {{the presentation of}} the young man in the linen cloth has homoerotic connotations. Following Mark 10:34, Clement writes in his letter, the story of Jesus raising the young man from the dead, who then loves Jesus and begs to stay with him. After six days, the young man comes to Jesus in the evening, clothed <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> but a linen garment, and spends the night, during which time Jesus teaches him the mystery of the Kingdom of God.|$|E

25|$|As the European {{population}} was severely reduced, land became more plentiful for the survivors, and labour consequently more expensive. Attempts by landowners to forcibly reduce wages, {{such as the}} English 1351 Statute of Laborers, were doomed to fail. These efforts resulted <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> more than fostering resentment among the peasantry, leading to rebellions such as the French Jacquerie in 1358 and the English Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The long-term effect was the virtual end of serfdom in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe, on the other hand, landowners were able to exploit the situation to force the peasantry into even more repressive bondage.|$|E
25|$|The Franks of Acre {{were for}} some time aware of the {{seriousness}} of the situation. They asked for help from Europe which resulted <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> significant. A small group of knights, among them the Savoyard Otto of Grandson, were sent by King Edward I of England. Burchard of Schwanden, the Grand Master of the German Teutonic Knights, resigned and was replaced by Konrad von Feuchtwangen who suddenly left Acre for Europe. The only noteworthy reinforcement came from king Henry II of Cyprus who fortified the walls and sent forces led by his brother Amalric to defend the city.|$|E
25|$|In 1442 Alfonso V of Aragon became {{ruler of}} Naples, {{bringing}} {{with him a}} collection of Flemish paintings and setting up a Humanist Academy. The painter Antonello da Messina {{seems to have had}} access to the King's collection, which may have included the works of Jan van Eyck. He seems to have been exposed to Flemish painting at a date earlier than the Florentines, to have quickly seen the potential of oils as a medium and then painted <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> else. He carried the technique north to Venice with him, where it was soon adopted by Giovanni Bellini and became the favoured medium of the maritime republic where the art of fresco had never been a great success.|$|E

25|$|The last {{recorded}} {{battle in}} the Mediterranean where galleys played a significant part was at Matapan in 1717, between the Ottomans and Venice and its allies, though they had little influence on the final outcome. Few large-scale naval battles were fought in the Mediterranean {{throughout most of the}} remainder of the 18th century. The Tuscan galley fleet was dismantled around 1718, Naples had only four old vessels by 1734 and the French Galley Corps had ceased to exist as an independent arm in 1748. Venice, the Papal States and the Knights of Malta were the only state fleets that maintained galleys, though <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> like their previous quantities. By 1790, there were less than 50 galleys in service among all the Mediterranean powers, half of which belonged to Venice.|$|E
25|$|The C64 {{performs}} a RAM test on power up {{and if a}} RAM error is detected, the amount of free BASIC memory will be lower than the normal 38911 figure. If the faulty chip is in lower memory, then an ?OUT OF MEMORY IN 0 error is displayed rather than the usual BASIC startup banner. The color RAM at $D800 uses a separate 2114 SRAM chip and is directly gated to the VIC-II. Unlike the rest of system RAM, it cannot be banked out by using the $0/$1 register. If a program does not use the BASIC interpreter, RAM {{can be read as}} well as written over that ROM's location. However, this means the character ROM is not available, and the RAM in its place is instead used for the character glyphs. Normally, this RAM is uninitialized, which then results <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> but random patterns appearing on the screen. This is solved by copying the character ROM into RAM. Most C64 games are written in this way, using tile maps, which require much processor time and memory. The same technique was used earlier in the Atari 8-bit family (1979) and arcade hardware such as Pac-Man (1981).|$|E

Though never an {{official}} member, she became Butthole Surfers' famous [...] "naked dancer", performing intermittently with them through 1989. One show in Washington, D.C. with GWAR saw Kathleen take the stage to dance <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> but gold body paint and antique wooden snow shoes. At another particularly wild concert in 1986, Haynes and Lynch, by now completely bald, reportedly engaged in sexual intercourse while on stage, as Leary used a screwdriver to vandalize the club's speakers. This came after only five songs, during which time Haynes had started a small fire.|$|E

When she comes back, she is <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> but his shirt and, singing [...] "Happy Birthday, Mr. President" [...] as Marilyn, she climbs into his lap, straddling him, then pulls away and says [...] "not gonna happen". The next day, Karen and Ivy go to their callback singing [...] "Let Me Be Your Star", which closes out the episode.|$|E
500|$|Leverett {{served as}} deputy {{governor}} under governor Richard Bellingham in 1671–1672, and succeeded to his position after the governor's death. His tenure as governor was chiefly notable because of King Philip's War, {{and the rising}} threats to the colonial charter that culminated in its revocation in 1684. The colony angered the king by purchasing the claims of Sir Ferdinando Gorges to portions of Maine in 1677, a territory Charles had intended to acquire for his son, the Duke of Monmouth. Edward Randolph, sent by Charles {{to report on the}} New England colonies, reported in 1676 that Leverett believed the colony to be beyond the crown's reach: [...] "He freely declared to me that the laws made by your Majesty and your Parliament obligeth them <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> but what consists with the interest of that colony".|$|E

500|$|Toward {{the end of}} his life, contemporaries {{considered}} him as more of a children's poet, as many of his readers were children. A reviewer in 1848 accused Longfellow of creating a [...] "goody two-shoes kind of literature... slipshod, sentimental stories told {{in the style of the}} nursery, beginning <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> and ending in nothing". A more modern critic said, [...] "Who, except wretched schoolchildren, now reads Longfellow?" [...] A London critic in the London Quarterly Review, however, condemned all American poetry—"with two or three exceptions, there is not a poet of mark in the whole union"—but he singled out Longfellow as one of those exceptions. An editor of the Boston Evening Transcript wrote in 1846, [...] "Whatever the miserable envy of trashy criticism may write against Longfellow, one thing is most certain, no American poet is more read".|$|E
500|$|Containing a vague plot, {{the opening}} scene of the clip {{features}} Usher donning a black tank top and dark jeans, while he stands in a field with the sun rising in the background. While performing t'ai chi-inspired dance moves, he begins to pursue his love interest, and appears shirtless {{in front of a}} black backdrop. [...] Appearing alongside his interest in the backdrop scenes, Usher then sings propped on a concrete wall in a dark alley, while he and the woman tease each other, before moving outside on the balcony of a house on top of mountains. The singer performs acrobatic moves, including one in particular in which he does a pull-up onto the roof to kiss his partner. All previous scenes are intercut before culminating with Usher seducing his partner in bed, in racy moments with Usher <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> but briefs as he pulls off her stockings. The final scene sees the singer driving off in a convertible.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics have}} {{compared}} Gravity with other notable films set in space. Lindsey Weber of Vulture.com said {{the choice of}} Ed Harris for the voice of Mission Control is a reference to Apollo 13. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter suggests the way [...] "a weightless Stone goes floating about <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> but her underwear" [...] references Alien (1979). Other critics made connections with [...] (1968). James Cameron praised the film and stated, [...] "I think it's the best space photography ever done, I think it's the best space film ever done, and it's the movie I've been hungry to see for an awful long time". Empire Online, Ask Men and The Huffington Post also considered Gravity {{to be one of}} the best space films ever made, though The Huffington Post later included Gravity on their list of [...] "8 Movies From The Last 15 Years That Are Super Overrated". Gravity was ranked second on Metacritic's Film Critic Top Ten List scorecard for 2013.|$|E
