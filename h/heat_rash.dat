50|$|Occupational {{heat stress}} is the net load {{to which a}} worker is exposed from the {{combined}} contributions of metabolic heat, environmental factors, and clothing worn which results {{in an increase in}} heat storage in the body. Heat stress can result in heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, hyperthermia, heat exhaustion, heat cramps or <b>heat</b> <b>rashes.</b> Although <b>heat</b> exhaustion is less severe, hyperthermia is a medical emergency and requires emergency treatment, which if not provided can even lead to death.|$|R

40|$|Background: The rise {{in global}} {{temperature}} is well documented. Changes in temperature lead {{to increases in}} heat exposure, which may impact health ranging from mild <b>heat</b> <b>rashes</b> to deadly <b>heat</b> stroke. Heat exposure can also aggravate several chronic diseases including cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Objective: This study {{examined the relationship between}} climate condition and health status and productivity in two main categories of the occupational setting &#x 2013; where one setting involves heat generated from the industry and the other with heat in a natural setting. Design: This cross-sectional study included four industrial sites (pottery industry, power plant, knife industry, and construction site) and one agricultural site in the Pathumthani and Ayutthaya provinces. Exposure data were comprised of meteorological data and heat exposure including relative humidity (RH) measured by Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) monitor. Heat index was calculated to measure the effects of heat exposure on the study population, which consisted of 21 workers at five worksites; a questionnaire was also used to collect data on workers. Results: Among the five workplaces, the outdoor WBGT was found to be highest at 34. 6 &#x 00 B 0;C during 12 : 00 and 1 : 00 &#x 2009;PM at the agricultural site. It was found that four out of five study sites had heat indices in the &#x 2018;extreme caution,&#x 2019; where heat cramp and exhaustion may be possible and one site showed a value of 41 &#x 00 B 0;C that falls into the category of &#x 2018;danger,&#x 2019; where sunstroke and heat exhaustion are likely and prolonged exposure may lead to heatstroke. Productivity as perceived by the workers revealed that only the construction and pottery industry workers had a loss of productivity ranged from 10 to 60 %. Conclusions: Climate conditions in Thailand potentially affect both the health and productivity in occupational settings...|$|R

50|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>rash,</b> {{also known}} as prickly heat, is a {{maculopapular}} rash accompanied by acute inflammation and blocked sweat ducts. The sweat ducts may become dilated and may eventually rupture, producing small pruritic vesicles on an erythematous base. <b>Heat</b> <b>rash</b> affects areas of the body covered by tight clothing. If this continues for a duration of time {{it can lead to}} the development of chronic dermatitis or a secondary bacterial infection. Prevention is the best therapy. It is also advised to wear loose-fitting clothing in the heat. However, once <b>heat</b> <b>rash</b> has developed, the initial treatment involves the application of chlorhexidine lotion to remove any desquamated skin. The associated itching may be treated with topical or systemic antihistamines. If infection occurs a regimen of antibiotics is required.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGhana’s savannah {{ecosystem}} {{has been}} subjected to a number of climatic hazards of varying severity. This paper presents a spatial, time-series analysis of the impacts of multiple hazards on the ecosystem and human livelihoods over the period 1983 – 2012, using the Upper East Region of Ghana as a case study. Our aim is {{to understand the nature of}} hazards (their frequency, magnitude and duration) and how they cumulatively affect humans. Primary data were collected using questionnaires, focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and personal observations. Secondary data were collected from documents and reports. Calculations of the standard precipitation index (SPI) and crop failure index used rainfall data from 4 weather stations (Manga, Binduri, Vea and Navrongo) and crop yield data of 5 major crops (maize, sorghum, millet, rice and groundnuts) respectively. Temperature and windstorms were analysed from the observed weather data. We found that temperatures were consistently high and increasing. From the SPI, drought frequency varied spatially from 9 at Binduri to 13 occurrences at Vea; dry spells occurred at least twice every year and floods occurred about 6 times on average, with slight spatial variations, during 1988 – 2012, a period with consistent data from all stations. Impacts from each hazard varied spatio-temporally. Within the study period, more 70 % of years recorded severe crop losses with greater impacts when droughts and floods occur in the same year, especially in low lying areas. The effects of crop losses were higher in districts with no/little irrigation (Talensi, Nabdam, Garu-Tempane, Kassena-Nankana East). Frequency and severity of diseases and sicknesses such as cerebrospinal meningitis, <b>heat</b> <b>rashes,</b> headaches and malaria related to both dry and wet conditions have increased steadily over time. Other impacts recorded with spatio-temporal variations included destruction to housing, displacement, injury and death of people. These impacts also interacted. For example, sicknesses affected labour output; crop losses were blamed for high malnutrition; and reconstruction of properties demanded financial resources largely from sale of agricultural produce. These frequent impacts and their interactions greatly explain the persistent poverty in the area...|$|R
50|$|Temperature {{extremes}} {{can also}} pose {{a danger to}} workers. Heat stress can cause heat stroke, exhaustion, cramps, and <b>rashes.</b> <b>Heat</b> can also fog up safety glasses or cause sweaty palms or dizziness, all of which {{increase the risk of}} other injuries. Workers near hot surfaces or steam also are at risk for burns. Dehydration may also result from overexposure to heat. Cold stress also poses a danger to many workers. Overexposure to cold conditions or extreme cold can lead to hypothermia, frostbite, trench foot, or chilblains.|$|R

40|$|Mechanism to control {{the cell}} lysis and the cell {{survival}} strategy in stationary phase under <b>heat</b> stress <b>Rashed</b> Noor* An array of stress signals triggering the bacterial cellular stress response {{is well known}} in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. Heat stress is usually sensed through the misfolded outer membrane porin (OMP) precursors in the peri-plasm, resulting in the activation of σE (encoded by rpoE), which binds to RNA polymerase to start the transcription of genes required for responding against the heat stress signal. At the elevated temperatures, σE also serves as the transcription factor for σH (the main heat shock sigma factor, encoded by rpoH), which is involved in the expression of several genes whose products deal with the cytoplasmic unfolded proteins. Besides, oxidative stress in form of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accumulate due to heat stress, has been found to give rise to viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells at the early stationary phase, which is in turn lysed by the σE-dependent process. Such lysis of the defective cells may generate nutrients for the remaining population to survive with the capacity of formation of colony forming units (CFUs). σH is also known to regulate the transcription of the major heat shock proteins (HSPs) required for heat shock response (HSR) resulting in cellular survival. Present review concentrated on the cellular sur-vival against heat stress employing the harmonized impact of σE and σH regulons and the HSPs as well as their inter connectivity towards the maintenance of cellular survival...|$|R
40|$|Nicotinic acid (pyridine 3 -carboxylic acid) and {{nicotinamide}} or {{nicotinic acid}} amide (pyridine 3 -carboxylic acid amide) {{are classified as}} belonging to the vitamin B complex. In Europe, the term niacin covers both substances. This {{is not the case}} in the USA where niacin chiefly de-notes nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are used to form certain coenzymes in the body. The human body itself is capable of synthesising nicotinic acid and nicotinamide from the essential amino acid tryptophan. At the same time, however, niacin is contained in a number of foods. The German Nutrition Society recommends a daily niacin intake of between 13 and 18 mg for adults. Given the typical diet in Germany, this intake level is now far ex-ceeded, meaning that niacin intake is sufficient. If nicotinic acid is additionally taken in high dosage, this can lead to various health problems. Typical symptoms include reddening of facial skin and on the neck and arms, sensation of <b>heat,</b> and nettle <b>rash</b> with very itchy wheals and itchy skin, often referred to as flushing symp-toms. Nonetheless, even further dosage increases up to several grams of nicotinic acid have been reported. This can lead to diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting and even cause jaundice and liver damage. In the opinion of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), consumers should therefore refrain from taking products, marketed as food supplement, that contain nicotinic acid in such excessive doses. The Institute considers nicotinic acid products with intake recommenda-tions of up to several grams per day as unsafe foods. This recommendation does not apply to the known use of nicotinic acid as an active ingredient in certain pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of various metabolic disorders under medical supervision...|$|R
60|$|My Lords, the Commons of Great Britain have {{no doubt}} upon this subject. We came hither to call for justice, not to solve a problem; and if justice be denied us, the accused is not acquitted, but the {{tribunal}} is condemned. We know that this man is guilty of all the crimes which he stands accused of by us. We have not come here to you, in the <b>rash</b> <b>heat</b> of a day, with that fervor which sometimes prevails in popular assemblies, and frequently misleads them. No: if we have been guilty of error in this cause, it is a deliberate error, the fruit of long, laborious inquiry,--an error founded on a procedure in Parliament before we came here, the most minute, the most circumstantial, and the most cautious that ever was instituted. Instead of coming, {{as we did in}} Lord Strafford's case, and in some others, voting the impeachment and bringing it up on the same day, this impeachment was voted from a general sense prevailing in the House of Mr. Hastings's criminality after an investigation begun in the year 1780, and which produced in 1782 a body of resolutions condemnatory of almost the whole of his conduct. Those resolutions were formed by the Lord Advocate of Scotland, and carried in our House by the unanimous consent of all parties: I mean the then Lord Advocate of Scotland,--now one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, and at the head of this very Indian department. Afterwards, when this defendant came home, in the year 1785, we reïnstituted our inquiry. We instituted it, as your Lordships and the world know, at his own request, made to us by his agent, then a member of our House. We entered into it at large; we deliberately moved for every paper which promised information on the subject. These papers were not only produced {{on the part of the}} prosecution, as is the case before grand juries, but the friends of the prisoner produced every document which they could produce for his justification. We called all the witnesses which could enlighten us in the cause, and the friends of the prisoner likewise called every witness that could possibly throw any light in his favor. After all these long deliberations, we referred the whole to a committee. When it had gone through that committee, and we thought it in a fit state to be digested into these charges, we referred the matter to another committee; and the result of that long examination and the labor of these committees is the impeachment now at your bar.|$|R
50|$|Especially in {{hot weather}} condition, fires present the risk of heat stress, which can entail feeling heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or nausea. Heat stress can {{progress}} into heat strain, which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature. This can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as <b>heat</b> <b>rash,</b> cramps, exhaustion or heat stroke. Various factors {{can contribute to the}} risks posed by heat stress, including strenuous work, personal risk factors such as age and fitness, dehydration, sleep deprivation, and burdensome personal protective equipment. Rest, cool water, and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress.|$|E

5000|$|This type of rash {{is common}} in several {{diseases}} and medical conditions, including scarlet fever, measles, Ebola virus disease, rubella, secondary syphilis (Congenital syphilis, which is asymptomatic, the newborn may present this type of rash), erythrovirus (parvovirus B19), chikungunya (alphavirus), zika, and <b>heat</b> <b>rash.</b> It is also a common manifestation of a skin reaction to the antibiotic amoxicillin or chemotherapy drugs. [...] Cutaneous infiltration of leukemic cells may also have this appearance. Maculopapular rash is seen in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant), which can be seen within one week or several weeks after the transplant. In the case of GVHD, the maculopapular rash may progress to a condition similar to toxic epidermal necrolysis. In addition, {{this is the type}} of rash that some patients presenting with Ebola virus hemorrhagic (EBO-Z) fever will reveal but can be hard to see on dark skin people. It is also seen in patients with Marburg hemorrhagic fever, a filovirus not unlike Ebola.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} encountered {{form of the}} illness is miliaria rubra, in which obstruction causes leakage of sweat into the deeper layers of the epidermis, provoking a local inflammatory reaction and giving rise to the typical appearance of redness (hence rubra) and larger (but still only a few millimetres), blister-like lesions. This form of the illness is often accompanied by the typical symptoms—intense itching or [...] "pins and needles" [...] {{with a lack of}} sweating (anhidrosis) to affected areas. There is a small risk of heat exhaustion due to inability to sweat if the rash affects {{a large proportion of the}} body's surface area or the sufferer continues to engage in heat-producing activity. Miliaria rubra is also known as prickly heat and <b>heat</b> <b>rash.</b> Differential diagnosis should be used to rule out polycythemia vera, which is a rare hematological disorder and appears more often in males than females, generally not before the age of 40.

40|$|In Travels in the Mogul Empire, A. D. 1656 - 1668, François Bernier recounts his {{experiences}} traversing northern India {{as a physician}} {{in the court of}} Emperor Aurungzeb. While documenting his encounters with material objects and people including sovereigns, villagers, and fakirs, Bernier reveals the sensuous dimension of imperial, quotidian, and ascetic life in Delhi, Agra, and Kashmir. This paper highlights many of Bernier's colorful descriptions of sensory events such as touch (e. g., feeling the “delicate texture and softness” of shawls made from wild goat hair), taste (e. g., savoring sweet mangoes and loathing confections “full of dust and flies”), hearing (e. g., reveling in the “solemn, grand, and melodious” sounds of karnas), sight (e. g., sneaking glimpses of the “almost inaccessible” maidens of Roshanara Begum’s retinue), and smell (e. g., detecting the scent of a woman’s garment “impregnated with scented oil, mixed with sandalwood powder and saffron” as she immolated herself on a pyre). For Bernier, his ephemeral, multi-sensory experiences yield a type of knowledge which he then tries to communicate with words. The sensation of pain, however, is nearly incommunicable as is the case when he suffers from a violent bout of <b>heat</b> <b>rash</b> under the sweltering sun of Punjab such that the “pen itself drops” from his blistered hand. In addition to this discussion of Bernier’s personal sensory experiences, attention is also given to his depictions of the incongruity between the sensory experience of the royals whose leisure and hedonism is evidenced through their sumptuous feasts and opulent abodes and the yogis, who through strict exercise, desire to transcend all sensory modalities to the point where “their external senses lose their functions. ...|$|E
40|$|According to Badan Meteorologi Klimatologi dan Geofisika estimation, in 2014 {{temperature}} in Semarang was around 23 – 36 °C.
