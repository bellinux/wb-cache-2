Advisors: Paul van den Broek and Sashank Varma. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 167 pages, appendices A-E. A positive association between <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> learning from texts {{has been well}} noted in the literature. However, {{the cause of the}} positive association between <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> learning from text is uncertain. The primary purpose of this dissertation was to examine a potential cause, inference generation, of the positive association between <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> learning from texts. Sixty undergraduate students participated in Experiment 1 by reading two scientific texts and writing recalls and answers to comprehension questions. Topic <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> text-based <b>interest</b> were measured using self-reports. The results indicated that topic <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> text-based <b>interest</b> were indeed positively associated with learning from texts. In Experiment 2, sixty-nine undergraduate students participated by completing the same measures as the participants in Experiment 1, with the inclusion of the think-aloud task while reading. The results from Experiment 2 indicated that topic <b>and</b> text-based <b>interest</b> were both found to be positively associated with inference generation. Subsequent analyses indicated that inference generation explained (as a mediator) the positive association between both topic <b>and</b> text-based <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> accurate answers to comprehension questions. In contrast, inference generation was statistically independent from the positive association between topic <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> recall. Inference generation affected the strength of (as a moderator) the positive association between text-based <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> recall. The findings from both experiments are discussed in the context of <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> text comprehension theories, specifically in regards to standards of coherence. The secondary purpose of this dissertation was to determine the usefulness of Wii Fit boards as a cost-effective means of incorporating gross body movements as an indirect measure of interest. Gross body movement data from forty-two of the participants in Experiment 1 was measured while the participants read the experimental texts. The findings indicated that <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> learning from text were negatively associated with both leaning back and shifting in one's seat. These findings are discussed in the context of embodied theories of cognition...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to create <b>and</b> test an <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> {{motivation}} self-regulation model comprising three main components: Interest-enhancing strategies, <b>interest,</b> <b>and</b> self-determination. It was first hypothesized that when people {{are faced with a}} boring task, they will use the five following interest-enhancing strategies: Challenge enhancement, exploitation of stimulation from the physical context, introduction of variety within the task, provision of self-relevant rationales, and focused attentional involvement on the task. Second, interest-enhancing strategy use was hypothesized to be associated with <b>interest,</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest,</b> in turn, was hypothesized {{to be associated with the}} level of self-determination of extrinsic motivation. These relationships were also hypothesized to hold over time. That is, interest-enhancing strategy use was hypothesized to predict long term gains in <b>interest,</b> <b>and</b> long term gains in interest were hypothesized to predict long term gains in self-determination. Four studies were conducted to test the aforementioned hypotheses. Study 1 was a cross-sectional survey (N = 318). Its goal was to provide an exploratory test of the <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> motivation self-regulation model. The goal of Study 2 (N = 434) was to cross-validate the results obtained in Study 1, using a similar methodology. In Study 3 (N = 354), the <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> motivation self-regulation model was tested in the context of a longitudinal survey. Questionnaire measures were obtained twice, at a 10 weeks interval. A control group was also tested at Time 2 to evaluate potential "carry-over" effects. In Study 4 (N = 120), the <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> motivation self-regulation model was evaluated using an experimental design. <b>Interest</b> <b>and</b> motivation were measured repeatedly while the participants performed a boring free recall task. The results of all four studies revealed that the participants used the five proposed interest-enhancing strategies to a moderate extent. A single strategy, namely attentional involvement, was directly and positively associated with interest in all four studies. This strategy also had an indirect positive impact on self-determination, through interest. Moreover, in Studies 1, 2, and 3, challenge enhancement and provision of self-relevant rationales were indirectly associated with <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> self-determination, through the mediation of attentional involvement. In Study 4, provision of self-relevant rationales had a direct positive impact on self-determination. Introduction of variety did not relate, directly or indirectly, to <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> self-determination in any of the four studies. The results pertaining to exploitation of stimulation were inconsistent. In Studies 1 and 2, this strategy displayed a negative indirect impact on <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> motivation, through the mediation of attentional involvement. No significant associations were found in Study 3 for this strategy. In Study 4, this strategy displayed a direct positive impact on <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> self-determination.
