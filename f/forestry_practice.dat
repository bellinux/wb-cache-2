5|$|Some Hydnellum {{species have}} been shown to be in decline in Europe, {{including}} the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Norway, and Scotland. In the United Kingdom, several are listed in the biodiversity action plan for stiped hydnoid fungi: H. aurantiacum is classified as critically endangered; H. caeruleum, H. ferrugineum are listed as endangered, while H. concrescens, H. spongiosipes, H. peckii, and H. scrobiculatum are considered vulnerable. H. ferrugineum and H. peckii are sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a <b>forestry</b> <b>practice</b> used in some areas of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The fungus forms a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas {{generally}} lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil. Similar to some other Hydnellum species, H.ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a <b>forestry</b> <b>practice</b> used in some areas of Europe. The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal at {{the leading edge of the}} mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing saprophytic tendencies.|$|E

The effect of all <b>forestry</b> <b>practices</b> (e. g., logging, road building, planting, thinning, and slash) on the riparian areas is considered since these areas {{are part of the}} landscape. In new forestry, more effort is directed in the planning effort to define site objectives and to understand the implications of each site objective at the landscape scale.

40|$|The {{necessity}} {{of increasing the}} investment and innovative support for <b>forestry</b> <b>practices</b> as a necessary prerequisite to ensure the maximum possible wood growth and integrated use of forest resource potential is substantiated. It is found that under current conditions the main institutional prerequisite for attracting private investments in forestry is the establishment of partnerships between state forestry enterprises and private business entities.

40|$|<b>Forestry</b> <b>practices</b> may {{directly}} kill {{animals as}} well as destroy and fragment their habitat. Even without habitat destruction, logging and its associated forest management practices (which include road building, re-forestation, and often increased recreational use) create noise, frighten animals, and may lead to changes in species composition {{as well as}} evolutionary responses to the myriad of anthropogenic impacts. Thus, <b>forestry</b> <b>practices</b> may create conservation problems. <b>Forestry</b> <b>practices</b> may also create welfare problems that may act on different temporal and spatial scales than the conservation problems. The individuals affected by forestry may have heightened glucocorticoid levels {{that may lead to}} a predictable set of deleterious consequences.

Clearly, a possibility exists for one species to be locally abundant with stable populations, yet still be declining throughout the range. Salamander habitat loss is mainly due to outright destruction, fragmentation, <b>forestry</b> <b>practice,</b> and pollution.|$|E
