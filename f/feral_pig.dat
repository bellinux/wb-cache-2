25|$|In Hawaii {{the seeds}} are {{dispersed}} by frugivorous animals. By {{far the most}} important disperser in Hawaii is the <b>feral</b> <b>pig,</b> which eats the fallen fruit and passes the seeds intact. Feral pigs seek out the fruit and when P. tarminiana occurs with feral pigs in Hawaii, the seeds are abundant in pig droppings. Germination is not enhanced by gut passage but pigs disturb the ground making a more favourable environment for germination of P. tarminiana. Because their home range is typically one to two square miles, pigs contribute more to the peripheral expansion of P. tarminiana patches than long distance dispersal.|$|E
40|$|<b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> (Sus scrofa) are {{an exotic}} {{ungulate}} {{which have been}} widely introduced worldwide with multiple ecosystem and economic consequences. The author conducted a semi-comprehensive literature review directed at identifying {{the current state of}} knowledge related to the effects of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> on island and mainland plant and animal communities. Also, the author describes the situation in California where <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> that were introduced in the late 1700 s are now widespread due to hunting-related introductions and natural range extensions. <b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> on predator-free oceanic islands are a serious conservation problem because they attain high densities and have contributed to near-extinctions and extinctions of multiple endemic plants and vertebrates. In mainland ecosystems, however, <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> can have both positive and negative effects depending on the local circumstances. Rooting, for example, can have both positive and negative effects on growth and survival of some trees, soils and soil processes, and the distribution of native and exotic grasses. In general, however, the negative effects of rooting by <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> are amplified when population densities are high. <b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> may compete with native species for limited resources, but there are limited data relevant to this hypothesis. Based on observations of small amounts of animal matter in their diets, <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> eat terrestrial vertebrates and eggs of ground nesting birds, but the importance of predation by <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> on native vertebrates is poorly known. <b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> also may have important indirect effects in mainland ecosystems by providing a new prey base for native predators which may then increase. In areas of Europe with extant wolf (Canis lupus) populations, wild boar (Sus scrofa) are an important prey species which may be facilitating numerical and geographic recoveries of wolves. Because wild boar are important prey for endangered Amur tigers (Panthera tigris), they are considered important for recovering tiger populations. In Australia, <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> are potentially important prey for dingoes (Canis familiaris dingo); whereas, in the United States, endangered Florida panthers (Felis concolor coryi) consumed 23 % to 59 % <b>feral</b> <b>pigs,</b> and mountain lions (Felis concolor) in Texas and California consumed 5 % to 38 % <b>feral</b> <b>pigs.</b> Research needs for <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> include quantitatively assessing: 1) how acorn foraging by <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> limits or influences regeneration of oaks (Quercus sp.); 2) the competitive effects of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> on native species; 3) whether direct predation by <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> suppresses small vertebrate populations; and 4) how the availability of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> as prey influences native predator populations...|$|R

40|$|Context. <b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> {{represent}} a significant threat to agriculture and ecosystems and are disease reservoirs for pathogens affecting humans, livestock and other wildlife. Information on the behavioural ecology of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> might increase {{the efficiency and}} effectiveness of management strategies. Aims. We assessed the frequency of promiscuous mating in relation to oestrous synchrony in <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> from southern Texas, USA, an agroecosystem with a widespread and well established population of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs.</b> An association between multiple paternity of single litters and synchrony of oestrous may indicate alternative mating strategies, such as mateguarding. Methods. We collected gravid sows at nine sites in southern Texas during 2005 – 07. We used a panel of DNA microsatellite markers to estimate frequency of multiple paternity {{and the distribution of}} male mating among litters of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs.</b> Conception dates were determined by fitting average fetal crown–rump measurements within litters to expected fetal development relative to gestation time.

They were of the wild-pig breed, descended originally from the European animal introduced by the early Spanish colonists, but after two or three centuries of feral life a good deal changed in appearance from their progenitors. This <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> was called barraco in the vernacular, and was about a third less in size than the domestic animal, with longer legs and more pointed face, and of a uniform deep rust-red in colour.

6000|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that the young of wild European and Indian pigs (3/26. D. Johnson 'Sketches of Indian Field Sports' page 272. Mr. Crawfurd informs me that the same fact holds good with the wild pigs of the Malay peninsula.), {{for the first six}} months, are longitudinally banded with light-coloured stripes. This character generally disappears under domestication. The Turkish domestic pigs, however, have striped young, as have those of Westphalia, [...] "whatever may be their hue" [...] (3/27. For Turkish pigs see Desmarest 'Mammalogie' 1820 page 391. For those of Westphalia see Richardson 'Pigs, their Origin, etc.' 1847 page 41.); whether these latter pigs belong to the same curly-haired race as the Turkish swine, I do not know. The pigs which have run wild in Jamaica and the semi-feral pigs of New Granada, both those which are black and those which are black with a white band across the stomach, often extending over the back, have resumed this aboriginal character and produce longitudinally-striped young. This is likewise the case, at least occasionally, with the neglected pigs in the Zambesi settlement on the coast of Africa. (3/28. With respect to the several foregoing and following statements on feral pigs see Roulin in 'Mem. presentes par divers Savans a l'Acad.' etc. Paris tome 6 1835 page 326. It should be observed that his account does not apply to truly feral pigs; but to pigs long introduced into the country and living in a half- wild state. For the truly feral pigs of Jamaica see Gosse 'Sojourn in Jamaica' 1851 page 386; and Col Hamilton Smith in 'Nat. Library' volume 9 page 93. With respect to Africa see Livingstone 'Expedition to the Zambesi' 1865 page 153. The most precise statement with respect to the tusks of the West Indian feral boars is by P. Labat quoted by Roulin; but this author attributes the state of these pigs to descent from a domestic stock which he saw in Spain. Admiral Sulivan, R.N., had ample opportunities of observing the wild pigs on Eagle Islet in the Falklands; and he informs me that they resembled wild boars with bristly ridged backs and large tusks. The pigs which have run wild in the province of Buenos Ayres (Rengger 'Saugethiere' s. 331) have not reverted to the wild type. De Blainville 'Osteographie' page 132 refers to two skulls of domestic pigs sent from Patagonia by Al. d'Orbigny, and he states that they have the occipital elevation of the wild European boar, but that the head altogether is [...] "plus courte et plus ramassee." [...] He refers also to the skin of a <b>feral</b> <b>pig</b> from North America, and says [...] "il ressemble tout a fait a un petit sanglier, mais il est presque tout noir, et peut-etre un peu plus ramasse dans ses formes." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Feral</b> <b>pigs</b> (S. scrofa) were {{introduced}} to the Pantanal region around 200 years ago and the population appears to be in expansion. Its eradication is considered to be impossible. The population of <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> in the Pantanal wetlands is currently estimated at one million. Two scientific excursions were organized. The first was conducted during the dry season, when 21 <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> were captured and the second was during the wet season, when 23 <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> were captured. Ticks were collected and the oviposition and hatching process were studied to confirm the biological success of each tick species. Three tick species were found to be feeding on feral pigs: Amblyomma cajennense, A. parvum, and Ornithodoros rostratus. During the dry season, 178 adult A. cajennense were collected, contrasting with 127 A. cajennense specimens in the wet season. This suggests that the seasonality of these ticks in the Brazilian Pantanal wetlands could be different from other regions. The results indicate that A. parvum and A. cajennense are biologically successful parasites in relation to <b>feral</b> <b>pigs.</b> A. cajennense appears to have adapted to this tick-host relationship, as well as the areas where <b>feral</b> <b>pigs</b> are abundant, and could {{play a role in the}} amplification of this tick population. 201...|$|R
