2500|$|The {{three factors}} that held back the {{development}} of the industry simultaneously underwent subtle but historic changes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1973, Britain entered the European Economic Community, which required the ending of historic trade terms for New Zealand meat and dairy products. This led ultimately to a dramatic restructuring of the agricultural economy. Before this restructuring was fully implemented, diversification away from traditional protein products to products with potentially higher <b>economic</b> <b>returns</b> was explored. Vines, which produce best in low moisture and low soil fertility environments, were seen as suitable for areas that had previously been marginal pasture.

40|$|CONTEXT: In 1997, Congress {{authorized}} the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to grant 6 -month extensions of marketing rights through the Pediatric Exclusivity Program if industry sponsors complete FDA-requested pediatric trials. The {{program has been}} praised for creating incentives for studies in children and has been criticized as a "windfall" to the innovator drug industry. This critique has been {{a substantial part of}} congressional debate on the program, which is due to expire in 2007. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> to industry for completing pediatric exclusivity trials. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cohort study of programs conducted for pediatric exclusivity. Nine drugs that were granted pediatric exclusivity were selected. From the final study reports submitted to the FDA (2002 - 2004), key elements of the clinical trial design and study operations were obtained, and the cost of performing each study was estimated and converted into estimates of after-tax cash outflows. Three-year market sales were obtained and converted into estimates of after-tax cash inflows based on 6 months of additional market protection. Net <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> (cash inflows minus outflows) and net return-to-costs ratio (net <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> divided by cash outflows) for each product were then calculated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Net <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> and net return-to-cost ratio. RESULTS: The indications studied reflect a broad representation of the program: asthma, tumors, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, hypertension, depression/generalized anxiety disorder, diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux, bacterial infection, and bone mineralization. The distribution of net <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> for 6 months of exclusivity varied substantially among products (net <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> ranged from -$ 8. 9 million to $ 507. 9 million and net return-to-cost ratio ranged from - 0. 68 to 73. 63). CONCLUSIONS: The <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> for pediatric exclusivity is variable. As an incentive to complete much-needed clinical trials in children, pediatric exclusivity can generate lucrative returns or produce more modest returns on investment...|$|R

40|$|Many {{groups and}} {{individuals}} are involved in decision making for the allocation of the salmon resource. A comprehensive study of the economics of salmon ranching in New Zealand has not previously been undertaken. Before informed decisions can be made, such a study is essential. In this project, the economic potential of salmon ranching is examined, and the major variables that influence the <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> are identified. Preliminary to the economic analysis, the features of commercial salmon ranching in New Zealand are outlined. Quinnat salmon biology is described, and the environmental parameters that influence the operation of a salmon ranch are discussed. The history of commercial harvesting of salmon in New Zealand is detailed, along with the influence of salmon anglers on ranching policy. Local and export markets for salmon are examined for each product category, and the prospects in the major markets are assessed. A simulation model that incorporates the important linkages between biological and economic variables is developed. The model is {{used to determine the}} net benefits to the nation from operating a salmon ranch. Subsequently, the sensitivity of <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> to the biological and economic variables is tested. Finally, the model is used to evaluate the effect of three aspects of salmon management policy on <b>economic</b> <b>return,</b> namely; ranch location, other forms of salmon aquaculture, and disposal of salmon caught at sea. Results show that salmon ranching can yield an "acceptable" <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> to the nation under certain conditions. <b>Economic</b> <b>return</b> is found to be most sensitive to the biological variables of hatchery carrying capacity, hatchery mortality, and survival of released salmon. Market price and feed costs are identified as the most significant of the economic variables. Ranch location is revealed to be a crucial factor in determining the <b>economic</b> <b>return</b> from salmon ranching. Taking these results into account, the characteristics of a salmon ranching investment are examined and found to diverge significantly from alternative investments. From this, it is concluded that unless salmon ranches can be located at or near river mouths, development of a salmon ranching industry that also enhances the sports fishery is unlikely to occur...|$|R
