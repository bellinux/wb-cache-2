It was the last of several attempts to depart on his mission; previous efforts had to be called off due to mechanical problems or poor weather. Wearing a leather flying suit bearing the rank of captain, he brought along a supply of money and toiletries, a torch, a camera, maps and charts, and a collection of 28 different medicines, as well as dextrose tablets to help ward off <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> an assortment of homeopathic remedies.|$|E

The team let slip a two-goal lead against Bayern Munich at Highbury on 5 December 2000, before winning 1–0 at Olympique Lyonnais to keep their {{aspirations}} of qualifying for the quarter-finals attainable. In the reverse fixture, an equaliser scored by Edmílson in the last minute of normal time prompted Wenger to rue <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> the absence of captain Adams. Arsenal defeated Spartak Moscow by a solitary goal {{and in spite of}} losing to Bayern Munich on 14 March 2001, Lyon's draw with Spartak Moscow meant Arsenal qualified for the quarter-finals by the head-to-head rule.|$|E

5|$|Gout {{can present}} in {{multiple}} ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsal-phalangeal joint {{at the base}} of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> a high fever.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression).

5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, <b>fatigue,</b> <b>and</b> carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E

The 79th Infantry Regiment, which had been defending the area around the Lakes, was ordered to move back to Kalasa and Sio, while the 80th Infantry Regiment, having been located around Kuanko, followed the 79th and moved east towards the coast.|$|E

The two subscales were moderately correlated at 0.57, suggesting that the physical and psychological aspects of depression are related rather than totally distinct.|$|E

5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, <b>fatigue,</b> <b>and</b> a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the contribution of cognitive, emotional and personality factors to the experience of fatigue severity in healthy adult individuals. Specifically, the study examined whether <b>fatigue</b> catastrophising <b>and</b> emotional distress mediated the relationships between neuroticism, general irrational and rational thoughts to fatigue severity. One hundred and eighty nine university students and community volunteers completed self-report questionnaires assessing <b>fatigue</b> catastrophising <b>and</b> symptom severity, neuroticism, general rational and irrational thoughts and emotional distress. A series of correlational and path analyses were conducted to test the study hypotheses. Neuroticism and more general negative, irrational cognitions were associated with elevated <b>fatigue</b> catastrophising <b>and</b> <b>fatigue</b> severity, whereas more adaptive, rational cognitions were related to lower <b>fatigue</b> catastrophising <b>and</b> <b>fatigue</b> severity. Both elevated <b>fatigue</b> catastrophising <b>and</b> emotional distress uniquely and simultaneously mediated the relationships between irrational and rational cognitions <b>and</b> neuroticism to <b>fatigue</b> severity. These findings demonstrate that cognitions play a role in fatigue severity. The results have implications in the assessment <b>and</b> treatment of <b>fatigue</b> disturbances in the general community. 19 page(s...|$|R
5|$|Egyptian troops {{raised their}} {{national}} flag {{on the eastern}} bank of the canal at 14:35. By that time company and battalion-size units of Israeli tanks and infantry began reaching the Bar Lev Line, but were prevented from reaching their positions by Egyptian ambushes. Those tanks that broke through came under fire {{from the west bank}} ramparts. At 14:45, a second wave of infantry landed on the opposite bank. Subsequent waves of infantry arrived at fifteen-minute intervals. However, after the fourth wave, <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> technical problems with the boats gradually widened the time intervals. The Egyptians abandoned their schedules, giving priority to anti-tank teams and weaponry that could critically affect the battle. Amphibious vehicles were also used to cross equipment. The wooden carts were ferried to the east bank via boats, where they were initially lifted {{to the top of the}} sand wall with their loads. However, this method proved clumsy, and the carts were first emptied then lifted, after which they were re-loaded and dragged to troops on the front line. The carts greatly facilitated the supply and transportation of matériel on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth David Ltd {{was never}} more than {{modestly}} profitable, but David would not lower her standards {{in search of a}} commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but she was always in the minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered from chronic <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> swollen, ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fatigue</b> <b>and</b> {{the huge}} {{cost of the}} indecisive battles {{eventually}} led Harald to seek peace with Sweyn, and in 1064 (or 1065 according to Morkinskinna) the two kings agreed on an unconditional peace agreement. By the agreement, they retained their respective kingdoms with the former boundaries, {{and there would be}} no payments of reparations. In the subsequent winter of 1065, Harald travelled through his realm and accused the farmers of withholding taxes from him. In response, he acted with brutality, and had peopled maimed and killed as a warning to those who disobeyed him. Harald maintained control of his nation through the use of his hird, a private standing army maintained by Norwegian lords. Harald's contribution to the strengthening of Norway's monarchy was the enforcement of a policy that only the king could retain a hird, thus centralising power away from local warlords.|$|E
