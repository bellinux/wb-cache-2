The sphenocorona (J86) and the sphenomegacorona (J88) are other Johnson solids that, like the square antiprism, consist of two squares and an even number of <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangles.</b>|$|R

5|$|The deltoid {{curve is}} {{another type of}} {{curvilinear}} triangle, but {{one in which the}} curves replacing each side of an <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangle</b> are concave rather than convex. It is not composed of circular arcs, but may be formed by rolling one circle within another of three times the radius. Other planar shapes with three curved sides include the arbelos, which is formed from three semicircles with collinear endpoints, and the Bézier triangle.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, tessellations can be {{extended}} to spaces other than the Euclidean plane. The Swiss geometer Ludwig Schläfli pioneered this by defining polyschemes, which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes. These are the analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the Schläfli symbol notation {{to make it easy}} to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangle</b> is {3}, while that for a square is {4}. The Schläfli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.|$|E
5|$|Tessellation or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangle,</b> square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E
50|$|Now the summands on {{the left}} side are the areas of <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangles</b> erected over the sides of the {{original}} triangle and hence the equations states that the sum of areas of the <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangles</b> is always greater or equal than the threefold area of the original triangle.|$|R
40|$|The packing {{problem of}} unit <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangles</b> {{not only has}} the {{theoretical}} significance but also offers broad prospects in material processing and network resource optimization. Because this problem is nondeterministic polynomial (NP) hard and has the feature of continuity, it is necessary to limit the placements of unit <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangles</b> before optimizing and obtaining approximate solution (e. g., the unit <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangles</b> are not allowed to be rotated). This paper adopts a new quasi-human strategy to study the packing problem of unit <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangles.</b> Some new concepts are put forward such as side-clinging action, and an approximation algorithm for solving the addressed problem is designed. Time complexity analysis and the calculation results indicate that the proposed method is a polynomial time algorithm, which provides the possibility to solve the packing problem of arbitrary triangles...|$|R

5|$|The angles made by {{each pair}} of arcs {{at the corners of}} a Reuleaux {{triangle}} are all equal to 120°. This is the sharpest possible angle at any vertex of any curve of constant width. Additionally, among the curves of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle is the one with both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest <b>equilateral</b> <b>triangle</b> inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant width.|$|E
