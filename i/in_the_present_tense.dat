It incorporates themes relating to philosophy, class consciousness, and personal conflict. The events and ideas of the novel are presented through the thoughts and reactions, interleaved throughout the novel, of two narrators, Renée and Paloma. The changes of narrator are marked by switches of typeface. In the case of Paloma, the narration {{takes the form of}} her written journal entries and other philosophical reflections; Renée's story is also told in the first person but more novelistically and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Tati is an ergative language, i.e. [...] "with {{transitive}} verbs the subject/agent of {{the verb}} is expressed by <b>the</b> direct case <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>tenses,</b> but by <b>the</b> oblique <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past tenses, whereas <b>the</b> direct object/patient <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>tenses</b> is {{expressed by the}} oblique, but by <b>the</b> direct <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past".Khalkhali {{is one of the}} Tati dialects spoken in Shahrood and Xorsh-rostam districts of Khalkhal. Khalkhali Tati is distinguished from other dialects producing ergative structures, because of the adherence of verb to semantic object, in number, person and specially in gender. Meanwhile, according to some evidence in this dialect, apart from past transitive verbs, some intransitive verbs are influenced by the ergative structure.|$|R

Building upon the ideas of the other and Said's work on orientialism, Gregory critiques the economic policy, military apparatus, and transnational corporations as vehicles driving present day colonialism.

500|$|The novel uses a third-person {{narrative}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> with {{a somber}} tone {{reminiscent of a}} [...] "low-level post-apocalypticism". Cayce's memories of the September 11, 2001 attacks, which briefly use the future tense, are told by Gibson as [...] "a Benjaminian seed of time", as one reviewer calls it, because of the monistic and lyrical descriptions of Cayce's relationship to objects with the attacks in the background. Two neologisms appear in the novel: gender-bait and mirror-world. Gibson created the term mirror-world to acknowledge a locational-specific distinction in a manufactured object that emerged from a parallel development process, for example opposite-side driving or varied electrical outlets. Gender-bait refers to a male posing as a female online to elicit positive responses. The term coolhunter, not coined by Gibson but used in the marketing industry for several years, is used to describe Cayce's profession of identifying the roots of emerging trends.|$|E
500|$|We're New Here {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 83, based on 28 reviews. AllMusic's Thom Jurek called it [...] "a mercurial collaboration ... full of nods to other club styles and eras", and praised Jamie xx for [...] "successfully (re)presenting Scott-Heron's music — integrity intact — <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> to a fickle yet discerning groove-centric culture without kitsch or excess". Chris Martins from The A.V. Club praised [...] "the everlasting gravity of ’s words and wisdom", writing that [...] "his pained, bluesy musings are as universally human {{as they are}} perennially pertinent ... Scott-Heron talks, sings, hums, and pontificates, sometimes over the beat and sometimes from deep within the snowdrift". Pitchfork Media critic Sean Fennessey commended Jamie xx for being bold rather than respectful of Scott-Heron's material with a [...] "finicky, hard-charging production [...] trumps Scott-Heron's voice, overpowering it with ideas, if not focus". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times said that the album is an improvement over [...] "the bummed-out original" [...] with [...] "patience and breadth and almost zero pretension". Max Feldman from PopMatters commented that [...] "Ultimately, We’re New Here succeeds because it manages to seamlessly reconcile the different traditions from which it draws—not just Gil Scott Heron’s uttering utterances, but UK Garage, the fibrous gloss of Seventeen Seconds-era The Cure, and R futurism".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Independent, James Urquhart found the novel to be [...] "richly textured" [...] {{and that it}} had [...] "energetic, acutely {{observed}} characters"; stating [...] "Miller populates Baratte's quest for equanimity with these lush and tart characters, seductively fleshed out, who collectively help to deliver the [...] resolution of Baratte's professional and personal travails." [...] Clare Clark, writing for The Guardian, found that [...] "Miller is a writer of subtlety and skill" [...] and stated that she found the novel to be much like a parable, stating that [...] "Unlike many parables, however, Pure is neither laboured nor leaden. Miller writes like a poet, with a deceptive simplicity – his sentences and images are intense distillations, conjuring the fleeting details of existence with clarity." [...] Clark {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Pure defies the ordinary conventions of storytelling, slipping dream-like between lucidity and a kind of abstracted elusiveness. The characters are often opaque. The narrative lacks dramatic structure, unfolding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> much as life does, without clear shape or climax" [...] and found that [...] "The result is a book that is unsettling and, ultimately, optimistic." [...] The Australian's Jennifer Levasseur found Pure to be [...] "Well-executed and inventive", stating that she found the plot [...] "Historically convincing, immediately engaging and intellectually stimulating". She went on to state, of Miller himself: [...] "Miller is the calibre of writer who deserves to be followed regardless of topic, time period or setting because of his astonishing dexterity with language, his piercing observations and his ability to combine rollicking storytelling with depth of character." ...|$|E
