5|$|Match Point (2005), a film by Woody Allen borrows many {{elements}} from the novel, in <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> is {{loosely based on}} it. In the movie the name of Dostoyevsky is referred to in several occasions.|$|E
5|$|According to Plateau's laws, the {{circular}} arcs in two-dimensional soap bubble clusters meet at 120° angles, the same angle {{found at the}} corners of a Reuleaux triangle. Based on this <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> is possible to construct clusters in which some of the bubbles {{take the form of a}} Reuleaux triangle.|$|E
5|$|All {{agreements}} {{were not}} actually {{made in the}} North Atlantic Council meeting, but in <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was made in Istanbul Summit, 2003, except for {{the signing of the}} missile defense contract which happened on 28 November. The Council meeting was held on 29 November.|$|E

5|$|Parachutes was {{recognised}} to have {{an alternative}} rock sound similar to English band Radiohead in their Bends era. In <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> {{has been suggested that}} the album's commercial success was due in part to a portion of Radiohead's audience being alienated by the band's experimental and more electronic-influenced Kid A album.|$|E
5|$|Some {{fans have}} {{suggested}} that our new Enterprise should carry a plaque somewhere which commemorates the <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was named after the first space shuttle launched from Earth in 1970s. This is an intriguing idea. It also has publicity advantages if properly released at the right time. It won't hurt NASA's feelings either. I'll leave it to you {{where you want it}} on the vessel.|$|E
5|$|The crucial {{property}} {{turns out}} to be treewidth, a measure of how tree-like the graph is. For a graph G of treewidth at most k and a graph H, the homomorphism problem can be solved in time |V(H)|O(k) with a standard dynamic programming approach. In <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> is enough to assume that the core of G has treewidth at most k. This holds even if the core is not known.|$|E

5|$|The expeditionary corps {{was made}} up of nine {{infantry}} regiments: Régiment d’Infanterie] says that this regiment left for the Morea (in <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> formed part of the replacements that arrived in 1830). The composition of the brigades is that given by A. Hugon, as it is the most precise.|$|E
5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} was the <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was so big. The melody starts off very soft {{but then it}} gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
5|$|Another factor behind Echmarcach's {{actions against}} Sitriuc could concern Knútr. Echmarcach's seizure of Dublin {{occurred}} {{only a year}} after the latter's death in 1035. There appears to be numismatic evidence, annalistic evidence, and charter evidence indicating that Knútr and Sitriuc had cooperated together in terms of trade and military operations in Wales. In contrast to this apparent congeniality, the relationship between Knútr and Echmarcach appears to have been less amiable. In <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> is possible that Echmarcach's meeting with Knútr may have bound him from taking action against Sitriuc, and that the confusion caused by Knútr's demise may have enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation by seizing control of the Irish Sea region.|$|E

5|$|Banksia sessilis {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to dieback {{caused by the}} introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; in <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> is so reliably susceptible that it is considered a good indicator species {{for the presence of}} the disease. Most highly susceptible species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, {{and in the absence of}} hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, B.sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus P.cinnamomi survives at these sites indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought {{it had something to}} do with naval guns.|$|E
5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds. USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> connects the peripheral and host grounds. This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E

5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, {{fears of a}} sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected. To {{be included in the}} eurozone, countries had to fulfil certain convergence criteria, but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.|$|E
5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on <b>fact...</b> <b>It</b> was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
5|$|In 1561, he {{finished}} his Historia General de las Indias and signed {{it over to the}} College of San Gregorio, stipulating that it could not be published until after forty years. In <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was not published for 314 years, finally being done so in 1875. He also had to repeatedly defend himself against accusations of treason: someone, possibly Sepúlveda, denounced him to the Spanish Inquisition, but nothing came from the case. Las Casas also appeared as a witness {{in the case of the}} Inquisition against his friend Archbishop Bartolomé Carranza de Miranda, who had been falsely accused of heresy. In 1565 he wrote his last will, signing over his immense library to the college. Bartolomé de Las Casas died on July 18, 1566, in Madrid.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E
5|$|In {{several other}} locations, {{the tree is}} absent from large areas but still present in a few {{specific}} habitats. An example is the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, where red maple is {{not found in the}} dominant open plains, but is present along streams. Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the Grain Belt, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward the mimic. This involves mimicry of a resource that is often vital to the prey's survival (or more precisely, the survival of its genes) such as nutrition or a mate. If the bait offered is of little value to prey {{they would not be}} expected to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal mimicry it is always the male sex that is deceived (in <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> has been suggested that females of some species have evolved mimicry as a strategy to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but may simply stay still and allow prey to come to it.|$|E

40|$|A {{theory of}} the Generalized nets was used to {{construct}} a generalized net model which describes the possibility to evaluate {{the time of the}} occurrence or completion of the events. Twenty predicates for checking the validity of the special circumstances, related to time-moments of two events were introduced. The model can be used to analyze the specific moments in which the facts have happened. In result we can answer questions such as: “Is the fact valid?” “How many <b>facts</b> <b>it</b> contradicts”, “How many <b>facts</b> <b>it</b> confirms?...|$|R
