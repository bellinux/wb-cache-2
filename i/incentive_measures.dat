However, only less than one third of the respondents see measures such as free parking in city centres, special credit offers with lower interest rates, or information campaigns as inevitable requirements for the purchase decision. Nevertheless, most of the interviewed persons regard these measures as an appropriate <b>incentive.</b> Overall, <b>measures</b> that give electric cars an advantage compared to conventional cars are welcomed by the majority of the consumers as appropriate <b>incentives.</b> <b>Measures</b> in disadvantage for conventional cars such as restricted access to certain areas in cities and an increase of fuel costs car are rather rejected by the majority of the respondents.|$|R

Subjects participate in choice experiments with monetary <b>incentives</b> <b>measuring</b> risk aversion, and impatience over an annual horizon, and conduct two different, widely used, tests of cognitive ability. We find that lower cognitive ability is associated with greater risk aversion, and more pronounced impatience. These relationships are significant, and robust to controlling for personal characteristics, education, income, and measures of credit constraints. We perform a series of additional robustness checks, which help rule out other possible confounds. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the sales force {{compensation}} metric {{is to determine the}} mix of salary, bonus, and commission that will maximize sales generated by the sales force. When designing a compensation plan for a sales force, managers face four key considerations: level of pay, mix between salary and <b>incentive,</b> <b>measures</b> of performance, and performance-payout relationships. The level of pay, or compensation, is the amount that a company plans to pay a salesperson {{over the course of a}} year. This can be viewed as a range, because its total will vary with bonuses or commissions.|$|E
3000|$|Tables  8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 in Appendix present {{descriptive}} statistics (mean, standard deviation and selected percentiles) {{for the different}} <b>incentives</b> <b>measures.</b> 7 As {{can be seen in}} Table  10, the mean of SSA F [...] is positive except for the age of 65. That is, continuing to work at ages 60 – 64, instead of fully retiring, comes with a gain in terms of SSW. Equivalently, there is an implicit subsidy (negative implicit tax) on postponing 1  year full retirement between 60 and 64, as can be observed in Table  11. On the contrary, at the age of 65 there is an implicit tax on further labour force participation. In the case of partial retirement, the tax on continue working arrives at an earlier age. Moreover, the mean peak value decreases with age and eventually becomes negative both in case of full and partial retirement, {{as can be seen in}} Table  12. This means that the gain in terms of SSW resulting from delaying retirement until a period with much higher SSW fades with age, and more rapidly in case of partial retirement. The analysis of the different <b>incentives</b> <b>measures</b> goes in favour of the idea outlined in the introduction: the non-applicability of reduction coefficients in case of partial retirement before the age of 65 is a potential source of making this exit route a dominant strategy against early retirement.|$|R
30|$|To {{properly}} evaluate {{how social}} security incentives affect {{the choice between}} alternative retirement routes we study the impact that delta social security wealth has on each hazard rate. Remember from Sect.  4.2 that this <b>incentive</b> <b>measure</b> provides an assessment about how much partial retirement exceeds full retirement in terms of SSW. Table  5 reports {{the results of the}} estimation where we only include as social security incentives the DSSW and the SSA. As we can observe, the DSSW has the expected sign and its coefficient is statistically significant. DSSW affects negatively the hazard rate to full retirement and positively the hazard rate to partial retirement.|$|R
3000|$|In {{relation}} to the peak value, we observe in columns 2 a and 2 b of Table  4 that PV F [...] has an unexpected positive sign to the hazard rate to full retirement while PV P [...] has the expected negative sign to the hazard rate to partial retirement. These findings suggest that forward-looking <b>measures</b> of economic <b>incentives</b> do influence retirement decisions {{but only in the}} case of partial retirement. So, full retirement decisions could be postponed 1  year but no more than this. However, the assumption that the maximum full retirement age allowed is 66 could reduce the potential strength of the peak value as an <b>incentive</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|R

Further, some treaties provide for tax sparing credits whereby the tax credit allowed is not only with respect to tax actually paid in the other treaty country but also from tax which would have been otherwise payable {{had it not been for}} <b>incentive</b> <b>measures</b> in that other country which result in exemption or reduction of tax.|$|E

50|$|The Moroccan government has been {{implementing}} {{reforms to}} improve the quality of education and make research more responsive to socio-economic needs. In May 2009, Morocco's prime minister, Abbas El Fassi, announced greater support for science during a meeting at the National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research. The aim was to give universities greater financial autonomy from the government to make them more responsive to research needs and better able to forge links with the private sector, in the hope that this would nurture a culture of entrepreneurship in academia. He announced that investment in science and technology would rise from US$620,000 in 2008 to US$8.5 million (69 million Moroccan dirhams) in 2009, in order to finance the refurbishment and construction of laboratories, training courses for researchers in financial management, a scholarship programme for postgraduate research and <b>incentive</b> <b>measures</b> for companies prepared to finance research, such as giving them access to scientific results that they could then use to develop new products.|$|E
50|$|The government's role in {{promoting}} industry increased in the postwar era, and in 1955 the Stroessner government undertook the country's first industrial census. Over the next twenty years, the government enacted a number of industrial <b>incentive</b> <b>measures,</b> {{the most important of}} which was Law 550. Law 550 promoted exportoriented industries or those that would save foreign exchange. It also provided liberal fiscal incentives for companies to develop specific areas of the country, especially the departments of Alto Paraguay, Nueva Asunción, Chaco, and Boquerón. Incentives for business were related mostly to import-duty exemptions, but they included a variety of tax breaks and placed no restrictions on foreign ownership. Approximately one-fourth of all new manufacturing investment from 1975 to 1985 was registered under Law 550. Most foreign investments originated from Brazil, West Germany, the United States, Portugal, and Argentina in that order of importance. The dynamic processes of agricultural colonization and hydroelectric development, combined with such attractive industrial incentives, caused manufacturing to grow at an unprecedented rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E

Hence both vary with the business cycle. In order to overcome endogeneity problems in explaining unemployment of the young, we resort to a simulated variable: “the inducement to retire”, which is constructed by simulating the social security benefits.

We justify the occurrence of TR alternatives and quantify the impact of the marking-to-market feature imbedded in the new accounting rules.

40|$|Abstract. An {{evolutionary}} game model between manufacturers {{is established}} {{to study the}} influence of government <b>incentive</b> <b>measures</b> for the EOL product recovery {{based on the assumption}} that all manufacturers have bounded rationality. Analysis on stable state shows that the evolutionary stable state does not always exist in the model.

Simulation results illustrate that there exists a reasonable range of the lowest recovery ratio within which government <b>incentive</b> <b>measures</b> work well and the fixed reward can expand the width of the reasonable range.

Our analysis tries to assess {{the importance of the}} financial incentives built into the social security system. The basic idea is very simple: at any given age, and based on the available information, workers compare theexpected present value of two alternatives: retiring today or working one more year, and then choose the best one. A key role in this kind of comparisons is played by social security wealth, whose level and changes reflect the expectations about the profile of future earnings and the institutional features of the social security system.
