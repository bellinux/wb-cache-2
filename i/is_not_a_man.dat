5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|In {{the comic}} book {{adaptation}} of , Batwoman (Kate Kane) appears {{as a member of}} Batman's Insurgency. She is also married to Renee Montoya in this continuity. At the end of the Year Three series she and Huntress fight Wonder Woman of Superman's Regime, with the latter being accidentally killed by the Amazon; while Wonder Woman is shocked by this, a furious Kate beats her into submission. Her grudge towards Wonder Woman continues into Year Four, where she also suffers the death of Renee after she overdosed on enhancement pills. When the Regime and the Greek Gods battle at the Hall of Justice, Kate gets revenge on Wonder Woman by strangling her with her own Lasso of Truth, recreating Huntress' experience. However, while she acknowledged she wants Diana dead, she lets her live as a sign that she is a better person. In Year Five, when an underground resistance is built up and named after the Joker, she confronts them in their hideout and tells them the Joker <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who should be honored. In the conclusion of the series, she seemingly sacrifices herself when she helped transport the other universe's Justice League to their world.|$|E

Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

25|$|The obscure word sōpiō (gen. sōpiōnis) {{seemed to}} mean a sexualized {{caricature}} with an abnormally large penis, such as the Romans were known to draw. It appears in Catullus 37: frontem tabernae sopionibus scribam ("I will draw sopios {{on the front of}} the tavern") and in graffiti from Pompeii: ut merdas edatis, qui scripseras sopionis ("whoever drew sopios, let him eat shit!'") The grammarian Sacerdos preserves a quotation about Pompey, that says quem non pudet et rubet, non est homo, sed sopio ("whoever is not ashamed, and does not blush, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> but a sopio.") Sōpiō would appear to describe drawings such as that of the god Mercury in the illustration.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1559, it became evident that Elizabeth {{was in love with}} her {{childhood}} friend Robert Dudley. It was said that Amy Robsart, his wife, was suffering from a [...] "malady in one of her breasts" [...] and that the Queen would like to marry Dudley if his wife should die. By the autumn of 1559, several foreign suitors were vying for Elizabeth's hand; their impatient envoys engaged in ever more scandalous talk and reported that a marriage with her favourite was not welcome in England: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who does not cry out on him and her with indignation... she will marry none but the favoured Robert". Amy Dudley died in September 1560, from a fall from a flight of stairs and, despite the coroner's inquest finding of accident, many people suspected Dudley of having arranged her death so that he could marry the queen. Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley for some time. However, William Cecil, Nicholas Throckmorton, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear. There were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place.|$|E
500|$|Analysis of the {{construction}} of tower houses has focused on two key driving forces. The first is that {{the construction}} of these castles appears to have been linked to periods of instability and insecurity in the areas concerned. In Scotland James IV's forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles in 1494 led to an immediate burst of castle building across the region and, over the longer term, an increased degree of clan warfare, while the subsequent wars with England in the 1540s added to the level of insecurity over the rest of the century. Irish tower houses were built {{from the end of the}} 14th century onward as the countryside disintegrated into the unstable control of a large number of small lordships and Henry VI promoted their construction with financial rewards in a bid to improve security. English tower houses were built along the frontier with Scotland in a dangerous and insecure period. Secondly, and paradoxically, appears to have been the periods of relative prosperity. Contemporary historian William Camden observed of the northern English and the Scots, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> amongst them of a better sort that hath not his little tower or pile", and many tower houses seem to have been built as much as status symbols as defensive structures. Along the English-Scottish borders the construction pattern follows the relative prosperity of the different side: the English lords built tower houses primarily in the early 15th century, when northern England was particularly prosperous, while their Scottish equivalents built them in late 15th and early 16th centuries, boom periods in the economy of Scotland. In Ireland the growth of tower houses during the 15th century mirrors the rise of cattle herding and the resulting wealth that this brought to many of the lesser lords in Ireland.|$|E
500|$|A proclamation: In {{the markets}} {{of the city}} the profits from {{commerce}} are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages {{are not allowed to}} sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this [...] "the boxing of the community family." [...] They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two {{at the end of the}} year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.|$|E

[...] Metacritic reports a 65 out of 100 rating based on 9 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and praised Hunt's performance: [...] "Billy Kwan is played, astonishingly, by a woman—Linda Hunt, a New York stage actress who enters the role so fully that it never occurs to us that she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> This is what great acting is, a magical transformation of one person into another". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised Gibson's performance: [...] "If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson (Gallipoli, The Road Warrior), then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence".|$|E
2500|$|Several {{attacks and}} counterattacks shifted the lines {{back and forth}} as Johnson {{received}} more and more reinforcements—McNair's Brigade (commanded by Col. David Coleman), and Deas's and Manigault's brigades from Hindman's division—but many of these men were exhausted. Van Derveer's brigade arrived from the Kelly Field line to beef up the Union defense. Brig. Gen. Patton Anderson's brigade (Hindman's Division) attempted to assault the hill in the gap between Johnson and Kershaw. Despite all the furious activity on Snodgrass Hill, Longstreet was exerting little direction on the battlefield, enjoying a leisurely lunch of bacon and sweet potatoes with his staff in the rear. Summoned to a meeting with Bragg, Longstreet asked the army commander for reinforcements from Polk's stalled wing, even though he had not committed his own reserve, Preston's division. Bragg was becoming distraught and told Longstreet that the battle was being lost, something Longstreet found inexplicable, considering the success of his assault column. Bragg knew, however, that his success on {{the southern end of the}} battlefield was merely driving his opponents to their escape route to Chattanooga and that the opportunity to destroy the Army of the Cumberland had evaporated. After the repeated delays in the morning's attacks, Bragg had lost confidence in his generals on the right wing, and while denying Longstreet reinforcements told him [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in the right wing who has any fight in him." ...|$|E
