Pritchard described the band's most recent album Listen as “percussion sonnets”. “The first couple albums I made <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about rhythms, I {{focused on the}} recording and the lyrics”, Pritchard said.|$|E
500|$|He {{made his}} debut for the Trinidad and Tobago {{national}} team on 29 January 2003 in a match against Finland. Jones scored his first goal on 25 May 2005 in a 4–0 win against Bermuda. He was later selected by Trinidad and Tobago for their 2006 World Cup campaign, {{where he made}} his first appearance in the competition in a 2–0 defeat against England on 15 June 2006 at Frankenstadion, Nuremberg. Jones was named as Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation's Player of the Year for 2007. Jones said, [...] "A lot of big names have won this before and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about something like this happening to me". Jones was named as captain of the Soca Warriors in August 2011 by manager Otto Pfister.|$|E

"It {{would be}} nothing," [...] he resumed, turning round again and {{lowering}} his hammer, [...] "if you hadn't always protested {{that you would}} never marry, but--oh, Jessie, I wonder at a girl who has always been so firm in sticking to her resolves, turning out so fickle. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that the family of Macnab could be brought so low through one of its female members." ...|$|R
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Erlewine—the website's senior editor—claimed that New York Dolls {{was a more}} quintessential proto-punk album {{than any of the}} Stooges' releases because of how it [...] "plunders history while celebrating it, creating a sleazy urban mythology along the way". David Fricke argued that it was a more definitive glam rock album than David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972) or anything by Marc Bolan because of how the band [...] "captured both the glory and sorrow of glam, the high jinx and wasted youth, with electric photorealism". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it an [...] "absolutely essential" [...] record and [...] "epic sleaze, the sound of five young men shaping the big city in their own scuzzy image". Sylvain attributed its influence on punk rock to how Rundgren recorded his guitar through the left speaker and Thunders' guitar on the right side, an orientation which he said younger bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols adopted. Rundgren was amused by how the record became considered a precursor to the punk movement: [...] "The irony is that I wound up producing the seminal punk album, but <b>I</b> was <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> of as a punk producer, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> got called by punk acts. They probably thought I was too expensive for what they were going for. But the Dolls didn't really consider themselves punk." ...|$|R
5000|$|Filming {{began in}} September 1942 and {{continued}} through to December. Jennings {{had decided that}} no professional actors would be brought in, and his entire cast consisted of untrained local people, although he was careful to ensure that nobody appeared on screen without giving their permission and that anyone who felt uneasy or uncomfortable about being filmed was excluded from shots. People were filmed going about their actual daily lives in a largely improvised manner with no script being provided. In {{a letter to his}} wife, he wrote: [...] "Down here I’m working on a reconstruction of the Lidice story in a mining community - but more important than that really is being close to the community itself and living and working inside it, for what it is everyday. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> to live and see the honest Christian and Communist principles acted on {{as a matter of course}} by a large number of British - I won’t say English - people living together." ...|$|R

40|$|From August through November of 2011 I {{worked as}} an intern for the Utah Democratic state party at their state party headquarters. I started my {{internship}} {{around the same time}} as the newly elected chair of the state party, Jim Dabakis, assumed his new role as head of the party. Dabakis did not have the traditional resume of a party chair but rather had his background as an international art dealer and businessman. He had always been politically minded and involved in political causes, but he did not have the extensive partisan politics background that previous chairs had. In anticipation of taking over as chair, Dabakis went on a statewide tour visiting with all of the county party leaders and Utahns from all over the state. When I started my internship Dabakis expressed that he was somewhat perplexed as to why the party was organized in the way that it was. He didn’t understand why each of twenty-nine counties needed its own county party with its own executive committee and its own bureaucratic structure. I realized that, despite my background in political science, <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about this question and had no idea whether there even were state parties that were organized in any other way. I began to ask the same questions as Dabakis. Certainly Salt Lake County, with over one million people living within its boundaries, needs its own county party structure but is the same necessarily true for Daggett or Piute counties that each has less than two thousand residents? If Utah has such a great contrast between counties creating confusion in organizational structure, then it is likely that other states have some unique organizational needs as well. This confusion over the decentralization of party power to the county level rather than some other sub-level spurred several questions. Do parties organize themselves in any other way below the state level in other states? If so, what is the reasoning behind the model of decentralization chosen in various states? Further, if a party chooses a different model of decentralization of state party organization what impact, if any, does this have on electoral success, candidate recruitment, party organizational strength, registration numbers, and other indicators of party success? These questions not only have theoretical grounding, but the answers to these questions have real life application to partisan politics in modern electoral politics in the United States. This paper will conduct a review of literature relating to party integration, summarize the hierarchical organizational structures of the various state parties, examine potential causes and potential consequences of various structure models, and provide a review of surveys and interviews of local party elites to provide useful insight into the aforementioned questions...|$|R
5000|$|In {{her teenage}} years, Sharon's main storylines {{depicted}} {{the plight of}} a young woman struggling to find her identity while growing up in a broken home and coping with her mother's alcoholism and her father's infidelities. Anita Dobson, who played Sharon's mother Angie, discussed Sharon and Angie's relationship, suggesting that Angie was not a good mother: [...] "I think someone handed Sharon over to her one day, and Angie thought of her like this glistening Christmas present. <b>I</b> think she <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> it through beforehand. I do believe she really wanted a child and she loved Sharon, but eventually found the competition pretty difficult to deal with in regard to Den's attentions. She was pretty rough on Sharon because of her drinking." [...] Sally Vincent, writing for The Guardian, has pontificated about the dynamics of Sharon's relationship with both her parents in 2001. She suggested that viewers felt sorry for Sharon [...] "because not only had her birth mother given her away, but her adoptive parents were the legendary Dirty Den and the feckless Angie, erstwhile landlord and lady of the Queen Vic, who were always too busy being dirty and feckless, in our opinion, to take proper care of their little girl. We knew enough about family psychology to know that all those presents they lavished upon her were no substitute for presence. We knew what neglect and emotional absence can do to a growing girl." [...] David Buckingham, in his 1987 book Public Secrets: EastEnders and its audience, analysed the relationship between Sharon and her parents, suggesting that teenage Sharon was suspended between childhood and adulthood. He reflected that Den frequently referred to her as [...] "just a child", but that Sharon herself sought to assert her status as an adult, describing her parents as [...] "immature" [...] or [...] "childish". In character dialogue, Sharon suggested that Den had tried to keep his wife Angie in the role of a baby, but that he himself was a child, stating [...] "I behave more like an adult that you've ever done". During this period, Sharon was shown to question her parents' capability to offer her advice, and both Den and Angie had difficulty refuting her arguments. In one episode Sharon questioned, [...] "How come you two always know what's best for me? You haven't exactly made a good job of your own lives!".|$|R

5000|$|Driver {{was born}} in Zebulon, North Carolina, {{where he grew up}} on a farm. Driver has stated that [...] "I wanted to play music for as long as I can remember.

5000|$|Almost immediately, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the Bruins had received the better of the deal. Neely stated that [...] "I was surprised at the trade. I really didn't know what to expect once I got to Boston and had no idea that my career would turn out the way it did for those ten years. From Day One in training camp, I just wanted to get the opportunity to play. The coaches said, 'Let's see what he can do.' As time went by, I got more and more confidence. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> I'd be a 50-goal scorer, but I was given a chance to contribute offensively, not just physically." ...|$|E
5000|$|The 2006 U.S. champion, Blanchard {{retired in}} 2007. She told the Houston Chronicle: [...] "I had some {{complications}} with {{the gym and}} the coach. I just had {{to get away from}} it all." [...] During her eight-month break she worked out with her brother, a body builder, but didn't bounce on a trampoline at all. But once the U.S. secured a wildcard Olympic spot, Blanchard reconsidered her retirement: [...] "When I walked away, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> of the Olympics as a possibility." [...] After a rough first day back, Blanchard said that it took her about a month to relearn most of her skills.|$|E

5000|$|It is Brown's {{first in}} a long {{association}} with Bo Ramsey as producer and instrumentalist. In an interview with Roy Kasten for No Depression magazine, Brown said of Ramsey: “We had met {{a long time before}} we played together; we both had bands in town, late ’70s or early ’80s. We talked a little, Bo had some idea that we should do something. He had heard one of my records and said he thought it really needed work... Bo has really taught me to enjoy the studio. Nine-tenths of what we do is live, but it’s a different approach; it’s relaxed and thoughtful. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> of making a record before then.” ...|$|E

But {{a lot of what}} we have is based on lies and deceit. They only teach you what they want you to know. I hope people will see the title and check it out. Next time you listen to `Wounded Knee', try and put the story and the music together. The rhythm and the pulse, there is an element of it that is angry then peaceful." ...|$|E

5000|$|Downes {{claimed the}} group's name derived as a pun {{on the rock}} band the Beatles, saying: [...] "It was {{originally}} called the Bugs ... studio insects—imaginary creatures who lived in recording studios creating havoc. Then somebody said as a joke that the Bugs would never {{be as big as}} The Beatles. So we changed it to the Buggles." [...] Horn later spoke of its name: [...] "I know the name's awful, but {{at the time it was}} the era of the great punk thing. I'd got fed up of producing people who were generally idiots but called themselves all sorts of clever names like the Unwanted, the Unwashed, the Unheard ... when it came to choosing our name I thought I'd pick the most disgusting name possible. In retrospect I have frequently regretted calling myself Buggles, but in those days <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> much about packaging or selling myself, all that really concerned me was the record." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song {{represented}} a temporary resurgence in Smith's recording career, after a six-year hiatus. Robert K. Oermann and A. Mary Bufwakck of Finding Her Voice: The History of Women in Country Music explained Smith's choice of leaving and re-entering the music business, [...] "I have never regretted that decision. I {{was sick and}} tired of it all. There just wasn't enough of me to go around. I nursed all three of my girls on the road. I couldn't keep doing what I was doing in church and with my family and the career. I couldn't afford someone to clean my house and do all that stuff. So the only thing I could give up was the singing. And <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> I'd go back to it." [...] Following the release of a second single in 1986, Smith went into semi-retirement again. She officially returned to recording and performing in 1998 with the release of her self-titled studio album.|$|E
