50|$|The Intermountain <b>Intertie</b> is {{the biggest}} linked {{repeater}} system {{in the state of}} Utah. The Intermountain <b>Intertie</b> covers areas west of the Wasatch Front, from Saint George to Tremonton. The Intermountain <b>Intertie</b> also covers areas in the northwest of Utah up to Boise, Idaho and to the northeast to Rock Springs, Wyoming. The <b>Intertie</b> reaches into parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Arizona. There are no Intermountain <b>Intertie</b> repeaters headed east from I-15 on I-70; in this area, the Sinbad Desert Amateur Radio Club <b>Intertie</b> has substantial coverage.|$|E
50|$|The Hidden Peak Repeater, {{on top of}} the Snowbird Tram, is {{the primary}} hub {{repeater}} for the Intermountain <b>Intertie.</b> Linked directly to Hidden Peak is Farnsworth Peak, which connects to southern and western Utah. Also connected to Hidden Peak is Malad Pass, a Simplex Carrier Squealch linking Idaho to the <b>Intertie,</b> Medicine Butte in Evanston, Wyoming connecting Wyoming to the <b>Intertie,</b> and Laketown, Utah connecting Bear Lake to the <b>Intertie.</b> Each of the repeaters connecting to Hidden Peak has repeaters connected to them.|$|E
25|$|Because Los Angeles {{is older}} than most other cities in California, the LADWP is {{currently}} faced with several unique issues. Most of the power lines in Los Angeles were built above-ground before it became customary to run power lines below-ground; as a result, the horizon line of the typical Los Angeles boulevard looks much more cluttered than boulevards in most Southern California cities. Starting in 2007, LADWP has a long-term project to upgrade the overhead power lines and convert them to underground. This difficult conversion has been slowed by budget constraints, the impact on traffic, the pursuit of other modernization projects, and the lingering effects of a workforce reduction over the last decade. Budget issues are particularly acute in the department's transmission system, where underground transmission costs about 10 to 14 times the cost of overhead transmission, per unit length, and the technical and environmental challenges which confront such installations. Additionally, undergrounding of the three 500 kV transmission lines (five lines, if the Pacific AC <b>Intertie's</b> two 500 kV lines terminating in Los Angeles are included) is presently technically infeasible. Upgrading the overhead lines {{is expected to take}} 10 to 15 years. The upgrading of LADWP's overhead power lines consists of eliminating the V-shape brackets on the power poles that are holding up the crossarm and replacing them with cross-brackets that are put on the crossarm. Some of the wooden power poles are being replaced with metal poles.|$|R

50|$|The Pacific DC <b>Intertie</b> is {{the other}} HVDC line serving Los Angeles. This HVDC line is owned and {{operated}} by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). HVDC lines such as the Intermountain line and the Pacific DC <b>Intertie</b> can be distinguished by having two transmission wires, rather than the three necessary for transmission of three phase AC power.|$|E
50|$|The <b>intertie</b> {{originates}} {{near the}} Columbia River at the Celilo Converter Station of Bonneville Power Administration's grid outside The Dalles, Oregon and {{is connected to}} the Sylmar Converter Station north of Los Angeles, which is owned by five utility companies and managed by LADWP. The <b>Intertie</b> can transmit power in either direction, but power flows mostly from north to south.|$|E

50|$|The Pacific <b>Intertie</b> takes {{advantage}} of differing power demand patterns between the northwestern and southwestern US. During winter, the northern region operates electrical heating devices while the southern portion uses relatively little electricity. In summer, the north uses little electricity while the south reaches peak demand due to air conditioning usage. Any time the <b>Intertie</b> demand lessens, the excess is distributed elsewhere on the western power grid (states west of the Great Plains, including Colorado and New Mexico).|$|E

50|$|California Oregon <b>Intertie</b> (COI), {{identified}} as Path 66 by Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), is a corridor of three roughly parallel 500 kV alternating current power lines connecting the electric grids of Oregon and California.

50|$|For {{countries}} that are trending away from coal fired baseload plants and towards intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar, there is a corresponding increase in the need for peaking or load following power plants {{and the use of}} a grid <b>intertie.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since the interties may {{consist of}} {{multiple}} power-lines, the maximum voltage used {{is shown in}} the table below. Some of the links such as Path 65, the Pacific DC <b>Intertie,</b> do consist of a single transmission line, so the maximum voltage is the voltage used.|$|E
50|$|BPA now markets the {{electricity}} from thirty-one federal hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River and its tributaries, {{as well as}} from the Columbia Generating Station, a nuclear plant located on the Hanford Site in eastern Washington. BPA has more than 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of electrical lines and 300 substations in the Pacific Northwest and controls approximately 75 percent of the high-voltage (230 kV and higher) transmission capacity in the region. BPA also maintains connection lines with other power grids, the California high-voltage transmission system by Path 66, which consists of the two 500 kV AC lines of the Pacific AC <b>Intertie,</b> plus a third 500 kV AC line of the California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) (managed by the Balancing Authority of Northern California). Together these three lines are operated as the California-Oregon <b>Intertie</b> (COI) (managed by the California Independent System Operator). An additional DC +/- 500 kV line, the Pacific DC <b>Intertie,</b> links BPA's grid at the Celilo Converter Station near The Dalles, Oregon to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) grid 800 miles (1,300 km) away at the Sylmar Converter Station in Los Angeles.BPA uses helicopters to sling load maintenance workers inspecting and repairing power lines.|$|E

50|$|SR 397 {{became a}} state highway in 1991, and the highway {{designation}} took effect on April 1, 1992. When SR 397 was originally created, it started about one mile (1.6 km) north {{of its current}} southern ending. It was later extended in 1993. The I-82 to SR 397 <b>Intertie</b> is a new 2-lane roadway being constructed from I-82/US 395 at exit 114 to SR 397 in Finley. The road, {{which is expected to}} be 11.03 mi long and the highway from I-82/US 395 to Olympia Street, about 3.24 mi long, was completed in November 2004. The second section of the road, from Olympia Street to Finley Road, about 5.39 mi long, was completed in 2005. The third segment, from Finley Road to SR 397, about 2.40 mi long, was expected to be completed in 2005, but is still under construction as of October 2008. In addition, the <b>intertie</b> is funded by multiple funding partners, which are listed on a sign at the current end of the <b>intertie.</b> WSDOT, a state fuel tax, Benton County, the Federal Reserve, and the Port of Kennewick funded this project and the project's engineer is JUB Engineers, Inc., and the contractor for the project is Steelman-Duff Inc. Also, the road is officially called County Route 397, but WSDOT considers it an extension or part of SR 397.|$|E
