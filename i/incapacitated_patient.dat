In the United States, individual patient autonomy is the primary guidepost for making end of life decisions for <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patients.</b> In the United Kingdom, patient preference is openly and deliberately supplemented with a careful consideration of the patient’s best interest. To contrast the two approaches, the Essay focuses on two cases involving patients in permanent vegetative states (PVS) for whom little was known about their respective individual preferences, and it analyzes the differences in conceptualization and resolution of disputes concerning these patients’ care. Finally, the Essay considers whether and how U. S. physicians and patients might more actively incorporate a “best interests” principle into end of life decision making for patients in PVS...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} some of {{the main}} inadequacies of the current law in relation to mentally disordered and <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patients</b> in England and Wales. Particular attention is devoted to the lack of appropriate safeguards for mentally <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patients</b> and the failure of the review procedures for mentally disordered patients to satisfy the minimum requirements of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The advent of the Human Rights Act 1998 has brought this to the forefront and demonstrated that fundamental human rights of mentally vulnerable individuals are still being compromised. The paper concludes with an account of the recent reform proposals and considers to what extent they will remedy these deficiencies by providing adequate human rights protection. The discussion also demonstrates the lack of coherence in the government's proposals to reform the law. The Draft Mental Incapacity Bill attempts to put patient autonomy at the forefront, whereas the Draft Mental Health Bill focuses on public protection and risk management, {{at the expense of the}} rights and wishes of detained patients. These differences in approach provide clear evidence of the government's confused thinking and disjointed approach to mental health and incapacity reform...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: A European Union Directive {{provides}} for the designation of a surrogate who can consent to or refuse inclusion of an <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patient</b> in research studies. The accuracy with which surrogates consent to research on behalf of patients has not been evaluated {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU). METHODS: A prospective multicenter study was conducted in ten ICUs of the French Famirea study group between July and October 2004. Two hypothetical studies were simultaneously submitted to the patient, surrogate, and physician at the time that the patient was discharged to a ward. One study involved minimal risk and the other greater-than-minimal risk to the patients. RESULTS: With the minimal risk study there was patient-surrogate discrepancy in 32 % of cases and patient-physician discrepancy in 25 %. Corresponding figures with the greater-than-minimal risk study were 42 % and 46 %. None of the collected variables differed significantly between cases with and without patient-surrogate discrepancy. CONCLUSIONS: Family members designated to serve as surrogate decision makers may fail to accurately consent to research for critically ill patients in one-third to nearly one-half of cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} approach to treatment decision making for incapacitated patients often fails to provide treatment {{consistent with the}} patient's preferences and values and places significant stress on surrogate decision makers. These shortcomings provide compelling reason to search for methods to improve current practice. Shared decision making between surrogates and clinicians has important advantages, {{but it does not}} provide a way to determine patients' treatment preferences. Hence, shared decision making leaves families with the stressful challenge of identifying the patient's preferred treatment option. To address this concern, the present paper proposes to incorporate the use of a "Patient Preference Predictor" (PPP) into the shared decision-making process between surrogates and clinicians. A PPP would predict which treatment option a given <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patient</b> would most likely prefer, based on the individual's characteristics and information on what treatment preferences are correlated with these characteristics. Use of a PPP is likely to increase the chances that incapacitated patients are treated consistent with their preferences and values and might reduce the stress and burden on their surrogates. Including a PPP in the shared decision-making process therefore has the potential to realize important ethical goals for making treatment decisions for incapacitated patients. The present paper justifies this approach on conceptual and normative grounds...|$|E
40|$|The mentally <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patient</b> is {{frequently}} {{encountered in the}} general medical hospital. Incapacity is the clinical state in which a patient is unable {{to participate in a}} meaningful way in medical decisions. Mentally incapacitated patients relinquish the authority, that is the competent patient 2 ̆ 7 s right, to choose among professionally acceptable alternative treatments. Such patients, therefore, require a surrogate decision-maker. There are certain clinical situations in which questions of incapacity are especially important to consider. In a study for the President 2 ̆ 7 s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medical Biomedical and Behavioral Research, the most common problem in recognizing incapacity was found with previously capable patients who became transiently incapacitated during the course of hospitalization. Questions of incapacity or the authority of surrogate decision-makers also arose with comatose, mentally retarded, mentally ill, and physically handicapped patients. While standards to determine capacity remain unclear, a practical approach is to demonstrate that a patient is able to describe the physician 2 ̆ 7 s view of the situation and to understand the physician 2 ̆ 7 s opinion as to the best intervention. When a patient is deemed to be incapacitated, the physician should turn to family members, whenever possible, to make decisions...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{review the}} medical, ethical, and legal {{basis of the}} {{doctrine}} of informed consent for surgery and its complications, particularly for an <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patient</b> who requires a surrogate decision maker; to discuss the elasticity of the consent doctrine, whether surgical consent encompasses consent for surgical complications, and emphasize the importance of communication and shared decision making {{in the context of the}} patient-surgeon relationship; and to discuss patient and surrogate refusal of treatment, standards of surrogate decision making, barriers to effective communication, the role of the hospital ethics committee in resolving disputes over treatment, and how to reconceptualize surgical consent in the context of patient-centered medicine. Data Sources We reviewed PubMed citations for informed consent in surgery, patient-physician communication, shared decision making, patient-centered medicine, and consent guidelines published by specialty societies, particularly the American College of Surgeons and the Society for Critical Care Medicine. Study Selection We selected articles in which issues of consent for surgical treatment were discussed or measured. Data Extraction We extracted data relevant to questions of consent in surgical practice. Data Synthesis We studied qualitative aspects of the consent doctrine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Under the amended Mental Health Act 2007, {{electroconvulsive therapy}} (ECT) {{can only be}} {{authorized}} in an <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patient</b> providing {{it is not in}} conflict with the decision of the donee of lasting power of attorney. OBJECTIVES: To assess the ability of surrogates to correctly predict a subject's preference for treatment with ECT both before and after viewing an educational video. The effect of the educational video on attitudes to ECT was also examined. METHODS: Twenty-five subject-surrogate pairs were recruited from relatives of psychiatric patients. The subjects' treatment preferences regarding the ECT and the surrogates' predictions of these preferences were assessed by means of 2 hypothetical scenarios before and after viewing an educational video. An attitude to ECT questionnaire (Questionnaire on Attitudes and Knowledge of ECT) was completed by all participants before and after the video. RESULTS: Subject-surrogate concordance was high, 84 % for scenario 1 (treatment-resistant depression) before and after the video. In scenario 2 (life-threatening depression), concordance rose from 80 % before the video to 96 % after the video. The greatest increase in concordance occurred in pairs in which neither subject nor surrogate had previous experience of ECT. Attitude scores were significantly more positive after the video. CONCLUSIONS: Surrogates were able to predict the subjects' preference for ECT with high levels of accuracy. This finding is contrary to similar studies involving end-of-life treatment. Providing surrogates with clear, detailed, and accurate information about the proposed treatment may improve surrogate accuracy particularly in treatments such as ECT where widespread misperceptions prevail...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the rights of}} people with mental disorder under Irish law {{against the background of}} the European Convention on Human Rights. It proposes that Irish law does not meet the minimum standards laid down by the Convention and that significant law reform is required to achieve this aim. The main issues concern the admission, detention and treatment of adults and children in psychiatric care and the safeguards provided in the Irish legal system. These matters are considered against the Convention requirements {{in the context of the}} current and ongoing process of law reform in Ireland. The rights addressed are: the right to protection from arbitrary deprivation of liberty under Article 5, particularly the liberty of the compliant <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patient.</b> This includes an empirical study of the habeas corpus provision in Ireland. Article 8 and Article 12 rights are examined, specifically, the right to self-determination in a number of spheres including: consent to treatment, the right to marry, to have a sexual relationship and children and the right not to be sterilised. The right to protection from inhuman and degrading treatment in Article 3 includes consideration of positive state obligations to protect physical integrity in relation to conditions of detention, seclusion and aspects of treatment. The right in Article 2 to have one's life protected from foreseeable risks and the obligation on the state to investigate following death is examined. The restrictions on the removal of civil rights and obligations in relation to access to court to take civil action and to have control over one's property and affairs are examined for compliance with Article 6. The outcome of the examination confirms the proposal that Irish law does not meet the minimum standards of the Convention. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{cornerstones}} {{of contemporary}} medicine is the patient’s right to decide {{about his or her}} medical treatment. Clinicians respect this right by obtaining the informed consent of competent patients, but face a dilemma in the many cases in which patients lack decisional capacity—for example, due to sudden events like stroke or head trauma or {{as a result of a}} gradual decline in cognitive function. A series of high-profile court cases in the United States, most notably the cases of Karen Quinlan in 1976 and Nancy Cruzan in 1990, spurred the development of the current ethical and legal framework for making treatment decisions for <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patients.</b> The framework primarily aims to extend the patient’s right to decide about his or her medical treatment into times of decisional incapacity. It encourages patients to discuss and document prospectively how they want to be treated in the event of incapacity. If patients lose the ability to make their own decisions, they will then be treated according to their previously stated preferences and values. When no clear advance direc-tive is available, clinicians ask a surrogate decision maker—usually a member of the patient’s family or a loved one—to make medical decisions based on the surrogate’s best estimate for how the patient would want to be treated in the given situation (the “substituted judgment ” standard). When it is unclear how the patient would want to be treated, clinicians and surrogates choose the course of treatment that best promotes the patient’s clinical interests. This framework for respecting the rights of <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patients</b> is widely endorsed, and it has been adopted not only in the United States, but i...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{group of}} letters concerns {{the death of}} Terri Schiavo in 2005. Because of an ed-itorial oversight, these letters were not published last year, and it seemed appropriate to include them here. Terri Schiavo: Rest in peace As Charles Weijer has pointed out, the case of Terri Schiavo involved a family conflict regarding end-of-life decision-making. 1 This irreconcilable conflict resulted {{in a series of}} judicial interven-tions that were a rerun, with some dif-ferences, of the Karen Ann Quinlan, Nancy Beth Cruzan and other well-known cases. Nowadays, many hospitals rely on clinical ethicists, ethics committees or mediators — before court intervention — to resolve conflicts in which family members or health care providers dis-agree about clinical interventions or care plans for an <b>incapacitated</b> <b>patient.</b> What was striking in Terri Schiavo’s case was the political rhetoric that sur-faced on an issue that health care providers and ethics committees tackle on a daily basis. And what was so tragic, aside from the patient’s condi-tion, was the breach of her right to die with dignity. Whatever one’s view of her case, Terri Schiavo had a right to have her life and death kept private and her medical records held in confidence. The media, along with prominent politicians, paraded her medical status for the entire world to witness. Not only was there a breach of privacy, but politicians, the media, special interest groups, family members and support-ers used her mental status to promote their causes. If one believes that withdrawing nutrition and hydration from a pa-tient in an irreversible coma or per-sistent vegetative state constitutes murder, there are ways of debating the issue and developing a consen-sus. But to use Terri Schiavo and her husband, her legally appointed sur-rogate decision-maker, to further that point of view strikes me as op-portunistic. The violation of the Kantian principle to treat mankind as an end, never as a means, dealt a fur-ther blow to Terri Schiavo’s wish to die with dignity. May she finally rest in peace...|$|E
