40|$|Gettysburg and Ormond are seamounts {{belonging}} to the Gorringe Bank, which {{is located on the}} Europen-African plate boundary. Given the importance of these oceanic features for understanding marine biodiversity patterns, two surveys were carried out in 1998 (Gettysburg) and 1999 (Ormond) using diving, photography and video for species identification and abundance evaluation. Of the 9 fish species found at Gettysburg and 11 at Ormond, 6 were common to both sites and these included the dominant species: the oceanic and commercially important, Seriola rivoliana, and the coastal, typically Atlantic-Mediterranean Coris julis and Anthias anthias. The strong representation of coastal, demersal and Atlantic-Mediterranean species in the Gorringe Bank region and the presence of Abudefduf luridus, an <b>endemic</b> <b>Macaronesian</b> species, at Gettysburg suggests that the upper part of these seamounts may have acted and still act as “stepping stones” for the dispersal of coastal species. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
5000|$|Asplenium anceps is a diploid fern of Aspleniaceae {{family and}} one of the {{ancestors}} of the ferns that form the trichomanes complex. It lives exclusively in the three northernmost islands of the Macaronesian region, that is, is an <b>endemic</b> <b>macaronesian</b> fern.

A typical feature of this fern, which he shares with all its hybrid offspring ( [...] Asplenium azoricum, Asplenium azomanes and Asplenium X tubalense [...] ) is the existence of a small atrium on the basis of medium and less pinnae directed toward the apex of the blade with one or two sori on its underside.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} results on {{germination}} {{patterns of the}} seed dispersal system of an <b>endemic</b> <b>Macaronesian</b> plant (Rubia fruticosa). Seeds from this plant are mainly dispersed by endemic lizards and native warblers; there-fore, we included three different treatments: control seeds, seeds extracted from lizards and seeds found in warbler droppings. Seeds from the same pool of every treatment were germinated in two different seasons, one in autumn, coinciding {{with the arrival of}} the first rains, and another in spring, coinciding {{with the arrival of the}} dry season. A clear differential pattern of germination success was observed between the two seasons. Seeds planted in au-tumn achieved a higher percentage of germination than those sown in spring in all treatments. The great robust-ness of these results seems to indicate that germination timing is strongly selected in R. fruticosa and this evolu-tionary trend probably extends to other vascular plants growing in xeric coastal environments of the Macarone-sian islands.

Nowhere in Europe is this pattern more conspicuous than in the Macaronesian biogeographic region. A large network of protected areas within the region has been developed, but the question of whether these areas will still be climatically suitable for the globally threatened endemic element in the coming decades remains open. Here, we make predictions on the fate of the <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>endemic</b> bryophyte flora in the context of ongoing climate change. The potential distribution of 35 <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>endemic</b> bryophyte species was assessed under present and future climate conditions using an ensemble modelling approach. Projections of the models under different climate change scenarios predicted an average decrease of suitable areas of 62 - 87 % per species and a significant elevational increase by 2070, so that even the commonest species were predicted to fit either the Vulnerable or Endangered IUCN categories.

In order to assess its potential to estimate the cover fraction of dominant plant species in <b>endemic</b> <b>Macaronesian</b> laurel forests and heathlands, a hierarchical Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was performed within a study area where different patches from mature forest, to degraded forest and pine plantations can be found.

Preliminary results showed a good separation of degraded from mature native forests and from plantations, although pine cover fraction is, in general, underestimated.

40|$|The <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>endemic</b> flora has {{traditionally}} been interpreted as a relict of a subtropical element that spanned across Europe in the Tertiary. This hypothesis is revisited in the moss subfamily Helicodontioideae based on molecular divergence estimates derived from two independent calibration techniques either employing fossil evidence or using an Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) to sample absolute rates of nucleotide substitution from a prior distribution encompassing {{a wide range of}} rates documented across land plants. Both analyses suggest that the monotypic Madeiran endemic genus Hedenasiastrum diverged of other Helicodontioideae about 40 million years, that is, well before Macaronesian archipelagos actually emerged, in agreement with the relict hypothesis. Hedenasiastrum is characterized by a plesiomorphic morphology, which is suggestive of a complete morphological stasis over 40 million years. <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>endemic</b> Rhynchostegiella species, whose polyphyletic origin involves multiple colonization events, evolved much more recently, and yet accumulated many more morphological novelties than H. percurrens.

40|$|Understanding the age, {{origins and}} {{extinction}} of oceanic island biota has captivated {{the interest of}} evolutionary biologists since Darwin and Wallace. Because oceanic islands are discrete entities of small geographical size but with considerable habitat diversity, they provide ideal templates within which to study evolutionary processes. The peripheral North Atlantic islands, collectively referred to as Macaronesia, are considered a hot spot of biodiversity {{due to the fact}} that they contain a large proportion of endemic taxa (ca 25 %). Recent molecular studies are providing insight into the patterns of colonization and radiation within the extant avifauna, while paleontological studies have described many extinct avian species, sometimes identifying the causes and chronology of extinction. The aim of this review is to develop an understanding of the evolutionary and biogeographic history of the macaronesian avifauna, combining information from phylogenetic and paleontological studies. We then compare patterns for Macaronesia with those of other oceanic archipelagos to evaluate to what extent patterns may be generalised across regions. Phylogenetic analyses have confirmed the close relationships between <b>endemic</b> <b>macaronesian</b> avifauna and the closest mainland areas (Europe and Africa), however, in contrast to other archipelagos of a similar age, we show that most extant birds appear to have colonized macaronesian archipelagos relatively recently, within the last four million years, despite some islands being approximately 30 million years old. Fossil records support the idea that higher species richness previously existed, with recent dating on bone collagen of selected extinct species suggesting that their extinction coincided with the arrival of aboriginal people ca 2500 years ago in the Canary Islands, or the arrival of Europeans across all the macaronesian islands in the 14 th century. It is plausible that these human mediated extinctions may have selectively acted upon older lineages, but there is little evidence available to evaluate this...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Several bird-pollinated or ornithophilous {{flowers are}} {{present on the}} Macaronesian archipelagos, the Canary Islands and Madeira, but absent from nearby NW Africa and Europe. In Macaronesia, no {{specialist}} nectar-feeding birds are found, but several generalist passerine bird species visit flowers for nectar. Two hypotheses attempt to explain the origin and evolution of ornithophily in the Macaronesian flora. According to 'the island de novo hypothesis', bird-flowers evolved from mainland insect-pollinated ancestors after island colonization. Alternatively, ancestors of the ornithophilous Macaronesian plant species evolved bird-flowers before reaching the islands ('the relict hypothesis'). In this study we first compile information of Macaronesian bird-flower interactions from the literature and our own field observations. Secondly, we discuss the two hypotheses of origin of ornithophily {{in the light of}} evidence from recent molecular plant phylogenies, palaeontology, historical biogeography of the African avifauna and flora, and present-day ecological patterns. Location: Madeira and Canary Islands. Results: At least eleven <b>endemic</b> <b>Macaronesian</b> plant species from six genera have typical ornithophilous floral traits. These genera are: Canarina and Musschia (Campanulaceae), Isoplexis (Scrophulariaceae), Echium (Boraginaceae), Lotus (Fabaceae) and Lavatera (Malvaceae). These lineages have clear affinities to the Mediterranean region, except for Canarina whose closest relatives grow in East African mountains. Six generalist passerine bird species of Sylvia, Phylloscopus (Sylviidae), Serinus (Fringillidae) and Parus (Paridae) visit this flora for nectar. Main conclusion: We suggest that the origin and evolution of ornithophilous traits in these plant species took place mostly in mainland areas prior to island colonization. In Canarina and Lavatera, it is well supported that ornithophily is a relict condition, which originated in mainland areas possibly in association with specialist nectar-feeding birds. For the remaining plant species except Echium wildpretii bird floral traits probably also are a relict condition. These species may be derived from ancestors, which were visited by specialist nectar-feeding birds during geological periods when the Mediterranean and the Ethiopian vegetation were intermingled in mainland Africa. Probably, these mainland ancestors went extinct due to severe climatic fluctuations, while their Macaronesian descendants survived in 'refuge' on the islands. Finally, the island de novo hypothesis may explain the evolution of a mixed bird/insect-pollination system in the neoendemic red-flowered Echium wildpretii. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Our results show that woodiness in Pericallis originated independently at least twice in these islands, further weakening some previous hypotheses concerning the value of this character for tracing the continental ancestry of island endemics. The same data suggest that the origin of woodiness is correlated with ecological shifts from open to species-rich habitats and that the ancestor of Pericallis was an herbaceous species adapted to marginal habitats of the laurel forest.

Here, we investigated the effects of exploitation on the population structure of a protandrous patellid limpet, Patella aspera, an overexploited <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>endemic.</b> Timed dives were used to collect animals across eleven islands of Macaronesia. Individuals were inspected for sex, size, and gonad stage. Using catch effort (time per person) per island coastal perimeter as a surrogate for exploitation intensity, we found that limpet abundance (CPUE) and mean size tended to decrease with exploitation intensity. When considering the sex of animals separately, the size of the largest male, but not females, decreased with exploitation. In contrast, the size of the smallest male remained relatively consistent, whereas the size of the smallest female decreased significantly with exploitation. As exploitation is mostly targeting larger individuals, results suggest that males are compensating the removal of larger females, by undergoing sex change at smaller and presumably earlier sizes. These results have wider implications for the conservation of P. aspera, as a reduction in female size will likely affect the numbers of oocytes produced, hence fecundity.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that niche {{pre-emption}} is not the only possible explanation for monophyly among <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>endemic</b> plants because (i) interspecific competition is diffuse, not species-specific, (ii) the radiations in question may not in fact be monophyletic, and (iii) later colonists may have hybridized with earlier ones, making a small and undetected contribution to the gene pool of lineages that appear to be monophyletic. The niche pre-emption mechanism does not, however, require species-specific competitive interactions. It merely proposes that the clade created by adaptive radiation will occupy more niche space than the original colonist could on its own. Members of the clade will then collectively inhibit establishment by new colonists more effectively than can a colonist that has not radiated. The monophyly of many larger radiations in the Macaronesian flora is well established and new studies tend to confirm this pattern. A few later-arriving colonists may have undetectably hybridized with earlier arrivals, but this is only a genetic interpretation of the essential idea behind pre-emption, i. e. that early arrivals so outnumber later colonists that the latter cannot establish. We do not therefore believe that hybridization provides an alternative explanation of why groups with multiple colonization failed to radiate in Macaronesia...|$|R

Here we evaluate the existence of selective pressures exerted by two different disperser guilds (lizards and birds) on two seed traits (seed coat thickness and seed germination pattern) of two congeneric species present on Mediterranean and Macaronesian islands.

Bystropogon (Lamiaceae) is <b>endemic</b> to the <b>Macaronesian</b> Islands and {{represents}} the best-known {{example of a}} putative phytogeographic connection between these islands and the New World. Previous morphological taxonomic studies suggested that this genus {{is closely related to}} the western South American Minthostachys. Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacers and 5. 8 S subunit of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the trnL gene and trnL-trnF spacer of the chloroplast genome for 33 of the 72 genera in the Mentheae tribe were performed. Maximum parsimony analysis of the combined data set resulted in 63 most parsimonious trees. The strict consensus tree of this analysis shows with moderate bootstrap support (74 %) that Bystropogon is sister to the Old World taxa Acinos, Ziziphora, andClinopodium vulgare. When analyzed separately, the ITS and trnL/F data sets do not agree as to the sister group to Bystropogon, although none supports a sister relationship with Minthostachys. The cpDNA phylogeny strongly supports a relationship of Bystropogon with a clade of New World mint taxa (90 % bootstrap value). Due to the apparent conflict between the chloroplast and nuclear characters observed in the phylogenies, we are not certain of the true biogeographic relationship of Bystropogon.

Mitochondrial data from the 16 S rRNA and COX 1 genes support its current species status, tropical ancestry, and the taxonomic homogeneity throughout its distribution range. In contrast, at the intraspecific level and based on control region sequences, we detected an overall low level of genetic diversity and three divergent lineages. The haplogroups α and γ were sampled in the Azores, Madeira, Canary, and Cabo Verde archipelagos; whereas haplogroup β was absent from Cabo Verde. Consequently, population analysis suggested a differentiation of the Cabo Verde population {{with respect to the}} genetically homogenous northern archipelagos generated by current oceanographic barriers.

40|$|Abstract Exotic {{pathogens}} {{have been}} implicated in the decline and extinction of various native-island-bird species. Despite {{the fact that there}} is increasing concern about the introduction of diseases in island ecosystems, little is known about parasites in the islands of Macaronesia. We focus on Berthelot’s pipit (Anthus berthelotii), an <b>endemic</b> and widespread <b>Macaronesian</b> bird species, using a combi-nation of field studies and molecular techniques to determine: (1) the range and prevalence of avian pox and malaria in Berthelot’s pipits throughout the species’ distribution, (2) the genetic characterization of both para-sites in order to ascertain the level of host specificity. We sampled 447 pipits across the 12 islands inhabited by this species. Overall, 8 % of all individuals showed evidence of pox lesions and 16 % were infected with avian malaria, respectively. We observed marked differences in the prevalence of parasites among islands both within and between archipelagos. Avian pox prevalence varied be-tween 0 – 54 % within and between archipelagos and avian malaria prevalence varied between 0 – 64 % within and between archipelagos. The diversity of pathogens detected was low: only two genetic lineages of avian malaria and one lineage of avian pox were found to infect the pipit throughout its range. Interestingly, both avian malaria parasites found were Plasmodium spp. that had not been previously reported in the Macaronesian avifauna (but that had been observed in the lesser kestrel Falco naumannii), while the avian pox was a host specific lineage that had previously been reported on two of the Canary Islands...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{confusion in the}} taxonomy of limpets of the North East Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, particularly those from the Macaronesian islands. The present study compared populations of the intertidal limpet Patella candei d'Orbigny from the Azores, Madeira and the Canaries with those of P. caerulea Linnaeus and P. depressa Pennant from the European and African continental coasts. No major differences in radular morphology were detected between the three species. However, electrophoretic analysis of 15 enzyme loci gave overall genetic identity (I) values of sim 0. 5 between the three species, indicating that they cannot be regarded as conspecific as previously thought, and suggesting that P. candei is <b>endemic</b> to the <b>Macaronesian</b> islands. Comparisons of P. candei within these islands showed that, although populations did not differ with respect to radular morphology and soft-body parts, populations from the Azores were distinct from those in Madeira and the Canaries in shell shape and gene frequencies. Individuals from the Azores had, no average, taller shells and longer radulae, while those in Madeira and the Canaries had a shallow, depressed and stellate shell form. This was interpreted as being due to the wider habitat distribution of the species in the Azores compared to Madeira and the Canaries. Electrophoretic results showed that P. candei from the Azores differed from P. candei in Madeira and the Canaries by almost 40 % of the loci investigated (I= 0. 660), suggesting that the former is a separate endemic species. An I value of 0. 969 between populations in Madeira and the Canaries was typical of conspecific populations...|$|R
40|$|Combined {{analysis}} of genetic and morphological variation can provide synergistic insights into eco-evolutionary forces shaping biodiversity, {{as well as}} tools for conservation and management. Macaronesian limpets are undergoing severe declines due to overexploitation which calls for {{an evaluation of the}} evolutionary significance and taxonomic status of populations. This study details the {{analysis of}} genetic (mtDNA sequencing) and morphological (geometric analysis of shell shape) variation among Macaronesian populations of Patella aspera, P. rustica, and P. candei. In the case of P. aspera and P. rustica, this also included analysis of mainland conspecifics. mtDNA revealed distinct phylogeographic patterns for the three species. For both P. aspera and P. rustica Macaronesian and continental samples were reciprocally monophyletic, with shallower, and distinct, phylogeographic structure within both clades. For P. candei, the <b>Macaronesian</b> <b>endemic,</b> three reciprocally monophyletic groups corresponding to (i) the Azores, (ii) Madeira and (iii) Selvagens and Canary Islands were resolved. The different patterns for each species are compatible with independent processes of colonization and demographic processes. Morphological differentiation matched the major phylogeographic groupings (i. e., Macaronesian v Continent for P. aspera and P. rustica; Azores/Madeira/Selvagens and Canary Islands for P. candei) compatible with such variation being shaped by genetic drift associated with distinct demographic histories of lineages as well as historical/recurrent selection pressures. The genetic/morphological congruence supports the formal recognition of at least three described P. candei subspecies. Moreover, the data prompt recommendation of the separate management of limpets from each archipelago. At present management efforts are hampered by illegal harvesting of limpets. From an applied viewpoint, this study confirms that morphology retains useful information on genetic status and thus represents a potentially cheap method applicable to limpet conservation. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The use of many {{traditional}} medicinal plants is often {{hampered by the}} absence of a proper biochemical characterization, essential to identify the bioactive compounds present. The leaves from five species <b>endemic</b> to the <b>Macaronesian</b> islands with recognized ethnobotanical applications were analysed: Apollonias barbujana (Cav.) Bornm., Ocotea foetens (Ainton) Baill, Prunus azorica (Mouill.) Rivas-Mart., Lousã, Fern. Prieto, E. Días, J. C. Costa & C. Aguiar, Rumex maderensis Lowe and Plantago arborescens Poir. subsp. maderensis (Dcne.) A. Hans. et Kunk [...] Since oxidative stress is a common feature of most diseases traditionally treated by these plants, it is important to assess their antioxidant capacity and determine the molecules responsible for this capacity. In this study, the antioxidant capacity of these plants against two of the most important reactive species in human body (hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals) was determined. To trace the antioxidant origin total phenol and flavonoid contents as well as the polyphenolic profile and the amount of trace elements were determined. There was a wide variation among the species analysed in what concerns their total leaf phenol and flavonoid contents. From the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) electrochemically detected peaks it was possible to attribute to flavonoids the antioxidant capacity detected in A. barbujana, O. foetens, R. maderensis and P. azorica extracts. These potential reactive flavonoids were identified for A. barbujana, R. maderensis and P. azorica. For R. maderensis a high content (7 mg g- 1 dry weight) of L-ascorbic acid, an already described antioxidant phytomolecule, was found. A high content in selenomethionine (414. 35 μg g- 1 dry weight) was obtained for P. arborescens subsp. maderensis extract. This selenocompound is already described as a hydroxyl radical scavenger is reported in this work as also possessing peroxyl radical scavenging capacity. This work is a good illustration of different phytomolecules (flavonoids, organic acids and selenocompounds), presents in leaves of the five traditional medicinal plants endemic to Macaronesia, all exhibiting antioxidant properties...|$|R
