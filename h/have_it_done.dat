2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1912, Loy's mother nearly died from pneumonia, and her father sent his wife and {{daughter}} to La Jolla, California. Loy's mother saw great potential in Southern California, and during one of her husband's visits, she encouraged him to purchase real estate there. Among the properties he bought was land he later sold at a considerable profit to Charlie Chaplin so the filmmaker could construct his studio there. Although her mother tried to persuade her husband to move to California permanently, he preferred ranch life and the three eventually returned to Montana. Soon afterward, Loy's mother needed a hysterectomy and insisted Los Angeles was a safer place to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>done,</b> so she, Loy, and Loy's brother David moved to Ocean Park, where Loy began to take dancing lessons. After the family returned to Montana, Loy continued her dancing lessons, and at the age of 12, Myrna Williams made her stage debut performing a dance she had choreographed based on [...] "The Blue Bird" [...] from the Rose Dream operetta at Helena's Marlow Theater.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2004, Hunt was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer and told to have surgery to remove her right breast and her lymph nodes. Hunt postponed seeking treatment for five months, later wondering if she would have faced first stage rather than third stage cancer had she not. When she chose to have surgery, she decided to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> in Ireland, because she felt that the Irish are more supportive and comfortable with illness than people in the U.S.; she envisaged that treatment in the U.S. would feel impersonal. Hunt decided to have a complete mastectomy with no following reconstruction. She says, [...] "Reconstruction – as if the breast is miraculously put back to the way it was. In fact, pretty much all you get is your cleavage back; you don't get any feeling or sensitivity... They take muscles from your back, skin from your thighs, fat from your stomach. You had a breast removed, but the rest of you was fine. Now half your body is hacked about – and for what?" [...] The day of her operation Hunt wrote a note on her breast to the surgical team, telling them to have fun, make sure they took the right breast off and drew them a flower.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Haven't {{you done}} it?' cried Mrs Verden, exaggerating her surprise. 'You'll never <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>done.</b> I'd better help you. What times does the train go?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is," [...] assented Loo meekly, [...] "but {{you will}} marry us to-morrow. My father will return {{too late to}} <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> to-night, I fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did it all}} but one question," [...] said Ethel, [...] "but so did he, you know, and we can't {{tell whether}} we should <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> well enough." ...|$|E
