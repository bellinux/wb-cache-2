5|$|With {{relations}} deteriorating {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, the three western Allies met in March 1948 to merge their zones of occupation {{and allow the}} formation of what became the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly known as West Germany. Meanwhile, the eastern Soviet zone became the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic,</b> commonly known as East Germany.|$|E
5|$|EUA, FRG, GDR. For the Games of 1956–1964, Germany participated as a Unified Team (EUA), {{representing}} the National Olympic Committees of both West Germany and East Germany. Retrospectively, the IOC uses the country code EUA for this team. After the NOC for the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> was granted full recognition by the IOC in 1968, East Germany (GDR) and West Germany (FRG) participated as two distinct teams at the Games of 1968-1988.|$|E

5|$|The wartime Allies {{initially}} {{worked together}} {{under the auspices of}} the Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany. Cooperation between the Western Allies and the Soviets ultimately broke down because of disagreements over Germany's political and economic future. In May 1949, the three western occupation zones were merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) with a freely elected government. The Soviet zone became the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> (GDR), under communist rule.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the CDU since 1954, he was elected as member of {{parliament}} in 1969. He continued to hold a mandate as {{member of the}} Bundestag until he became Governing Mayor of West Berlin, following the 1981 state elections. In 1984, von Weizsäcker was elected as President of the Federal Republic of Germany. During his presidency, German reunification was accomplished through the incorporation of {{the territory of the}} former <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> into the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990.|$|E
5|$|After Germany surrendered, the Allies {{partitioned}} Berlin and Germany's remaining territory {{into four}} military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 {{to form the}} Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> (Deutsche Demokratische Republik). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany. East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasize its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo.|$|E

5|$|Germany {{had been}} de facto divided, and two {{independent}} states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> were created within {{the borders of}} Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence. Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, Fuchs {{confessed that}} he was a spy. He was sentenced to {{fourteen}} years' imprisonment and stripped of his British citizenship. He was released in 1959, after serving nine years, and emigrated to the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> (East Germany), where {{he was elected to the}} Academy of Sciences and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) central committee. He was later appointed deputy director of the Institute for Nuclear Research in Rossendorf, where he served until he retired in 1979.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} furrier, Mühe {{was born}} on 20 June 1953 in Grimma, Saxony, in the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> (East Germany). After leaving school he trained as a {{construction}} worker, then did compulsory military service in the Nationale Volksarmee (National People's Army) as a border guard at the Berlin Wall. He was relieved of duty after contracting stomach ulcers; a number of commentators have {{said that this was}} due to stress, and also suggested that it marked the beginnings of the stomach cancer that would eventually lead to his death.|$|E

5|$|The time of Rau's German Economic Commission {{ended in}} October 1949 with the {{establishment}} of the East German state, the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> (GDR). The GDR was proclaimed on 7October 1949, at a ceremony in the former Air Ministry Building in Berlin, until then the seat of Rau's organisation. Five days later, the DWK was formally abolished on 12October 1949. Rau thereupon became a delegate of the People's Chamber, the newly established parliament of the GDR and joined the new government.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Berlin {{had been}} {{divided into four}} sectors {{controlled}} by the Allies: the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France. The sector borders inside the city could in general be used freely for passage out of the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic,</b> even after {{the border between the}} Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR had been continually closed off, starting in 1952. The outer border of West Berlin, which was also the border between West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German Border Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups of the Working Class locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction of border protection facilities began.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{sought help}} from the Soviet Union, the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> (GDR), and P. R. China for funding for several projects and military advice. The failure of several GDR-led projects including the New Zanzibar Project, a 1968 urban redevelopment scheme to provide new apartments for all Zanzibaris, led to Zanzibar focussing on Chinese aid. The post-revolution Zanzibar government was accused of draconian controls on personal freedoms and travel and exercised nepotism in appointments to political and industrial offices, the new Tanzanian government being powerless to intervene. Dissatisfaction with the government {{came to a head}} with the assassination of Karume on 7 April 1972, which was followed by weeks of fighting between pro and anti-government forces. A multi-party system was eventually established in 1992, but Zanzibar remains dogged by allegations of corruption and vote-rigging, though the 2010 general election was seen to be a considerable improvement.|$|E
5|$|The park {{lies between}} Wallstraße {{on the north}} side, the Straße am Köllnischen Park on the east side, Rungestraße {{on the south side}} and Inselstraße on the west side. Its {{boundaries}} are not clearly delimited; on the west side there are some buildings between the park and the street, including the former building of the Köllnisches Gymnasium, built in 186568 and now used as a music school, and on the north side, facing the river, is the Märkisches Museum. The western edge is dominated by a large office building built in 1903/04 as the headquarters of the Landsversicherungsanstalt, which has been used {{for the past few years}} by the Department of Urban Development of the Senate of Berlin, and the southern by the 1931/32 building of the German health insurance group Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse, which under the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> was the Parteihochschule Karl Marx.|$|E
5|$|No German {{team was}} allowed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London or the Winter Games in St. Moritz. Brundage {{was anxious to}} reintegrate Germany into the Olympic {{movement}} once the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, through Brundage's lifetime) was formed in 1949. Soon after the state's formation, its National Olympic Committee approached the IOC, seeking recognition, {{but there was still}} much animus towards Germany. Just prior to the IOC session in Vienna in 1951 (Brundage was still vice president), the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> (East Germany) also formed an NOC and requested recognition. This created controversy, as the Federal Republic and its NOC claimed to represent both West and East Germany, but did not control the latter. Despite lengthy discussions, no resolution was reached in 1951, and the matter was put over until February 1952, when a negotiating session was scheduled for Copenhagen. Although the East Germans came to Copenhagen, they refused to attend the session, which was eventually cancelled by Edström after the IOC officials and West Germans waited for hours in vain. The German team which competed in Helsinki that summer was entirely West German.|$|E

5|$|Doping {{has played}} a {{significant}} part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from the <b>German</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Republic</b> {{in track and field}} from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems {{as a result of the}} regime. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. Doping problems have also been associated with sprinters such as Tyson Gay, Michael Rogers, and Justin Gatlin, all from the United States. Doping has also affected entire nations, such as Russia, which has been banned from competing at both the Indoor World Championships and the Olympics in 2016. This ban was imposed in 2016 after major allegations of doping and covering up were discovered in 2015.|$|E
