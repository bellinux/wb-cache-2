40|$|Abstract. We present design issues, data {{structures}} and algorithms which {{allow us to}} leverage the power of high performance computer clusters in generic finite <b>element</b> <b>codes.</b> Large scale flow simulations require parallel algorithms to scale to thousands of processor cores. Simple parallelization in generic finite <b>element</b> <b>codes</b> often reduces to implementing parallel linear algebra and solvers or interfacing with an existing parallel linear algebra library. Other data {{structures and}} algorithms, e. g. mesh handling, are not designed for parallel computations and introduce bad scaling and memory constraints.
