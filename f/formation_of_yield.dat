40|$|In 1996, China {{launched}} {{a program to}} breed super rice or super hybrid rice by combining intersubspecific heterosis with ideal plant types. Today, approximately 80 super rice varieties have been released {{and some of them}} show high grain yields of 12 – 21 t/hm 2 in field experiments. The main reasons for the high yields of super rice varieties, compared with those of conventional varieties, can be summarized as follows: more spikelets per panicle and larger sink size (number of spikelets per square meter); larger leaf area index, longer duration of green leaf, greater photosynthetic rate, higher lodging resistance, greater dry matter accumulation before the heading stage, greater remobilization of pre-stored carbohydrates from stems and leaves to grains during the grain-filling period; and larger root system and greater root activity. However, there are two main problems in super rice production: poor grain-filling of the later-flowering inferior spikelets (in contrast to earlier-flowering superior spikelets), and low and unstable seed-setting rate. Here, we review recent research advances in the crop physiology of super rice, focusing on biological features, <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> components, and population quality.

40|$|Limiting {{factors in}} organic potato {{production}} are predominantly nitrogen and infesta-tion with late blight disease (Phytophthora infestans). To maintain high yields, organic nitrogen fertilization, presprouting {{and control of}} potato late blight with copper-treatments are potential measures. A field trial was conducted in 2005 and 2006 to evaluate which single measure and combination of measures was most likely to achieve the best results. In both years, organic nitrogen fertilization led to an average yield increase of 16 %. Tuber presprouting before planting accelerated plant emer-gence, increasing yields by up to 24 %. It was the most effective single measure, provided that late blight disease appeared (2005). In absence of infection with late blight, presprouting had no influence on potato yield (2006). Only copper-treatments in combination with optimized plant nutrition and presprouting had {{a positive impact on}} potato yield. Varieties with early tuber development (e. g. : Princess) have almost com-pleted <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> when infection with late blight sets in.

40|$|Canola (Brassica napus L.) {{is a major}} {{rotation}} crop but {{low yield}} has limited its adoption by farmers in the low-rainfall regions of southern Australia, where drought events can occur at any stage of crop development. We examined the effect of soil water deficit on osmotic adjustment and seed yield of canola and mustard (B. juncea L.) at the juvenile, elongation, anthesis, or seed-fill stage under glasshouse conditions and post-anthesis drought in the field. At the juvenile and elongation stages, leaves of both canola cv. Monty and mustard line 397 - 23 - 2 - 3 - 3 adjusted osmotically after exposure to water deficit. In comparison, only the mustard line expressed osmotic adjustment at anthesis and neither genotype adjusted at the seed-fill stage. A single drought event at the juvenile or elongation stage {{had little effect on}} growth and seed yield of either genotype, whereas water deficit at anthesis or seed-fill stage reduced seed yield of the canola cultivar by decreasing pod number, seeds per pod, and/or harvest index but largely did not affect the mustard line. In the field where rainfall diminished and plants were subjected to increasing water deficit during the reproductive stages, canola cv. Karoo and mustard line JN 25 showed higher osmotic adjustment at anthesis and less yield reduction than the canola cv. Monty. This study suggests that yield sensitivity to water deficit was mainly due to its effect on concurrent <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> components, but could be modified by the physiological trait of osmotic adjustment...|$|E

Rate {{and timing of}} these phases and single growth stages are strongly controlled by day length, accumulated temperature and genotype. Awareness of development phases and their potential association with crop responses to management practices (e. g. nitrogen, pesticide applications) and to external stresses, are elemental for understanding their importance to <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> potential (Kirby & Appleyard 1984). Oat cultivar Belinda was grown in the greenhouse to visualize the apical development stages and phases described by Åfors et al. (1988). The apical development was monitored frequently and digital images of apex were photographed under stereomicroscope. Accelerated development is characteristics for oat grown in long days. Particularly oat transfers from vegetative to generative phase when only two fully opened leaves are apparent and no tillers have yet emerged. Therefore, main shoot apex is at much more advanced development stage when compared to tiller apices. Hierarchy is also evident within the inflorescence. The development of the oat inflorescence proceeds from the uppermost terminal spikelet downwards {{to the base of}} the inflorescence. Within the spikelet, development and cell division of primary grain dominates the development over the secondary grain (Rajala & Peltonen- Sainio 2004).

40|$|Genomic selection, enabled by whole genome {{prediction}} (WGP) methods, is revolutionizing plant breeding. Existing WGP {{methods have}} been shown to deliver accurate predictions in the most common settings, such as prediction of across environment performance for traits with additive gene effects. However, prediction of traits with non-additive gene effects and prediction of genotype by environment interaction (G×E), continues to be challenging. Previous attempts to increase prediction accuracy for these particularly difficult tasks employed prediction methods that are purely statistical in nature. Augmenting the statistical methods with biological knowledge has been largely overlooked thus far. Crop growth models (CGMs) attempt to represent the impact of functional relationships between plant physiology and the environment in the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> and similar output traits of interest. Thus, they can explain the impact of G×E and certain types of non-additive gene effects on the expressed phenotype. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a novel and powerful computational procedure, allows the incorporation of CGMs directly into the estimation of whole genome marker effects in WGP. Here we provide a proof of concept study for this novel approach and demonstrate its use with synthetic data sets. We show that this novel approach can be considerably more accurate than the benchmark WGP method GBLUP in predicting performance in environments represented in the estimation set as well as in previously unobserved environments for traits determined by non-additive gene effects. We conclude that this proof of concept demonstrates that using ABC for incorporating biological knowledge in the form of CGMs into WGP is a very promising and novel approach to improving prediction accuracy for some of the most challenging scenarios in plant breeding and applied genetics...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{elaborate}} {{winter wheat}} cultivation technologies based on balanced fertilizer system that combines application of mineral fertilizers {{and the increase}} of their efficiency {{by the use of}} preparations with microelements. Methods. Field and laboratory studies, mathematical and statistical analysis. Results. During 2011 – 2013, the effect of cultivation technologies on the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> and quality of winter wheat varie­ty ‘Benefis’ (pea is a predecessor) was studied. In case of alternative technologies that provided adding only by-products of the predecessor, the yield of winter wheat was 3. 73 t/ha when using integrated protection system, and it was increased to 4. 22 t/ha with grain quality of the 4 th– 5 th class of the group B when foliar dressing was applied. Resource saving technologies of cultivation with restricted use of fertilizers (Р 45 К 45 N 30 (II) + 30 (IV)) provided productivity at the level of 5. 19 – 5. 61 t/ha with grain quality of the 2 nd– 3 rd class of the group A. Grain yield of 6. 27 t/ha of the 2 nd class quality was obtained by the use of intensive cultivation technology, which included application of mineral fertilizers (Р 90 К 90 N 30 (II) + 60 (IV) + 30 (VIII)) in addition to the use of predecessor’s by-products and foliar dressing. The highest yield of grain (6. 71 t/ha) on average during all years of the study with the 1 st class of the group A quality was provided by energy-intensive technology, which included application of P 135 K 135 N 60 (II) + 75 (IV) + 45 (VIII) with embedding of predecessor’s by-products into the soil and foliar dressing.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of flowers and}} then that of seeds are key processes in the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> in faba bean (Vicia faba L.), as in other grain legumes. Winter faba bean generally has a quantitative vernalization requirement, allowing flowering to occur at a lower node than in unvernalized plants. Some germplasm is day-neutral, other germplasm is long-day with a critical daylength between 9. 5 and 12 h. Progress toward flowering follows a conventional thermal-time model, with 830 – 1000 °C-d above 0 °C required for the onset of flowering and an optimum temperature of 22 – 23 °C. Flowers may abscise from the crop {{because of lack of}} pollination, because proximal flowers on the same raceme are fertilized, because of vegetative–reproductive competition for assimilate, or because of stresses such as drought. The large seed size of faba bean has enabled this species to be a model for studies of the molecular physiology of seed development. Seed filling in the retained pods proceeds through well defined pre-storage and storage phases. During the pre-storage phase, cell expansion occurs mostly in the endosperm and seed coat while the embryo is in a cell division phase. Extracellular invertase from the inner cell layers of the seed coat acts on sucrose unloaded from the phloem, ensuring that the rapidly dividing embryo cells are bathed in hexose-rich fluid. With further {{development of}} the embryo, endosperm sugar levels become depleted and the embryo relies more directly on nutrients released by the seed coat. In the transition to the storage phase, the cotyledon cells expand, synthesize storage proteins and starch, and undergo endopolyploidization. Thin-walled parenchyma cells in the seed coats differentiate into transfer cells and the enhanced area of plasma membrane results in increased nutrient flow to the rapidly growing embryo. Release of sucrose and potassium into the seed apoplasm is energy-coupled through a plasma membrane H⁺-ATPase and a sucrose/H⁺-antiport. Subsequent radial transfer of nutrients to the storage parenchyma cells of the cotyledons follows a symplastic pathway through numerous plasmodesmata. Cotyledon cell expansion stops when the mechanical restraints of the seed coat and space within the pod cavity are met. It is now possible to identify genes for manipulation that may make seed setting and final seed size less susceptible to environmental stresses...|$|E

40|$|Being a {{macronutrient}} with essential {{functions in}} plant metabolism, a sufficient supply of magnesium to crops {{is important to}} gain high yields and quality. In agriculture and forestry magnesium deficiency has become a problem in some areas. Besides low soil concentrations especially in light and sandy soils, also other parameters such as high concentrations of Ca 2 +, K+, H+, Al 3 + or low soil humidity can lead to suboptimal provision of magnesium to crops. This will lead among other things, {{to the formation of}} chlorosis in the older leaves, reduced growth and the accumulation of sugars in source leaves. Instead of soil amendment, magnesium can also be applied via foliar fertilization. This can be valuable if the magnesium soil availability of magnesium is reduced or if a rapid improvement of the plants nutrient status is needed. Magnesium foliar application has been demonstrated to improve chlorophyll concentration and biomass accumulation in oregano, maize, soybean and apples (Reay et al. 1998; Szulc et al. 2001; Dordas 2009; Teklic et al. 2009). With regards to responses of yield and quality, however, studies present differential results. The impact of foliar MgSO 4 application on plant physiology has also been studied scarcely. In this study, the influence of foliar MgSO 4 fertilization on different aspects, such as the distribution of the major cations Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + and K+ in different plant compartments, the transcript abundance of enzymes related to the appearance of deficiency symptoms and the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> and seed quality in Vicia faba was examined. For this purpose, faba beans were grown in nutrient solution containing either sufficient (0. 5 mM) or low (0. 05 / 0. 015 mM) MgSO 4. Plants growing in nutrient solution containing only low concentrations of MgSO 4 were subjected to foliar applications of MgSO 4 with either 0 mM, 50 mM or 200 mM. Foliar application proved to change the cation relations in the apoplast and symplast in diverse manners. The rise in apoplastically bound Mg 2 + led to a decrease of Ca 2 + while in the symplast the risen Mg 2 + concentration affected on the K+ concentration, if high concentrations of MgSO 4 (200 mM) were applied. Although both cations hold important functions in plant structure and metabolism, negative effects could not be observed with regards to the other parameters measured. It was therefore proposed that these cations can replace each other partially. The concentration of chlorophyll and the photosynthesis rate proved to be enhanced by application of 200 mM MgSO 4. However, the reduced transcript abundance of Mg chelatase H under magnesium deficiency was not changed by foliar magnesium application. This might indicate that under magnesium deficiency chlorophyll synthesis is reduced which is not influenced by foliar application. Instead, a reduced chlorophyll breakdown due to ameliorated magnesium supply is possible. This study revealed that the transcription of the plasmalemma H+-ATPase isoforms is differentially regulated under magnesium deficiency. However, specific functions of different isoforms have not been revealed yet. Magnesium foliar application resulted in a significant increase of seed yield of plants growing in magnesium deficient nutrient solution. This increase was mainly attributable to {{the increase in the number}} of pods per plant. Additionally, the quality of the seeds was raised due to magnesium foliar application as significantly higher protein concentrations could be found. This might be associated to the role of magnesium in nitrogen assimilation and protein synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Diploma thesis {{with the}} topic: <b>Formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> and dry matter with genetic {{resources}} of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) was worked {{out at the}} Department of botanics and plant physiology, Faculty of agrobiology, food and natural resources ČZU in Prague. The purpose of this thesis was to determine genotype and ontogenetic differences in amount of yield, production of dry mass, and value of growth-analytic characteristics in certain species of opium poppy. Diploma thesis {{was based on the}} fact that most of the studies about opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) are focused on the content of alkaloids and other substances present in poppy seeds. Due to this facts, it is necessary to describe the genotypes of poppy plants and their genetic resources from the physiological point of view. Following species of opium poppy were chosen for the experiment: Akvarel, Albín, Buddha, Florian, Korneuburger Weisser, Lazur, Major, Marianne, Opál, Postomi, Sokol, Tatranský. These species were chosen according to their content of alkaloids, especially morfine very low content, low content, medium content and high content of morfine. All of the tested genotypes are tested as object of study of genetic poppy resources. Seeds were supplied by GB Oseva Pro s. r. o., o. z. VÚO Opava and company Český mák. Field experiments were established at the research laboratory FAPPZ ČZU in Prague, in Červený Újezd. This location is in Prague-West division, in area of Middle Bohemia. The altitude of this location is 401 metres above the sea level. The size of the field for testing was 2 m 2. The experiment was based in 4 repetitions by the method of Latin square. Winter wheat was used as the preceding crop. Opium poppy was planted according to agrotechnical principles of planting. Content of dry mass in individual plant organs was measured in certain ontogenetic stages of opium poppy (35, 45, 49, 52, 54, 62, 81 BBCH). Size of leaf area was assessed by the image analysis WinDias. Yield of seeds was assessed as well. Growth-analytic characteristics were calculated from the values of wieght of dry mass and size of leaf area. The results confirmed that the size of plants is influenced by its ontogeny and also by its species. The results also confirm, that the height of plants is not influenced by the content of morfine. Connection between the colour of seeds and height of plant was not confirmed either. Increase in weight of above-ground biomass depending on ontogenetic stage and influence of plant species was confirmed. There are differences in production of yield in species of poppy with different contents of morfine because the average weight of yield in species with very low content of morfine was 112, 36 g, in species with low content of morfine 110, 41 g, in species with middle content of morfine 12167 g and in species with high content of morfine 123, 16 g. It was approved that ontogeny of plants influences the leaf area index (LAI) as it increases until blooming and then it decreases as a result of senescence and falling off the old leaves. Differences in leaf area index were detected among the species of opium poppy, depending on the content of morfine. It was detected that crop growth rate (CGR), relative crop growth rate (Rw) and relative growth rate of assimilation area (RA) are influenced by the ontogeny of plants. It was detected that species with high content of morfine in poppy seeds (Buddha, Postomi, Lazur) and species with white seeds Sokol and Albín have lower yield than species with middle content of morfine...|$|E

The found <b>formation</b> <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> DMSO for 284 K (46. 3 ± 5. 0 %), 295 K (34. 8 ± 7. 6 %) and 306 K (24. 4 ± 2. 8 %), at 200 mbar O 2, give evidence for the predominance of the addition pathway at low temperature. High overall molar <b>formation</b> <b>yields</b> <b>of</b> SO 2, about 90 % at all temperatures, leads to the conclusion that further oxidation of the products in both the addition and abstraction channels results mainly in SO 2 production under the experimental conditions of this study. The major sulphur-containing products identified in the presence of NO x were SO 2, DMSO, dimethyl sulphone (DMSO 2), MSA, methane sulphonyl peroxy nitrate (MSPN) and OCS. The variation <b>of</b> the product <b>yields</b> with NO x concentration at different temperatures was also found to be consistent with the occurrence of both addition and abstraction channels. It was found that increasing the initial NO concentration depresses the DMSO, SO 2 and OCS formation yields and enhances those of DMSO 2, MSA and MSPN. The branching ratio for DMSO formation was found to decrease with increasing initial NO and to decrease with increase of the temperature. This behaviour is expected for a reaction sequence involving <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a thermally unstable peroxy radical adduct and its subsequent reaction with NO with <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> an oxy-alcoxy species which can react with molecular O 2 to form DMSO 2. The molar <b>formation</b> <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> SO 2 was found to decrease with increasing both the temperature and initial NO x. A study of the gas phase oxidation of DMSO by OH radicals has been performed under conditions similar to those for DMS. <b>Formation</b> <b>of</b> MSIA in a very high yield was found. The results show quite definitely that MSIA is the major oxidation product of DMSO and that its measured <b>yield</b> is independent <b>of</b> the reaction conditions. <b>Formation</b> <b>of</b> DMSO 2, SO 2, MSA and MSPN has been observed. The observed behaviour of these products supports a formation mechanism involving secondary chemistry of MSIA initiated either by OH or by peroxy radicals...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Study {{of cutting}} lettuce {{varieties}} of Dutch breeding, determination of their morphological traits and commercially valuable characteristics. Methods. Field, laboratory, statistical. Results. Characteristics of five varieties of cutting lettuce of Dutch breeding were studied. It was {{established that the}} <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> marketable <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> lettuce leaves and their commercial quality largely depends on varietal features. Conclusions. Tested varieties are suitable for direct sowing on the field under conditions of Kiev Oblast. Time interval from mass germination to industrial ripeness was the shortest for Sirmay variety – 48 – 51 days. The largest number of leaves was recorded in Sirmay and Kitoniya varieties – 32, 9 and 32, 1 per plant respectively. The average weight of leave rosette was the highest in Sirman, Keaton and Karmesi varieties – 0, 290, 0, 266 and 0. 207  kg respectively...|$|R

Caldera collapse occurred in 2000 at Miyakejima Island (Japan) {{in response to a}} lateral intrusion. Based on geophysical data it is inferred that a set of caldera ring faults was propagating upward. To understand the kinematics of ring-fault propagation, linkage, and interaction, the authors describe new laboratory sand-box experiments that were analyzed through Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and post-processed [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{cultivation}} of mouse mononuclear phagocytes {{leads to the}} formarion of cytoplasmic organelles with the properties of lysosomes (1). The production of these granules as well as three hydrolytic enzymes was blocked by irdaibitors of protein synthesis (2). Further analysis revealed that the phasedense granules arose from pinocytic vacuoles which accumulated in the centrosphere region (3). The rate <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> and <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> granules and hydrolytic enzymes was dependent upon the concentration of serum in the medium. In addition, there was a direct relationship between serum concentration {{and the rate of}} pinocytosis. These data suggested that the regulation <b>of</b> granule <b>formation</b> and hydrolytic enzyme production was controlled in some fashion by the pinocytic process (3). This article will be concerned with the reversibility of macrophage differentiation by means of alterations in the external medium. In addition, the uptake and turnover of selected granule constituents has been examined. Materials and Method...|$|R

40|$|It {{should be}} {{possible}} to predict the rate of growth of Escherichia coli of a given genotype in a specified environment. The idea that the rate of synthesis of ATP determines the rate of growth and that the <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> ATP determines the <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> growth is entrenched in bacterial physiology, yet this idea is inconsistent with experimental results. In minimal media the growth rate and yield vary with the carbon source in a manner independent of the rate <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> and <b>yield</b> <b>of</b> ATP. With acetate as the carbon source, anapleurotic reactions, not ATP synthesis, limit the growth rate. For acetate and other gluconeogenic substrates the limiting step appears to be the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> triose phosphate. I conclude that the rate of growth is controlled by the rate <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a precursor metabolite and, thus, of monomers such as amino acids derived from it. The protein-synthesizing system is regulated according to demand for protein synthesis. I examine the conjecture that the signal for this regulation is the ratio of uncharged tRNA to aminoacyl-tRNA, that this signal controls the concentration of guanosine tetraphosphate, and that the concentration of guanosine tetraphosphate controls transcription of rrn genes. Differential equations describing this system were solved numerically for steady states of growth; the computed values of ribosomes and guanosine tetraphosphate and the maximal growth rate agree with experimental values obtained from the literature of the past 35 years. These equations were also solved for dynamical states corresponding to nutritional shifts up and down...|$|R

50|$|In {{a manner}} similar to those for 289Fl, first {{experiments}} with a 242Pu target identified an isotope 287Fl decaying by emission of a 10.29 MeV alpha particle with a lifetime of 5.5 seconds. The daughter spontaneously fissioned with a lifetime in accord with the previous synthesis of 283Cn. Both these activities have not been observed since (see copernicium). However, the correlation suggests that the results are not random and are possible due to the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> isomers whose <b>yield</b> is obviously dependent on production methods. Further research is required to unravel these discrepancies.|$|R
