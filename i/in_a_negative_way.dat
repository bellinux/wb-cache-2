5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't {{be able to be}} an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

25|$|Drug addiction, alcoholism, {{a mental}} disability, bio-chemical changes and PTSD can all {{lead to a}} person {{committing}} an aggressive act against another person.

These factors are typically associated with a heightened chance of anger, but there are other, less-known factors that can lead to people acting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>way.</b> Prolonged or intense anger and frustration contributes to physical conditions such as headaches, digestive problems, high blood pressure and heart disease. Problems dealing with angry feelings may be linked to psychological disorders such as anxiety or depression. Angry outbursts can be a way of trying to cope with unhappiness, or depression.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1960s, the Swedish society saw {{increased}} socialist sentiments, {{just like}} many other European countries.

5000|$|One {{commonly}} reported {{phenomenon is}} that when individuals are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "bad mood", they typically recall more bad things having happened to them and evaluate episodes in their lives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> than usual. It {{has been suggested that}} this effect occurs because a person's mood at any given time has a strong influence on which aspects of their environment seem most salient.

500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} merit-making may have affected the economies of Buddhist countries <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>way,</b> because spending savings on the local temple would prevent consumption and investment and therefore stunt economic growth. Other researchers have disagreed, pointing out that spending resources on a Buddhist temple does stimulate economic growth through the investment in goods for the temple. It has also been suggested {{that even if the}} economy of Buddhist countries would be better off without merit-making, it would result in an economy {{that the majority of the}} population would not prefer. Another criticism often leveled at merit-making in modern times is that it prevents people from using their resources to help the poor and needy. Very often, however, temples do have many social roles in society, and offer help to many groups in society—resources are therefore redistributed widely. Moreover, since merit-making is often done as a community, merit-making may strengthen social ties, which Walters calls [...] "sociokarma".|$|E
500|$|Mark Arm, the vocalist for the Seattle band Green River—and later Mudhoney—is {{generally}} credited {{as being}} {{the first to use}} the term grunge to describe the Seattle genre of music.

Pure noise! Pure shit!". Clark Humphrey, contributor to Desperate Times, cites this as the earliest use of the term to refer to a Seattle band, and mentions that Bruce Pavitt of Sub Pop popularized the term as a musical label in 1987–88, using it on several occasions to describe Green River. Sub Pop called Green River's 1986 EP Dry as a Bone [...] "ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation." [...] Everett True states that when Arm stated that Seattle's streets were [...] "paved with grunge", he was using the word <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>way</b> to mean [...] "orthless."

500|$|However, Aurel Sari {{has since}} {{said that the}} special rapporteur's {{interpretation}} was wrong and that [...] "neither the decision to commission images depicting the Prophet in defiance of Islamic tradition, nor the actual content of the individual cartoons {{can be regarded as}} racist within the meaning of the relevant international human rights instruments" [...] although [...] "some of the more controversial pictures may nevertheless be judged 'gratuitously offensive' to the religious beliefs of Muslims in accordance with the applicable case-law of the European Court of Human Rights." [...] This means that the Danish authorities probably could have prohibited the drawings' dissemination if they had chosen to. Randall Hansen said that the cartoons were clearly anti-Islamic, but that this {{should not be confused with}} racism because a religion is a system of ideas not an inherent identity. Tariq Modood said that the cartoons were essentially racist because Muslims are in practice treated as a group based on their religion, and that the cartoons were intended to represent all of Islam and all Muslims <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>way,</b> not just Muhammad. Erik Bleich said that while the cartoons did essentialise Islam in a potentially racist way, they ranged from offensive to pro-Muslim so labelling them as a group was problematic. The Economist said [...] Muslims were not targeted in a discriminatory way, since unflattering cartoons about other religions or their leaders are frequently printed. Noam Chomsky posited that the cartoons were inspired by a spirit of [...] "ordinary racism" [...] and that they must be seen in the context of Jyllands-Posten agenda of incitement against immigrants in Denmark.|$|E

Jerry West called him a [...] "complex... very nice person", and NBA rival Jack McMahon even said: [...] "The best thing that happened to the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person... he could have killed us all with his left hand."
