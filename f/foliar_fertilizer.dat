The response of soyabean variety Solitaire to OmniBoost and Folifert Molibor was evaluated. The effect of OmniBoost and Folifert Molibor on Solitaire seed quality was determined through foliar and grain nutrient analysis. Compound D (7 % N: 14 % P 2 O: 7 % K 2 O) was used as a basal fertilizer. <b>Foliar</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was applied at three different growth stages during the pod-filling stage, that is, during the 7 th, 8 th and 9 th week after crop emergency. Different applications rates were evaluated as follows; rate I was the control (no <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilizer</b> applied), rate 2 (0. 5 kg OmniBoost + 0. 5 L Folifert Molibor, rate 3 (1 kg OmniBoost + 1 L Folifert Molibor, rate 4 (1. 5 kg OmniBoost + 1. 5 L Folifert Molibor), rate 5 (2 kg OmniBoost + 2 kg Folifert Molibor) and rate 6 (2. 5 kg OmniBoost + 2. 5 L Folifert Molibor), There was the standard rate recommended by the fertilizer manufacturers (2 kg OmniBoost + 2 L Folifert Molibor) which was applied at 4 weeks after crop emergency. The experimental design was a 3 x 6 incomplete factorial arranged in an Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. There was a significant difference (P< 0. 05) in grain yield and yield components, such as the weight of 1000 seeds and the number of branches per plant. The control, where no <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was applied, was significantly lower than the other treatments. There was also a significant difference (P< 0. 05) in phosphorus (P) and molybdenum (Mo) content in the grain. The content of P and Mo increased with increase in the rate of <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilizer</b> applied. However, {{there were no significant differences}} in the other yield components, which are the number of pods, seeds and barren pods per plant. There was no significant effect of application time, interaction of rate and time on the foliar and grain nutrients (N, P, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Zn, Fe, Cu). Evaluation of effect of these fertilizers on net income showed that it was only profitable to apply 0. 5 kg OmniBoost + 0. 5 L Folifert Molibor. The comparison of how well the crop used supplied nutrients under the respective treatments (Nutrient Use Efficiency) was done using the Agronomic Efficiency (AE) and the Partial Factor Productivity (PFP). Fertilizer use efficiency of N, P, Mg, Mo, B was calculated and it was observed that Agronomic Efficiency and Partial Factor Productivity (PFP) decreased with increase in the rate of <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilizer</b> applied. Germination tests were carried out to determine the viability of the seeds. There was no definite trend, which was established, but some significant differences were observed amongst the treatments.

Tea quality parameters (brightness, briskness, colour of liquor, strength of liquor and milk take) were affected significantly (P< 0. 05) by the different <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> Copper sulphate gave the highest average score implying highest quality, whilst the control (no fertilizer application) gave the lowest total average score, thus the lowest yield. The different foliar fertilisers increased the quality of tea. Results from this study showed that application of Copper sulphate results in increase in quality but not in yield. Application Zinc oxide increases both yield and quality of tea. Application of Magnesium oxide results in increase in quality but not yield.

40|$|Agronomic {{improvements}} in grain yield {{and quality of}} wheat crops could be obtained {{through the application of}} strategies, such as using foliar fungicides with fertilizers, to protect the leaves against pathogens and delay senescence during grain filling. However, few studies have reported the effect of these practices on wheat, although these treatments could represent a new method of increasing wheat production and profits. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> applied alone or in combination with a fungicide, on the photochemical, biochemical, and nutritional parameters of wheat plants. The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions in a 2 × 3 factorial design (fungicide × <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilizer)</b> with four replications. The fungicide treatment used was azoxystrobin + cyproconazole + mineral oil; the control was left untreated. The <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was used at two different rates, and the control was not treated. Plants were sprayed at the GS 29 /GS 30, GS 45, and GS 60 growth stages, and the plants were assessed ten days after the last spray. Chlorophyll a fluorescence, the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and electron transport rate were positively influenced by fertilizer. Fertilizer spraying significantly increased the leaf pigment content (chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids) and the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium concentration in flag leaves.

The segetal flora was assessed 6 weeks after the application of the herbicides and before the ha-rvest of the triticale crop. The herbicides were applied together at labelled doses as well as at doses reduced to 75 % and by half. Spraying with the <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilizers</b> was done twice during the growing period. Plots in which no herbicides or <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilizers</b> were used were the control treatment. Matricaria maritima and Viola arvensis from the dico-tyledonous class were predominant in the winter triticale crop, whereas Apera spica-venti was the dominant species among the monocotyledons. The weed control efficacy of the reduced herbicide doses was weaker compared to the labelled rates by, respectively, from 6 % to 9 % at the first time of weed infestation assessment and from 4 % to 8 % at the second assessment time. Simultaneously, air-dry weight of weeds in the herbicide-treated plots did not differ significantly. This indicates that it is possible to reduce herbicide doses in a winter triticale crop without a risk of increased weed infestation.
