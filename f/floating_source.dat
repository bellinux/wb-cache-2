In the case of galvanic source, only one resistor has to be connected between one of the bases and the ground.

40|$|Abstract- An {{alternative}} solution in PV generation systems is the grid connected AC module. PV panel and micro inverter {{connected to the}} grid forms this combination. The power processing interface between the PV source and the electrical grid is high step-up converter and DC-AC inverter. The energy injected to the grid depends on the efficient conversion of high step-up converter and efficient inversion by the DC-AC inverter. The proposed configuration boosts the low array voltage by tracking maximum power from the PV array and converts the high DC power to high quality AC, feeding it to the grid. In this paper a ZETA converter with coupled inductor is used to efficiently recycle the leakage inductor energy. Further the overall safety to the system is enhanced since the PV array appears as an <b>floating</b> <b>source.</b> A discussion about the operating principle, steady state analysis, stress on active components of converter are done in this paper.

In this paper a method for automatic sizing and optimization of a <b>floating</b> voltage <b>source</b> (FVS) used in a CMOS Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) is presented. The optimization determines the optimal component values and transistor dimensions for FVS {{in order to minimize}} the dissipated power and output impedance.

The purpose of this thesis is to introduce the use of interface-trap charge pumping devices (ITCP) in an analog application based in ultra-low-current transconductors. This application naturally exploits the continuous nature of the current generated by the interface-trap charge pump. An interface-trap charge-pump has been used as an ultra low current source for biasing an operational transconductance amplifier in both single-ended and fully differential configurations. Source degeneration techniques have been applied to reduce the total harmonic distortion. The history, physics and a primary model of ITCP are presented as background material. The analysis has been extended for the design of analog circuits based in ultra-low frequency OTA filters. A novel technique based on ITCP for a <b>floating</b> current <b>source</b> is presented as an alternative solution for fully differential structures.
