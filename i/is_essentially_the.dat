While the events in L'ange are set in 1470 in Nisida and Naples, La favorite is set in Santiago de Compostela and Castile, both in Spain, prior to 1350. Donizetti made fundamental changes to {{the first half of}} La favorite and little remains of L'ange.

5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> same on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E
5|$|E-767 – the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) {{platform}} for the Japan Self-Defense Forces; it <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> Boeing E-3 Sentry mission package on a 767-200ER platform. E-767 modifications, completed on 767-200ERs flown from the Everett factory to Boeing Integrated Defense Systems in Wichita, Kansas, include strengthening to accommodate a dorsal surveillance radar system, engine nacelle alterations, as well as electrical and interior changes. Japan operates four E-767s. The first E-767s were delivered in March 1998.|$|E

5|$|From the 8th century AD onward, astronomers {{developed}} {{methods for}} approximating and calculating the direction to Mecca (qibla)—and its distance—from any {{location on the}} Earth. From the 9th century onward they were using spherical trigonometry and map projection methods to determine these quantities accurately. The calculation <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> conversion of the equatorial polar coordinates of Mecca (i.e. its longitude and latitude) to its polar coordinates (i.e. its qibla and distance) relative to a system whose reference meridian is the great circle through the given location and the Earth's poles, and whose polar axis is the line through the location and its antipodal point.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> displacement of a contact line {{such as the}} one in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes {{it much easier to}} strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E

5|$|Maya art <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> art of {{the royal}} court. It is almost {{exclusively}} concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only {{a small proportion of}} the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas. Maya art has many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E

He or she is elected for two-and-a-half-year terms, meaning two elections per parliamentary term. The President is currently Antonio Tajani MEP of the EPP.|$|E

5|$|Tulsidas {{identifies}} Maya with Sita, the inseparable {{energy of}} Rama which takes avatar along with Rama. In his view, Maya is of two types – Vidya and Avidya. Vidya Maya {{is the cause}} of creation and the liberation of Jiva. Avidya Maya {{is the cause of}} illusion and bondage of the Jiva. The entire world is under the control of Maya. Maya <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> same but the two divisions are made for cognitive purposes, this view of Tulsidas is in accordance with Vaishnava teachers of Vedanta.|$|E
5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E

5|$|In February 2015, {{a credit}} dispute between {{universal}} primer technology and DNA barcoding came to light. Verma {{has argued that}} DNA barcoding, a technique independently described by zoologist Paul D N Hebert in 2003, <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> same as universal primer technology (UPT) and that both utilize standardized, short stretch of DNA from mitochondrial genome, amplified using the specific universal primers, to assign the identity of an unknown biological sample to a particular species. Verma claimed that UPT was described earlier than DNA barcoding in his patents, and publication; therefore, it should be fairly credited. However, Hebert argued {{that he was not}} aware of UPT because its patents were not visible to the broader scientific community due to a substantial interval from its filing in 2001 to grant in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Mother Gothel {{appears in}} Tangled (2010). For {{hundreds}} of years, Gothel, a vain old woman, hoards the rejuvenation powers of a magical flower {{in order to}} remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts a secret {{from the rest of the}} kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower is desperately retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to what <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> only thing that is keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via her long, golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, raising the child as her own and prohibiting her from leaving solely in order to use her hair to stay young.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
