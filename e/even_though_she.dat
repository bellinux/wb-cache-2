5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s.

5|$|Campania {{failed to}} receive the signal to deploy when the Grand Fleet {{departed}} Scapa Flow on 30 May 1916 {{en route to the}} Battle of Jutland, but she sailed two hours and fifteen minutes later. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> was slowly overtaking the fleet early in the morning of 31 May, she was ordered to return to Scapa Flow as she lacked an escort and German submarines had been reported in the area. The ship participated in some anti-submarine and anti-Zeppelin patrols, but she was later declared unfit for fleet duty because of her defective machinery and became a seaplane training and balloon depot ship. In April 1918 Campania, along with the Grand Fleet, was transferred from Scapa Flow to Rosyth.|$|E
