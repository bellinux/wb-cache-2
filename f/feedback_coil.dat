40|$|The {{requirements}} for active resistive wall mode (RWM) feedback control have been systematically investigated and established using highly reproducible current-driven RWMs in ohmic discharges in DIII-D. The unambiguous evaluation of active RWM feedback control {{was not possible}} in previous RWM studies primarily due to the variability of {{the onset of the}} pressure-driven RWMs; the stability of the pressure-driven RWM is thought to be sensitive to various passive stabilization mechanisms. Both feedback control specifications and physics {{requirements for}} RWM stabilization have been clarified using the current-driven RWMs in ohmic discharges, when little or no passive stabilization effects are present. The use of derivative gain on top of proportional gain is found to be advantageous. An effective feedback control system should be equipped with a power supply with bandwidth greater than the RWM growth rate. It is beneficial to apply a feedback field that is toroidally phase-shifted from the measured RWM phase {{in the same direction as}} the plasma current. The efficacy of the RWM feedback control will ultimately be determined by the plasma fluctuations on internal diagnostics, as well as on external magnetics. The proximity of the <b>feedback</b> <b>coils</b> to the plasma appears to be an important factor in determining the effectiveness of the RWM <b>feedback</b> <b>coils.</b> It is desirable that an RWM feedback control system simultaneously handles error field correction at a low frequency, along with direct RWM feedback at a high frequency. There is an indication of the influence of a second least stable RWM, which had been theoretically predicted but never identified in experiments. A preliminary investigation based on active MHD spectroscopic measurement showed a strong plasma response around 400 Hz where the typical plasma response associated with the first least stable RWM was expected to be negligible.

Plasmas 7, 3681 (2000) ]. Control optimization shows that the mode can be stabilized up to the ideal wall beta limit, using the internal control coils (I-coils) and poloidal sensors located at the outboard midplane, in combination with an ideal amplifier. With the present DIII-D power supply model, the stabilization is achieved up to 70 % of the range between no-wall and ideal-wall limits. Reasonably good quantitative agreement is achieved between MARS-F simulations and experiments on DIII-D and JET (Joint European Torus) [P. H. Rebut, Nucl.

40|$|The EXTRAP T 2 R is a Reversed Field Pinch (RFP) device purposed {{to conduct}} {{magnetic}} confinement fusion research. Magnetic confinement {{works on the}} principle of isolating the hot plasma from the cool walls by locking in the plasma onto the magnetic field lines.

40|$|For {{the success}} of {{thermonuclear}} fusion by magnetic confinement {{it is important to}} improve on the stability limits imposed by large-scale magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) instabilities. This thesis focuses on the stabilisation of the "resistive-wall mode" (RWM), an instability which affects high-pressure tokamaks but also Reversed Field Pinches (RFP). In high-pressure tokamaks, one way to stabilise the RWM is to induce sufficient toroidal velocity of the bulk plasma. Numerical simulations with an ideal-MHD model have been used to study how the critical rotation velocity depends on different plasma parameters. Predictions of the model are compared with experimental data and are in reasonable agreement for the critical rotation required for the stabilisation of the RWM. The main stabilising effect comes from Alfvé resonances close to rational magnetic surfaces inside the plasma. A second method, adopted both in tokamaks and RFPs, uses external <b>feedback</b> <b>coils</b> which control the magnetic field at the plasma boundary. Active control of MHD instabilities has received growing attention in the latest years both for increasing the stability of high-pressure plasmas and to study fundamental MHD properties of RFPs. An investigation with a simple cylindrical model describes the main features of the RWM control problem and the analysis is combined with standard control theory. The results are encouraging, predicting the possibility to stabilise the RWM with moderate coil voltages. Favourable results of feedback control have already been obtained in tokamaks.

Active control of MHD modes is of interest for both the Advanced Tokamak and the Reversed Field Pinch (RFP) configurations. A wide range of unstable, current driven MHD modes {{is present in the}} RFP. An ideally conducting wall facing the plasma can in principle provide stabilization to these modes. However, a real, resistive wall characterized by a wall field diffusion time, cannot stabilize the ideal MHD modes unless they rotate with Alfvénic velocity, which is usually not the case. With a resistive wall, the ideal modes are converted into resistive wall modes (RWM) with growth rates comparable to the inverse wall time.

40|$|In many {{research}} areas physical {{systems are}} described by mathematical models. We focus here on {{systems that are}} regulated by a controller, typically realized by software, whose design involves certain parameters. Inevitably, there will be differences between {{the behavior of the}} physical system and the model (uncertainties), and it is desirable that the control system meet certain demands {{in the face of all}} likely uncertainties. Achieving such reliability is the purpose of robust control. This thesis aims at solving the robust control problem by combining techniques for numerical optimization with theory for robust control. For the latter, w e consider PID and H&# 8734; controllers, and the design problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem with controller parameters as unknowns, and closed loop robustness and performance measures entering as constraints (criteria) and as objective function. Robustness to model uncertainties is guaranteed by use of quantitative feedback theory and structured singular values. In particular, a conceptually simple, and sometimes efficient, methodology is presented for computing an upper bound of the supremum of the structured singular value with respect to frequency. In solving the robust control problem, we make use of local optimization algorithms (using sequential quadratic programming) and semi-definite programming (using interior point methods to satisfy Linear Matrix Inequalities). Since all problems do not have unique solutions, global optimization also plays an important role. The design method is applied to two different systems. The first is the addition of external carbon to the Rya wastewater treatment plant in Göteborg. Uncertainty models are derived and it is shown in a feedback/feedforward design that both parts of the controller have to be designed jointly for the performance to be optimal, and that the feedforward controller is particularly sensitive to the uncertainties. The second application is one of the bottleneck problems in the advanced tokamak (the leading candidate for a fusion reactor); for general scenarios and for the DIII-D tokamak at General Atomics.

A Kalman filter is applied to discriminate unwanted contributions in the sensor signals, improving reliability of the control system. Control analyses show that simple controllers in combination with a surrounding wall can achieve stabilization of the RWMs, and although the resulting closed loop performance is not always ideal, it is shown that closed loop behavior can be significantly improved in DIII-D, and that pressure limits in advanced scenarios can be increased...|$|R

The feedback configuration leads to a very stable response. <b>Feedback</b> ferrite-cored solenoidal <b>coils</b> show very little interaction {{as long as they are}} separated by one half their length...|$|R
