40|$|Recently {{selective}} cerebral per fusion (SCP) {{has been}} established as a very useful method for cerebral protection during aortic arch reconstruction, but many details such as per <b>fusion</b> <b>flow</b> and pressure remain to be defined in order for this technique to be considered safe. It will also he necessary to define the cerebral functions which will serve best as diagnostic criteria for safety during such surgery. This study investigated for the optimal cerebral per <b>fusion</b> <b>flow</b> and evaluated the usefulness of motor evoked potentials (MEP) as a criterion for cerebral function. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and MEP were monitored to evaluate cerebral function in 44 adult mongrel dogs. The dogs were subjected to extracorporeal circulation (ECC). SCP was started when the brain temperature had cooled to 25 ℃ using ECC. After a 90 -minute period of SCP, the dogs were rewarmed gradually to normal temperature. 34 out of the 44 dogs had been divided into four groups and subjected to the following cerebral per <b>fusion</b> <b>flow</b> rates. Group I (n= 9) : 100 % flow rate, i. e. the imposed per fusion was equal to the physiological flow as determined experimentally; Group II (n= 10) : 50 % flow rate; Group III (n= 8) : 25 % flow rate; Group IV (n= 7) : 0 % flow rate (cerebrocirculatory arrest). In the remaining group (n= 10), cerebral tissue blood flow before ECC and during SCP was measured by non-radioactive color-labelled microspheres. There {{was no significant difference}} between the observed changes in SEP and MEP. Cerebral function showed no abnormal findings as assessed by the final SEP and MEP after rewarming in both Groups I and II; these potentials recovered almost completely to the pre-ECC values in all dogs. In Group III, SEP and MEP disappeared in 5 dogs (62. 5 %). In Group IV, SEP and MEP disappeared in all dogs. The observed cerebral tissue blood flow showed a clear correlation with the cerebral per <b>fusion</b> <b>flow</b> rate. It was concluded that (1) MEP is a useful monitor for cerebral function during ECC, (2) the safe range of cerebral per <b>fusion</b> <b>flow</b> of SCP under moderate hypothermia is 50 - 100 % of the physiological flow rate, and (3) cerebral tissue blood flow depends on the cerebral per <b>fusion</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R

40|$|Data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> is a {{particular}} form of testing that identifies data <b>flow</b> relations as <b>test</b> objectives. Data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> has recently attracted new interest {{in the context of}} testing object oriented systems, since data flow information is well suited to capture relations among the object states, and can thus provide useful information for testing method interactions. Unfortunately, classic data <b>flow</b> <b>testing,</b> which is based on static analysis of the source code, fails to identify many important data flow relations due to the dynamic nature of object oriented systems. This thesis presents Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing,</b> a technique which rethinks data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> to suit the testing of modern object oriented software. Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> stems from empirical evidence that we collect on the limits of classic data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> techniques. We investigate such limits by means of Dynamic Data Flow Analysis, a dynamic implementation of data flow analysis that computes sound data flow information on program traces. We compare data flow information collected with static analysis of the code with information observed dynamically on execution traces, and empirically observe that the data flow information computed with classic analysis of the source code misses a significant part of information that corresponds to relevant behaviors that shall be tested. In view of these results, we propose Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing.</b> The technique promotes the synergies between dynamic analysis, static reasoning and test case generation for automatically extending a test suite with test cases that execute the complex state based interactions between objects. Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> computes precise data flow information of the program with Dynamic Data Flow Analysis, processes the dynamic information to infer new test objectives, which Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> uses to generate new test cases. The test cases generated by Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> exercise relevant behaviors that are otherwise missed by both the original test suite and test suites that satisfy classic data flow criteria...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} limits of current data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> {{approaches}} from a radically novel viewpoint, and shows that the static data flow techniques used so far in data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> to identify the test objectives fail to represent the universe of data flow relations entailed by a program. This paper compares the data flow relations computed with static data flow approaches with the ones observed while executing the program. To this end, the paper introduces a dynamic data flow technique that collects the data flow relations observed during testing. The experimental data discussed in the paper suggest that data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> based on static techniques misses many data <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> objectives, and indicate {{that the amount of}} missing objectives (false negatives) can be more limiting than the amount of infeasible data flow relations identified statically (false positives).

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} the ML <b>Flow</b> <b>test</b> as an additional, serological, tool for the classification of new leprosy patients. In Brazil, Nepal and Nigeria, 2632 leprosy patients were classified by three : (1) as multibacillary (MB) or paucibacillary (PB) according to the number of skin lesions (WHO classification), (2) by slit skin smear examination, and (3) by serology using the ML <b>Flow</b> <b>test</b> detecting IgM antibodies to Mycobacterium leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid-I. The proportion of MB leprosy patients was 39. 5, 35. 6 and 19. 4 % in Brazil, Nepal and Nigeria, respectively. The highest seropositivity in patients was observed in Nigeria (62. 9 %), followed by Brazil (50. 8 %) and Nepal (35. 6 %). ML <b>Flow</b> <b>test</b> results and smears were negative in 69. 1 and 82. 7 % of PB patients, while smears were positive in 58. 6 % of MB patients in Brazil and 28. 3 % in Nepal.

Two cross-borehole <b>flow</b> <b>tests</b> were completed. Each test involved measurement and analysis of transient flow in a newly installed deep corehole with a long open interval during short-term pumping and recovery in an adjacent shallow well with a short open interval. The cross-borehole <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> in the mudstone identified a hydraulic connection through a dipping fractured bed between the pumped interval in the well and a flow zone at an intermediate depth in the corehole. The presence of a hydraulic connection between the pumped well and the corehole was not obvious because the water-level response in the corehole was dominated by a shallow zone of high transmissivity, which was hydraulically isolated from the pumped interval. In the sandstone, the cross-borehole <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> identified a hydraulic connection along dipping fractured beds as well as a connection to a deep high-angle fracture that cuts across bedding.

40|$|Background: In Nigeria, leprosy {{still remains}} a {{condition}} that attracts attention, both {{by the government of}} the country, and particularly so by the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), due to its disabling and disfiguring consequences. Thus given the difficulties that control programs are often faced with, leprosy still remains a public health problem in Nigeria. Method: The Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) Biomedical Research developed the mycobacterium leprae (ML) <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> and evaluated its performance on standard sets of serum and blood samples. Databases and forms for data collection and evaluation were developed and health centres and workers were selected for participation in the project. They were trained {{in the use of the}} ML flow and the ML <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> was then used for 18 months as part of routine leprosy control activities in the selected health centres. Results: A total of 186 patients and 529 contacts were tested with the ML <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> in 28 health facilities located in 10 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Jigawa State. Thirty four health workers participated in the anthropological study. There were 117 (62. 9 %) patients found positive with the ML <b>flow</b> <b>test.</b> Conclusion: Despite that the ML <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> currently makes no sizeable contribution to the classification of leprosy patients in Jigawa State, it was still felt that the test could make a contribution in contact tracing and in classification, if the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of multibacillary (MB) would be followed...|$|R
