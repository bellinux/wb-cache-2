25|$|Panarchy: {{the degree}} to which a certain <b>hierarchical</b> <b>level</b> of an {{ecosystem}} is influenced by other levels. For example, organisms living in communities that are in isolation from one another may be organized differently from the same type of organism living in a large continuous population, thus the community-level structure is influenced by population-level interactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} emergence—that the {{properties}} and functions {{found at a}} <b>hierarchical</b> <b>level</b> are not present and are irrelevant at the lower levels–is often a basic principle behind self-organizing systems. An example of self-organization in biology leading to emergence {{in the natural world}} occurs in ant colonies. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behaviour and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.|$|E

A HTA can be represented in list or diagram form. In list form lines should be indented to denote the different hierarchical levels.
