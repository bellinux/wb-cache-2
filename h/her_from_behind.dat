The woman in the lower right hand corner turns to see flames {{reflected}} {{in the eyes of the}} daemon who holds <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> with a look of horrified guilt on her face. Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.|$|E
5|$|Smith's third {{victim was}} Carol Jordan, a 39-year-old care home worker {{and mother of}} six from Balsall Heath, who was killed as she walked to work. Smith hit <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> with his car while driving back from Worcestershire, {{fracturing}} her hip. Fearing {{that he would be}} caught, Smith moved her to another location and beat her so much that dental records were required to identify her corpse. The body was discovered at 8:50am on 12 November on parkland next to Bell Barn Road, Lee Bank.|$|E
5|$|Act III Le Chiffre tortures Bond {{in order}} to find out where Bond has hidden the cheque for his winnings, but Bond does not reveal where it is. After a fight between Bond and Le Chiffre's guards, Bond shoots and wounds Le Chiffre, saving Valerie in the process. Exhausted, Bond sits in a chair {{opposite}} Le Chiffre to talk. Mathis gets in between them and Le Chiffre grabs <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> threatening her with a concealed razor blade. As Le Chiffre moves towards the door with Mathis as a shield, she struggles, breaking free slightly and Bond is able to shoot Le Chiffre.|$|E

5|$|On October 18, 2010, jury {{selection}} commenced in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia before Judge Gerald I. Fisher. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez presented {{the names of}} potential witnesses for the trial, including FBI agent Brad Garrett and the two women whom Guandique was convicted of assaulting. At {{the start of the}} trial, the prosecution's case was expected to take around four weeks and the defense was expected to take one day. On October 25 and 26, Halle Shilling and Christy Wiegand testified about being attacked by Guandique while independently jogging in Rock Creek Park. Wiegand recounted that Guandique grabbed <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> dragged her down a ravine and held a knife against her face.|$|E
5|$|Koalas are {{seasonal}} breeders, and births {{take place}} {{from the middle}} of spring through the summer to early autumn, from October to May. Females in oestrus tend to hold their heads further back than usual and commonly display tremors and spasms. However, males do not appear to recognise these signs, and have been observed to mount non-oestrous females. Because of his much larger size, a male can usually force himself on a female, mounting <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> and in extreme cases, the male may pull the female out of the tree. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors, but will submit to one that is dominant or is more familiar. The bellows and screams that accompany matings can attract other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders. These fights may allow the female to assess which is dominant. Older males usually have accumulated scratches, scars, and cuts on the exposed parts of their noses and on their eyelids.|$|E
25|$|Sutcliffe {{attacked}} Olive Smelt in Halifax in August. Employing {{the same}} modus operandi, he struck <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> {{and used a}} knife to slash her, this time above her buttocks. Again he was interrupted, and left his victim badly injured but alive. Like Rogulskyj, Smelt suffered emotional scars, including clinical depression. On 27 August, Sutcliffe attacked 14-year-old Tracy Browne in Silsden. He struck <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> and hit her on the head five times while she was walking along a country lane. He ran off {{when he saw the}} lights of a passing car, leaving his victim requiring brain surgery. Sutcliffe was not convicted of the attack, but confessed to it in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Sutcliffe {{attacked}} 20-year-old Marcella Claxton in Roundhay Park, Leeds, on 9 May. Walking {{home from}} a party, she accepted an offer of a lift from Sutcliffe. When {{she got out of}} the car to urinate, Sutcliffe hit <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> with a hammer. She was left alive and testified against Sutcliffe at his trial. At the time of this attack, Claxton had been four months pregnant, and subsequently suffered a miscarriage.|$|E
25|$|In Malibu Comics' {{short-lived}} Street Fighter series, Chun-Li {{is depicted}} as having known Ryu and Ken since her late teens, as well as having a romantic interest in Ryu, though both make their first appearances therein fighting each other after he sneaks up on <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b> She criticizes his overly devout dedication to his training that has seen him distance himself from Ken for a long time, while he tires of hearing her desire of revenge against Bison and is aghast at her announcement that she has started working with Interpol. The main storyline did not focus on Chun-Li nor Ryu, but rather the aftermath of Sagat's murder of Ken, which itself was never resolved as the comic was canceled at Capcom's request after only three issues.|$|E
60|$|Neither {{the contact}} of daily familiarity, {{the quality of}} suffering, nor the {{presence}} of approaching death, could subdue the woman's nature in Grace. She instantly raised <b>her</b> shield. <b>From</b> <b>behind</b> it she began to fence feebly with the dying man.|$|R

25|$|A day later, on Saturday, August 25, Rolling {{broke into}} the {{apartment}} where 18-year-old Christa Hoyt lived by prying open a sliding glass door with a KA-BAR knife and a screwdriver, {{but she was not}} home. He waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m. she entered the apartment and Rolling surprised <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> placing her in a choke-hold. After she had been subdued, he taped her mouth shut, bound her wrists together and led her into the bedroom, where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her face-down and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her heart. He then decapitated the body and posed her head on a shelf facing the corpse, adding to the shock of whoever discovered her.|$|E
25|$|Ridgway began each {{murder by}} picking up a woman, usually a sex worker. He {{sometimes}} showed the woman {{a picture of his}} son, to trick her into trusting him. After raping her, Ridgway strangled <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b> He initially strangled them manually. However, many victims inflicted wounds and bruises on his arm while trying to defend themselves. Concerned these wounds and bruises would draw attention, Ridgway began using ligatures. He killed most victims in his home, his truck, or a secluded area. In the early 1980s, the King County Sheriff's Office formed the Green River Task Force to investigate the murders. The most notable members of the task force were Robert Keppel and Dave Reichert, who periodically interviewed incarcerated serial killer Ted Bundy in 1984. Bundy offered his opinions on the psychology, motivations, and behavior of the killer; he suggested that the killer was revisiting the dump sites to have sexual relations with his victims, {{which turned out to be}} true, and if police found a fresh grave, they should stake it out and wait for him to come back. Also contributing to the investigation was John E. Douglas, who has since written much on the subject of the Green River Killer.|$|E
25|$|Although Black {{was mostly}} {{successful}} in America, {{months prior to}} her final SHIMMER appearance she lost her RQW Women's Championship at a 16 June RQW event to German wrestler Wesna, with Jetta and Amazing Kong also competing in the four way elimination match. Her rematch with Wesna, this time in a singles match, took place at ChickFight IX.5 but ended in a controversial manner when Jetta interfered in the match {{to make it seem}} as if Black had used a foreign object, thus having her disqualified. Enraged, Black chased Jetta out of the building but the two were booked for a grudge match later on that same night; Giving Jetta a taste of her own medicine, Black attacked <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> during her entrance leading to a brawl all around ringside that consumed most of the match until it officially began inside the ring with Black eventually losing as Jetta used the ropes for the pin. After Black was on the winning side of the tag team match at Shimmer, it became clear the two needed to settle their feud one-on-one and RQW decided to host the match in October. However, the hotly anticipated bout ended in a double count-out ostensibly due to the fierce fighting between the two, though Black had actually suffered a legitimate shoulder injury during the match and could not carry on.|$|E

The reference is made clear when Peter asks her if she bought a necklace using her money from the show. Tiffani also tells Peter he need not worry about her conceiving, as she is [...] "already pregnant." [...] In real life, Thiessen was expecting her first child at the time. After Lois decides to leave Peter, she is shown shopping for groceries at the Quahog Market.

Michael approached <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> and warned her that his brothers did not treat women right and that his brother only wanted to use her for sex. Changing the subject, the female fan asked for the pop star's autograph, which request he obliged in addition to writing, [...] "Please, don't go". The woman ignored Michael's request and headed to the Jacksons' apartment complex, where she had sex with Jackie. Afterward, Jackie informed the woman that they would not meet again. Ashamed and upset, the fan left the apartment in tears.|$|E
500|$|In her video series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games (2013–2017), feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian criticises Resident Evil for sexualising its {{alternate}} costumes for women, citing as {{an example}} Valentine's pirate costume in the game Resident Evil: Revelations (2012). She also cites Valentine's movement in the game {{as an example}} of female characters who walk in an overly sexualised manner. Valentine's first appearance in the film Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) is of her legs in a miniskirt, and the camera frequently follows <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b> Commentators have noted that her body shape is unrealistic and does not reflect her physical training, and she was the only member of her team in the original game not to wear a bulletproof vest. Video-game journalist Bob Mackey described her miniskirt outfit in Resident Evil 3 (1999) as an [...] "embarrassing relic" [...] from a period that catered to teenage boys.|$|E

500|$|During the First Battle of Narvik on 10 April 1940, Hunter {{and four}} other H-class ships of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla {{attacked}} the German destroyers that had transported German troops to occupy Narvik in northern Norway the previous day. The flotilla leader [...] led four of her half-sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a blinding snowstorm. [...] and [...] were initially left at the entrance, but Hunter followed Hardy into the harbour and fired all eight of her torpedoes into the mass of shipping. One torpedo hit the [...] in the forward engine room, followed by one of Hunters 4.7-inch shells. As the British ships were withdrawing, they encountered five German destroyers at close range. Two of the German ships crossed the T of the British ships and quickly set Hardy on fire and forced her to run aground. Hunter eventually took the lead, but was severely damaged by the Germans, probably including one torpedo hit, and her speed dropped rapidly. Hotspur, immediately behind her, was temporarily out of control due to two hits, and rammed <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b> When the ships managed to disengage, Hunter capsized. 107 men of the crew were killed and another five died of their wounds. The German destroyers rescued 46 men, who were released into Sweden on 13 April.|$|E
500|$|During the First Battle of Narvik on 10 April the ship, {{together}} with her sister ship, , was initially deployed to secure the escape route {{of the other three}} destroyers of the 2nd Flotilla and deal with any captured coast defence guns. Hotspur did eventually move forward and fired four torpedoes into Narvik harbour, sinking at least two merchant ships. As the British ships were leaving the vicinity of Narvik they encountered five German destroyers at close range. Two of the German ships crossed the T of the British ships and quickly set [...] on fire and forced her to run aground.

[...] and [...] had disengaged earlier, but came back to save Hotspur. Hostile laid a smoke screen that allowed Hotspur to escape while Havock engaged the German ships. Hostile escorted the badly damaged Hotspur to the repair base set up at Flakstadøya in the Lofoten Islands. During the battle the ship had been hit seven times by German shells which knocked out No. 2 boiler, all electrical circuits, her depth charges, her rangefinder and killed 18 of her crew. Temporary repairs allowed Hotspur to sail for Chatham Dockyard where she was repaired from 2 May to 16 July.|$|E
