5000|$|There are two {{specific}} types of <b>interpleader</b> <b>actions</b> in the United States federal courts. Statutory Interpleader governed by , and Rule Interpleader established by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [...]|$|R
5000|$|Thus, [...] "where a {{court of}} equity has all the parties before it, it will {{adjudicate}} upon all {{of the rights of}} the parties connected with {{the subject matter of the}} action, so as to avoid a multiplicity of suits."

50|$|In an <b>interpleader</b> <b>action,</b> {{the party}} {{initiating}} the litigation, normally the plaintiff, is termed the stakeholder. The money or other property in controversy {{is called the}} res. All defendants having a possible {{interest in the subject}} matter of the case are called claimants. In some jurisdictions, the plaintiff is referred to as the plaintiff-in-interpleader and each claimant a claimant-in-interpleader.|$|E
5000|$|Deposit: A Statutory <b>Interpleader</b> <b>action</b> is {{commenced}} by the stakeholder {{who must}} initially deposit with the court, {{the amount in}} controversy, or post a specific bond with the court, [...] The stakeholder may, however, at trial claim they don't owe money to the claimants at all, since the action {{can be in the}} nature of interpleader.|$|E
50|$|Interpleader is civil {{procedure}} {{that allows a}} plaintiff or a defendant to initiate a lawsuit in order to compel two or more other parties to litigate a dispute. An <b>interpleader</b> <b>action</b> originates when the plaintiff holds property on behalf of another, but does not know to whom the property should be transferred. It {{is often used to}} resolve disputes arising under insurance contracts.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of interpleader {{depends upon the}} availability of injunctions against other proceedings. There is no congressional authorization of such injunctions for rule interpleader cases. If interpleader were an in rem action, {{one of the other}} exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act might save the day, but the Supreme Court has apparently foreclosed that option. This article examines that three-sided conflict. Part II discusses the problem in greater depth, focusing first on how interpleader functions and why it depends on being “the only game in town. ” Part II next addresses the background and interpretation of the Anti-Injunction Act, exploring particularly the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s narrow interpretation the Act 2 ̆ 7 s provisions and discussing the federalism values that the Act and the Court seek to serve. Finally, Part II reviews interpleader 2 ̆ 7 s status as an in personam action. Even in setting out the problem, one can conceive of at least three potential solutions. One might simply acknowledge that injunctions are not available in rule <b>interpleader</b> <b>actions.</b> Alternatively, one might reverse the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s view of interpleader as an in personam action, recharacterizing it as in rem to get around the strictures of the Anti-Injunction Act. Finally, one might leave interpleader itself untouched but reinterpret the jurisdiction exception to the Anti-Injunction Act. Unfortunately, each of these solutions comes with an unpalatable price. Part III discusses the price of each solution. Part IV considers whether, despite the costs of each solution, Congress or the Court should adopt any of them or whether there is some other alternative. In fact, there are two alternatives. Recharacterizing interpleader as an in rem proceeding to fit it within the Anti-Injunction Act is possible, though not the best answer because it would require extended judicial effort to refine the courts 2 ̆ 7 jurisdictional treatment of in rem proceedings generally. This approach is anything but simple and easy to implement. The more elegant option is for Congress explicitly to authorize injunctions against state proceedings in rule <b>interpleader</b> <b>actions,</b> and Part IV offers language that does so...|$|R
50|$|Interpleader {{is a civil}} {{procedure}} developed under equity jurisprudence, though originally it was derived the <b>interpleader</b> form of <b>action</b> at law, which only applied to bailees subject to multiple actions of detinue. However, the action at law became obsolete and relief became available from the Court of Chancery.|$|R
50|$|The GDC {{can also}} {{entertain}} <b>interpleader</b> causes of <b>action,</b> allowing a party holding {{something of value}} to force all competing claimants to litigate which of them has the superior claim. As with other causes of action, the jurisdictional limitations must be met. It must be remembered that the GDC has no injunctive power; while the Circuit Courts can issue injunctions prohibiting parties from litigating the interpleader claim in other forums, the GDC can not prevent this. Finally, {{there is no right}} of intervention in GDC proceedings; a third party that wishes to become a party to a pending case can not do so except on a motion of an existing party to the case.|$|R

50|$|The may claim {{language}} {{added in}} 1948 codification to Title 28 of the United States Code in {{the definitions of}} claim allow interpleader for unliquidated claims, such as multiple claimant to a liability insurance policy injured in an accident before they are reduced to judgment or settled, however the injunction may only restrain the claimants from suits making claims against the res not suits to liquidate the claim or against third parties. The procedures for a Statutory <b>Interpleader</b> <b>action</b> are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 22(b).|$|E
50|$|For example, {{suppose a}} person dies {{with a life}} {{insurance}} policy. However, the insurance company knows {{there will be a}} dispute over who should receive the proceeds. The insurance company can file an <b>interpleader</b> <b>action.</b> The insurance company is the stakeholder, the claimants are the persons who might be beneficiaries under the policy, and the cash value of the policy benefit is the res. Under the proceeding as originally developed, the stakeholder would deposit the res with the court, and then the defendants would have their claims adjudicated by the court. Statutory modifications to the procedure, which vary by jurisdiction, sometimes allow the stakeholder to retain the res pending final disposition of the case. Typically, once the stakeholder deposits the res into the court (for example, the face value of the insurance policy), the stakeholder is released from the action and the claimants proceed against each other to determine which of them is legally entitled to the res. A disinterested stakeholder is entitled to costs including attorney's fees. Except for the denominations of the parties, the action proceeds for the most part as other civil lawsuits in the same jurisdiction.|$|E
40|$|I {{have been}} invited to comment on Judge Carter 2 ̆ 7 s paper and on the conference proceedings. My {{concerns}} are threefold. First, many proceduralists seek to invoke the views of the drafters of the Federal Rules to advance visions of what the Rules should look like and how those Rules should be interpreted. Constitutional law scholars have already made plain the complexities of analysis based upon 2 ̆ 2 framers 2 ̆ 7 intent. 2 ̆ 2 We proceduralists should learn those lessons and be reluctant to draw too much meaning from 2 ̆ 2 the framers. 2 ̆ 2 Moreover, whatever one believes about analysis based upon intent, the utility of that approach {{in the context of the}} Federal Rules is exceedingly questionable. Given the process of rule enactment, the statutory and self-proclaimed limits of the Advisory Committees, and the self-described minimal involvement of the Judicial Conference and of the Supreme Court, privileging the words of the Advisory Committee notes and the supposed intent behind those words becomes all the more suspect. Second, a remarkable aspect of this conference has been the repeated references to the 2 ̆ 2 political 2 ̆ 2 aspects of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. From a variety of perspectives, many of the speakers have made comments about the political implications of various Rules. Others, seeming to accept the political content of the Rules, have warned that 2 ̆ 2 we 2 ̆ 2 (that is, all litigants) are safer when the facade, if not the reality, is maintained that 2 ̆ 2 neutral 2 ̆ 2 Rules are applied to 2 ̆ 2 anonymous 2 ̆ 2 (that is, not identifiable in advance) plaintiffs and defendants. I believe we cannot and should not ignore the political content and consequences of procedural rules. Over the last decade, a variety of powerful 2 ̆ 2 repeat players 2 ̆ 2 have sought, sometimes openly, to influence 2 ̆ 2 court reform 2 ̆ 2 efforts. By and large, that work has been done not by letters written to the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, but rather by lobbying efforts directed towards legislatures and the public, by well-financed media campaigns, and by support for conferences and meetings to address and describe the 2 ̆ 2 litigation crisis. 2 ̆ 2 However appealing might be the notion that writing the Rules of Civil Procedure (in contrast to the Rules of Criminal Procedure) is a 2 ̆ 2 neutral 2 ̆ 2 task with diverse consequences on anonymous and interchangeable civil plaintiffs and defendants, that description is no longer available. 2 ̆ 2 Tort reform, 2 ̆ 2 among other events of the last decade, has denied us the refuge of a comforting image. Finally, fifty years after the Federal Rules were enacted, we must wonder about whether litigation of individuals 2 ̆ 7 cases will be available fifty years hence. During these past five decades, federal courts have become less willing to attend to small cases and to individual problems. Increasingly, these cases are diverted—to state courts, to agencies, to alternative dispute resolution, to settlement, to management, to arbitration. Increasingly, those cases that remain in the federal system are aggregated—by multi-district litigation, by bankruptcy, by <b>interpleader,</b> by class <b>action,</b> by consolidation, by informal procedures. Increasingly, federal judges complain that they do not have time (and some say interest) for cases of small value, for cases that seem only to raise individual claims of wrongdoing. The pressures for aggregation and its growing popularity affect perceptions about the utility of having federal courts address individual claims...|$|R
