Bumgarner was rested for what would have been his final start of the season, following a great seven-inning, one-run, 10-strikeout win over the New York Mets. Bochy said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Bumgarner a break and also allow Barry Zito a final home start. Bumgarner finished in ninth place for the National League Cy Young Award voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said {{that even if he}} reached the merits of the question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E
5|$|Considering the {{response}} to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> France, {{in the event of}} an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO–Warsaw Pact war. In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command, and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the air force bases that it had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.|$|E

5|$|Nomura {{redesigned}} Cloud for {{his appearance}} in Kingdom Hearts. He is depicted with a claw and a crimson cape, and {{the blade of}} his sword is wrapped in bandages. Stating that Cloud's left arm was inspired by Vincent Valentine, Nomura explained that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the character a more demon-like appearance due to his ties {{to the dark side}} in the game. Nomura stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud was searching for Aerith open to the player's interpretation. Teruaki Sugawara, the game's voice director, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of The Bouncer, Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak. Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be voicing a different character than the one featured in Final Fantasy VII.|$|E
5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging {{her to come}} and see him so they can be together. The letter reaches her just before she can take the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding. She must tell Charming she does not love him, or the King will kill him. Snow obeys because she loves Charming too much to let him die, but both are left heartbroken. Snow leaves and is soon joined by Grumpy and six other dwarfs, who offer her a place to stay. She considers the potion but Grumpy warns her that those feelings however painful, are part of her. Charming calls off the wedding to look for Snow and the dwarves hear about it from Red Riding Hood. Grumpy joyfully tells Snow the good news, but she has forgotten about Charming. The pain was too great to bear and she drank the potion.|$|E

25|$|Gritty and realistic, {{the novel}} was partly {{intended}} to shatter {{the myth of}} a noble, obedient Finnish soldier. In Linna's own words, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Finnish soldier a brain, an organ lacking in earlier depictions—such as Johan Runeberg's The Tales of Ensign Stål where Finnish soldiers are admiringly portrayed with big hearts and little independent intellect.

25|$|After {{a season}} and a half with the Braves, he was traded to John McGraw's New York Giants along with Larry Benton and Herb Thomas for Doc Farrell, Kent Greenfield and Hugh McQuillan. The Giants had {{acquired}} Grimes in another trade and wanted Taylor to be his personal catcher. Despite catching Grimes' team-leading 19 wins and performing well defensively to help the Giants finish the season just two games behind the pennant-winning Pittsburgh Pirates, McGraw released Taylor back to the Braves for the waiver price of $4,000 on February 28, 1928, the same day Grimes was traded to Pittsburgh. McGraw said he regretted releasing the 29-year-old Taylor, but that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> younger catchers such as Shanty Hogan a chance to play. Taylor took over as the Braves' starting catcher for the 1928 season.|$|E
25|$|Upon being {{informed}} of the indictment, he urged his followers not to take any action {{if he was going}} to be sentenced to less than six months in prison, stressing that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> an example of dignity, but ordered a group of Legionaries to defend him in case of an attack by the authorities. He was arrested together with 44 other prominent members of the movement, including Ion Zelea Codreanu, Gheorghe Clime, Alexandru Cristian Tell, Radu Gyr, Nae Ionescu, Şerban Milcoveanu and Mihail Polihroniade, on the evening of April 16. The crackdown coincided with the Orthodox celebration of Palm Sunday (when all those targeted were known to be in their homes). After a short stay in the Romanian Police Prefecture, Codreanu was dispatched to Jilava prison, while the other prisoners were sent to Tismana Monastery (and later to concentration camps such as the one in Miercurea Ciuc).|$|E
25|$|Final Fantasy III saw the {{introduction}} of the Job Change System: through special crystals, the four player characters were granted a variety of jobs or character classes that could be switched at any point by the player. The Job Change system was initially proposed by Sakaguchi as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> players freedom to customize the party members: with five characters with eight jobs each, the team needed to create forty different pixel portraits. The Job System has continued to have a strong role in the series, being most prominent in Final Fantasy V with twenty-two available jobs. Jobs have recurring functions throughout the series. Some of the more traditional classes include the Warrior/Fighter, the Dragoon, the Thief and variations on magical classes such as White and Black Mages. More original classes have appeared throughout the series, such as Bards, Scholars, and Summoners. Due to the series' popularity, they have become staples of RPGs since their debut. The complexity and scope of the class system varies from game to game. The original Final Fantasy XIV did away with the Job System in favour of a character class-driven system where equipment determined skills and growth. For the later stages of Final Fantasy XIV and later A Realm Reborn, the Job System was reintroduced as a second level to the current class system. Many Jobs, such as the Dragoon, the Summoner, and the Red Mage have become closely identified with the series.|$|E

[...] Although McCartney was a supporter of Yankovic's work and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Yankovic the chance to parody one of his songs, he begrudgingly turned him down {{due to the fact}} that, as a vegetarian, he could not condone the eating of animal flesh.

500|$|The {{decision}} {{to shoot the}} film mainly {{in black and white}} contributed to the documentary style of cinematography, which cinematographer Janusz Kamiński compared to German Expressionism and Italian neorealism.
