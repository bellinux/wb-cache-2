5000|$|An {{antistatic}} {{floor mat}} or ground mat {{is one of}} a number of antistatic devices designed to help eliminate static electricity. It does this by having a controlled low resistance: a metal mat would keep parts grounded but would short out exposed parts; an <b>insulating</b> <b>mat</b> would provide no ground reference and so would not provide grounding. Typical resistance is on the order of 105 to 108 ohms between points on the mat and to ground. [...] The mat would need to be grounded (earthed). This is usually accomplished by plugging into the grounded line in an electrical outlet. It's important to discharge at a slow rate, therefore a resistor should be used in earthing the mat. The resistor, as well as allowing high-voltage charges to leak through to earth, also prevents a shock hazard when working with low-voltage parts. Some ground mats allow you to connect an antistatic wrist strap to them. Versions are designed for placement on both the floor and desk.|$|E

It defines {{a field of}} aplication of an equipment and deals with a design solution versions. It also deals with a structure of chosen version and a calculation. The calculation is devided into a preliminary calculation, a kinematics analysis, a static analysis and a control calculation. Safety- checking of elements due to limit state flexibility {{is a result of}} a control calculation. An economic analysis follows after it. It concerns calculating the cost of materials, normalized components, modular components and other components...|$|E
40|$|The {{investment}} {{involved in}} any communication system represents a considerable sum. Even though it is desirable that the system work properly each and every time it is called into use, some failures are bound to occur. Most failures, however, and especially those that occur most frequently, are due to poor installation techniques. An extra hour spent at an installation site can save many maintenance trips and many frustrating hours of system troubleshooting. Typical faults likely to cause communication outrage are Pager phone systems Poor splices aggravated by corrosion. Strain relief not provided. Drip loop not provided. Incorrect branch connections. Overloading the circuit. Poor battery connections. Improper wire size or type. Lightning strikes. Improper placement of wire runs. Carrier phones Mounting transceiver near load resistors or other sources of heat. Tracks not electrically bonded. Cable abrasion due to poor mounting location. Disconnected battery. Poor mechanical installation. Each installation should be well planned. After an installation is completed, the technician should ask the question, "What can go wrong with this unit or line?" Remember the adage, "Whatever can go wrong, will. " Preventive measures taken during installation will pay off in the long run. 6. 2 Pager Phone Installation The pager phones used in many underground coal mines are battery-operated, party-line telephones with provisions for loudspeaker paging. The system is usually two-wire, nonpolarized, and operated by self-contained batteries. Many of the individual units are certified as permissible. 6. 2. 1 Mounting Pager phones {{are designed to be}} mounted on an upright support at the desired location. For convenience, the phone should be mounted 5 feet above the floor where there is no obstruction to using the handset or removing the cabinet front cover for servicing or battery replacement. In low-coal situations, a suitable height for installation should be selected convenient to the normal operator's position at the site selected. About 12 inches of free space {{on each side of the}} phone should be provided for cabinet access. The phone should be protected against direct exposure to dripping water and should not be allowed to rest in a puddle of water. The mounting location should be convenient to a work location and have a safe, unobstructed area for a worker to stand and use the phone. The phone must be in a location where the worker will not be in the path of moving vehicles or falling debris. Each telephone is normally well insulated, but it is still good practice to provide an <b>insulating</b> <b>mat</b> or dry planking for the user to stand on...|$|E
50|$|In 1663 Alexis settled {{to convert}} his {{personal}} domain into a technologically advanced center of Russian economy; {{he believed that}} agricultural technologies and crafts could be perfected {{to a point where}} domestic produce can substitute imports of wine, silk, cotton and spices. Another, less ambitious, objective was to grow commercial quantities of traditional Russian produce - wheat and linen. Most of this plan did, in fact, materialize. Izmaylovo vineyards, protected in winter by <b>insulating</b> <b>mats,</b> were sustained for decades; melons grew in soil brought from Astrakhan, figs and coconuts in greenhouses, although slowly. The stubborn silk worm appears to be the only absolute failure. Records of Izmaylovo inventory, including names of hundreds of Russian and foreign employees, were compiled soon after the death of Alexis and preserved in archives together with original architectural plans of the 1660s, making Izmaylovo the best documented of 17th century estates in Russia.|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} of ordinary houses {{varies according to}} location and elevation. In the southern lower altitudes, thatched bamboo houses are common; buildings progress to simple stone structures in higher altitudes. Two-storied buildings resembling but smaller than the lordly mansions are common throughout western Bhutan. Like mansions, upper floors are often reserved for chapels, which double as guest quarters. Attics, <b>insulated</b> with bamboo <b>mats</b> and hay, often serve for drying animal skins and chilies.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the breakup}} of the former Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the 18 class members, and the TEŽ itself, were owned and {{operated}} by the Czechoslovak State Railways (ČSD). In service, their well proven three section articulated configuration allowed successful operation on the TEŽ's tight radius curves. Additionally, their all axle drive system enabled rapid acceleration and good traction, especially on uphill sections. On the other hand, the class did suffer from occasional derailments, leading to service interruptions. There were also problems with torn coupling bellows between the units, and the rubber <b>insulating</b> roof <b>mats.</b> In July 1981, due to delays in the delivery of replacements for worn tyres, all but four of the units had to be temporarily taken out of service, and replaced by road buses.|$|R

Motor and transmission are located under the floor in the back, high-floor of the bus. The three gas cylinders (each with a volume of 320 l) for CNG are located on the roof in front of the car. From the producer was offered also a diesel version with the designation L 12 D, but its production had no plans in the near future.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{of their}} number managed to obtain liquid oxygen {{from the nearby}} Arthur D. Little company, which was {{developing}} a portable military [...] "lox" [...] generator and was dumping excess product fuming and freezing everything, into the gutter. The club hauled it to their test site in 5-gallon steel cans <b>insulated</b> with fiber <b>mat.</b> This gave their most successful test—the rocket motor roared with a ten-foot plume of flame filled with standing shock waves, with the thrust gauge off-scale for ten seconds or more. But the aluminum motor burned out its throat and set the test stand on fire, which they put out with a Pyrene hand fire extinguisher. However the carbon tetrachloride produced phosgene and chlorine gasses (they deduced), which corroded all the metal.|$|R
50|$|The US Army has {{recently}} prioritized renewable energy strategies in Iraq. Strategies include the Tactical Garbage to Energy Refinery Program, which converts 1 ST of waste to 11 gal of JP-8 fuel, a photovoltaic flexible, portable <b>mat,</b> <b>insulating</b> foam technology, hybrid-electric Manned Ground Vehicles (MGV), and highly efficient portable cells. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act gave more than $150 million {{to develop these}} technologies. Stateside, the Army created the Net Zero program with a goal to have 30 installations achieve net-zero energy by 2030, including some that will also be net-zero in waste and water. In 2011, they opened the Base Camp Systems Integration Laboratory, which compares an energy efficient base camp with a traditional one and trains soldiers to use energy efficient technologies. The Army Energy Security Implementation Strategy, published in 2009, gives details about the Army’s energy goals.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{forest fires}} {{occurred}} {{during the summer of}} 2004 in the Klondike Goldfields region of the Yukon Territory, an area of extensive discontinuous permafrost. More than 35 shallow detachment failure landslides developed in subsequent weeks in Steele Creek, a small drainage basin located about 60 km south of Dawson City. Preliminary observations of the failures and near-surface thermal regime were made through freeze-up of 2004 and continued in the summers of 2005 and 2006. Detachment failures were mapped and individual sites were surveyed. Air and ground temperatures were measured in burned and unburned areas. In addition, two-dimensional DC resistivity transects were used to examine subsurface conditions in the area. Forest fire contributed to detachment failure activity on permafrost slopes by destroying the surface organic mat, causing burned surface temperatures to rise, thawing active layers by up to 20 cm (+ 31 %) deeper than unburned slopes and weakening the surface root structures. Deeper thaw melted transient layer ground ice, raising soil porewater pressures. The thermal differences between burned and unburned sites were greater at the north-facing than south-facing sites, and active layer freezing and thawing processes varied according to both aspect and burned status. More southerly-facing and/or burned sites generally thawed earlier, refroze later and had warmer temperatures than more northerly and/or unburned sites. Thaw of burned areas with high ground surface temperatures can be expected to continue, depending on climatic conditions, until sufficient revegetation occurs to shade the surface and rebuild the <b>insulating</b> organic <b>mat.</b> The detachment failures occurred from a few weeks to two years after forest fire, and only on slopes where permafrost was extensive. They were not similar to others in the literature in that almost all occurred in coarse-gained soils and had failure planes elevated above the permafrost table. These landslides were flow-type failures that rafted portions of the organic mat on top of deforming, non-cohesive sediment. They occurred in areas of deeper thaw but their distribution and the resistivity data suggest that they were associated with supra-permafrost taliks which concentrated groundwater flow. In an unglaciated area like the Klondike region this landsliding process has likely occurred thousands of times during the Pleistocene and may be responsible for elements of the form of the region's slopes. Predicted increases in the frequency and magnitude of forest fire in the boreal forest due to warming climates may increase incidence of these types of failures...|$|R
