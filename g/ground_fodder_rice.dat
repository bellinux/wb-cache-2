40|$|Abstract Evapotranspiration (ET) from {{irrigated}} land {{is one of}} the most useful indicators to explain whether the water is used as “intended”. In this study, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used to compute actual ET from a Landsat 7 image of December 29, 2000 for diverse land use in the Krishna Basin in India. SEBAL ETa varies between 0 to 4. 7 mm per day over the image and was quantified for identified land use classes. Seasonal/annual comparison of ETa from different land uses requires time series images, processed by SEBAL. In this study, the Landsat-derived snapshot SEBAL ETa result was interpreted using the cropping calendar and time series analysis of MODIS imagery. The wastewater irrigated area in the basin has the highest ETa in the image, partly due to its advanced growth stage compared to groundwater-irrigated rice. Shrub and forests in the senescence phase have similar ETa to vegetable/cash crops, and ETa from grasslands is a low 0. 8 mm per day after the end of the monsoon.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Production of the fodder legume, Lathyrus sativus, was {{studied in}} the rice fields of farmers to {{mitigate}} a shortage of fodder supply to dairy cattle and to improve soil fertility. Eight farmers broadcast seed of the fodder legume as a relay crop in standing Aman <b>rice.</b> <b>Fodder</b> yield was recorded and soil fertility was assessed. Fodder was harvested after 2 months and fed to milking cows by mixing with straw. Average green yield of fodder was 11. 02 t/ha and soil OM and nitrogen were increased {{as a result of}} legume growth. Milk yield was increased by 20 % and 14 % in on-farm and research station studies respectively, and milk composition slightly increased due to the supplementation of straw with fodder.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{relationships}} between inhabitants’ livelihoods and forest resources management at watershed level in the semiarid forests (woodlands) of Persian oak (Quercus persica) in southwest Iran. The ultimate objective of the studies is to lay a basis for planning woodland resource management, to suggest on strategies for improvements in implementation of management plans for sustainable use and conservation of these resources, and improvement of natural resources-based livelihoods of the communities. Paper I investigates {{the relationships between the}} traditional utilization, socioeconomic development during recent decades and land cover changes in the study area. Paper II aims to investigate dependency of inhabitant’s livelihoods on the woodland resources by characterizing their forest-based activities. The impacts of these activities on the attributes of the woodland as well as the participation of inhabitants in these activities are studied in Paper III. In Paper IV, a diameter class model is developed in order to predict the effects of different management practices on growth and yield of stands of Persian oak. Data on land cover change (Paper I) were collected through stereo interpretation with digital photogrammetric techniques applied to sets of scanned aerial photographs. Field data for all studies were gathered in 2003 from a woodland inventory. Socioeconomic data were gathered through interviews in 2006 (Paper I) and in 2008 (Papers II and III). Some data for model parameters in Paper IV were extracted from information of an adjacent forested area. In Paper II, canonical correlation analysis and pairwise correlation analysis were used to explore any significant relationships between the socioeconomic variables and the variables of the forest-based activities of the households. In Paper IV, linear programming was used to solve the planning problems. Results show stability in crown cover density and in the number of large trees and an increment of the woodland area. This could be related to a change in the traditional pattern of the woodland utilization in the past decades. There is a high dependency of inhabitants’ livelihoods on the woodland resources. The woodland-based incomes in Ganaveh are obtained by performing animal grazing, and collection of fuel wood, seeds, and <b>ground</b> <b>fodder.</b> The more income diversification and the better educational conditions for households, the less dependency on these resources. Lack of natural regeneration, relatively high incident of bad quality trees cause concerns for sustainability and conservation of the woodland {{as a result of the}} performed activities. Some efforts to reach social acceptance from the woodland users to protect the preserved areas from animal grazing and seed gathering for a period could be a good alternative for woodland rehabilitation. Fuel wood collection should not put the sustainability of the woodland in jeopardy. Although the accuracy of some parameters of the suggested diameter class model should be improved, the preliminary results show that the present prohibition of harvests seems contra productive. Rather, a regulated harvest of trees could enhance the livelihood of the Ganaveh households...|$|R

Small and medium livestock farmers have between 10 and 30 cows or beef cattle. A major constraint {{to the expansion of}} dairy holdings and beef production in Bangladesh is the scarcity of quality fodder, especially during the dry winter season (Haque et al., 2008). Straw from paddy rice is the main source of fodder for livestock in Bangladesh, but has being abundant and low quality (Haque et al., 2008).

For sugarcane tops/urea fed alone, milk production was most limited by amino acid followed by long chain fatty acid availability. Among the protein-rich oil cake supplements at 100, 200 and 300 g supplement/kg total DM, cottonseed oil cake proved superior with a milk yield of 5 · 5, 7 · 3 and 8 · 3 kg/day, respectively. This was followed by mustard oil cake with 5 · 1, 6 · 5 and 7 · 6 kg/day, respectively. In {{the case of a}} protein-rich supplement (fish meal), milk yield was limited to 6 · 6 kg/day due to a shortage of long chain fatty acids.

Taking into consideration the almost identical environmental conditions and thepopulation density the rearing of the fish depends on additional food given and its quality. Following theperformed investigation we can appreciate that, the feeding with non-conventional fodders in intensiveand semi-intensive rearing systems, in ponds, can provide the energy and complete range of essentialnutrients for the combined culture of common carps and P. spathula. Using good quality stockingbiological material (obtained in summer I), a “cheap formula” for feeding, a good quality and volume ofwater, it is possible to get fish that can be delivered on the market at the required dimensions next year. Taking into account the obtained production using conventional and non-conventional fodders and havingin view their price, we can conclude that fodders from the aquaculture market can be successfullyreplaced with non-conventional ones, which have a more affordable price, resulting in a lower cost perkilogram of fish in the case of mixed culture C. carpio and P. spathula...|$|R

40|$|Maize-based crop {{rotations}} are advocated as alternate to rice-based systems in South Asia due to better suitability for diverse ecologies, higher yields with less water use and more palatable maize <b>fodder</b> compared to <b>rice,</b> and increased demand of maize from piggery and poultry industries. Alternate tillage and crop establishment practices are important management strategies for tackling {{the issues of}} soil health deterioration and over exploitation of underground water resources, particularly in rice based intensive {{crop rotations}}. The conservation agriculture (CA) based tillage and crop establishment practices such as zero tillage (ZT) and permanent raised beds (PB) hold potential to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC), physical and biological properties for sustainability of soil health. Therefore, a long term {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the twelve combinations of tillage practices (03) and irrigated intensive maize based crop rotations (04) on organic carbon, physical properties and microbial biomass and enzymatic activities of a sandy loam (Typic Haplustept) soil in north-western India. The tillage practices consisted of ZT, PB and conventional tillage (CT) in main plots and four diversified intensive maize based crop rotations (MWMb: Maize-Wheat-Mungbean, MCS: Maize-Chickpea-Sesbaina, MMuMb: Maize-Mustard-Mungbean, MMS: Maize-Maize-Sesbania) in sub plots. In this study we analysed the SOC, physical and biological properties of soil at various depths after 7 years of continuous ZT, PB and CT in diversified maize rotations. Compared to CT plots, the soil physical properties like water stable aggregates (WSA) > 250 μm were 16. 1 - 32. 5 % higher, and bulk density (BD) and penetration resistance (PR) showed significant (P < 0. 05) decline (11. 0 – 14. 3 and 11. 2 – 12. 0 %) in ZT and PB plots at 0 – 15 and 15 – 30 cm soil layers. The soil organic carbon (SOC) increased by 34. 6 - 35. 3 % at 0 – 15 cm, and 23. 6 - 26. 5 % at 15 – 30 cm soil depths with conservation agriculture (ZT and PB) based crop establishment techniques over CT. Similarly, the soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under CA based systems increased by 45 – 48. 9 % in 0 – 30 cm profile depth of a sandy loam (Typic Haplustept) soil. Significant (P < 0. 05) improvement in soil enzymatic activities i. e., Fluorescein diacetate, dehydrogenase, β Glucosidase and Alkaline phosphatase was also recorded in the CA based treatments. Significant (P < 0. 05) synergistic effects of summer legumes (mungbean and Sesbania) with winter legume/cereal in crop rotations were observed on SOC,WSA, BD, PR and Ksat at 0 – 15 and 15 – 30 cm depths. Interaction between tillage and crop rotations were significant (P < 0. 05) for soil organic carbon, physical properties and enzymatic activities. Thus our long-term study suggests that CA based crop management with selected diversified maize based rotations (MCS and MWMb) can be advocated as sustainable intensification strategy in light textured soils of north-western India and other similar agro-ecologies of South Asia...|$|R
