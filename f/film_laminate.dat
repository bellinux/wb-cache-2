40|$|Live {{bacterial}} cells (LBC) {{are administered}} orally as attenuated vaccines, to deliver biopharmaceutical agents, and as probiotics to improve gastrointestinal health. However, LBC present unique formulation challenges and must survive gastrointestinal antimicrobial defenses including gastric acid after administration. We present a simple new formulation concept, termed Polymer <b>Film</b> <b>Laminate</b> (PFL). LBC are ambient dried onto cast acid-resistant enteric polymer films that are then laminated together {{to produce a}} solid oral dosage form. LBC of a model live bacterial vaccine and a probiotic were dried directly onto a cast film of enteric polymer. The effectiveness at protecting dried cells in a simulated gastric fluid (pH 2. 0) depended on the composition of enteric polymer film used, with a blend of ethylcellulose plus Eudragit L 100 55 providing greater protection from acid than Eudragit alone. However, although PFL made from blended polymers films completely released low molecular weight dye into intestinal conditions (pH 7. 0), they failed to release LBC.

40|$|Plasma {{treatment}} and vacuum Al deposition on films from biaxially oriented polypropylene is a multistep large scale industrial process, mainly {{ending up in}} packaging film laminates. As atmospheric plasma treatment processes suffer from lack of reproducibility, low pressure plasma treatment processes that can be operated in-line with the metal deposition are being developed. Process development is difficult, because the final packaging <b>film</b> <b>laminate</b> has to deliver optimum properties of adhesion {{as well as of}} the barrier against oxygen and water vapor permeation. As a typical production run involves tens of thousands to up to one hundred thousand square meters of film, experiments on an industrial scale are expensive, so smaller scale experimental processes are needed, which so far do not match well enough with industrial process characteristics. Moreover, bonding mechanisms between the treated substrate film and the deposited Al layer are not sufficiently understood. This paper describes the sequence in development and optimization of substrate films and plasma treatment that has been performed on an experimental as well as on an industrial scale. A sufficient correlation between experimental and industrial scales was achieved, which helps to perform development and optimization on a small scale before scaling up to industrial processes. However, improvement is still needed both in fundamental understanding of the aluminum-polypropylene interface as well as in experimental equipment and methodology...|$|E

Oral administration of live attenuated bacterial vaccines (LBV) can safely and effectively promote mucosal immunity but new formulations are required that provide controlled release of optimal numbers of viable bacterial cells, which must survive gastrointestinal transit overcoming various antimicrobial barriers. Here, {{we use a}} gastro-small intestine gut model of human GI conditions to study the survival and release kinetics of two oral LBV formulations: the licensed typhoid fever vaccine Vivotif comprising enteric coated capsules; and an experimental formulation of the model vaccine Salmonella Typhimurium SL 3261 dried directly onto cast enteric polymer films and laminated to form a polymer <b>film</b> <b>laminate</b> (PFL). Neither formulation released significant numbers of viable cells when tested in the complete gastro-small intestine model. The poor performance in delivering viable cells {{could be attributed to}} a combination of acid and bile toxicity plus incomplete release of cells for Vivotif capsules, and to bile toxicity alone for PFL. To achieve effective protection from intestinal bile in addition to effective acid resistance, bile adsorbent resins were incorporated into the PFL to produce a new formulation, termed BR-PFL. Efficient and complete release of 4. 4 x 107 live cells per dose was achieved from BR-PFL at distal intestinal pH, with release kinetics controlled by the composition of the enteric polymer film, and no loss in viability observed in any stage of the GI model. Use of this in vitro GI model thereby allowed rational design of an oral LBV formulation to maximize viable cell release...|$|E

40|$|A pulsed {{excimer laser}} (248 nm) based LIGA-like process is {{presented}} for the fabrication of Ni serpentine microstructures, {{such as those}} that might be used for micro-heaters. The structures were made on both Cu (60 µm) clad PCB and on Cu/Ti (up to 4 µm/ 15 nm) sputtered Si (100) substrates. The substrates were laminated with Laminar AX dry film (35 µm) photopolymer, which was then patterned by laser ablation to produce the mould for Ni electroforming. The optimal ablation conditions were identified for laser patterning to prepare the micro polymer mould. Beam fluence (~ 1 J/cm 2) and number of shots (~ 60 pulses) for 50 µm wide features on this photoresist were established, and it was observed that an increased number of shots and increased fluence was needed for features less than 20 µm. Additionally, the Cu layer surface was cleaned by the use of 5 - 10 laser pulses at the same fluence. Ni electroforming has been carried out using standard Ni sulfamate bath at a current density of ~ 10 mA/cm 2. After Ni electroforming, both the Laminar AX dry film and the Cu layers around the electroformed Ni patterns were removed using a combination of acetone, laser and Cu selective etching.

Phase I Objective: Demonstrate thin film encapsulated working phosphorescent OLED devices on optical glass with lifetime of 1, 000 hour life, CRI greater than 75, and 15 lm/W. Phase II Objective: Demonstrate thin film encapsulated working phosphorescent OLED devices on plastic or glass composite with 25 lm/W, 5, 000 hours life, and CRI greater than 80. Phase III Objective: Demonstrate 2 x 2 ft{sup 2 } thin film encapsulated working phosphorescent OLED with 40 lm/W, 10, 000 hour life, and CRI greater than 85. This report details the efforts of Phase III (Budget Period Three), a fourteen month collaborative effort that focused on optimization of high-efficiency phosphorescent OLED devices and thin-film encapsulation of said devices. The report further details the conclusions and recommendations of the project team that have foundation in all three budget periods for the program. During {{the conduct of the}} Thin Film Packaging Solutions for High Efficiency OLED Lighting Products program, including budget period three, the project team completed and delivered the following achievements: (1) a three-year marketing effort that characterized the near-term and longer-term OLED market, identified customer and consumer lighting needs, and suggested prototype product concepts and niche OLED applications lighting that will give rise to broader market acceptance as a source for wide area illumination and energy conservation; (2) a thin film encapsulation technology with a lifetime of nearly 15, 000 hours, tested by calcium coupons, while stored at 16 C and 40 % relative humidity ('RH'). This encapsulation technology was characterized as having less than 10 % change in transmission during the 15, 000 hour test period; (3) demonstrated thin film encapsulation of a phosphorescent OLED device with 1, 500 hours of lifetime at 60 C and 80 % RH; (4) demonstrated that a thin <b>film</b> <b>laminate</b> encapsulation, in addition to the direct thin film deposition process, of a polymer OLED device was another feasible packaging strategy for OLED lighting. The thin <b>film</b> <b>laminate</b> strategy was developed to mitigate defects, demonstrate roll-to-roll process capability for high volume throughput (reduce costs) and to support a potential commercial pathway that is less dependent upon integrated manufacturing since the laminate could be sold as a rolled good; (5) demonstrated that low cost 'blue' glass substrates could be coated with a siloxane barrier layer for planarization and ion-protection and used in the fabrication of a polymer OLED lighting device. This study further demonstrated that the substrate cost has potential for huge cost reductions from the white borosilicate glass substrate currently used by the OLED lighting industry; (6) delivered four-square feet of white phosphorescent OLED technology, including novel high efficiency devices with 82 CRI, greater than 50 lm/W efficiency, and more than 1, 000 hours lifetime in a product concept model shelf; (7) presented and or published more than twenty internal studies (for private use), three external presentations (OLED workshop-for public use), and five technology-related external presentations (industry conferences-for public use); and (8) issued five patent applications, which are in various maturity stages at time of publication. Delivery of thin film encapsulated white phosphorescent OLED lighting technology remains a challenging technical achievement, and it seems that commercial availability of thin, bright, white OLED light that meets market requirements will continue to require research and development effort. However, there will be glass encapsulated white OLED lighting products commercialized in niche markets during the 2008 calendar year.
