500|$|First {{published}} in January 2008, the monthly Torchwood Magazine began occasionally including Torchwood comic strips, in which Jack also appears. One such comic, written in 2009 by John Barrowman and sister Carole E. Barrowman, [...] "Captain Jack and the Selkie", expands on Captain Jack's characterisation. Barrowman comments that [...] "We’d already agreed {{to tell a}} story that showed a side of Jack and a part of his history that hadn’t been explored too much in other media. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> fans something original about Jack." [...] Torchwood Magazine also ran with the ten-part Rift War! storyline from April to December 2008. The first Torchwood comic [...] "Jetsam" [...] was later collected along with Rift War! in a graphic novel.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Coulter met Jamie Babbington, {{a builder}} from Gold Coast who was aged 23 at the time. They started [...] "dating seriously" [...] after about a year. Coulter and Babbington married at a secret {{location}} in Canungra, Queensland on 7 September 2007. Coulter took her husband's last name and became Ricki-Lee Babbington. The couple had their honeymoon in the Maldives for five weeks. The following year, on 18 October 2008, Coulter's publicist issued a statement that they had separated due to [...] "distance and time apart". In an interview with Herald Suns Jonathan Moran, {{three years after the}} marriage ended, Coulter revealed that she had experienced depression during her relationship with Babbington. [...] "I was living my dream but behind closed doors my personal life was a mess. [...] I felt alone, I bottled it all up and it made things worse. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up everything. I wouldn't leave the house for days at a time. I'd sit in the house all day and do nothing".|$|E

500|$|Jepsen's second studio {{album was}} {{initially}} {{planned to be}} released on February 14, 2012; however, she chose not to release it {{because she wanted to}} make sure she [...] "got the second CD right. I think I got a little nervous about the idea of the sophomore being a little less-than because it's so rushed. So <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> myself the time to not feel that pressure." [...] She then worked with songwriter Josh Ramsay and producer Ryan Stewart on most of the album's tracks. Jepsen's songwriting process was inspired by her life and friends. After the recording sessions were completed, Curiosity was announced as a full-length album, with a digital release date confirmed for February 14, 2012. A few days before its official release, however, the label decided to change the format of the album, turning it into an extended play. The songs cut from the album [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Alice In Wonderland", [...] "Dear Julian", [...] "Europe" [...] and [...] "Angels" [...] came to have their preview on iTunes Canada, before having changed album to EP.|$|E
500|$|Barrowman's first {{published}} work of original fiction was a Torchwood comic strip, titled Captain Jack and the Selkie, co-written with sister Carole. Commenting on the characterisation of Jack Harkness in {{the comic strip}} Barrowman states: [...] "We’d already agreed {{to tell a story}} that showed a side of Jack and a part of his history that hadn’t been explored too much in other media. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> fans something original about Jack." [...] Barrowman's début fantasy novel titled Hollow Earth, co-written with his sister Carole, was published in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2012 by Buster Books. The novel is about twins Matt and Emily ("Em") Calder who share an ability that allows them to make artwork come to life, due to their powerful imaginations. Their ability is sought after by antagonists who wish to use it to breach Hollow Earth—a realm in which all demons and monsters are trapped. Two sequels from the same team concerning Hollow Earth followed - The Bone Quill (2013) and The Book of Beasts (2014) - and Conjuror (2016), the first in a new series (the [...] "Orion Chronicles") featuring the same twins, as well as a separate novel Torchwood: Exodus Code (2013).|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E

500|$|The opening track, [...] "Sure Hope You Mean It", {{features}} slightly off-beat percussion, tambourine shakes, {{and lyrics}} {{about a man}} who awaits a sign of approval from the woman he admires. [...] "Keep Marchin", which evoked socially conscious and positive sentiments, was composed in the vein of the Civil Rights Movement era soul music by artists such as Sam Cooke and the Staple Singers. Gail Mitchell from Billboard compared the song to Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions' 1968 song [...] "We're a Winner". Saadiq said [...] "Keep Marchin" [...] was also inspired by his journey in the music industry. [...] "Big Easy", featuring New Orleans-style brass playing, was sung {{from the point of view}} of a man in New Orleans who reacts to Hurricane Katrina and looks for his lost lover. J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer remarked that the song [...] "manages to cast Hurricane Katrina as the villain in a romance, tearing lovers apart." [...] Its composition—mixing a blissful sound with disheartening lyrics—is similar to the songwriting technique used by Holland–Dozier–Holland. Saadiq was inspired to write [...] "Big Easy" [...] after watching the 2006 documentary film When the Levees Broke. He explained its upbeat composition in an interview for All Things Considered: [...] "In New Orleans, when they mourn, they really celebrate and have a great time. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it that same spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, Beyoncé {{embarked}} {{her fourth}} concert tour, The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. In June 2013, {{it was announced}} that a limited edition of Heat, titled Heat: The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, would be released the same month, inspired by the tour. Speaking about the fragrance, Beyoncé said: [...] "I love my music, I love performing and most of all I love and appreciate my fans. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them a special remembrance of this tour and I created this scent to reflect the power, passion and playfulness I put into my performances." [...] The fragrance opens with mangosteen, black pepper and Açaí palm as its top notes and later continues with violet petals, Indian Sambac Jasmine and a Brassia Edua Loo orchid as its middle notes before finishing with bourbon vanilla, Australian sandalwood and vetiver as its base notes. Gaby Wilson of MTV noted that the ingredients introduced a lighter scent than her previous releases. According to Beyoncé's official perfume website, the fragrance is [...] "paying tribute to Beyoncé's amazing momentous journey" [...] and further [...] "transport you into Beyoncé's world and the intensity of her shows. [...] will make you feel the power, passion and playfulness she gives to her fans." [...] It was also meant to celebrate Beyoncé's accomplishments and her [...] "historic life journey". Gregory DelliCarpini Jr. of Billboard magazine described the scent of the fragrance as [...] "strong and feminine". Holly Carter of People magazine noted that the scent was [...] "the best-smelling alternative" [...] for people who missed The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour.|$|E

My promoter always says that I make the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public.

2500|$|Mel {{has been}} dubbed as a chameleon, and Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that she liked to bring variation to Mel's characterisation: [...] "When I arrived I liked the idea Mel was feisty and strong. I didn't want her turning into a wimpy character like so many women in soaps. You know, they're either bitches or they're slags or they're victims. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Mel a bit of everything. Every woman has all those elements to their character. It's just working out where they come and go, and I don't think that's lack of continuity; I think that's a three-dimensional character." ...|$|E

It was later revealed in an interview with Vibe, however, that Shaolin Vs.

In regards to the album's direction, Raekwon stated [...] "RZA doesn’t have to be on every album. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> some other producers a chance. It’s not about beef.

2500|$|The idea of {{the cover}} was Siouxsie's. Photographer Paul Wakefield met her and the band to discuss the project: [...] "The idea was to shoot disquieting and unnerving images {{underwater}} {{in a swimming pool}} – you can’t scream underwater. I {{wanted to be able to}} completely control the lighting, and so an indoor pool was the only option. I scouted quite a few pools, but when I saw this pool in the YMCA in Central London, which was dark blue tiled with light blue lane stripes instead of the normal reverse colors, I knew it was the ideal location. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it an eerie underwater night-time feel, and this setting was perfect. We used a number of 1000K and 2000K lights around the pool edge. I used school kids as models and they pretty well ran riot." ...|$|E
2500|$|A further {{strategy}} {{aimed at}} diminishing the power dynamic between photographer/subject {{was to have}} each participant choose their own image, with the option of re-photographing them if they desired.

A camera is a tremendously powerful tool and the power dynamic between photographer and subject is palpable. For this reason, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> some of the power back to the subjects. It {{was never going to}} be completely democratic – it is, after all, my concept, my project, and my design – but there are some strategies you can employ to make it less unilateral. Everyone got to see their image and choose to keep it or erase it and shoot again." [...] One participant was re-photographed 27 times.|$|E

2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't {{very smart}} about things. At that stage I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, {{most of the other}} guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I thought {{it was up to me}} to compete with the Packer boys.

It nearly never got recorded - when the time came to record it, the keyboard player I wanted to use, Peter Jones, was out of town, so we cut the band track with a different keyboard player. It didn't work. A few days later when we tried it again with a different keyboard player, again it didn't work, and the band was losing interest in the song. Just before the album was finished, Peter Jones came back into town, the band and I had an argument because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Reminiscing a third chance. Peter played on it, we cut it, and finished it, and sent the album to Capitol. Capitol said that they couldn't hear any singles on the album, and didn't know what to release. Five weeks later, someone at Capitol's New York office said 'You're all crazy, Reminiscing is a smash.' Capitol put it out, and it just immediately caught on fire, and became our highest chart hit." ...|$|E
