5000|$|In {{developing}} Indonesia's aviation industry, {{he adopted}} an approach called [...] "Begin at the <b>End</b> <b>and</b> <b>End</b> at the Beginning". In this method, {{elements such as}} basic research became the last things upon which to focus, whilst actual manufacturing of the planes was placed as the first objective. Under Habibie's leadership, IPTN became a manufacturer of aircraft including Puma helicopters and CASA planes. It pioneered a small passenger airplane, the N-250 Gatokaca, in 1995, but the project was a commercial failure.|$|E
5000|$|In Greece {{the dance}} is called [...] "Osmantakas" [...] or [...] "Samantakas" [...] {{and it is}} danced in Epirus. It is one of nine basic dancing genres (the other being Tsamikos, Syrtos in 3 steps, Syrtos in 2 steps, Pogonisios, Zagorisios, Kleftes, Fezodervenagas, Berati) of Epirus. The Osmantakas dancing genre has its {{distinct}} dacing style, it's exclusively danced in the correspondent song and it's {{not to be confused}} with any other dancing genre in Epirus. Apart from the traditional 8-measure motif, today it is also performed in a 4-measure motif, very similar to the Pogonios. In the typical fashion in the music of Epirus the specific song may sometimes be interrupted at the <b>end</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> up in Syrtos or Tsamikos rhythm. A general classification of the dancing genres in Zagori region of Epirus can classify Osmanatakas, as well as the Berati, Kleftes, Perdikomata, as variations of Tsamiko. This dance is supposed to have been the dance of the Souliotes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Currently {{the most}} popular method to evolve black-hole {{binaries}} is the “moving puncture ” method. It has recently been shown that when puncture initial data for a Schwarzschild black hole are evolved using this method, the numerical slices quickly lose contact with the second asymptotically flat <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> instead on a cylinder of finite Schwarzschild coordinate radius. These slices are stationary, meaning that their geometry does not evolve further. We will describe these results {{in the context of}} maximal slices, and present timeindependent puncture-like data for the Schwarzschild spacetime. 1...|$|E
40|$|Guillain±BarreÂ {{syndrome}} (GBS) {{is traditionally}} con-sidered to be a large-®bre neuropathy. However, {{the presence of}} hypo-aesthesia, dysaesthesia and dysauto-nomia in GBS patients {{raises the possibility that}} small-diameter sensory and autonomic nerves may also be affected. To investigate small-®bre neuropathy in GBS, we performed a skin biopsy from the distal leg of 20 patients with the demyelinating form of GBS. Skin sections were immunohistochemically stained with anti-serum against protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5), a ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase. Cutaneous innervation was evaluated by measuring epidermal nerve density (<b>END),</b> <b>and</b> <b>END</b> was further correlated with various clinical and electrophysiological parameters. In GBS patients, END values were much lower than in age- an...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{trials in}} chronic pain often collect {{information}} about interference with work as answers to component questions of commonly used questionnaires but {{these data are}} not normally analysed separately. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from four large trials of pregabalin for fibromyalgia lasting 8 - 14 weeks. We analysed data on interference with work, inferred from answers to component questions of Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Short Form 36 Health Survey, Sheehan Disability Scale, and Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue, including "How many days {{in the past week}} did you miss work, including housework, because of fibromyalgia?" from FIQ. Analyses were performed according to randomised treatment group (pregabalin 150 - 600 mg daily or placebo), pain improvement (0 - 10 numerical pain rating scale scores at trial beginning vs. <b>end),</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of trial pain state (100 mm visual analogue pain scale [VAS]). RESULTS: Comparing treatment group average outcomes revealed modest improvement over the duration of the trials, more so with active treatment than with placebo. For the 'work missed' question from FIQ the change for patients on placebo was from 2. 2 (standard deviation [SD] 2. 3) days of work lost per week at trial beginning to 1. 9 (SD 2. 1) days lost at trial end (p /= 50 % pain improvement and from 1. 9 (SD 2. 2) days to 0. 73 (SD 1. 4) days (p /= 50 % pain improvement and a pain score 1 day per week can be achieved in patients with good pain responses...|$|E
