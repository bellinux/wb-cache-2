5|$|In the 1930s, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> Parts II and IV, Joyce's {{progress}} slowed considerably. This {{was due to}} {{a number}} of factors including {{the death of his father}} John Stanislaus Joyce in 1931; concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia; and his own health problems, chiefly his failing eyesight.|$|E

5|$|Farhan Akhtar {{conceived}} {{the idea to}} remake the iconic 1978 film {{of the same name}} after listening to a remixed version of a song from the original film. In early 2005, media started reporting that Akhtar was planning to remake the film, but rather than confirming the news, he revealed that though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> the screenplay based on the film, he would take the final decision after completing the script. The director co-wrote the film with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original film with Salim Khan.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Abu-Jamal was punished with solitary {{confinement}} {{for engaging in}} entrepreneurship contrary to prison regulations. Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 HBO documentary , which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons. In litigation before the US Court of Appeals, in 1998 he successfully established his right to write for financial gain in prison. The same litigation also established that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections had illegally opened his mail {{in an attempt to}} establish whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> for financial gain.|$|E
5|$|Sony Pictures {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Isaacson's book in October 2011, hiring Aaron Sorkin to adapt it. In November 2011, George Clooney and Noah Wyle (who previously portrayed Jobs in the 1999 TV film Pirates of Silicon Valley) were rumored {{to be considered for}} the title role. In May 2012, Sorkin officially confirmed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> the script, and had enlisted the help of Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, for historical accuracy.

5|$|The Sword of Shannara is a 1977 epic fantasy {{novel by}} American writer Terry Brooks. It {{is the first}} book of the Original Shannara Trilogy, {{followed}} by The Elfstones of Shannara and The Wishsong of Shannara. Brooks was heavily influenced by J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and began writing The Sword of Shannara in 1967. It took him seven years to complete, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> the novel while attending law school. Ballantine Books used it to launch the company's new subsidiary Del Rey Books. Its success boosted the commercial expansion of the fantasy genre.|$|E
5|$|Wanting to make {{an unusual}} romance film, Anand {{struggled}} to find unconventional ideas while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing.</b> Then his wife Mamta {{came up with the}} core narrative of the film, which excited him and changed his perspective. Anand approached novelist Advaita Kala who developed the story into a feature-length script, and later co-wrote the screenplay with him. Principal photography was done entirely in New York City, Las Vegas and San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|While Joseph Priestley {{was writing}} {{about the history of}} electricity, Franklin {{encouraged}} him to use an electrostatic machine to perform the experiments <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> about. Priestly designed and used his own variations of Franklin's machine. While replicating the electrical experiments, some unanswered questions prompted Priestly to design additional experiments, leading to additional discoveries. In 1767 he published a 700-page book on his findings called The History and Present State of Electricity.|$|E

5|$|William {{had access}} to the chronicles of the First Crusade, {{including}} Fulcher of Chartres, Albert of Aix, Raymond of Aguilers, Baldric of Dol, and the Gesta Francorum, as well as other documents located in the kingdom's archives. He used Walter the Chancellor and other now-lost works for the history of the Principality of Antioch. From the end of Fulcher's chronicle in 1127, William is the only source of information from an author living in Jerusalem. For events that happened in William's own lifetime, he interviewed older people who had witnessed the events about which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing,</b> and drew on his own memory.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> at the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.|$|E
5|$|Bede's primary {{intention}} {{in writing}} the Historia Ecclesiastica was to show {{the growth of the}} united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; {{by the end of the}} Historia the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons. This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the Historia is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the Synod of Whitby in 664. Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing.</b> He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote.|$|E

5|$|Kesselring {{resumed his}} work on {{a history of the}} war that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> for the US Army's Historical Division. This effort, working under the {{direction}} of Generaloberst Franz Halder in 1946, brought together a number of German generals for the purpose of producing historical studies of the war, including Gotthard Heinrici, Heinz Guderian, Lothar Rendulic, Hasso von Manteuffel and Georg von Küchler. Kesselring contributed studies of the war in Italy and North Africa and the problems faced by the German high command. Kesselring also worked secretly on his memoirs. The manuscript was smuggled out by Irmgard Horn-Kesselring, Rainer's mother, who typed it at her home.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{returned}} to the East Coast in late September 1931. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> Arctic Village, he also wrote prolifically on other topics and published several articles about American forestry. In particular, he was concerned that few articles of this time {{addressed the issue of}} deforestation, and he {{wrote a letter to the}} president of the American Forestry Association, George D. Pratt, on the matter. He also pursued a variety of other activities: he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial (Louis Marshall Memorial Hall) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse. He lectured in various cities, delivering speeches about his travels and wilderness preservation.|$|E
5|$|Puzzled by the {{geographical}} distribution of wildlife and fossils he {{collected on the}} voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published {{in a series of}} books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.|$|E
