5|$|All {{candidate}} theories {{still have}} major formal and conceptual problems to overcome. They also face the common problem that, as yet, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus {{to decide between}} the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{explains}} that he knew Homer would probably change his mind, and decided to send the letter before that could happen. Homer desperately tries to prevent the letter from reaching Mr. Burns, but fails. Mr. Burns becomes furious and demands that Homer be beaten. However, Smithers calls off the beating {{on the grounds that}} <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> thank the man who saved Mr. Burns' life, and instead convinces Mr. Burns to instead reward the Simpson family. The Simpsons receive an antique Xtapolapocetl, an Olmec head (a massive, Tiki-god-like affair) that Bart, the blood donor, likes, and which Homer hates.|$|E
5|$|The {{new sound}} chip and MIDI out {{abilities}} {{were exposed to}} the BASIC programming language with the command PLAY and a new command SPECTRUM was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80KB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs.|$|E

5|$|The remake takes {{advantage}} of the Wi-Fi feature of the Nintendo DS {{in the form of a}} Mail/Mognet system similar to Final Fantasy IX. Various moogles in the game allow the player to send email to others. Players are also able to send mail to various characters in the game as well as to other players. Side quests can also be unlocked using this system, such as the quest to unlock the Onion Knight. An interruption-save option is also available that lets the player turn off the DS and continue when turning it back on. Like in the original, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make permanent saves while inside a dungeon.|$|E
5|$|The sound {{values of}} {{modified}} Latin letters {{can often be}} derived {{from those of the}} original letters. For example, letters with a rightward-facing hook at the bottom represent retroflex consonants; and small capital letters usually represent uvular consonants. Apart from the fact that certain kinds of modification to the shape of a letter generally correspond to certain kinds of modification to the sound represented, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> deduce the sound represented by a symbol from its shape (as for example in Visible Speech) nor even any systematic relation between signs and the sounds they represent (as in Hangul).|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{slated for}} the {{interchange}} with County Routes 516 and 527 in Old Bridge as there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> access {{either of them}} without driving through a residential area off Route 18. The traffic flow along CR 516 (Old Bridge into Matawan) and 527 (Old Bridge into Englishtown/Manalapan) has increased significantly {{in the past ten}} years which called for the exit ramp off Route 18. The Old Bridge improvements include adding inside shoulders and widening County Routes 516 and 527. A signalized ramp is to be added for access to County Routes 516 and 527. Subsequently, County Route 516's intersection with Old Matawan Road is to be relocated. The project would cost over $28 million and was slated to begin in 2009 and to end in 2010. As of the end of 2009 the large project was put on hold {{because of the lack of}} funds and the economic situation. Demolition was completed in 2009 on Marlboro Road, taking down several residential houses and along Old Matawan Road and CR 516 and taking down an old gas station in preparing for the project. There is no new date released by NJDOT in when construction will begin.|$|E
25|$|For general problem classes {{there may}} <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> show that meta GP will {{reliably}} produce results {{more efficiently than}} a created algorithm other than exhaustion.|$|R
60|$|On {{either side}} of the mansion were others, so there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get to the rear, {{excepting}} through the door below, and this was tightly barred.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get the {{creature}} out {{without breaking the}} vase, so the Tin Woodman smashed it with his axe and set the little prisoner free.|$|R
5|$|For further {{elements}} up to 124, {{given that}} increasing the neutron number allows for {{getting closer to}} the predicted closed neutron shell at N = 184 that would confer stability, the use of weakly radioactive iron-60 instead of stable iron-58 as a projectile has been considered. 60Fe has a half-life of 2.6 million years. The isotopes 299Ubu, 300Ubu, and 301Ubu that could be produced in these reactions via the 3n and 4n channels {{are expected to be}} the only reachable unbiunium isotopes with half-lives long enough for detection; the cross-sections would nevertheless push the limits of what can currently be detected. They would decay through isotopes of ununennium that could be produced by cross-bombardments in the 248Cm+51V or 249Bk+50Ti reactions, which will be tried at RIKEN and JINR respectively in 2019–2020, down through known isotopes of tennessine and moscovium synthesised in the 249Bk+48Ca and 243Am+48Ca reactions. The multiplicity of excited states populated by the alpha decay of odd nuclei may however preclude clear cross-bombardment cases, as was seen in the purported yet likely nonexistent link between nuclides assigned to 293Ts and 289Mc. Heavier isotopes are expected to be more stable; 320Ubu is predicted to be the most stable unbiunium isotope, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> synthesise it with current technology as no combination of usable target and projectile could provide enough neutrons.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Forerunner ship, the Master Chief is {{captured}} and interrogated by Covenant forces, but manages to escape using a concealed weapon. On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle {{in an effort}} to escape. Ruwan reveals that the Key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother James Ackerson made up as children; James told the Covenant about the Key in order to prevent the outright destruction of Cleveland. After fighting Covenant forces, Ruwan and Tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city. The Master Chief attempts to kill the Covenant's leader, Prophet of Truth, but is discovered as he takes aim; Truth escapes as the Chief is left to kill the Prophet's guards and find a way off the ship. Learning that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> change the Forerunner ship's destination, the Chief jumps to Earth using a piece of the vessel as a heat shield.|$|E
5|$|Since there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reach N = 184 {{close to}} the magic proton shell, the main hope of {{reaching}} anywhere near this neutron number in fusion–evaporation reactions is via increasing the proton number past 118, but that also greatly diminishes the cross-sections and may not quite reach N = 184. Using newly available 251Cf targets and intense beams of 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe would allow {{the production of the}} more neutron-rich 296Og, 300Ubn, 304Ubb, and 308Ubq, the latter three in the 1n channel that may be indicated by the low neutron binding energy of the compound nucleus 309Ubq* with N = 185 just above the closed shell. 308Ubq would reach the magic neutron number N = 184 and consequently have a higher cross-section for its production. Nevertheless, the growing importance of spontaneous fission as a decay mode over alpha decay in this region of the nuclide chart, as well as the short half-lives, may hamper the production of these nuclides even though they reach the closed neutron shell, and the feasibility of the 1n channel is also questionable. The most plausible way of reaching the centre of the island with current technology is to reach nuclides like 299Uue, 295Ts, and 295Lv whose alpha daughters are near enough to the island to undergo electron capture to add the necessary neutrons; nonetheless, the island is expected to be centred around copernicium, element 112, and thus this would not be of much help synthesising elements beyond 118.|$|E
50|$|Higher grades at {{some schools}} may reflect better {{performance}} than others (although with no national standard, there can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> compare one school to another by grades).|$|R
50|$|It is {{certainly}} possible that “Palms of Victory” {{was written by}} someone else, and there seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> determine exactly how the song came to be.|$|R
5000|$|The law was unjustifiably discriminatory. What if a British citizen {{was also}} {{suspected}} of terrorism which required {{that they be}} detained indefinitely without trial? There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do it.|$|R
5|$|The team finds {{another version}} of themselves, dead, who come from yet another {{parallel}} universe and were trapped aboard while investigating the ship, just as they are. Soon, the ship jumps again, into a reality where Atlantis is under attack from an unfamiliar alien ship. Sheppard intervenes, and the aliens retaliate by launching fighters. One of the fighters crashes into the Daedalus before it jumps again, this time into a universe where Atlantis' sun has already swelled into a red giant. To keep the ship from being burned up, McKay (David Hewlett) increases {{the rate at which}} the alternate reality drive activates, warning that his modifications are irreversible. Meanwhile, the team must contend with aliens from the crashed fighter. McKay figures out that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> guide the alternate reality drive, but that they can return to their original reality by reversing the drive and jumping back through the realities they had visited before. They use the maneuvering thrusters to stabilize the ship's orbit above the red giant, and weather another attack by the aliens, with help from an alternate Atlantis. Once they return to their own reality, they leave the ship in space suits after a remaining alien detonates an explosive, causing a breach in the ship's hull and are picked up by Lorne (Kavan Smith) after the Daedalus disappears. In the end, McKay is shown working on fixing the alternate reality drive, despite Sheppard's admonishments.|$|E

50|$|The train {{became known}} as the Doodle train because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> turn the engine between runs on the eight-mile route and it {{returned}} to Pickens backward, looking like a doodle bug.|$|R
25|$|A calliope is {{typically}} very loud. Even some small calliopes are audible for miles. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> vary tone or loudness. Musically, the only expression possible is the pitch, rhythm, {{and duration of}} the notes.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{directly}} measure {{thrust of}} a rocket in flight; Rather, a mathematical calculation {{is made from}} combustion chamber pressure, turbopump speed, calculated propellant density and flow rate, nozzle design, and atmospheric pressure.|$|E
25|$|Checkmate (often {{shortened}} to mate) {{is a game}} {{position in}} chess and other chess-like games in which a player's king is in check (threatened with capture) and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> remove the threat. Checkmating the opponent wins the game.|$|E

60|$|We {{were very}} angry, insanely, vociferously angry. Beating our chests, bristling, and gnashing our teeth, we {{gathered}} together in our rage. We felt the prod of gregarious instinct, the drawing together as though for united action, the impulse toward cooperation. In dim ways this need for united action was impressed upon us. But there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> achieve {{it because there}} <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> express it. We did not turn to, all of us, and destroy Red-Eye, because we lacked a vocabulary. We were vaguely thinking thoughts for which there <b>were</b> <b>no</b> thought-symbols. These thought-symbols were yet to be slowly and painfully invented.|$|R
25|$|In {{the most}} {{straightforward}} case, {{such as the}} sampling of a batch of material from production (acceptance sampling by lots), it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include {{any one of them}} in our sample. However, in the more general case this is not usually possible or practical. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> identify all rats in the set of all rats. Where voting is not compulsory, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> identify which people will actually vote at a forthcoming election (in advance of the election). These imprecise populations are not amenable to sampling in any of the ways below and to which we could apply statistical theory.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{it may be}} {{desirable}} to write a function that only operates on numbers. However, in the untyped lambda calculus, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> prevent a function from being applied to truth values, strings, or other non-number objects.|$|E
25|$|A {{person can}} become a nazirite {{whether or not the}} Temple in Jerusalem is standing. However, lacking the temple there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> bring the offerings that end the nazirite vow. As such the person would de facto be a {{permanent}} nazirite.|$|E
50|$|In the Legion of 3 Worlds, it is {{revealed}} {{that in the}} 31st century Mogo has been long dead and without him, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> distribute the rings and thus no Green Lantern Corps.|$|R
