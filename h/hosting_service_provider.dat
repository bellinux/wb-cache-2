We show that this undesirable result need not occur, and does not follow in most cases when the model underlying the Nash game is sufficiently general.

Further, we consider both single-tier and two-tier pricing, as practiced currently by a major web <b>hosting</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider...</b>|$|E

40|$|A web content <b>hosting</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> {{needs to}} {{dynamically}} allocate servers in a server farm to its customers â€™ web sites. Ideally, the allocation {{to a site}} should always suffice to handle its load. However, due to {{a limited number of}} servers and the overhead incurred in changing the allocation of a server from one site to another, the system may become overloaded. The problem faced by the web <b>hosting</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> is how to allocate the available servers in the most profitable way. Adding to the complexity of this problem is the fact that future loads of the sites are either unknown or known only for the very near future. In this paper we model this server allocation problem, and consider both its offline and online versions. We give a polynomial time algorithm for computing the optimal offline allocation. In the online setting, we show almost optimal algorithms (both deterministic and randomized) for any positive lookahead. The quality of the solution improves as the lookahead increases. We also consider several special cases of practical interest. Finally, we present some experimental results using actual trace data that show that one of our online algorithm performs very close to optimal. Interestingly, the online server allocation problem can be cast as a more general benefit task system that we define. Our results extend to this task system, which captures also the benefit maximization variants of the k-server problem and the metrical task system problem. It follows that the benefit maximization variants of these problems are more tractable than their cost minimization variants...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} {{business}} context, {{evaluation of the}} web page views or web pages accesses is gaining a huge recognition where {{it has become a}} vital need in planning of computer resource allocations and estimation process of upcoming revenue and advertising growth. One of the essential tasks of the <b>hosting</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> is to allocate servers to each of the websites to maintain a certain level of quality of service for different levels of incoming requests at each point of time, and optimize the use of server resources, while maximizing its profits. In order to have a proactive management of resources within the servers it is required to build an accurate forecasting process of web accesses per unit time. As a time series, the web access patterns of the users exhibit not even different levels of short time random fluctuations but also periodic patterns that evolve randomly from one period to another. In this paper, we focus on extracting trends and web access patterns from page view or page access series using data mining techniques and their applicability on predicting the future web page accesses. Based on the time series regression techniques which are used to analyse and forecast web accesses, we found that Sequential Minimal Optimization and Linear Regression algorithms were providing more accurate results in forecasting...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Internet service {{utilities}} host multiple server applications on {{a shared}} server cluster (server farm). One {{of the essential}} tasks of the <b>hosting</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> is to allocate servers {{to each of the}} websites to maintain a certain level of quality of service for different classes of incoming requests at each point of time, and optimize the use of server resources, while maximizing its profits. Such a proactive management of resources requires accurate prediction of workload, which is generally measured as the amount of service requests per unit time. As a time series, the workload exhibits not only short time random fluctuations but also prominent periodic (daily) patterns that evolve randomly from one period to another. We propose a solution to the Web server load prediction problem based on a hierarchical framework with multiple time scales. This framework leads to adaptive procedures that provide both longterm (in days) and short-term (in minutes) predictions with simultaneous confidence bands which accommodate not only serial correlation but also heavy-tailedness, and nonstationarity of the data. The long-term load is modeled as a dynamic harmonic regression (DHR), the coefficients of which evolve according to a random walk, and are tracked using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms; whereas the short-term load is predicted using an autoregressive model, whose parameters are also estimated using SMC techniques. We evaluate our method using real-world Web workload data. Index Termsâ€”Dynamic harmonic regression, seasonal time series, sequential Monte Carlo, Web-load prediction. I...|$|E
