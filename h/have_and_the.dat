The shorter the {{sections}} the shorter they close, the more eyes they <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> better the power curve is in them.

25|$|JSL is a romanization {{system based}} on Japanese phonology, {{designed}} using the linguistic principles used by linguists in designing writing systems for languages {{that do not have}} any. It is a purely phonemic system, using exactly one symbol for each phoneme, and marking pitch accent using diacritics. It was created for Eleanor Harz Jorden's system of Japanese language teaching. Its principle is that such a system enables students to better internalize the phonology of Japanese. Since it does not have any of the advantages for non-native speakers that the other systems <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Japanese already have a writing system for their language, JSL is not widely used outside the educational environment.|$|E

500|$|Noam Chomsky {{has argued}} that forces {{opposing}} the development of such a world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore {{has argued that}} mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should {{take into account that}} if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The Committee on Conscience of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: [...] "When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet, and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice" [...] (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: [...] "The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world." [...] Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped the conscience of the world. [...] The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by conscience, who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people.

2500|$|Proper {{strategy}} in tournaments can vary widely {{depending on the}} amount of chips one has, the stage of the tournament, the amount of chips others <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> playing styles of one's opponents. [...] Although some authors still recommend a tight playing style, others recommend looser play (playing more hands) in tournaments than one would otherwise play in cash games. In tournaments the blinds and antes increase regularly, and can become much larger {{near the end of the}} tournament. This can force players to play hands that they would not normally play when the blinds were small, which can warrant both more loose and more aggressive play.|$|E

[...] In Danish, the real passive has only periphrastic forms in the perfect: bilen er blevet set ude på Stockholms gader. In the lexicalised and {{reciprocal}} passives, on the other hand, we find a combination of the verb <b>have</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> s-passive preterite: e.g. mødtes [...] "have met", har fandtes [...] "have existed" [...] etc. (but strangely enough, the irregular har set(e)s [...] "have seen each other" [...] is much more common than har sås, which is considered substandard).|$|E
