40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo report {{outcomes}} of cochlear implantation (CI) {{in a child}} with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) and to provide preliminary clinical evidence of the efficacy of CI in ANSD patients. MethodsA 4 –year–old boy with diagnosed auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) received implantation of a Nucleus CI 24 R after an unsatisfactory trial of amplification. Post–implantation performance in both hearing sensitivity and speech recognition was assessed in different sessions. Aided hearing thresholds were tested by behavioral audiometry. Mandarin <b>Early</b> <b>Speech</b> <b>Perception</b> <b>Test</b> (MESP), Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS), category of auditory performance (CAP) and Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) {{were used to assess}} the benefits in auditory skills or speech recognition the boy obtained from CI. The tests were administered before surgery and at 3 months and 7 months after opening. ResultsThe boy demonstrated improved auditory sensitivity by using CI. Concerning speech recognition and communication, both speech audiometry and questionnaires showed an obvious benefit from CI. ConclusionsCI has worked efficiently in this ANSD boy. But because of limited understanding of ANSD and rehabilitation effect by cochlear implantation in this condition, the clinical decision to implant should be cautious and only after a thorough evaluation. Meanwhile, well controlled and long term studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of cochlear implantation in patients with ANSD...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{perception}} {{tests are}} an important part of procedures for diagnosing pre-verbal hearing loss. Merely establishing a child's hearing threshold with and without a hearing aid is not sufficient to ensure an adequate evaluation with a view to selecting cases suitable for cochlear implants because it fails to indicate the real benefit obtained from using a conventional hearing aid reliably. Speech perception tests have proved useful not only for patient selection, but also for subsequent evaluation of the efficacy of new hearing aids, such as tactile devices and cochlear implants. In clinical practice, the tests most commonly adopted with small children are: The Auditory Comprehension Test (ACT), Discrimination after Training (DAT), Monosyllable, Trochee, Spondee tests (MTS), Glendonald Auditory Screening Priocedure (GASP), <b>Early</b> <b>Speech</b> <b>Perception</b> <b>Test</b> (ESP), Rather than considering specific results achieved in individual cases, reference is generally made to the four speech perception classes proposed by Moog and Geers of the CID of St. Louis. The purpose of this classification, made on the results obtained with suitably differentiated tests according to the child's age and language ability, is to detect differences in perception of a spoken message in ideal listening conditions. To date, no italian language speech perception test has been designed to establish the assessment of speech perception level in children with profound hearing impairment. We attempted, therefore, to adapt the existing English tests to the Italian language taking into consideration the differences between the two languages. Our attention focused on the ESP test since it can be applied to even very small children (2 years old). The ESP is proposed in a standard version for hearing-impaired children over the age of 6 years and in a simplified version for younger children. The rationale we used for selecting Italian words reflect the rationale established for the original version, but the choice of single words follows different criteria from the original version. In fact, the two languages differ in important linguistic features so that the test can not be not adapted to the Italian language by simply translating the words involved. As currently there is no children's language dictionary in Italian arranged according to age bracket, we chose words used in children and in pre-school reading material...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the development of}} early auditory capability and <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> in the prelingual deaf children after cochlear implantation, and to study the feasibility of currently available Chinese assessment instruments {{for the evaluation of}} early auditory skill and <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> in hearing-impaired children. Methods A total of 83 children with severe-to-profound prelingual hearing impairment participated in this study. Participants were divided into four groups according to the age for surgery: A (1 - 2 years), B (2 - 3 years), C (3 - 4 years) and D (4 - 5 years). The auditory skill and <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> ability of CI children were evaluated by trained audiologists using the infant-toddler/ meaningful auditory integration scale (IT-MAIS/MAIS) questionnaire, the Mandarin <b>Early</b> <b>Speech</b> <b>Perception</b> (MESP) <b>test</b> and the Mandarin Pediatric Speech Intelligibility (MPSI) test. The questionnaires were used in face to face interviews with the parents or guardians. Each child was assessed before the operation and 3 months, 6 months, 12 months after switch-on. Results After cochlear implantation, early postoperative auditory development and <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> gradually improved. All MAIS/IT-MAIS scores showed a similar increasing trend with the rehabilitation duration(F= 5. 743, P= 0. 007). Preoperative and post operative MAIS/IT-MAIS scores of children in age group C (3 - 4 years) was higher than that of other groups. Children who had longer hearing aid experience before operation demonstrated higher MAIS/IT-MAIS scores than those with little or no hearing aid experience(F= 4. 947, P= 0. 000). The MESP test showed that, children were not able to perceive speech as well as detecting speech signals. However as the duration of CI use increased, <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> ability also improved substantially. However, only about 40 % of the subjects could be evaluated using the most difficult subtest on the MPSI in quiet at 12 months after switch-on. As MCR decreased, the proportion of children who could be tested using the MPSI reduced. Conclusions Within one year after CI, children develop <b>early</b> auditory and <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> capabilities with time.

40|$|Good <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> and {{communication}} skills {{in everyday life}} are crucial for participation and well-being, and are therefore an overarching aim of auditory rehabilitation. Both behavioral and self-report measures {{can be used to}} assess these skills. However, correlations between behavioral and self-report <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> measures are often low. One possible explanation {{is that there is a}} mismatch between the specific situations used in the assessment of these skills in each method, and a more careful matching across situations might improve consistency of results. The role that cognition plays in specific speech situations may also be important for understanding communication, as <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> vary in their cognitive demands. In this study, the role of executive function, working memory (WM) and attention in behavioral and self-report measures of <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> was investigated. Thirty existing hearing aid users with mild-to-moderate hearing loss aged between 50 and 74 years completed a behavioral <b>test</b> battery with <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> ranging from phoneme discrimination in modulated noise (easy) to words in multi-talker babble (medium) and keyword perception in a carrier sentence against a distractor voice (difficult).

Methods: Forty-six adults {{with a minimum of}} 6 months of cochlear implant experience were included. CIS+, HDCIS and FSP were compared in <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> in noise, pitch scaling and questionnaires. The randomized tests were performed acutely (interval 1) and again after 3 months of FSP experience (interval 3). The subjective evaluation included questionnaire 1 at intervals 1 and 3, and questionnaire 2 at interval 2, 1 month after interval 1. Results: Comparison between FSP and CIS+ showed that FSP performed at least as well as CIS+ in all <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests,</b> and outperformed CIS+ in vowel and monosyllabic word discrimination. Comparison between FSP and HDCIS showed that both performed equally well in all <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests.</b> Pitch scaling showed that FSP performed at least as well as HDCIS. With FSP, sound quality was at least as good and often better than with HDCIS. Conclusions: Results indicate that FSP performs better than CIS+ in vowel and monosyllabic word understanding. Subjective evaluation demonstrates strong user preferences for FSP when listening to speech and music.

40|$|Objectives:Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that chil-dren who use cochlear implants (CIs) tend to achieve higher reading levels than their peers with profound hearing loss who use hearing aids. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the influ-ences of auditory information provided by the CI on the later reading skills of children born with pro-found deafness. The hypothesis was that there would be a positive and predictive relationship between <b>earlier</b> <b>speech</b> <b>perception,</b> production, and subse-quent reading comprehension. Design: The <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> and production skills at the vowel, consonant, phoneme, and word level of 72 children with prelingual, profound hear-ing loss were assessed after 48 mos of CI use. The children’s reading skills were subsequently assessed using word and passage comprehension measures after an average of 89. 5 mos of CI use. A regression analysis determined the amount of variance in read-ing that could be explained by the variables of per-ception, production, and socioeconomic status. Results: Regression analysis revealed that it was possible to explain 59 % of the variance of later reading skills by assessing the <b>early</b> <b>speech</b> percep-tion and production performance. The results indi-cated that <b>early</b> <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> and production skills of children with profound hearing loss who receive CIs predict future reading achievement skills. Furthermore, the study implies that better <b>early</b> <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> and production skills re-sult in higher reading achievement. It is speculated that the early access to sound helps to build better phonological processing skills, which is one of the likely contributors to eventual reading success.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: (1) To {{report the}} <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> and {{intelligibility}} results of Mandarin-speaking patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (LVAS) after cochlear implantation (CI); (2) to compare their performance {{with a group}} of CI users without LVAS; (3) to understand the effects of age at implantation and duration of implant use on the CI outcomes. The obtained data may be used to guide decisions about CI candidacy and surgical timing. METHODS: Forty-two patients with LVAS participating in this study were divided into two groups: the early group received CI before 5 years of age and the late group after 5. Open-set <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> (on Mandarin tones, words and sentences) were administered one year after implantation and at the most recent follow-up visit. Categories of auditory <b>perception</b> (CAP) and <b>Speech</b> Intelligibility Rating (SIR) scale scores were also obtained. RESULTS: The patients with LVAS with more than 5 years of implant use (18 cases) achieved a mean score higher than 80 % on the most recent <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> and reached the highest level on the CAP/SIR scales.

Both groups had been previously assessed on their perception of native and non-native phoneme contrasts (6 - 8 months of age) and their vocabulary size and use of gestures (10 - 29 months of age). Their current language development and executive functioning was correlated with their scores on <b>early</b> <b>speech</b> contrast <b>perception.</b> The analysis revealed that children who showed less sensitivity to a non-native speech sound contrast at infant age performed better on a rapid naming test at 3 ½ to 4 ½ years of age.

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} impact of visual cues, speech {{materials}} and age on the frequency bandwidth necessary for optimizing speech recognition performance in listeners with normal hearing. Method: Speech recognition abilities of adults and children with normal hearing were assessed using three <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> that were low-pass (LP) filtered and presented in quiet and noise. The speech materials included the Multimodal Lexical Sentence Test (MLST) that was presented in auditory-only and auditory-visual modalities {{for the purpose of}} determining the listener 2 ̆ 7 s visual benefit. In addition, The University of Western Ontario Plurals Test (UWO) assessed listeners 2 ̆ 7 ability to detect high frequency acoustic information (e. g., /s/ and /z/) in isolated words and The Maryland CNC test that assessed speech recognition performance using isolated single words. Speech recognition performance was calculated as percent correct and was compared across groups (children and adults), tests (MLST, UWO, and CNC) and conditions (quiet and noise). Results: Statistical analyses revealed a number of significant findings. The effect of visual cues was significant in adults and children. The type of speech material had significant impact on the frequency bandwidth required for adults and children to optimize speech recognition performance. The children required significantly more bandwidth to optimize performance than adults across <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> and conditions of quiet and noise. Adults and children required significantly more bandwidth in noise than in quiet across <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests.</b> Conclusion: The results suggest that children and adults require significantly less bandwidth for optimizing speech recognition performance when assessed using sentence materials which provide visual cues. Children, however, showed less benefit from visual cues in the noise condition than adults. The amount of bandwidth required by both groups decreased {{as a function of the}} speech material. In other words, the more ecologically valid the speech material (e. g., sentences with visual cues versus single isolated words), the less bandwidth was required for optimizing performance. In all, the optimal bandwidth (except for the noise condition of the UWO test) is achievable with current amplification schemes...|$|R

[URL] development of multiple channel cochlear implants has been a significant advance in the rehabilitation of profound hearing loss. <b>Speech</b> <b>perception</b> benefits have been particularly evident for postlinguistically deafened adults, who as a group have shown not only supplementation of lipreading scores but also significant comprehension of words and sentences using an implant alone, without the aid of lipreading.

These improvements in open-set speech benefits for adult users have resulted in a steady increase in group mean scores and a reevaluation of selection criteria for cochlear implantation. In the initial development of cochlear implants, only those with little or no residual hearing were considered as candidates. Current selection criteria now include those with substantial residual hearing, who may score up to 40 % in the best-aided condition on word and sentence <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests.</b> In order to provide realistic expectations for prospective cochlear implant patients, it is important to establish the relationship of many preimplant factors to postimplant <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> benefits.

40|$|This study {{compared}} adult {{cochlear implant}} (CI) users to normally hearing (NH) listeners {{in their ability}} to identify various environmental sounds. It also assessed the impact of cochlear implantation on <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> as well as the ability to identify environmental sounds. A comprehensive Environmental Sounds Perception Test (EST) was developed for this study. It was hypothesised that: (i) the NH participants would score higher than the experienced CI users on the EST; (ii) for the pre-to-post CI group, scores on the EST would be higher post-surgery than presurgery, and (iii) for the pre-to-post CI surgery group, scores on <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> would be higher post-surgery than pre-surgery. 10 experienced adult Nucleus CI users and 24 similarly-aged NH subjects were compared on the EST. The study also tested four adults pre-surgery (with HAs), and subsequently post-surgery with the CI on <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> as well as the EST. The closed-set EST consisted of 45 different sounds selected to be representative of everyday stimuli, classified into 9 groups; transport, nature, arriving home, bathroom, kitchen, household appliances, human, office and other. Each sound was represented by two different tokens, ranging in lengths from 2. 5 to 12. 5 seconds. The results showed that NH participants scored significantly higher than the experienced CI users on the EST (p < 0. 001). For the participants tested pre- and post- surgery, the higher scores with the CI than with HAs was approaching significance (p = 0. 068) for both the EST and the <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> measures. No significant correlations were found between scores on the EST and a range of participant factors such as age or <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> scores for any group. Overall these results suggest that CI users are poorer than NH participants, but better than HA users with severeto- profound hearing losses, in recognizing environmental sounds...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundA key {{objective}} when fitting hearing aids to children is {{to maximize the}} audibility of high frequency speech cues which are critical {{in the understanding of}} spoken language. Recent advances in digital signal processing have enabled the development of hearing aids which offer linear frequency transposition as a new way of accessing these important speech sounds. Transposition of acoustic information from higher to lower frequencies may help people with severe or profound high frequency hearing loss, especially when a ‘dead region’ is present. ObjectiveThe current study is designed to investigate the clinical efficacy of frequency transposition on <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> in Arabic speaking hearing impaired children. MethodsTen children and adolescents with sensorineural hearing loss were evaluated with their own hearing aids, then fitted with Widex Inteo- 19 with master program without frequency transposition. The study group was reevaluated after 2 months to assess the benefits of the new digital HA, if any. HAs have been reprogrammed with a frequency transposition mode as a standalone program. The performance was compared with that of the former two visits after 3 months of regular use and auditory training. ResultsHearing impaired children showed improvement in aided thresholds in the high frequency region. There was a significant improvement in the <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> and in <b>speech</b> production as reflected on Voice Onset Time (VOT) of voiced stops and vowel duration. WILSI (Widex Infant Listening Skill Inventory) reflected the same improvement as judged by the parents. ConclusionHearing impaired children’s performance improved with frequency transposition program as evidenced by <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests,</b> <b>speech</b> production and WILSI questionnaire...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} the Digit Triplet Test (DTT) in a simulated home environment for measuring speech recognition in adults with cochlear implants by comparing the result to clinic <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests.</b> To {{evaluate the}} acceptability of the DTT in adults using cochlear implants. Methods: A prospective single-centre study with the following outcomes: • Digit Triplet Test Speech Reception Threshold • Clinic <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> (BKB sentences in quiet and noise, CUNY sentences with lip-reading) • A satisfaction questionnaire to assess patient perception of the Digit Triplet Test Sixteen people using cochlear implants aged from 43 to 83 years took part. Results: • Eighty-eight percent of participants were able to be tested on the DTT; there were no floor or ceiling effects. • DTT SRT was highly correlated with clinic BKB sentence scores in quiet and adaptive noise, and participants felt positive about using the DTT for home testing. Conclusion: The majority of adults using cochlear implants in this study were able and willing to use the DTT to test their speech recognition in a simulated home environment. The DTT SRT was highly correlated with traditional clinic sentence scores, supporting its validity as a home test for hearing in adults using cochlear implants. Hearing testing in the clinic is still the gold standard of clinical care for people with cochlear implants, but a home test could provide a useful addition. <br/...|$|R

[Methods]This study was a retrospective review of patient charts conducted at a tertiary referral center. Thirty-five pre-lingually deafened children underwent multichannel cochlear implantation and habilitation at the Kyoto University Hospital Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. A pre-operative cognitive–adaptive developmental quotient was evaluated using the Kyoto scale of psychological development.

40|$|Magdalena Lachowska, Agnieszka Pastuszka, Paulina Glinka, Kazimierz Niemczyk Department of Otolaryngology, Hearing Implant Center, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{benefits}} of cochlear implantation in the elderly. Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis of 31 postlingually deafened elderly (≥ 60 years of age) with unilateral cochlear implants was conducted. Audiological testing included preoperative and postoperative pure-tone audiometry and a monosyllabic word recognition test presented from recorded material in free field. <b>Speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> included Ling&# 39;s six sound test (sound detection, discrimination, and identification), syllable discrimination, and monosyllabic and multisyllabic word recognition (open set) without lip-reading. Everyday life benefits from cochlear implantation were also evaluated. Results: The mean age {{at the time of}} cochlear implantation was 72. 4 years old. The mean post-implantation follow-up time was 2. 34 years. All patients significantly improved their audiological and speech understanding performances. The preoperative mean pure-tone average threshold for 500 Hz, 1, 000 Hz, 2, 000 Hz, and 4, 000 Hz was 110. 17 dB HL. Before cochlear implantation, all patients scored 0 % on the monosyllabic word recognition test in free field at 70 dB SPL intensity level. The postoperative pure-tone average was 37. 14 dB HL (the best mean threshold was 17. 50 dB HL, the worst was 58. 75 dB HL). After the surgery, mean monosyllabic word recognition reached 47. 25 %. <b>Speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> showed statistically significant improvement in speech recognition. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that cochlear implantation is indeed a successful treatment for improving speech recognition and offers a great help in everyday life to deafened elderly patients. Therefore, they can be good candidates for cochlear implantation and their age alone should not be a relevant or excluding factor when choosing candidates for cochlear implantation.

40|$|Normal hearing (NH) {{listeners}} commonly {{perform better}} when listening to speech in modulated than in steady state maskers. This improvement is often labeled as a “release of masking”. Cochlear-implant (CI) listeners generally don’t receive a masking release in <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> {{and the reasons}} are indistinct. This study {{for the first time}} investigates the comodulation masking release, an underlying psychoacoustic effect, in a flanking band setup acoustically in CI users. The focus of the experiments was, if CI users can use across-frequency cues to improve signal detection in (co-) modulated interfering noise. The test bases upon a forced choice paradigm to determine detection thresholds of a sinusoidal signal in fluctuating maskers. The maskers consisted of one or five amplitude modulated narrow noise-bands. The masking noise-bands were either incoherently or coherently modulated (comodulated). The difference of the detection threshold of the sinusoidal signal in these two conditions is defined as comodulation masking release (CMR). Two parameters of the masking noise complex were varied: the bandwidth/modulation frequency and the spectral alignment. 18 NH and 28 CI users participated in this study. The measured detection thresholds in CI users were highly reproducible. In contrast, the inter-individual standard deviation was higher for CI users compared to NH. Nevertheless, CMR in CI users was significant (p< 0. 01). The results clearly show that CI users can benefit from across-frequency cues and achieve a significant CMR under the described test conditions. So, the basis for a release of masking in <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests</b> in CI users seems to exist...|$|R
40|$|Background: About 25 % {{children}} with profound deafness have additional disabilities. For children who cannot be evaluated by <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>tests,</b> an alternative scale scoring-method {{was designed by}} the CI-team at Rikshospitalet, reflecting subjective observations on reactions to sound {{and the desire to}} use CI. Study question: To explore the benefit from CI in {{children with}} profound hearing loss and complex disabilities. Additionally the impact of cognitive dysfunction on benefit was explored. Population and method: Retrospective review of 127 medical records from all children receiving CI during 2008 – 2011 at Rikshospitalet, Norway. Two scales were used for evaluation. The standard scale from 0 - 10 (10 normal speech development) was based on <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> only. When not applicable, the alternative scale from 0 - 4 (0 = non-user, 4 = great benefit, speech development) was applied. Results: Thirty (24 %) children had complex disability. Of these, nine (30 %) had a cognitive dysfunction. Sixteen (53 %) of the children with complex disabilities could be tested with the normal <b>speech</b> <b>perception</b> <b>test,</b> and their mean scores equaled mean to scores of otherwise “healthy” children with CI (6, 6 and 7, 6 respectively). The alternative scale was applied for 14 children with complex disorders (nine of them with cognitive dysfunction), the mean score (2, 4) indicated that these children also benefited from CI. Forty-two (33 %) children were not yet tested because of young age or testing difficulties. Conclusion: In this study children with complex disabilities without cognitive dysfunction did as well with CI as children without complex disabilities, in terms of speech development. When cognitive dysfunction was present, alternative scale scores indicated a clear, but variable benefit. Further studies on this group of children with CI are important in order to develop appropriate tools for evaluation and prognosis...|$|R
