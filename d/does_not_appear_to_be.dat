5|$|C. Auguste Dupin {{is a man}} in Paris who {{solves the}} mystery of the brutal murder of two women. Numerous {{witnesses}} heard a suspect, though no one agrees on what language was spoken. At the murder scene, Dupin finds a hair that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> human.|$|E
5|$|Disrupting the attacker's {{perception}} of the target's motion was the main intended purpose of dazzle camouflage as used on ships in the First World War, though its effectiveness is disputed. This type of dazzle <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used by animals.|$|E
5|$|In African antelopes, {{the lateral}} dental {{grooming}} apparatus <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used during grazing or browsing. Instead, {{it is used}} during grooming when the head sweeps upward in a distinctive motion. It is thought to comb the fur and remove ectoparasites.|$|E

5|$|Myrmecia {{contains}} {{a total of}} nine species groups. Originally, seven species groups were established in 1911, but this was raised to 13 in 1951; Promyrmecia had a total of eight while Myrmecia only had five. M. maxima <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a species group, as no type specimen is available.|$|E
5|$|P. c. barbouri was {{described}} by Allan Brooks in 1920. Abundant on Anticosti Island in eastern Quebec, this subspecies is significantly heavier but not larger than other grey jay subspecies in Quebec, and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> genetically distinct from P. c. nigricapillus or other populations in Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Seychellum {{are the two}} species of Deckenia from the African mainland. The two-lobed shape of the last segment of the mandibular palp, which {{had been used to}} argue for a close relationship between Seychellum and Indian crabs of the family Gecarcinucidae, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a reliable phylogenetic character.|$|E

5|$|This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the entire}} story. Four {{modifications}} to the cytosine residues in human DNA have been reported. These modifications are the addition of methyl (CH3)-, hydroxymethyl (CH2OH)-, formyl (CHO)- and carboxyl (COOH)- groups. These modifications are through to have regulatory functions.|$|E
5|$|Yoke valves {{are rated}} between 200 and 240 bar, and there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> any {{mechanical}} design detail preventing connection between any yoke fittings, though some older yoke clamps will not fit over the popular 232/240 bar combination DIN/yoke cylinder valve as the yoke is too narrow.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{the drug}} eculizumab was {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of PNH. It improves quality of life and decreases the need for blood transfusions but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> affect the risk of death. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> change the risk of blood clots, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, or aplastic anemia.|$|R

It is {{resistant}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses {{a major threat}} to many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it does not appear on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
5|$|Meechum remains Underwood's {{bodyguard}} once {{he becomes}} the president, and there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker {{on one of the}} walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{the tree}} sparrow include a variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, little owl, and {{sometimes}} long-eared owl and white stork. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at {{an increased risk of}} predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, jays, least weasels, rats, cats and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake.|$|E

5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} {{is frequently}} caught incidentally by trawlers of Australia's South East Trawl Fishery, which operate throughout its range. It is discarded after capture with an unknown, but probably high, rate of survival. Since this species <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The hero, {{who comes}} from a land beyond Alefgard, is a {{descendant}} of the legendary Erdrick. When the hero arrives, he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a warrior – he arrives without weapons or armor – and is ignorant of the situation. The populace thinks his claim {{of the ability to}} defeat the Dragonlord are preposterous; however, King Lorik sees this ability, which give him hope and he aids the hero on his quest.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} aside, B.integrifolia <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under threat. It has excellent {{resistance to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses {{a major threat}} to many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it does not appear on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E

5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> threatened by human activity {{and it has been}} assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during {{the first few months of}} life.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{at what point}} among the extant fragments the division between books 1 and 2 fell, but {{at least some of}} the Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) were most likely found in the 2nd book because there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enough room left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. It was once thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).|$|E

Use of vitamin D in children with normal vitamin D levels <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> improve bone density.
