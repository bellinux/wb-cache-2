50|$|The term Girocheque {{quickly became}} {{associated}} with welfare dependence. Worse still, {{the name was}} often associated with Girobank in the public psyche, making little distinction between the welfare cheque and the business. Having a <b>giro</b> <b>account</b> meant writing one's own girocheques and although recipients of girocheques {{did not need to}} have (and most did not have) a <b>giro</b> <b>account,</b> girocheques issued by personal customers were sometimes viewed with suspicion by the recipient. They also carried the name and address of the issuer, making them very noticeably different from the cheques issued by other banks and noticeably similar to welfare girocheques.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{expenditure}} side, it {{would limit the}} growth in staff by limiting the plans for expanding the personal customer base. As this grew, transaction costs grew (including the cost of remitting all those daily movement statements). Advertising ceased and charges were introduced that would discourage further growth in the personal <b>giro</b> <b>account</b> business.|$|E
50|$|Giropay offers merchants a {{real-time}} {{payment method}} (publicized as virtually risk-free) to accept internet payments. For customers, Giropay {{uses the same}} environment as their banks' online banking sites. The level of security depends on the participating bank. Some German Banks offer two-factor authentication (2FA), such as a challenge-response access token based on the chip embedded in the debit card or ATM card. Others, however, offer simpler PIN and TAN based online banking services. No sensitive information is being shared with the merchant, such as credit card or <b>Giro</b> <b>account</b> numbers. There is no chargeback right however, which {{can be considered a}} disadvantage for the consumer using this payment method. This is considered an advantage to the merchants.|$|E
5000|$|In Germany, banks {{generally}} have been providing direct debit (elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren (ELV), [...] "Lastschrift", Bankeinzug) using both methods {{since the advent}} of so-called <b>Giro</b> <b>accounts</b> in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Computerisation, it was argued, would {{transform}} {{the profitability of}} the new system, and {{it was estimated that}} a payment between two National <b>Giro</b> <b>accounts</b> could be made in 24 hours if there was a central accounting office located at a good communications hub. This would also speed up the national bank payment clearing system based on local bank branches and centralised cheque exchange requiring cheques to be returned to local branches. This had (and to this day still has) a 3-5 day clearing cycle.|$|R

50|$|The {{assembly}} comprises 51 members {{elected in}} a general, free, secret and direct ballot by {{the citizens of}} Zagreb according {{to the principle of}} proportional representation. Elections take place every four years - {{at the same time as}} for the Mayor. According to the Decision on the Regular Financing of the Parties, male representatives are annually paid around 56,000 kunas (cca. €7,545), while female representatives are annually paid around 62,000 kunas (cca. €8,355). However, this money is paid to the representatives' special <b>giro</b> <b>account</b> and can only be spent on the program of a political party or as a charitable donation. In addition, each of the 51 representatives is paid 1,200 kunas (cca. €160) per month for work at the Assembly, regardless of whether they have come to the Assembly meeting or not, and around 1,250 kunas (cca. €170) for the work in assembly committees (each representative is member of at least one committee).|$|E
50|$|This {{method is}} very popular within Germany as it allows quick and easy payments, and it is suited even for {{one-time}} payments. A customer might just give the authorisation {{at the same time}} she or he orders goods or services from an organisation. Compared to payments by credit cards, which allow similar usage, bank fees for successful collections are much lower. Often retailers such as supermarkets will process Girocards as direct debit (ELV) transactions after performing a real-time risk analysis when the card is swiped. This is possible because the bank account number and routing code of the <b>giro</b> <b>account</b> form part of every Girocard's card number (PAN), similar to early 1990s 19 digit Switch card numbers. The customer agrees to the direct debit by signing the back of the receipt, which normally contains a long contractual text that also allows the retailer to contact the customer's bank and get their address in the case the debit is returned ("Rücklastschrift"). Direct debits are practically free for the retailer, allowing them to save the Girocard interchange fees (approx. 0.3%) that would be associated with PIN based transactions, but incur a higher risk as the payment can be returned for any reason for up to 45 days. Therefore, they are used usually for returning customers that have already had successful Girocard (PIN-verified) transactions at the same store or are purchasing low-risk or small-ticket items.|$|E
