40|$|Quality {{control is}} an {{essential}} operation of pharmaceutical industries. Drugs must be marketed as safe and therapeutically active formulations whose performance is consistent and predictable. New and better medicinal agents are being produced at an accelerated rate. At the same time more exacting and sophisticated analytical methods are being developed for their evaluation. Currently, world-wide efforts {{have been made to}} ensure the practice of quality along with coast effective good quality medicines. Parenterals are the sterile preparation that is directly administered into the circulatory system avoiding the enteral route. These preparation provide rapid onset of action compared to others, but the most concerning topics related to this, is their stability problem that arises from microbial contamination of the products. Therefore, to ensure their sterility and stability, regulations regarding to quality control through pharmacopeial specifications has a great importance. Pharmacopeias provides an effective guideline to overcome those problems by following current good manufacturing practices and establishing standard operating procedures. <b>In-process</b> quality <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> are done with a motive to remove error from every stage in production and maintain the quality of the final product with the compendial standards as specified in the pharmacopoeias. The quality of final products depends on <b>in-process</b> <b>control</b> <b>tests,</b> because it helps to incorporate excellence within the products. The qualitative and quantitative parameters of pharmaceutical products are checked by finished product quality <b>controls</b> <b>tests.</b> Therefore, the drive {{of this study is to}} provide concise information on the in-process and finished product quality <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> for parenteral preparations as per different pharmacopoeias.

40|$|During {{development}} of adenovirus-based vaccines, samples {{have to be}} analyzed in order to either monitor the production process or control the quality and safety of the product. An important quality attribute is the total concentration of intact adenoviruses, which currently is determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or anion exchange-HPLC. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) was evaluated as alternative to the current methods with the aim to have one single method that allows reliable and fast quantification of adenovirus particles throughout the full process. Intact adenoviruses samples from downstream processing and upstream processing were analyzed directly by CE with UV-detection at 214  nm. Only the samples with high amounts of DNA required a simple sample pretreatment by benzonase. Adenovirus particles were separated from matrix components such as cell debris, residual cell DNA, and/or proteins on a PVA-coated capillary using a BGE consisting of 125  mM Tris, 338  mM tricine and 0. 2 % v/v polysorbate- 20 at pH 7. 7. Full factorial design of experiments was used for method optimization {{as part of the}} analytical quality by design (AQbD) method development approach. The method was validated for the quantification of adenoviruses on five representative samples from the manufacturing process in the range of 0. 5 × 1011 – 1. 5 × 1011 adenovirus particles per ml (~ 80 to 250  pmol/l). The CE method showed intermediate precision of 7. 8 % RSD on concentration and an accuracy (spiked recovery) of 95 – 110 %.

40|$|The MDI is now {{established}} {{as the principal}} dosage form of inhalation drug therapy for bronchial asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) are pharmaceutical delivery systems designed for oral or nasal use, which deliver discrete doses of aerosolized medicament to the respiratory tract. The MDI contains the active substance, dissolved or suspended in a liquefied propellant system held in a pressurized container that is sealed with a metering valve. In general, MDI formulations can take the form of either suspensions or solutions. Traditionally the preferred route has been to formulate a suspension of the micronized drug substance in the liquid propellant (CFC or HFA). In some cases, additional excipients (e. g., surfactants and/or co- solvents) have been added {{to improve the quality of}} the dispersion.

40|$|Reliable {{analytical}} {{tools are}} important for time efficient and economical process development, production and batch release of pharmaceuticals. Therapeutics recovered from human plasma, called plasma protein products, involve a large pharmaceutical industry of plasma fractionation. In plasma fractionation of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) and albumin (HSA) recommended analysis techniques are regulated by the European Pharmacopoeia and are including total protein concentration assays and zone electrophoresis for protein composition and purity. These techniques are robust, but more efficient techniques with higher resolution, specificity and less hands-on time are available. Surface plasmon resonance is an optical method to study biomolecular interactions label-free in real time. This technology {{was used in this}} master thesis to set up assays using Biacore systems for quantification of HSA and hIgG from all steps of chromatographic plasma fractionation as a tool for process development and <b>in-process</b> <b>control.</b> The analyses have simplified mass balance calculations to a high extent as they imply specific detection of the proteins compared with using total protein detection. The assays have a low hands-on time and are very simple to perform and the use of one master calibration curve during a full week decreases analysis time to a minimum. Quick, <b>in-process</b> <b>control</b> quantification of one sample is easily obtained within < 10 minutes. For final QC of hIgG or for process development, an assay to quantify the distribution of the IgG subclasses (1 - 4) was set up on Biacore and showed significantly lower hands-on time compared with a commercial ELISA.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} possible {{connections between}} an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) system, such as Predix, and data driven Lean practises. The {{aim is to}} examine if an IIoT platform can improve existing practises of Lean, and if so, which Lean tools are most likely influenced and how this is. Design/Methodology: The paper follows a phenomenon-based research approach. The methodology contains of a mix of primary and secondary data. The primary data was obtained through “almost unstructured” interviews with experts, while the secondary data comprises of {{a comprehensive review of}} existing literature. Moreover, a model was developed to investigate the connections between the concepts of IIoT and Lean. Findings: Findings derived from expert interviews at General Electric (GE) in Uppsala have led to the conclusion that Predix fulfils the necessary requirements to be considered an IIoT platform. However, the positive effects of the platform on the selected Lean tools could not be found. Only in one instance improved Predix the effectiveness of a Lean tool. Overall, data analytic efforts are performed and let to better <b>in-process</b> <b>control.</b> However, these efforts were independent from the Lean efforts carried out. There was no increase in data collection or analytics due to the Lean initiative and Predix is not utilised for data collection, storage, or analysis. It appears that the pharmaceutical industry is fairly slow in adapting new technologies. Firstly, the high regulatory requirements inherent within the pharmaceutical industry limit the application of cutting edge technology by demanding strict <b>in-process</b> <b>control</b> and process documentation. Secondly, the sheer size of GE itself slows down the adoption of new technology.

In addition, the efficiency of ultrasonic as compared to single impacts, such as obtained with peening processes, is assessed. Finally, it describes the mechanism of the effect on materials, feedback mode, <b>in-process</b> <b>control</b> of the treatment quality, tools and power supplies designed {{on the basis of the}} results of investigations of UIT. 1...|$|R
