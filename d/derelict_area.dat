Thinking of all the other abandoned buildings there must be in Paris, Besson decided to create a world where all these places were together, and combined this idea with a previous suggestion that he make a feature-length version of his 1981 debut short film, L'Avant Dernier. Le Dernier Combat was primarily filmed in Paris, with scenes depicted as begin in the desert filmed in Tunisia. Locations for filming in Paris included a former Électricité de France building that was demolished the day after filming was completed, and the <b>derelict</b> <b>area</b> where the Bibliothèque nationale de France was later constructed. The film was shot in black and white and contains only two words of dialogue.|$|E

Unfortunately, we do not know the exact numbers, size and diversity of <b>derelict</b> sited, <b>areas</b> are not recorded, solutions for this problem are not systematic. In the Statistical Region, we can see many of the areas, that are undergoing a degradation for a longer period, or they are undergoing a ceasing activity, which leads to derelict sites. In my diploma, I focused on the town Medvode and its surrounding. The purpose of my work is not to record all the derelict sites for this addressed area, but to identify learning examples for each type of derelict sites and their detailed presentation. Based on the record, that was carried out {{with the help of the}} census documents; an analysis of derelict sites was made.

A new species record of uncertain indigene, M [...] quadrivalvis was recorded {{for the first time}} in restricted localities along the roadsides in Pekan Darat and Bertam, Seberang Perai, Gurun and Bedong in Kedah in addition to widely distributed and seemingly ubiquitous presence of M. invisa Mart. ex.

Both species exhibited largely contagious and overdispersed distribution patterns with positive peaks in pattern intensity values although regularity or underdispersed distribution patterns do manifest in certain localities. The giant mimosa, M. pigra inhabited in clustered thickets, large pockets of lands in the urban and sub-urban localities in the states of Penang, Perak, Kelantan, Kuala Lumpur and Negeri Sembilan. In other states, M. pigra was confined to a few localities in smaller patches.

40|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century a {{widespread}} crisis of numerous industrial sectors contributed to the appearance of <b>derelict</b> industrial <b>areas.</b> In this perspective the recycling of <b>derelict</b> industrial <b>areas</b> is indispensable for sustainable city development in the optic of recovery and conservation of our industrial heritage. The transformation of derelict industrial sites into public spaces represents a significant enhancement to the quality of life and land use, and at the same time marks a new commitment to the transformation of once-industrial sites to new cultural and environmental uses. This requires a new planning approach based on knowledge, new technologies and collaborative design. The present study evaluates three design strategies that might be used to reclaim derelict sites in urban areas transforming them for the society and the environment. Each is strategy related to different landscape characters: the heritage, the environmental and the socio-cultural character. The objective of the present work was to analyse those design strategies used in the reclamation of <b>derelict</b> industrial <b>areas</b> using three representative different case studies: Duisburg Nord, Fresh Kills and Downsview Park. In those projects it was found that the design strategies adopted minimize the environmental impact assuring a harmonious reclamation of the natural and built environments. Landscape architects such as Peter Latz, James Corner and Bruce Mau, have shown how to create culturally stimulating landscapes with a large variety of uses and activities arising out of the derelict remains of past industry...|$|R

Macintyre, an established campaigner in civic redevelopment projects, proposed the unexecuted 3-storey A Town House for an Artist as centrepiece to an arts, heritage and tourist centre. As a prelude to that, and with Hardiman's expertise, Mackintosh Galleries Ltd set up The Scottish Fine Art Group and began staging regular arts events in the Inverness area. However, despite support, discussion, additions and amendments, the scheme failed to satisfy the planners and others, and the proposals were rejected in favour of a shopping complex.|$|E
