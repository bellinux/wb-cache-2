Ethier {{hit a home}} run which drove in the first four runs of the season for the Dodgers, who stole five bases — their most since August 23, 1999 when they stole seven in a game at Milwaukee. [...] "It's kind of cool to have a decent game on Jackie Robinson Day," [...] Martin said. [...] "I’m going to {{remember}} this probably {{for the rest of my}} life." [...] Randy Wolf, who was playing for the Dodgers at the time (currently a free agent) allowed six hits and three runs in six innings and struck out seven. [...] "The whole team wearing No. 42, it kind of goes sour if we don’t win," [...] Wolf said. [...] "It was great. There were a lot of special people here.

500|$|While Green Day {{was nearing}} {{completion}} of Warning, the band {{announced it would}} be performing on the 2000 Vans Warped Tour during the summer before the album's October release. Although the group {{had been invited to}} perform on the tour before, the band was unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts. Because of Green Day's new stylistic change displayed on Warning, the band was considered an unconventional choice for the tour. Jason White, guitarist for Armstrong's side project Pinhead Gunpowder, was recruited to perform with the band to add [...] "more power" [...] to the group's sound; White observed that [...] "Even I was like, 'Why are Green Day on the Warped Tour?'". Fat Mike of NOFX recalled, [...] "They were the biggest band on the tour but it wasn't by far. [...] Green Day weren't super popular at that time. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the Warped tour because they wanted to get popular again." [...] He also went on to call Warning [...] "probably their worst album, I think. It's what happens, the ups and downs." [...] However, Joel Madden of Good Charlotte, whose 2002 release The Young and the Hopeless outsold Warning, opined that [...] "I was definitely aware that our record at the time sold more maybe than their record but I think we idolized them so much that it didn't matter. [...] We thought Warning was one of their best records." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark {{became the}} first {{mainstream}} soap character to be diagnosed as HIV-positive. The storyline came after a government request to [...] "spread the word". Mark's story also helped dispel the myth that HIV is an automatic death sentence. He lived with the condition for 13 years before dying of an AIDS related illness. The Terrence Higgins Trust worked with the production team {{for the duration of}} Mark's story. Despite all the public health campaigns concerning HIV transmission, the biggest peak in requests for testing in Britain was seen in January 1991 when Mark Fowler was diagnosed HIV-positive. Carty has commented: [...] "I feel that the storyline educated people {{at a time when there}} were lots of misconceptions about HIV and AIDS…My main concern was that they'd get it right and, overall, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> - because it showed someone living with HIV, as opposed to dying of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since its release, [...] "I Want It That Way" [...] {{has been}} covered on {{numerous}} occasions. In 2002, Dynamite Boy covered {{the song in}} a punk rock version for the Punk Goes Pop series. American musician Ryan Adams performed the song live several times starting in 1999, although his performance featured a bit of sarcasm. Selena Gomez & the Scene cover the song on their House of Blue Tour. British boyband JLS performed the song and [...] "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)", along with two NSYNC songs, in a medley on their tour [...] "JLS Tour", in support of their second album Outta This World. Psychedelic rock band Vanilla Fudge covered it on their album The Return. In 2010, Steel Panther covered the song on a few live shows and released the single as a download in the UK, supposedly {{as a result of}} a bet. In 2013, the Glee Cast covered the song on the episode [...] "Feud" [...] as a mashup with NSYNC's [...] "Bye Bye Bye". In 2013, Charli XCX performed a cover live at the Borderline Music in Chicago. The singer-songwriter also performed a version of the song in August 2013 for The A.V. Club A.V. Undercover series. Also in 2013, British boy-band One Direction performed a cover of the song during their Take Me Home Tour, live at a Stockholm, Sweden concert. Backstreet Boys member Howie D approved the cover, saying, [...] "It’s nice to see groups like that pay homage to us. We definitely paid homage to groups in the earlier days that we admired So it’s cool. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> a great job. It seemed like it went over really well." ...|$|E

5000|$|Gare {{was quoted}} by Christobel Mattingley as explaining, [...] "I have always written {{about my own}} experiences. I write as I feel. I have been too afraid to write from my {{imagination}} in case I mislead. My own reading when I was very young caused me to expect so much more from life than one ever gets. So I distrust most fiction. I'd never never contrive to make a plot.

60|$|All {{these things}} struck me, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the others, {{because by the}} action of some {{simultaneous}} thought it came to our minds that very probably we were looking on them for the last time. It is all very well to talk of the Unknown and the Infinite whereof we are assured we are the heirs, but that does not make it any easier for us to part with the Known and the Finite. The contemplation of the wonders of Eternity does not conceal the advantages of actual and existent Time. In short there is no one of us, from a sainted archbishop down to a sinful suicide, who does not regret the necessity of farewell to the pleasant light and the kindly race of men wherewith we are acquainted.|$|E

As for me, I ran forward, not back, since the Kaffirs were behind me, across the path, Baas, driving off the oxen. They sprang at me, but I jumped this way and that way and avoided them.

Of course, he may have stopped with the Merryweathers, but I am afraid he has not. I fancy that part of Faulkner's story must be true; he could never have accused Julian if he had not met him near his gate--for Julian in that case could have easily proved where he was at the time. No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> meet, and very likely had a row. You know what Faulkner is; and I can understand that if he met Julian he would most likely say something to him, and there might then be a quarrel; but I think that his story about Julian coming out and looking at him is either pure fancy or a lie. No doubt he was thinking of him as he rode along; and, badly wounded as he was, perhaps altogether insensible, he may have imagined the rest." ...|$|E

[...] Babiš's coalition partners ČSSD (Šincl's party) and KDU-ČSL demanded an apology but Babiš {{refused to do}} so and claimed that Šincl had lied about him in the Parliament. Bohuslav Sobotka, Czech Prime Minister and the chairman of ČSSD called on a coalition meeting on the same day.|$|R
60|$|In this, perhaps, I have answered, I think, {{another of}} your questions,--Whether the British Constitution {{is adapted to}} your circumstances? When I praised the British Constitution, and wished it to be well studied, I {{did not mean that}} its {{exterior}} form and positive arrangement should become a model for you or for any people servilely to copy. I meant to recommend the principles from which it has grown, and the policy on which it has been progressively improved out of elements common to you and to us. I am sure it is no visionary theory of mine. It is not an advice that subjects you to the hazard of any experiment. I believed the ancient principles to be wise in all cases of a large empire that would be free. I thought you possessed our principles in your old forms in as great a perfection as we did originally. If your States agreed (as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did)</b> with your circumstances, they were best for you. As you had a Constitution formed upon principles similar to ours, my idea was, that you might have improved them as we have done, conforming them to the state and exigencies of the times, and the condition of property in your country,--having the conservation of that property, and the substantial basis of your monarchy, as principal objects in all your reforms.|$|E
5000|$|The soundtrack {{was also}} {{released}} on vinyl by Varèse Sarabande, and was re-released on compact disc in 1998.

5000|$|The {{album is}} not a direct copy of the music used in the film, but rather a remixing. The mix was an {{assembly}} of the film's original tracks that often accentuated the various layers of the music differently from in the film itself. It also includes elements of synthesized speech and sound effects. The mix was done by Scot Holton of Varèse Sarabande, who loved many of the subtler elements of the film's score and made them more prominent in the album's tracks.
