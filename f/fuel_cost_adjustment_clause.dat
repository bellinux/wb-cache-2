Two different models of the regulatory environment are considered. For each, it is shown that input choice incentives are altered in the presence of a fuel adjustment mechanism. Finally, some suggested benefits of such clauses to the financial position of the utility are examined. ...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the impact}} of {{continuously}} sharp rises in crude oil prices since 2005, the Japanese economy has been facing severe increases in costs such as those related to energy. Nevertheless, {{in regard to the}} pass-through of these increases in energy-related costs to the price of goods and services, some observers hold the view that given the supply-demand structure of the market, there has been inadequate price pass-through. In addition, with regard to issues such as domestic tariffs in regulated industries such as power utilities, there are measures such as a <b>fuel</b> <b>cost</b> <b>adjustment</b> system, which permits changes in fuel and raw material costs to be passed through automatically after a certain period. However, owing to factors such as the increase in the burden of working capital in the period up to the time at which the costs are passed through, there are calls for the related systems to be revised. Based on monthly public statistics on prices of crude oil and petroleum products and other items in recent years, in this paper I examine industries such as those manufacturing and selling petroleum products and manufacturing industries consuming large amounts of energy. I specifically analyze the extent of pass-through rates and adjustment periods with regard to the increases in costs resulting from the steep increases in crude oil and other prices, {{and the extent to which}} they are absorbed on the supply side by management efforts. As a result of this analysis, I find that the price pass-through rate to petroleum products from the steep rises in crude oil prices in recent years is around 96 %, and that around 4 % - with regard to heavy oils in particular - has been absorbed by management efforts. With regard to manufacturing industries that consume large amounts of energy, I find that in many of them some 60 %- 93 % of the steep rises in energy raw materials are subject to price pass-through, and that the remainder are either absorbed by management efforts or, in cases in which there has been an apparent price pass-through of more than 100 %, they are offset through {{the impact of}} non-cost factors. The non-cost factors include, for example, market structure and disparities in manufacturing technology, including the tightness of the product supply-demand situation and the level of energy-saving technologies. In addition, regarding the prices of petroleum products and the products of manufacturing industries that consume large amounts of energy, I observe that price pass-through begins immediately after rises in prices of energy raw materials, and its impact lasts for 11 - 30 months. These results confirm that at times of sharp rises in prices of energy raw materials, in some cases there is inadequate price pass-through owing to the supply-demand structure in the market, and in other cases there is a long-term impact. In addition, with regard to factors such as the <b>fuel</b> <b>cost</b> <b>adjustment</b> system, which currently permits 100 % price pass-through within three to six months, I consider it necessary to study revisions directed at smoothing their impact with respect to the pass-through rate and adjustment period. ...|$|R

Our study shows that ignoring changes in preference structure frequently leads to the underestimation of the consumer's true {{cost of living}} standards and growth scales in Taiwan. When changes in preference structure are taken into consideration, as was done in studies by Phlips and Sanz-Ferrer [Phlips, Louis, & Sanz-Ferrer, Richard. (1975).

40|$|Historically, {{productivity}} {{advances in}} the public utility sector have been high, substantially mitigating the impact of inflation on operating costs. However, today's high rates of inflation, coupled with regulatory lag, have resulted in profit erosion which impacts adversely on the utility's ability to attract new investor capital.

40|$|The {{geothermal}} user's viewpoint in {{this case}} is somewhat unique. San Diego Gas & Electric Company, by virtue of its activity in geothermal exploration and development since 1972, {{is in a position to}} be considered not only a user of geothermal, but a producer as well through the activities of its wholly-owned subsidiary, New Albion Resources Co. As the Supervisor of Fuel Development of SDG&E and the General Manager of NARCO, I can speak from experience on both sides of the negotiating table. I have given advice from the user's point of view to SDG&E's fuel acquisitions people as they labored to negotiate a contract to buy from a geothermal producer of hot water. As General Manager of NARCO, I am in the position of developing geothermal resources and negotiating contracts to sell some of NARCO's heat to third parties. So much for the introduction [...] How does a utility, such as SDG&E, view risk in today's business climate? The answer to that question is very simple. SDG&E has an allowed rate of return of 10. 59 %. This is based upon 48 % debt, having an imbedded interest cost of 8. 1 %; 14 % preferred stock, at a cost of 8. 2 % and 42 % equity. Out rates are supposed to return 14 - 112 % on this equity. Let me put these numbers in perspective. In early March SDG&E sold $ 50 million of mortgage bonds which bear an interest rate of 16 %. In mid-March we sold 2 - 112 million shares of common stock for $ 11. 50 per share. The current dividend of $ 1. 52 will yield 13. 2 % and those dividends are paid after taxes. When money borrowed to build a project costs more than you can earn on the project, there is no incentive to build that project and certainly no incentive to take any risk associated with the project. How does SDG&E view risks? Simple [...] don't take any risks which can be avoided. Is this attitude likely to change? My forecast is, there is no change in sight. Does this take SDG&E out of contention as a possible market for producers of geothermal energy? Not likely. For all of its risk aversion, SDG&E still remains one of the best potential markets for any energy producer. A recent article in FORBES MAGAZINE found that SDG&E had the third highest price per kilowatt of any utility in the country [...] 5. 9 {cents} per kilowatt hour for commercial customers. That was in March, 1980. Energy <b>cost</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>clause</b> increases resulted in an average commercial price per kilowatt hour of 7. 2 {cents} in May. In July it is expected to climb to 9. 2 {cents}. SDG&E's rate territory continues to expand at the rate of 5 % annually and it is located just over 100 miles from a major source of geothermal heat in the Imperial Valley. But today, SDG&E has no commercial geothermal heat or power purchase contracts with domestic producers. You may ask, ''Why not?'' With no incentive to spend its own money and with a high growth rate, what is SDG&E doing to obtain capacity for its existing and future customers? At the present time, most of SDG&E's capital expenditure for generation is going to the construction of San Onofre Units 2 and 3, a nuclear project which has been under way for ten years and which is expected to start generating commercial power in 1982 and 1983. San Onofre 2 and 3 will add 440 MW of capacity from a reliable, proven generating technology to SDG&E's system...|$|R
