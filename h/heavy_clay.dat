5|$|Wagga Wagga is {{upstream}} from the Riverina plain in the mid-catchment {{range of the}} Murrumbidgee River in an alluvial valley confined by low bedrock hills. Much of Wagga Wagga is on <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> soils in a large drainage basin with a small catchment discharge point. Groundwater therefore cannot leave easily, leading to Wagga Wagga having a problem with waterlogged soil and soil salination. Urban salination in Wagga Wagga is now {{the subject of a}} large multi-pronged approach to prevent further salination and reclaim salt-affected areas.|$|E
5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E
50|$|Soil {{formations}} {{resulting from}} {{the erosion of the}} high mountains in the park primarily consist of tropical ferruginous soils in catenas, hydromorphic soils and vertisols. <b>Heavy</b> <b>clays</b> are the dominant soil type in the park.|$|R

50|$|Hakea denticulata {{occurs on}} Western Australia's {{southern}} coast from Albany to east of Esperance. It reaches the Stirling Range to the north. It is {{found on a}} range of soils from sand to gravel and even a <b>heavier</b> <b>clay</b> loam.|$|R
5|$|Some {{important}} roads {{cross the}} site of the new city. Most important of these is Watling Street from London to Chester. Originally, the Northampton to London road joined the Watling Street at Fenny Stratford, via Broughton and Simpson. The Oxford to Cambridge route came through Stony Stratford, Wolverton and Newport Pagnell. Unfortunately, the <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> soils, poor drainage and many streams made these routes frequently impassable in winter. The Hockliffe to Dunchurch stretch of Watling Street became a (paved) Turnpike in 1706 (the first turnpike to be approved by parliament). Simpson remained a quagmire and in 1870 the new Northampton/London turnpike diverted away at Broughton to take the higher route through Wavendon and Woburn Sands to join Watling Street near Hockliffe. On the east/west route, the Stony Stratford to Newport Pagnell turnpike of 1814 extended the Woodstock, Oxfordshire/Bicester/Stony Stratford turnpike of 1768. Turnpikes provided a major boost to the economy of Fenny Stratford and particularly Stony Stratford. In the stage coach era, Stony Stratford was a major resting place and exchange point with the east/west route. In the early 19th century, over 30 coaches a day stopped here. That traffic came to an abrupt end in 1838 when the Londonâ€“Birmingham Railway (now the West Coast Main Line) opened at nearby Wolverton.|$|E

50|$|Potassium deficiency, {{also known}} as potash deficiency, is a plant {{disorder}} that is most common on light, sandy soils, because potassium ions (K+) are highly soluble and will easily leach from soils without colloids. Potassium deficiency is also common in chalky or peaty soils with a low clay content. It is also found on <b>heavy</b> <b>clays</b> with a poor structure.|$|R
5000|$|The geology of the High Weald {{consists}} {{largely of}} a series of hard standstone strata, underlain by <b>heavy</b> <b>clays,</b> giving rise to a combination which occurs across the Weald of sandstone ridges and clay vales. Combined with faulting and watercourses cutting into the rock sequences, this has led to the smooth rolling uplands, plateaus and ridgelines, strongly incised by deep stream valleys (ghylls).|$|R
50|$|Thus {{subspecies}} spinosa is a 5-10 m shrub or tree found widely across eastern Australia and Tasmania {{from the}} Eyre Peninsula, Flinders Ranges and Kangaroo Island in South Australia to north Queensland. Subspecies lasiophylla has shorter, wider leaves and smaller flowers and only reaches 5 m. It replaces the other subspecies on <b>heavier</b> <b>clay</b> soils in southeastern Australia (eastern South Australia and southern New South Wales).|$|R
25|$|There {{is also a}} small lake, {{known as}} 'The Trap', which is stocked with coarse fish. A German Messerschmitt bomber crashed into the Trap during World War II, shot down by {{anti-aircraft}} fire after going off course following a bombing run over Liverpool.

25|$|Although most of {{the land}} around Mount Magnet has the <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> soil and Acacia aneura (Mulga) scrub common {{throughout}} semi-arid Western Australia, the area on which B.rosserae occurs is unusual in having deep yellow sand and laterite. It occurs there with mallee Eucalyptus species, over open heath of Grevillea, Hakea, Leptospermum, Melaleuca, Cryptandra and Triodia species. Thus the flora is more like that found on the Swan Coastal Plain than the arid zone in which it occurs.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{earliest}} history of Coventry, but prior to its existence there were settlements in nearby Corley and Baginton, which came to be occupied by the Romans, and later by Saxon invaders. These locations were probably chosen because they lay on early trackways, and were situated on light, easily worked soil free from thick forest and undergrowth; unlike the <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> soil, covered in marsh and forest near the north-eastern reaches of the Forest of Arden on which Coventry would rise.|$|E
50|$|Subsurface Textile Irrigation (SSTI) is a {{technology}} {{designed specifically for}} subsurface irrigation in all soil textures from desert sands to <b>heavy</b> <b>clays.</b> Use of SSTI will significantly reduce the usage of water,fertilizer and herbicide. It will lower on-going operational costs and, if maintained properly, will last for decades. By delivering water and nutrients directly to the root zone, plants are healthier and have a far greater yield.|$|R

25|$|Surrey {{had little}} {{political}} or economic significance in the Middle Ages. It was not the main power-base of any important aristocratic family, nor the seat of a bishopric. Its agricultural wealth was limited by the infertility of most of its soils, while urban development, excepting the London suburb of Southwark, was sapped by the overshadowing predominance of London and {{by the lack of}} direct access to the sea. Population pressure in the 12th and 13th centuries initiated the gradual clearing of the Weald, the forest spanning the borders of Surrey, Sussex and Kent, which had hitherto been left undeveloped due to the difficulty of farming on its <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> soil.|$|E
25|$|The fenlands, {{that stretch}} down {{as far as}} Norfolk, are former {{wetlands}} consisting both of peat bogs and tidal silt marshes which were virtually all drained {{by the end of}} the 19th century when Firsby had its longest period of growth. The former peat fens and silt marshes provided a rich loamy soil that was ideal for the growing of cereal and vegetable crops, and gave Lincolnshire its reputation as being the 'bread basket' of England. The resulting flat lands also made an ideal environment for the later mechanisation of farming in the mid-20th century. Firsby has always been an agriculturally based village with a dark and rich loamy soil over a <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> subsoil.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the Hunter Valley {{has more}} soils (mostly hard, acidic patches of poorly {{draining}} <b>heavy</b> <b>clay)</b> that are unsuitable for viticulture {{than they have}} areas that are ideal for growing grapes. The soils of the Lower Hunter vary widely from sandy alluvial flats (often planted to Semillon), to deep friable loam (often planted with Shiraz) and friable red duplex soils. In the Upper Hunter, the rivers and creeks of the region contribute to the areas black, silty loam soils that are often overlaid on top of alkaline clay loam. Among the hills of the Brokenback range are strips of volcanic basalt that are prized by growers for their tendencies to restrict vigor and concentrate mineral flavours in the grapes.|$|E

This technique, used in Iran from ancient times, has never been completely abandoned. The abundance of heavy plastic earth, in conjunction with a tenacious lime mortar, also facilitated the development and use of brick.|$|R

There are four major municipalities in Trinidad: Port of Spain, the capital, San Fernando, Arima and Chaguanas. The main town in Tobago is Scarborough. Trinidad is made up of a variety of soil types, {{the majority}} being fine sands and <b>heavy</b> <b>clays.</b> The alluvial valleys of the Northern Range and the soils of the East-West Corridor are the most fertile.|$|R
25|$|In 1837 the Hippodrome racecourse {{was laid}} out. The racecourse {{ran around the}} hill, and {{bystanders}} were expected to watch from {{the summit of the}} hill. However, the venture was not a success, in part due to a public right of way which traversed the course, and in part due to the <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> of the neighbourhood which caused it to become waterlogged. The Hippodrome closed in 1841, after which development resumed and houses were built on the site. The crescent-shaped roads that circumvent the hill, such as Blenheim Crescent, Elgin Crescent, Stanley Crescent, Cornwall Crescent and Landsdowne Crescent, were built over the circular racecourse tracks. At the summit of hill stands the elegant St John's church, built in 1845 in the early English style, and which formed the centrepiece of the Ladbroke Estate development.|$|E
25|$|The geology of the site, {{a former}} farmer's field on a slight slope, with a <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> soil that {{is subject to}} {{seasonal}} movements when wet, meant that substantial foundations and drainage had to be constructed. The main support for the above ground structures consists of 210 concrete piles extending vertically downwards into the soil, each up to 7 metres deep. These pilings were engineered in June 2009 by a specialist company, Wig-Palen, from Belgium, using a 62-ton machine to drill and compact the required holes. Concrete was then poured into the hollow drill {{to fill the void}} as the drill was extracted, and steel reinforcement cages were then placed into the still-wet concrete. This screw-piling technique ensured that the cemetery foundations were both end-bearing and friction-bearing in nature, increasing the stability of the pilings and the structures they support.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} a wine region will largely dictate whether Chenin blanc is {{produced}} in a predominately sweet or dry manner, while the vineyard soil type will generally influence the overall style of the wine. <b>Heavy</b> <b>clay</b> based soils, paired with the right climate, is favorable {{to the development of}} weighty, botrytized dessert wines that need time to age and mature. Well-drained and less organic, predominately sandy soils tend to produce lighter styles of wine that mature more quickly. Chenin blanc planted in soils with a high silex content will produce wines with distinctive minerally notes, while limestone based soils will encourage wines with sharp acidity. In Vouvray the soil is predominately argilo-calcaire or calcareous clay, which produces rounded wines with both acidity and weight. In areas where schist is plentiful in the soil, Chenin blanc grapes will generally ripen earlier than in vineyards with predominately clay based soils.|$|E
