The content and strategies of the intervention were based on the transtheoretical model (stages of change) and motivational interviewing. The educational calls component of the intervention was evaluated by tracking expenditures, surveying educators who originated the calls, and surveying a sample of the young adult participants. Many of the participants were only reachable via cell phones during evening hours and phone contacts often required several repeated attempts. Educators rated participants ’ receptiveness in nearly equal categories of concise and businesslike (34 %), enthusiastic and engaged (31 %) and hurried and distracted (31 %). Two thirds of the educators rated the use of telephones for education as somewhat practical, 14 % said it was not practical and 19 % gave it a rating of quite or very practical. On average, it cost about $ 6 to complete an <b>educational</b> <b>call.</b> Cost was primarily educator’s time to reach and speak to the learner.

In fact, only 6 % gave the calls a higher rankin...|$|E
