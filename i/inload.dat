50|$|Albert Morris is {{a private}} detective who uses dittos extensively. His dittos are usually {{imprinted}} faithfully; indeed, his dittos have a fidelity rate rarely seen in the novel's world. The book opens with a green ditto being chased across the city by ditto thugs of Beta, a criminal figure engaged in copyright violation by kidnapping desirable dittos and duplicating them. Albert's green makes it to safety, allowing Albert to <b>inload</b> his memories and bust Beta's latest scheme. The next morning, Albert makes three dittos (two grays and a green) and sends them off to do his business. After four hours of sleep, he imprints an ebony to help him work on a case.|$|E
5000|$|The novel {{takes place}} in a future in which people can create clay duplicates (called [...] "dittos" [...] or golems) of themselves. A ditto retains all of the archetype's {{memories}} up until the time of duplication. The duplicate lasts only about a day, and the original person (referred to in the book as an archie, from [...] "archetype", or [...] "rig", from [...] "original") can then choose whether or not to upload the ditto's memories. Most dittos want to <b>inload,</b> so that their experience will be continuous with that of their archie. Most people use dittos to do their work, as they are affordable even for the poor. Many also use dittos to experience pleasure which could hurt a real person. Dittos come in many colors, which signify their quality and intended role. A cheap ditto suitable for housework is green, whereas a quality one for business is gray. Ebonies are highly specialized dittos that are good at intelligent data analysis; platinums are only used by the very rich, and closely resemble real people. Ivory dittos specialize in the reception of pleasure and sexual fulfillment. Other colors of ditto (such as purple, red, and yellow) exist, but are rarely mentioned in the novel.|$|E

The existing systems use dozers to regulate how much coal is in the bin and is not an exact science. Weighers are also used but are generally unreliable and not designed for the specic purpose of conveyor speed control to maintain levels within the loadout bins. The project aim is to investigate the practicality and possibility of using control tech-niques based on instrumentation to automate a train loadout facility. Determine the requirements for automating a train loadout Determine what coal is made of Research appropriate head unit for conveyor control Conceptual design A number of units were tested and looked at for various locations around the train loadout facility. A minor setback {{for the development of a}} working model is that the weight of coal depends on the amount of moisture that the coal retains. This can be overcome if an inline moisture analyzer is installed. Sampling of the coal will need to continue to determine the ash content of the coal being loaded. This project has shown that the LMS- 111 laser is the stand out device as it is simple,inexpensive and can be used in a range of locations for various applications. Due to the LMS- 111 's unique features the device can be utilized in a number of various locations around the train loadout facility. A project package for the installation of the LMS- 111 has been developed and plans are currently underway to test and commission the device on an <b>inloading</b> conveyor at Dalrymple Bay coal terminal, located 30 km south of Macka...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 This thesis {{asserts that}} faculty are the {{critical}} resource for {{the integration of}} distance education by postsecondary institutions. The major barriers to the participation and adoption of distance education center around faculty. This manuscript thesis incorporates {{a series of articles}} to develop applied frameworks and strategies that place faculty {{at the core of the}} institutional adoption process. An advocacy approach that integrates organizational culture and diffusion of innovation theories provides a conceptual framework for addressing the complex issues inducing faculty resistance to distance teaching. What issues impact faculty receptivity to distance teaching? At the institutional level, altered faculty roles for distance teaching, academic quality, <b>inload</b> vs overload teaching assignments, promotion and tenure, quality of instructional and student support services, and traditionally embedded academic norms affect faculty receptivity to distance teaching. Moreover, this thesis asserts that institutional and interinstitutional extended degree programs utilizing telecommunications must resolve issues related to curricular approval, accreditation, program prioritization, academic residency, fee structures, and articulation. Integrated instructional delivery frameworks are presented that fuse traditional instructional systems with new learning systems. These frameworks advocate the gradual integration of telecommunications-based coursework in extended degree programs to promote greater faculty participation, expand curricular offerings for students, and balance the introduction of new learning systems with traditional campus-based systems. A faculty support model for integrating distance education in postsecondary institutions delineates the key organizations and professionals essential to faculty and institutional adoption. This model asserts that the centrality of faculty to distance teaching adoption requires mutual support from presidents, deans, departmental chairpersons, the faculty senate, media services, and continuing education. In conclusion, distance education compels postsecondary institutions to reduce existing barriers to faculty participation by compensating, rewarding and training faculty at levels commensurate with traditional instructional activities and to provide instructional and administrative support services designed to ensure student access to high quality programs. Without well trained and equitably rewarded distance teaching faculty, the potential of distance education will be seriously diminished. Within the mainstream academic culture, failure to ameliorate these human resource needs reduces faculty receptivity to, and participation in, postsecondary distance teaching. Institutions that satisfy these needs will simultaneously create a balanced equilibrium between the application of advanced technologies and human resource development necessary for ensuring instructional quality and student access to extended educational programs delivered via distance education...|$|E
5000|$|On 19 February 1863, Thomas Reid {{commissioned}} the Surveyor General {{to assess the}} island. The following is the transcribed handwritten report (original documents in the gallery {{at the bottom of}} the page)Sir, I request you ___before you (mark?) off for sale Garden or Smooth Island in Norfolk Bay, carefully noting the capability of the island for grazing or agricultural purposes, the existence of guano or otherwise, the loading place - and such other information as may be. W Hogan Esq19/2/1863Sir, in accordance with your instruction, I proceeded to effect the survey of Garden Isl'd and the diagram of which with the following remarks I beg to submit.The Island embraces a total area of 146 acres and is lightly (timbered?) with a description of ___ gums and ___ ___. Part the latter timber has been partly (well) cleared off where it had (been?) close to the water side and available for shipment, however for years to come there would be plenty of limber left to ___ the ordinary want of a (shelter/settler/fellow?). About 40 acres could be brought into cultivation and which a ___ ___ consists of a rich ___ sandy soil that with judicious management (would?) grow some splendid cropsTwenty acres of this proportion would require little or no clearing, the remaining portion of the island when burned off and cleared of firm and cutting grass roots would make for gazing land - I may have observe that there is no grass on the island, having over run with (firm? vs thorny) thistles.There is a large quantity of wild rabbits in it.With reference to water supply, you will observe by the diagram that a spring or well is (shown?) on the west coastline, and which is about 4 feet above the ordinary high water mark - it has apparently been roughly dug out to a depth of about feet - (and?) is at present slightly (running?) over. The water is quite free from any brackish taste. In fact it is good water. I should ___ be (inclined?) to doubt its capacity to supply a steady moderate demand for homestead cattle ___ but I think a good well could be (put?) a little farther ...... inland. With reference to the facilities for landing, I may state that they are almost exclusively confined to the Eastern shore of the island, except in fair or moderate weather where the island is accessible at any point. Then (bring?) (cold?) water along the W, S, + N. coast line. There are along the E. line of coast thus four places which have been partially made for the reception of boats, probably where bay whaling was carried (?out) to some extent, the positions of which I have noted on the diagram. I may in general terms state that the island would (offer/afford) shelter for the ordinary ___ crafts in any weather. T prevailing formation is ???stone and which at the N.W. portion of the island appears to possess but a small percentage of (?? guan"?) approaching much in appearance a description of blue.....(marble?) - as regards the existence of guano to which my attention was directed, I must confess that I have failed to find any satisfactory traces of it though there would appear to have been an idea ___ out that it might be found from the excavating which have been made to (discern/discover) it and which are at the ___ end of the island. The soil and loose ___ there have been (worked?) through to the extent of about 3 feet without success + which (arrives/arises) at the solid (rock/south). As far as it have (seen?) there is nothing to lead me to think that a bed exists on the island. In reference to the value of the island I think it is well worth £2 per acre, but would feel inclined to suggest that it might be let by tender as I believe there would be little or no opposition if... offered for sale now - but I believe there would be from completion to lease. I (have?) not ___ any reservation round the island as it would considerably reduce the area (per/for/nor?) do I see any actual (necc????y) for it. ... useful to (<b>inloading???)</b> purchasers or serviceable to this office in (appraising/affirming) an upset price.
