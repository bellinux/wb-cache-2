40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an economic}} model {{to compare the}} profitability of two strategies for the pricing of packaged software: fixed-fee and pay-per-use licensing. It is assumed that the market consists of a monopoly software vendor who is selling packaged software to Customers who are homogeneous in marginal value of software use but heterogeneous in level of use. In addition to obtaining the software package from the market, customers can develop the required software in-house. When <b>in-house</b> development <b>costs</b> are constant across customers, {{the results show that}} the software vendor prefers pay-per-use licensing over fixed-fee licensing if in-house development is relatively expensive, whereas fixed-fee licensing is optimal if the <b>cost</b> of <b>in-house</b> development drops below a certain threshold value. When the assumption of a constant <b>in-house</b> development <b>cost</b> is relaxed by letting it vary among customers, it still holds that pay-per-use licensing is optimal if its average is relatively large. For low and medium values of the average <b>cost</b> of <b>in-house</b> development, however, fixed-fee licensing may no longer be optimal as the relative attractiveness of the two licensing strategies now depends on flow dispersed the <b>in-house</b> development <b>costs</b> of individual Customers are.

Even functions once labeled inherently governmental are now being evaluated for outsourcing in the quest to reduce spending. One such function is the Helicopter Combat Support (HC) Mission aboard Military Sealift Command (MSC) ships. This thesis evaluates service contract cost escalation rates and compares them to <b>in-house</b> <b>cost</b> escalation rates.

40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) Federal Government {{agencies}} convert in-house {{positions to}} contractor positions via the A- 76 process {{in order to}} save money. During an A- 76 conversion, stable future labor cost growth is assumed. This assumption is faulty in cases wherein the contractor workforce subsequently unionizes. Unionization may lead to unanticipated increases in cost, threatening the savings projected during the A- 76 process. This study seeks to: 1) compare the rate of labor-cost growth for military, civilian, and contract employees and 2) compare current labor costs for a sample outsourced activity (fuels) to labor costs for the military requirement based on manpower standards. The study finds that overall, annual collective bargaining agreement (CBA) wages increases were typically 1 - 2 % higher than Service Contract Act (SCA) wages increases. However, we found no evidence that contractors performed functions in our sample functional area at a higher cost than in-house. The actual cost of contractors averaged ~ 40 % less than the cost derived from the military manpower standard. The actual <b>in-house</b> <b>cost</b> averaged over 20 % higher than the cost derived from the manpower standard.

40|$|Recently the Department of Defense and the Navy {{have sought}} new avenues for {{achieving}} {{the national security}} of the United States {{within the scope of}} available resources. In an attempt to meet savings objectives, the Navy has looked toward outsourcing the Helicopter Combat Support (HC) mission aboard Military Sealift Command (MSC) ships. After several evaluations with civilian helicopter companies, the Navy awarded Geo-Seis Helicopters, Inc. a three-year contract for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore logistics services. This thesis evaluates the current outsource contract and compares costs of the contract to those of the HC community. The purpose was to determine the level of savings and the differences in services provided. Within the course of this study, the total <b>in-house</b> <b>cost</b> was established for the HC squadrons flying the H- 46 aircraft. This cost was then fractured down to equal the services provided by the contractor to determine the Most Efficient Organization. This thesis determined that the current outsource contract does provide a small savings but at the costs of increased risk in not meeting surge requirements for unplanned contingencies. Furthermore, inherent risks are associated with the inability to not fill personnel billets within other areas of the Navy through reduced manning levels due to outsourcing. U. S. Navy (U. S.

30|$|The {{interventions}} under DBRHC {{and related}} cost information indicate that if scaled {{up by the}} Government, it has scope of further cost containment through cost adjustment; {{particularly with respect to}} BCC material inputs (material development and printing)—because the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has its own well-equipped BCC unit/Health Education Bureau and printing unit under its Directorate General of Health Services and Directorate General of Family Planning that could produce similar materials at lower cost. In addition to its in-house arrangement; the MoHFW has collaborative linkage with the Department of Mass Communication for BCC campaign under the Ministry of Information and the Bangladesh Government Press (BG press) for printing, publication and stationery support. Other capital investments made by the model (basic training, workshop, facility renovation), have been in place {{for quite a long time}} in MOHFW service delivery system but are not effectively meeting the needs of quality improvement of RH services. The DBRHC model has put forward evidence-based information for required low-cost modifications of the system. It is understandable that cost adjustment in basic and refresher training is possible through engaging the Technical Training Unit (TTU) of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and National Institute of Population Research and Training (NIPORT). For construction and renovation of health facilities the MOHFW has its own Health Engineering Department that can undertake suggested renovations. The MOHFW has already invested in maternal voucher scheme—where the model has suggested low-cost modified approach only. The expenses incurred for local travel by intervention staff and participants would be much lesser for MOHFW staff as they do not need to test the interventions at the field level. Given the above-mentioned resource mobilization using existing intra and interdepartmental functionaries for integrating the DBRHC model, the government sector has adequate scope to replicate the model through cost adjustment and perhaps at a lesser cost than estimated here. Similarly, NGOs working in reproductive health and family planning in Bangladesh have their own low-cost BCC material production arrangement, training/orientation units and funds for physical maintenance which can cope with the estimated cost of the DBRHC model through <b>in-house</b> <b>cost</b> adjustment.|$|E

40|$|Many {{enterprises}} {{are currently}} exploring {{the possibility of}} migrating {{some or all of}} their IT functionalities to public clouds with the objective of reducing their overall IT service costs or to open new business frontiers. Unfortunately, making such a decision is not a straightforward task; it requires a vigorous evaluation of the various benefits, risks and costs associated with the migration of their diverse business processes that comprise of their current IT services. Yet, this problem has received very little attention in the literature, mainly due to its interdisciplinary nature. This thesis aims at filling this gap by aiding the enterprises during the phase of making their cloud migration decision. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, a novel cloud-migration framework is introduced to guide the enterprises through a sequence of well-defined recommended analysis steps. These steps culminate with the formulation of the migration decision problem as a mathematical optimization one. The second contribution is a decision engine that efficiently solves this optimization problem. More precisely, the proposed framework gradually guides the enterprise to first identify the various business processes that are related to their IT services and then to determine the relationship and the communication needed among those processes. The identified inter-process communication represents an indicator of how tightly coupled these business processes are to each other. When outsourcing business processes, tightly coupled processes add a high communication cost and may introduce service latency if they are not co-located. As such, inter-process communication becomes an important input parameter that affects the migration decision. Enterprises can then determine to partially or completely migrate IT services to clouds. Furthermore, multiple vendors can be used for different services. However, when different vendors are involved, the communication cost between different processes increases. The objective is to maximize profit for an organization which includes lowering IT expenses in the long term without compromising data integrity or security. An optimization formula is finally constructed to help the enterprise determine which services to migrate given input parameters of {{the cost of doing business}} <b>in-house,</b> <b>cost</b> of outsourcing, and communication costs. Finally, a case study is utilized to demonstrate the performance of the proposed work by analyzing the process of migrating the services to clouds for an IPTV service provider. More specifically, the case study focuses on the content delivery network (CDN) within the IPTV provider’s infrastructure which is responsible for delivering contents to viewers. The CDN network can use the proposed profit-optimization formula to determine whether to utilize a cloud service or to use its internal resource to deliver the content. A performance evaluation from a simulation is presented to demonstrate the proposed profit-optimization formula can return a set of optimal mix of both internal and external services to maximize profits...|$|E

Worldwide IT outsourcing is currently valued at 991 billion dollars per annum (Gartner 2012). The significant {{growth in the}} outsourcing business is attributed to its role in cost savings and strategic risk reduction allowing enterprises to focus on their core competencies. In spite {{of the volume of}} IT outsourcing, industry reports suggest that over fifty percent of the IT outsourcing contracts are renegotiated or cancelled. According to these reports while vendor's lack flexibly and provide poor customer service, client's hidden costs in outsourcing contracts lead to contract failure. Further, there exists natural tension in an outsourcing relationship as clients seek a service at lower than the <b>in-house</b> <b>cost</b> and the vendors wants to maximize their profits. Given this natural tension between the client and the vendor, the IT outsourcing vendor must be selected carefully and the outsourcing contract must be designed assiduously. Chapter two of the thesis acknowledges the presence of information asymmetry in IT outsourcing markets and posits insight on the question: "How to choose IT outsourcing vendor in presence of information asymmetry between clients and vendors?" Clients have uncertainty about vendors' capabilities and vendors' have uncertainty about client's requirements. This makes the selection of vendors and contracting for IT outsourcing projects especially challenging. In this chapter we answer this question and present evidence that third party advisors, with their knowledge of client requirements and the vendor capabilities, mitigate the information asymmetry in the IT outsourcing market and improve contract outcomes. Chapter three of the thesis acknowledges that as the size of outsourced IT projects increases, it is likely that one IT vendor does not possess the economy of scale and specialization in all components of the outsourced project. Thus, as outsourced IT projects become larger, clients may involve multiple vendors in a project. This chapter posits insight on the question: "How many vendors should be involved in an IT outsourcing contract?" In other words, which form of outsourcing clients should choose: (i) Single-Sourcing, where the client outsources to one primary vendor, (ii) Single-Sourcing with subcontracting, where the primary vendor involves other/secondary vendors in the project, or (iii) Multi-Sourcing, where the client outsources to multiple primary vendors. While chapters two and three focuses on studying IT outsourcing {{from the point of view}} of clients, Chapter four aims at understanding outsourcing from vendor's point of view. This chapter posits insight on the question "What capabilities should vendor develop in order to get selected for IT outsourcing contracts?" It examines how the diversity in the type of projects executed by vendors helps them to develop their capabilities and grow their business...|$|E

40|$|In {{deciding}} on whether {{and when to}} outsource component production, firms should consider the trade-off between total production costs {{and the ability to}} horizontally differentiate products. We study the outsourcing decision in a duopoly under decreasing but uncertain market rates for components, given that outsourcing increases the substitutability of the final products. We find that {{there is at least one}} firm that eventually outsources component production because it cannot differentiate its product enough by in-house production to justify the (eventually) higher costs. The follower outsources at a lower market rate or may even remain vertically integrated. The follower thus incurs the (eventually) much higher <b>in-house</b> component <b>costs</b> longer, while the low substitutability is enjoyed by both firms. Under endogenous roles, firms thus engage in a preemption game to be the first to outsource.

40|$|Virtualization of {{processing}} power, storage, and networking applications via cloud-computing allows Smart Buildings to operate heavy demand computing resources off-premises. While this approach reduces <b>in-house</b> <b>costs</b> and energy use, recent case-studies have highlighted complexities in decision-making processes associated with implementing {{the concept of}} cloud-computing. This complexity {{is due to the}} rapid evolution of these technologies without standardization of approach by those organizations offering cloud-computing provision as a commercial concern. This study defines the term Smart Building as an ICT environment where a degree of system integration is accomplished. Non-expert managers are highlighted as key users of the outcomes from this project given the diverse nature of Smart Buildings’ operational objectives. This research evaluates different ICT management methods to effectively support decisions made by non-expert clients to deploy different models of cloud-computing services in their Smart Buildings ICT environments. The objective {{of this study is to}} reduce the need for costly 3 rd party ICT consultancy providers, so non-experts can focus more on their Smart Buildings’ core competencies rather than the complex, expensive, and energy consuming processes of ICT management. The gap identified by this research represents vulnerability for non-expert managers to make effective decisions regarding cloud-computing cost estimation, deployment assessment, associated power consumption, and management flexibility in their Smart Buildings ICT environments. The project analyses cloud-computing decision-making concepts with reference to different Smart Building ICT attributes. In particular, it focuses on a structured programme of data collection which is achieved through semi-structured interviews, cost simulations and risk-analysis surveys. The main output is a theoretical management framework for non-expert decision-makers across variously-operated Smart Buildings. Furthermore, a decision-support tool is designed to enable non-expert managers to identify the extent of virtualization potential by evaluating different implementation options. This is presented to correlate with contract limitations, security challenges, system integration levels, sustainability, and long-term costs. These requirements are explored in contrast to cloud demand changes observed across specified periods. Dependencies were identified to greatly vary depending on numerous organizational aspects such as performance, size, and workload. The study argues that constructing long-term, sustainable, and cost-efficient strategies for any cloud deployment, depends on the thorough identification of required services off and on-premises. It points out that most of today’s heavy-burdened Smart Buildings are outsourcing these services to costly independent suppliers, which causes unnecessary management complexities, additional cost, and system incompatibility. The main conclusions argue that cloud-computing cost can differ depending on the Smart Building attributes and ICT requirements, and although in most cases cloud services are more convenient and cost effective at the early stages of the deployment and migration process, it can become costly in the future if not planned carefully using cost estimation service patterns. The results of the study can be exploited to enhance core competencies within Smart Buildings in order to maximize growth and attract new business opportunities...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium alloys {{are a key}} {{series of}} {{metallic}} materials used in aerospace engineering. Life cycle of aluminium consists {{of a series of}} independent product processes including, for example, bauxite mining, bauxite refining, smelting, casting, forming, performing, and disposal. In order to understand the life cycle cost of aluminium, an <b>in-house</b> module for <b>costing</b> of life cycle in material processes has been developed. The object oriented costing approach is suggested and adopted. Based on survey data and engineering analysis of the processing, cost estimating relationships are established. Through the module, costs for various processes of aluminium production can be estimated. Example results show that the module could be a useful tool for costing life cycle of aluminium, or for estimating costs for an aluminium component with an individual process.

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} a {{state-of-the-art}} review of the scope and practical implications of the Building Information Modelling (BIM) platform in the UK construction practice. Theoretical developments suggest that BIM is an integration of both product and process innovation, not just a disparate set of software tools. BIM provides effective collaboration, visual representation and data management, which enable the smooth flow of information throughout the project’s lifecycle. The most frequently reported benefits are related to Capital Cost (capex) and Operational costs (opex) and time savings. Key challenges, however, focus on the interoperability of software, capital installation <b>costs,</b> <b>in-house</b> experience, client preference and cultural issues within design teams and within the organisation. The paper concludes with a critical commentary on the changing roles and a process required to implement BIM in UK construction projects, and suggests areas for further research...|$|R
25|$|Part of the Commodore 64's {{success was}} its sale in regular retail stores instead of only {{electronics}} or computer hobbyist specialty stores. Commodore produced {{many of its}} parts <b>in-house</b> to control <b>costs,</b> including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology. It {{has been compared to}} the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production. Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles have been made for the Commodore64 including development tools, office productivity applications, and video games. C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, or a compatible video game console, to run these programs today. The C64 is also credited with popularizing the computer demoscene and is still used today by some computer hobbyists. In 2011, 17 years after it was taken off the market, research showed that brand recognition for the model was still at 87%.|$|R
40|$|Software can be {{distributed}} closed source (proprietary) or open source (developed collaboratively). While a firm cannot sell {{open source software}}, and so loses potential sales revenue, the open source software development process can have a substantial {{positive impact on the}} quality of a software, its diffusion, and, consequently, the demand for a complementary product from which the firm does profit. Previous papers have considered the firm's option to release software under a closed or open source license as a simple once and for all binary choice. We extend this research by allowing for the possibility of keeping software proprietary for some optimally determined finite time period before making it open source. Furthermore, we study the impact of switching costs. We show that in case of high <b>in-house</b> R&D <b>costs,</b> the firm always makes the software open source at some point (unless switching itself is too expensive). The timing, however, depends on the initial software quality. On the other hand, when R&D is inexpensive, the firm opens the source code only when the initial level of software quality is low. For intermediate R&D costs, the firm might have the choice between opening the code immediately, opening it at some subsequent and optimally determined time, or keeping it closed forever. Finally we find that whereas high switching costs might prevent firms from adopting an open source business model, low switching costs mainly affect the timing of the opening of the source code...|$|R
