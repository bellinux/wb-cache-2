5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process of}} learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddlers,</b> but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddlers.</b> Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships {{that may lead}} to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and {{there is a lack of}} clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddlers</b> brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E

5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddlers.</b> In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

The rash is rarely itchy for children, but can be extremely itchy for adults. Painful facial ulcers, blisters, or lesions may also develop in or around the nose or mouth. HFMD usually resolves on its own after 7–10 days. Most cases of the disease are relatively harmless, but complications including encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis that mimics the neurological symptoms of polio can occur.|$|E
25|$|Kindergartens (幼稚園 yōchien), {{predominantly}} {{staffed by}} young female junior college graduates, are supervised by the Ministry of Education, {{but are not}} part of the official education system. The 58% of kindergartens that are private accounted for 77% of all children enrolled. In addition to kindergartens, there exists a well-developed system of government-supervised day-care centers (保育園 hoikuen), supervised by the Ministry of Labor. Whereas kindergartens follow educational aims, preschools are predominantly concerned with providing care for <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddlers.</b> Just as there are public and private kindergartens, there are both public and privately run preschools. Together, these two kinds of institutions enroll well over 90 percent of all preschool-age children prior to their entrance into the formal system at first grade. The Ministry of Education's 1990 Course of Study for Preschools, which applies to both kinds of institutions, covers such areas as human relationships, health, environment, language, and expression. Starting from March 2008 the new revision of curriculum guidelines for kindergartens as well as for preschools came into effect.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} {{separation}} from the female caregiver has profound effects is one with considerable resonance outside the conventional study of child development.

40|$|Despite trends {{indicating}} that low-income, Latino families underuse licensed child care (Chaudry et al., 2011; Howes et al., 2007), questions remain about why these mothers {{do not use}} <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddler</b> child care programs. Therefore, this mixed methods case study of a Los Angeles community illustrates the interplay of licensed child care availability with maternal preferences regarding <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddler</b> care arrangements. Community demographic data as well as availability and quality of licensed child care data provided the descriptive community context. Family survey data depicted trends in child care use of a predominantly low-income sample of 556 mothers living in the community. Lastly, semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} a subsample of 28 family survey mothers to shed light on mothers' beliefs about <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddler</b> child care. Taken together, these sources of data indicated that limited <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddler</b> licensed care was available, and few programs served specifically low-income families. Within this community child care context, mothers had a limited awareness of the available licensed care. Additionally, these mothers expressed negative impressions of licensed care, which seemed warranted based on the observational data on programs serving low-income families. From this study, policymakers should strive {{to improve the quality of}} care for all <b>infant</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddler</b> programs while also better designing and marketing child care assistance programs to meet the needs of low-income families. Practitioners can utilize these findings by learning about the concerns of low-income mothers, addressing any shortcomings their programs face, and better communicating with new mothers to allay fears about group care...|$|R

500|$|Physical context {{involves}} {{the presence of}} an object or action that is also the topic of conversation. With the use of physical context, the child is exposed to both the words and a visual reference of the word. This is frequently used with <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddlers,</b> but can be very beneficial for school-age children, especially when learning rare or infrequently used words. Physical context may include props such as in toy play. When engaging in play with an adult, a child's vocabulary is developed through discussion of the toys, such as naming the object (e.g. [...] "dinosaur") or labeling it {{with the use of a}} rare word (e.g., stegosaurus). These sorts of interactions expose the child to words they may not otherwise encounter in day-to-day conversation.|$|E
500|$|Oobi was {{instrumental}} in growing the Noggin network's viewership. From 2003 to 2004, full-length episodes of the show (along with premieres of Miffy and Friends and Connie the Cow) were responsible for increasing Noggin's average daily viewers to 93,000 children in its key demographic of <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddlers</b> (a 55 percent increase over its ratings the year before). The average number of viewers aged 2–5 watching Oobi increased by 43 percent {{during the same time}} period. The steady increase in ratings received coverage from Multichannel News author Mike Reynolds, who attributed Noggin's popularity to its [...] "breakout original series Oobi." [...] Its growing audience led Noggin to order a second set of full-length episodes. The premiere of the [...] "Uma Preschool!" [...] episode on September 6, 2004, posted a 2.35 Nielsen rating among the preschool age group, becoming the highest-rated premiere of a Noggin original series to that date.|$|E
500|$|Deprived {{of foreign}} assistance, the rebels were quickly routed by the Ottomans, whose units were manned {{primarily}} by Albanians and Bosnian Muslims. In early October, Karađorđe {{fled to the}} Austrian Empire. He was joined by around 100,000 other Serbs fleeing the Ottoman advance, including 50,000 from Belgrade and its environs alone. Belgrade fell later that month. The city's fall {{marked the end of}} the First Serbian Uprising. The Ottomans singled out men and boys over the age of 15 for execution, and sold women and children into slavery. Torture was used extensively and executions were particularly brutal. [...] "Men were roasted alive, hanged by their feet over smoking straw until they asphyxiated, castrated, crushed with stones, and bastinadoed," [...] one eyewitness wrote. [...] "Their women and children were raped and sometimes taken by force to harems. Outside Stambul Gate in Belgrade, there were always on view the corpses of impaled Serbs being gnawed by packs of dogs." [...] Another account relays how <b>infants</b> <b>and</b> <b>toddlers</b> were boiled alive. In one day alone, 1,800 Serbian women and children were sold into slavery at a Belgrade market. Churches throughout the city were destroyed and mosques that had been converted into churches following the city's capture in 1806 were returned to their original use. Others were deliberately torched by the Ottomans for the purpose of inflicting suffering on the city's inhabitants. In one instance, several dozen Serb refugees seeking shelter in a mosque were burned alive inside.|$|E
