5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as <b>heirlooms</b> owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E
5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family <b>heirlooms.</b> Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
5|$|In 1714, {{with the}} {{accession}} of George I, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Hanover both {{came to be}} ruled in personal union by the House of Hanover. Early Hanoverian monarchs were careful to keep the <b>heirlooms</b> of the two realms separate. George III gave half the British <b>heirlooms</b> to his bride, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, as a wedding present. In her will, Charlotte left the jewels to the 'House of Hanover'. The Kingdom of Hanover followed the Salic Law, whereby the line of succession went through male heirs. Thus, when Queen Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom, her uncle Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale became King of Hanover. King Ernest demanded {{a portion of the}} jewellery, not only as the monarch of Hanover but also as the son of Queen Charlotte. Victoria flatly declined to hand over any of the jewels, claiming they had been bought with British money. Ernest's son, George V of Hanover, continued to press the claim. Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, suggested that she make a financial settlement with the Hanoverian monarch to keep the jewels, but Parliament informed the Queen they would neither purchase the jewels nor loan funds for the purpose. A parliamentary commission was set up to investigate the matter and in 1857 they found in favour of the House of Hanover. On 28 January 1858, 10 years after Ernest's death, the jewels were handed to the Hanoverian Ambassador, Count Kielmansegg. Victoria did manage to hang on to one of her favourite pieces of jewellery: a fine rope of pearls.|$|E

5|$|The {{businessman}} and politician William Smith was appointed Lord Warden in 1891, but died in Walmer Castle {{during his first}} visit here in October of that year. Smith had proposed that the historical artefacts in the castle should be protected from being removed by later Lord Wardens and suggested that government pass an Indenture of <b>Heirlooms</b> Bill. The government carried out the plan after Smith's death, protecting almost 70 pieces of furniture and 50 artworks at the castle and forbidding them being moved from the castle without the Secretary of State for War's approval. Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, became the next Lord Warden; with adequate legal protection now in place, the 3rd Duke of Wellington suggested returning his grandfather's possessions to the castle, but Lady Salisbury declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} of the Order of Canada states that the insignia remain property of the Crown, and requires {{any member of the}} order to return to the chancellery their original emblem should they be upgraded within the order to a higher rank. Thus, while badges may be passed down as family <b>heirlooms,</b> or loaned or donated for display in museums, they cannot be sold by any individual other than the monarch with the proper advice and consent of her ministers. Over the decades, however, a number of Order of Canada insignia have been put up for sale, the first being the Companion's badge of Major Coldwell, who was appointed in 1967; his badge was sold at auction in 1981, an act that received criticism from government officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag was}} {{examined}} in the early 20th century by A.J.B. Wace of the Victoria and Albert Museum, who concluded that the silk was woven in either Syria or Rhodes, and the darns {{were made in the}} Near East. It was his opinion that the flag, in its original state, would have been quite precious, possibly a relic like the shirt of a saint. The belief {{at the time of this}} examination was the MacLeods were descended from Harald Hardrada, who spent some time in Constantinople in the 11th century. In line with this belief, it was suggested that the flag may have passed from Harald Hardrada down to the eponymous ancestor of the clan—Leod. The MacLeod Estate Office (Dunvegan Castle) website claims that experts have dated the flag to the 4th and 7th centuries—hundreds of years before the Crusades. The flag is currently held in Dunvegan Castle, along with other notable <b>heirlooms</b> such as the Dunvegan Cup and Sir Rory Mor's Horn.|$|E
50|$|Another way of {{defining}} <b>heirloom</b> cultivars {{is to use}} the definition of the word <b>heirloom</b> in its truest sense.

40|$|<b>Heirloom</b> jewelry pieces perform {{important}} {{functions in}} family networks. Jewelry’s durability allows {{the potential to}} frequently outlive its original owner, gain sentimental value over successive generations, and influence relationships. Through the frame of Actor-Network-Theory and using a case study methodology, this study analyzed three participants’ <b>heirloom</b> rings functions in conjunction with their oral accounts of family history. Rings were chosen as a specific format of <b>heirloom</b> jewelry in order to limit {{the scope of the}} research, and because of their generalized usage. Interviews concentrated on the history of their <b>heirloom</b> ring’s origins, the participant’s view on ownership of a family <b>heirloom,</b> and other relevant family history. This research sought to unite material context and historical context in order to examine the importance of objects in social interactions. Specifically, the research investigated the roles <b>heirloom</b> jewelry enacts in family narratives and interactions. The research found that <b>heirloom</b> jewelry, even as an inanimate object, can exert social influence through the mediation and moderation of family relationships. Furthermore, the research showed that <b>heirloom</b> enacts identity and culture, and is a valuable medium to facilitate both art and social history education...|$|R
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family <b>heirlooms,</b> and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E

40|$|A {{cultivar}} trial, including {{commercial and}} <b>heirloom</b> cultivars of major cereals and grain legumes {{was conducted in}} Vancouver, BC, under low input organic conditions. We assessed 19 wheat (6 commercial and 13 <b>heirloom),</b> 17 barley (8 commercial and 9 <b>heirloom),</b> 5 pea, 5 favabean, 5 kidneybean, 2 lentil, and 2 soyabean cultivars for plant performance metrics, and their potential in a small grain:legume intercropping system. <b>Heirloom</b> wheat cultivars showed notable response {{in a number of}} parameters including late maturity, taller plants, greatest number of spikes per m 2, longest spike, highest number of seed per spike, greater seed weight to volume ratio, and resistance to stripe rust compared with commercial cultivars. For the heirloom-type, 6 of 14 wheat cultivars, (i. e., “Reward”, “Glenn”, “Cerebs”, “Red Bobs”, “Sounders” and “Black Bearded”) produced yields comparable to the commercial cultivars (i. e., nearly 5 t/h or higher). Also, <b>heirloom</b> cultivars typically contained higher protein levels most suitable for baking and blending purposes with “Einkorn” displaying the highest level (16. 2 %). <b>Heirloom</b> and commercial barley cultivars did not differ significantly with respect to plant height, spike length, and seed weight to volume ratio. However, a number of <b>heirloom</b> cultivars (e. g., “Jet”, “Dolma”, “Andie” and “Himalayan”) displayed greater responses on earliness, number of spikes per m 2, grain yield, protein content and seed weight to volume ratio. Pea and lentil yielded lower than the national average under trial conditions. However, <b>heirloom</b> peas “Corgi”, “De Grace”, “Snowbird”, and “Golden” were earlier compared to the commercial cultivar “Reward”. All kidney bean cultivars yielded ~ 3 t/h with the highest yield from “Red Kidney” (3. 8 t/h). Fava and soyabean appeared as promising crops as the cultivars produced good growth and yields. Neither lentil (“Crimson” and “Essex”) produced satisfactory responses though they had excellent vegetative growth and flowered. Therefore, significant variation was observed including several <b>heirloom</b> cultivars displayed great potential in terms of yield, protein content, and disease resistance and that specific cultivars were better suited for an intercropping system...|$|R
