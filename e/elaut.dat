5000|$|The Wizard of Oz is an arcade pusher game {{based on}} the 1939 film that awards token chips and cards that are redeemable for prizes. The player shoots coins into the machine which drops chips and cards. The player {{collects}} the cards and chips that can be redeemed later for prizes. The coins are retained by the machine. Most arcades that have this game will award a jackpot for collecting the entire series of cards. It can be played by up the six players. The game is developed by <b>Elaut</b> Belgium and released {{in the fall of}} 2010. [...] According to the company's press release, the game was very well received by players and amusement centers.|$|E
40|$|Bouckaert, <b>Elaut</b> and Heymans (1) have {{reported}} increased carotid sinus excitability in dogs with hypertension {{produced by the}} method of renal ischemia (2). Their tests for sinus excitability were made on hypertensive dogs under anesthesia with chlor*alosane, and they found that "the usual reflex responses of vaso-constriction and elevation of blood pressure, concurrent. with the lowering of endovascular pressure in the carotid sinuses, were much more marked in the dogs with hypertension. " Their conclusion was that chronic hypertension due to renal ischemia is associated with increased reflex excitability of the vasoconstrictor mechanisms, and that the hyperexcitability {{may be due to}} either central or peripheral nervous or humoral phenomena. Recently Verney and Vogt (3) tried to determine whether increased sensitivity to variations in pressure within the carotid sinus appears in dogs that are hypertensive due to renal ischemia. They thought, quite correctly, that increased sensitivity would vitiate readings of blood pressure from the van Leersum carotid loop, if the ipsolateral carotid sinus were not denervated. They found, however, that the range of responses in any one dog were much the same before and after the development of hypertension. Their metho...|$|E
40|$|Introduction.   There {{has been}} little {{research}} published {{on the impact of}} intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) methods on sexual functioning. Aims.   This study aimed: (i) to assess different aspects of sexual functioning, including the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women using a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS); (ii) to compare this prevalence with that among copper-releasing intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) users; and (iii) to identify the relationship between psychological variables and sexual functioning in women using one of the aforementioned IUCs. Methods.   In a multicenter cross-sectional study, 845 women with an IUC were invited to fill out a questionnaire. The latter was returned by 402 (48 %) of them: 353 women were LNG-IUS users (88 %) and 49 were Cu-IUD users (12 %). The questions asked pertained to depression, well-being, marital relation quality, and sexual functioning. Main Outcome Measures.   Sexual functioning was measured with the Short Sexual Functioning Scale. Results.   One-third of LNG-IUS users (33 %) reported a sexual dysfunction. Of those, 20 % reported an increased sexual desire, 25 % a decreased sexual desire, 5 % arousal problems, and 8 % orgasm problems. Women using a LNG-IUS did not differ significantly in distribution, type, or prevalence (32. 9 % vs. 36. 7 %) of sexual dysfunction, nor in depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory score; 4. 7 vs. 3. 9; P =  0. 33), general well-being (WHO- 5 well-being scale score; 16. 8 vs. 17. 7; P =  0. 170), or partner relationship quality (Dyadic Adjustment Scale score; 107 vs. 108; P =  0. 74) compared to Cu-IUD users. Overall, the perceived influence of IUCs on sexual functioning was in the lower range and did not differentiate LNG-IUS greatly from Cu-IUD-users. Conclusion.   Women using a LNG-IUS do not differ from those wearing a Cu-IUD with regard to psychological and sexual functioning. The perceived impact of IUD use on sexuality should not be overestimated. Enzlin P, Weyers S, Janssens D, Poppe W, Eelen C, Pazmany E, <b>Elaut</b> E, and Amy J-J.
