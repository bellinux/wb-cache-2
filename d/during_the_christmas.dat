5|$|After {{undertaking}} {{a series}} of friendlies, Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur in the Charity Shield and drew 0–0 to share the honour. Defeats by Everton and Aston Villa {{set the tone for}} the league season as the team were left with much to do; a poor run of form <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> and New Year period effectively ruled the team out of retaining the championship. Arsenal finished the season strongly however – unbeaten in 16 matches, to end the campaign in fourth place. Wright was Arsenal's top goalscorer with 26 goals.|$|E

The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> season of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{start to}} their league campaign, with one defeat {{in their first}} 12 matches saw Arsenal begin November in first spot. Although the club were winless <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> period, their chances of winning the title {{remained}} intact. A run of two draws and losses in February was more severe, as it moved Arsenal down to fourth spot. Draws in April prompted Wenger to rule his team out of the title race and make priority to second spot, which came with a qualifying spot for the Champions League. Defeat to Newcastle United in the penultimate {{game of the season}} all but ended Arsenal's chances of finishing second, given Newcastle's superior goal difference. A win on the final day against Derby County meant the club finished third, level on points with Newcastle and Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five {{movements in}} a symmetrical arrangement of two framing duets surrounding recitatives and a central aria. Bach scored {{the work for}} two vocal soloists (soprano (S) and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of originally two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes that the scoring for just two voices and strings was probably intended to ease the workload of musicians who had a busy time <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> season. In the later version, Bach added a trio of two oboes (Ob) and taille (Ot). The duration is given as 17 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E

In the United States, Daydream became Carey's best-selling album, being certified diamond by the RIAA (RIAA), denoting shipments of ten million copies.|$|E

5|$|The club {{began their}} league {{campaign}} with two draws, but defeat by Cardiff City {{marked the beginning}} of a seven-game losing streak. Results improved in October and November before three more successive defeats saw Sturrock replaced by Mariner. Performances gradually improved and the club won both of their fixtures <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> period, including a 4–1 win against Reading; their best of the season. The club signed Damien Johnson in the winter transfer window from Birmingham City and made a number of signings on loan, including Kenny Cooper and David Stockdale, {{in order to try to}} improve their league position. A succession of draws and narrow defeats followed in February, which prompted Mariner to make more signings.|$|E
