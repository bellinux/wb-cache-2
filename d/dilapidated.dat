5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, {{they did not}} {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included {{the building of the}} Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), the restoration of the Pool of Raranj, and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538.
