5000|$|The phrase {{street name}} {{securities}} or [...] "nominee name securities" [...] {{is used in}} the United States to refer to securities of companies which are held electronically in the account of a stockbroker or bank or custodian, similar to a bank account. [...] The entity whose name is recorded as the legal owner of the securities is known as the [...] "nominee owner," [...] and that entity has ownership rights in the security. [...] The nominee owner holds those ownership rights on behalf of the true <b>economic</b> <b>owner</b> who is [...] referred to as the beneficial owner. In the US, Cede & Co., a nominee of Depository Trust Company, is typically the largest stockholder of a company. In the US where Cede & Co. is the street name holder, therefore, all beneficial rights such as voting rights and dividends flow first to the nominee holder Cede, and then are passed onward, and ultimately to the beneficial owners. [...] In the United Kingdom this is known as holding shares in a nominee account.|$|E
40|$|For {{many kinds}} of assets, {{the growth rate of}} the real asset stock is a {{nonlinear}} function of the economic owner’s decision whether to invest or extract the asset. Examples within the economy are primarily biological assets, both privately owned (such as those found in aquaculature and agriculture) and publicly owned or regulated (such as fish stocks, and in some case, timber stocks.) Optimal exploitation of the asset necessitates thatthefuturepossiblegrowthratesintheassetmustbeconsideredwhen determining the optimal amount of extraction today. In this sense, the level of the asset is determined by the <b>economic</b> <b>owner</b> or regulator and is thus said to be endogenous. This paper considers existing methods for the valuation of these endogenous assets when observed transaction prices are lacking. In particular, we consider valuation in a near-market context, whereby the the economist can only observe income flows from the asset. This near-market approach to asset valuation is particularly important for environmental accounting when transaction prices for the asset or the right to exploit the asset are lacking. We give sufficient restrictions on the revenue and cost structure of the firm in order to permit asset valuation based on average profits. In an emprical application, we combine economic and biomass data to value the US Bering Sea crab fisheries. ∗The views expressed herein {{are those of the authors}} and not those of the Bureau o...|$|E

Bettelheim, N. Poulantzas and G. Carchedi. The author comes to the conclusion that certain theses of these authors may be considered as irreconcilable with K. Marx' th eory of ownership.

5000|$|Men were {{previously}} considered as the [...] "head of household", with exclusive power over their family.

This agreement birthed the idea of Naked Marriage, where couples are likely to share the same discourse and decision-making power when confronting critical issues, such as household decisions and distribution of possessions. Therefore, they may attain real equality in marriage. As supporters of Naked Marriage argue, it is the joint effort of life partners that constitute the most precious element of marriage.|$|R

Agricultural undertakings, especially cattle breeders, have been almost ignored in the development of Estonia’s entrepreneurship policies.

The author obtained the data used in this research from the databases of Estonian Animal Recording Centre, Estonian Agricultural Register and from questionnaires. The author conducted interviews with beef cattle breeders doing performance testing and with parish authorities. Family enterprises are extremely vulnerable; their reserves for surviving critical periods are small or nearly nonexistent. They often depend only on one area of activity. In the current <b>economic</b> situation <b>owners</b> of family enterprises need to pay particular attention to strategic management, so as to survive in difficult situations.

30|$|As {{the focus}} of control shifts to manufacturer-food processor, who is preoccupied with the {{efficiency}} of capital employed in a factory, will naturally adopt economies of scale.

The primary concern of this tertiary actor, efficiency of capital employed for marketing shall be best with economies of scale. Accordingly, demand and price mechanism for single product (say baby corn) both at secondary level and tertiary level of this value chain will alter the cropping pattern of the farming community and make them largely a baby corn producing community.|$|R
40|$|U. S. farm {{commodity}} {{support programs}} encompass nearly {{three quarters of}} a century and {{three quarters of a}} trillion taxpayer dollars. One dividend from that effort is to learn lessons. Farm commodity programs have steadfastly maintained a primary objective of supporting the incomes of a relatively few producers of a relatively few commodities. Nonetheless, farm programs have not been static but have adapted to changing economic and political parameters. Changes in agricultural policy tend to coincide with extremes in the food supply-demand balance. Farm program income transfers leak from their intended beneficiaries to other asset <b>owners.</b> <b>Economic</b> rents, once institutionalized, retain political momentum that sustains the rents. The rise of pressure from the World Trade Organization to provide only non-market-distorting payments may challenge the continued viability of these lessons; however, the lessons also caution against discounting the extant political influence of the farm lobby.

Stakeholder theory, one of these approaches, has emerged {{in recent years as}} the most prominent. This approach calls for a shift from the supremacy of economic interests of stockholders and attempts to derive alternatives for corporate governance that include and balance the interests of all those affected by corporate conduct. This thesis consists of a review of relevant literature to identify three major contributions stakeholder theory brings to the CR debate: (1) it implicitly introduces the organic model into the CR debate and thereby forces a fundamental change in the way corporations are conceived within ethics frameworks; (2) in recognition of the expanding ethical sphere of corporations, it extends corporate responsibility beyond <b>economic</b> performance, the <b>owners</b> of the corporation, expertise, and the law and government regulations; and (3) it provides a foundation for identifying what responsibilities corporations do have...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in privatizing natural resource systems to promote sustainability and conservation goals. Though <b>economic</b> theory suggests <b>owners</b> {{of private property}} rights {{have an incentive to}} act as resource stewards, few studies have tested this empirically. This paper asks whether private rights-owners were more conservative with respect to their management opinions than nonrights-owners in five Australian abalone (Haliotis spp.) fisheries. Multiple regression analyses were used to link opinions to demographic, economic, and attitudinal variables. In contrast to standard economic assumptions, nonrights-owners suggested more conservative catch limits than did rights-owners, confirming qualitative observations of behavior in management workshops. Differing views about the condition of the resource and differing levels of experience contributed to these results. The first of its kind, this study directly demonstrates that private rights do not necessarily promote the greatest level of stewardship. This has substantial implications for how natural resources are governed globally, but also warns against applying simplistic behavioral assumptions to complex social-ecological systems...|$|R
