5|$|After {{securing}} {{additional financing}} from Eurimages and ARTE, Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets {{he had built}} {{at a cost of}} €2 million. The French funding was cross-financed for the shoot by T. T. Filmműhely. As funds were frozen however, the Corsican subcontractor Tanit Films (controlled by the film's then-executive producer Jean-Patrick Costantini), terminated their contract with Balsan and through legal action compelled the production to <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> sets and leave the shooting location. At that point, Ognon Pictures shut the production down and disassociated themselves from the film, and Tarr withdrew to Hungary to regroup.|$|E

5|$|Operation Dragoon {{also had}} {{political}} implications. Two {{days after the}} landing, the Germans proceeded to <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> Vichy France government. Members of the Sicherheitsdienst stormed French government institutions and moved the Vichy French officials, including Philippe Pétain, to Belfort in Eastern France. Later, they were moved to Sigmaringen in Germany, where they acted as a Vichy French government in exile. With {{the collapse of the}} Vichy French government, troops of the FFI took over and resumed control of the French political institutions. Antony Beevor comments that The landings in the south of France prompted a rapid German withdrawal and thus reduced the damage and suffering done to France.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} closed in 1914 {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, for the duration of which the steel structure was not maintained and consequently became rusty. During the war the government made unsuccessful attempts to buy the tower for its metal. Controversy still surrounds the decision to <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> tower after the war ended; some still believe the structure was safe and could have been repaired. Demolition began in 1919 and by 1921 only the ballroom remained. The metal was sold to scrap dealers.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} fire rapidly increased, when enemy {{vehicles}} {{could be seen}} moving towards the villa from the nearby woods; this in particular worried Frost, as the radio sets the force had been issued failed to work, giving him no means of communication with his other detachments, including 'Nelson' who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach. Fortunately for the British, Flight Sergeant Cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded to <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> radar equipment, placing the pieces on specially designed trolleys.|$|E

5|$|Though much of {{the mythology}} {{surrounding}} the patrol and the site has dissipated in the national consciousness since the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, World's View endures as a tourist attraction to this day. A campaign in the 1990s to <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> monument and remove the graves met with strong opposition from both local residents and the Department of National Museums and Monuments, {{partly because of the}} income it brings from visitors, and partly out of respect for the site and the history surrounding it.|$|E
5|$|After Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev became {{leader of}} the Soviet Union and began a process of de-Stalinisation, citing Lenin's writings, {{including}} those on Stalin, to legitimise this process. When Mikhail Gorbachev took power in 1985 and introduced the policies of glastnost and perestroika, he too cited these actions as a return to Lenin's principles. In late 1991, amid {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the Lenin archive be removed from Communist Party control and placed under the control of a state organ, the Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History, at which it was revealed that over 6,000 of Lenin's writings had gone unpublished. These were declassified and made available for scholarly study. Yeltsin did not <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> Lenin mausoleum, recognising that Lenin was too popular and well respected among the Russian populace for this to be viable.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War, Powell {{was made}} a baronet by Charles II. Although it is {{unrecorded}} when Bodiam Castle was dismantled (slighted), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and after the Civil War, many castles were slighted {{to prevent them from}} being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> barbican, the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.|$|E

5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> public welfare system.|$|E
5|$|Chance leads Natasha to {{his uncle}} Douvee's (Wilford Brimley) house {{deep in the}} bayou, and enlists his help in {{defeating}} the men.

Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end only Fouchon is left, but he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow. Chance charges him, attacking with a flurry of blows, and then drops a grenade in his pants. Fouchon attempts to <b>dismantle</b> <b>the</b> grenade, but fails and gets incenerated in the explosion. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee now make {{their way out of}} the warehouse.|$|E

The Robin side re-opened on April 7 and ran until June 28 when it was closed {{for the rest of the}} year. The Batman side did not operate at all, but three of the five cars from the original Robin train were placed on Batman's maintenance track.
