40|$|Artículo de publicación ISILaron syndrome(LS) is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} caused by mutations {{in the growth}} hormone receptor (GHR) gene. The most frequent GHR mutation is <b>E</b> <b>180</b> splice (rs 121909360), which was initially found in an inbred population of Spanish descent in Ecuador and subsequently in Israel, Brazil, Chile, and the United States. The aim {{of the present study}} is to determine if the <b>E</b> <b>180</b> splice mutation arose from a common origin. We studied 22 patients with LS from Ecuador, Israel (of Moroccan origin), Brazil, Chile, and the United States (of Mexican origin) who were homozygous for the <b>E</b> <b>180</b> splice mutation and compared them to control individuals for markers surrounding the GHR, intragenic polymorphisms, and Y-chromosome STR. An identical haplotype was found in {{all but one of the}} subjects carrying the <b>E</b> <b>180</b> splice mutation: D 5 S 665 : 150 / 150; D 5 S 2082 : 192 / 192; D 5 S 2087 : 246 / 246; rs 6179 G/G; and rs 6180 C/C. One patient differed from the others only at D 5 S 2082 (168 / 192). This haplotype is rare (1 %) in control individuals and confirmed that the <b>E</b> <b>180</b> splice-associated haplotype was not derived from independent origins but represented recombination from a common ancestor. The analysis of paternal lineage markers showed that 50 % belong to haplogroup R 1 b (found in Portugal and Spain) and 40 % to haplogroups J and E (typical in the Middle East and in Eastern European Jews). The germline <b>E</b> <b>180</b> Splice mutation appears to have originated froma single common ancestor. The presence of Y-chromosome markers associated with Sephardic populations in persons harboring the <b>E</b> <b>180</b> splice mutation provides genetic evidence in support of the historical tracking of the exodus of this specific population.

40|$|Background and AimsSatellite DNA is a genomic {{component}} {{present in}} virtually all eukaryotic organisms. The turnover of highly repetitive satellite DNA is {{an important element in}} genome organization and evolution in plants. Here we assess the presence and physical distribution of the repetitive DNA <b>E</b> <b>180</b> family in Medicago and allied genera. Our goals were to gain insight into the karyotype evolution of Medicago using satellite DNA markers, and to evaluate the taxonomic and phylogenetic signal of a satellite DNA family in a genus hypothesized to have a complex evolutionary history. MethodsSeventy accessions from Medicago, Trigonella, Melilotus and Trifolium were analysed by PCR to assess the presence of the repetitive <b>E</b> <b>180</b> family, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used for physical mapping in somatic chromosomes. Key ResultsThe <b>E</b> <b>180</b> repeat unit was PCR-amplified in 37 of 40 taxa in Medicago, eight of 12 species of Trigonella, six of seven species of Melilotus and in two of 11 Trifolium species. Examination of the mitotic chromosomes revealed that only 13 Medicago and two Trigonella species showed FISH signals using the <b>E</b> <b>180</b> probe. Stronger hybridization signals were observed in subtelomeric and interstitial loci than in the pericentromeric loci, suggesting this satellite family has a preferential genomic location. Not all 13 Medicago species that showed FISH localization of the <b>E</b> <b>180</b> repeat were phylogenetically related. However, nine of these species belong to the phylogenetically derived clade including the M. sativa and M. arborea complexes. ConclusionsThe use of the <b>E</b> <b>180</b> family as a phylogenetic marker in Medicago should be viewed with caution. Its amplification appears to have been produced through recurrent and independent evolutionary episodes in both annual and perennial Medicago species as well as in basal and derived clades...|$|E
40|$|Familial hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (FHC) {{is a disease}} of cardiac sarcomeres. To identify molecular mechanisms underlying FHC pathology, functional and structural differences in three FHC-related mutations in recombinant α-Tm (V 95 A, D 175 N, and <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G) were characterized using both conventional and modified in vitro motility assays and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Mutant Tm's exhibited reduced α-helical structure and increased unordered structure. When thin filaments were fully occupied by regulatory proteins, little or no motion was detected at pCa 9, and maximum speed (pCa 5) was similar for all tropomyosins. Ca 2 +-responsiveness of filament sliding speed was increased either by increased pCa 50 (V 95 A), reduced cooperativity n (D 175 N), or both (<b>E</b> <b>180</b> G). When temperature was increased, thin filaments with <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G exhibited dysregulation at temperatures ~ 10 °C lower, and much closer to body temperature, than WT.

40|$|Abstractα-Tropomyosin (αTm) {{is central}} to Ca 2 +-regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. The {{familial}} hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation αTm <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G enhances Ca 2 +-sensitivity in functional assays. To investigate the molecular basis, we imaged single molecules of human cardiac αTm <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G by direct probe atomic force microscopy. Analyses of tangent angles along molecular contours yielded persistence length corresponding to ∼ 35 % increase in flexibility compared to wild-type. Increased flexibility of the mutant was confirmed by fitting end-to-end length distributions to the worm-like chain model. This marked increase in flexibility can significantly impact systolic and possibly diastolic phases of cardiac contraction, ultimately leading to hypertrophy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThree HCM-causing {{tropomyosin}} (Tm) mutants (V 95 A, D 175 N, and <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G) {{were examined}} using the thin-filament extraction and reconstitution technique. The effects of Ca 2 +, ATP, phosphate, and ADP concentrations on cross-bridge kinetics in myocardium reconstituted {{with each of}} these mutants were studied at 25 °C, and compared to wild-type (WT) Tm at physiological ionic strength (200  mM). All three mutants showed significantly higher (2 – 3. 5 fold) low Ca 2 + tension (TLC) and stiffness than WT at pCa 8. 0. High Ca 2 + tension (THC) was significantly higher for <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G than that for WT, whereas THC of V 95 A and D 175 N was similar to WT; high Ca 2 + stiffness (YHC) had the same trend. The Ca 2 + sensitivity of isometric force was significantly greater for V 95 A and <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G than for WT, whereas that of D 175 N remained {{the same as for}} WT; for all mutants, cooperativity was lower than for WT. Nine kinetic constants and the cross-bridge distribution were deduced using sinusoidal analysis. The number of force-generating cross bridges was similar among the D 175 N, <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G, and WT Tm forms, but it was significantly larger in the case of V 95 A than WT. We conclude that the increased number of actively cycling cross bridges at pCa 8 is the major cause of Tm mutation-related HCM pathogenesis, which may result in diastolic dysfunction. Decreased contractility (Tact) in V 95 A and D 175 N may further contribute to the severity of myocyte hypertrophy and related prognosis of the disease...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: α-Tropomyosin (Tm) {{carrying}} {{hypertrophic cardiomyopathy}} mutation D 175 N or <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G was expressed in Escherichia coli. We have assembled dimers of two polypeptide chains in vitro that carry one (αα*) or two (α*α*) {{copies of the}} mutation. We found {{that the presence of}} the mutation has little effect on dimer assembly, thereby predicting that individuals heterozygous for the Tm mutations are likely to express both αα * and α*α * Tm. Depending on the expression level, the heterodimer may be the predominant form in individuals carrying the mutation. Thus, it is important to define differences in the properties of Tm molecules carrying one or two copies of the mutation. We examined the Tm homo- and heterodimer properties: actin affinity, thermal stability, calcium regulation of myosin subfragment 1 binding, and calcium regulation of myofibril force. We report that the properties of the heterodimer may be {{similar to those of the}} wild-type homodimer (actin affinity, thermal stability, D 175 N αα*), similar to those of the mutant homodimer (calcium sensitivity, D 175 N αα*), intermediate between the two (actin affinity, <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G αα*), or different from both (thermal stability, <b>E</b> <b>180</b> G αα*). Thus, the properties of the homodimer are not a completely reliable guide to the properties of the heterodimer...|$|E

40|$|Synthesis of the O: 54 O antigen of Salmonella enterica is {{initiated}} by the nonprocessive glycosyl transferase WbbE, assigned to family 2 of the glycosyl transferase enzymes (GT 2). GT 2 enzymes possess a characteristic N-terminal domain, domain A. Based on structural data from the GT 2 representative SpsA (S. J. Charnock and G. J. Davies, Biochemistry 38 : 6380 – 6385, 1999), this domain is responsible for nucleotide binding. It possesses two invariant Asp residues, the first forming a hydrogen bond to uracil and the second coordinating a Mn 2 � ion. Site-directed replacement of Asp 41 (D 41 A) of WbbE, the analogue of the first Asp residue of SpsA, revealed {{that this is not}} required for activity. WbbE possesses three Asp residues near the position analogous to the second conserved residue. Whereas D 95 A reduced WbbE activity, activity in D 93 A and D 96 A mutants was abrogated, suggesting that either D 93 or D 96 may coordinate the Mn 2 � ion. Our studies also identified a C-terminal region of sequence conservation in 22 GT 2 members, including WbbE. SpsA was not among these. This region is characterized by an ED(Y) motif. The Glu and Asp residues of this motif were individually replaced in WbbE. <b>E</b> <b>180</b> D in WbbE had greatly reduced activity, and an <b>E</b> <b>180</b> Q replacement completely abrogated activity; however, D 181 E had no effect. <b>E</b> <b>180</b> is predicted to reside on a turn.

Recombinant α-Tm was expressed with an N-terminal Ala-Ser extension to substitute for the essential N-terminal acetylation of the native Tm. Native and Ala-Ser-Tm were indistinguishable in our assays. In the absence of F-actin, the thermal unfolding of Tm was reversible and the heat sorption curve of Tm with Cys- 190 reduced was decomposed into two separate calorimetric domains with maxima at ∼ 42 and 51 °C. In the presence of phalloidin-stabilized F-actin, a new cooperative transition appears at 46 – 47 °C and completely disappears after the irreversible denaturation of F-actin. A good correlation was found to exist between the maximum of this peak and the temperature of half-maximal dissociation of the F-actin/Tm complex as determined by light scattering experiments. We conclude that Tm thermal denaturation only occurs upon its dissociation from F-actin. In the presence of F-actin, D 175 N α-Tm shows a melting profile and temperature dependence of dissociation from F-actin similar to those for wild-type α-Tm.

Methods: Clinical, multicenter, analytical, prospective, comparative, controlled and non-randomized study. This study {{was carried out in}} the plastic surgery outpatient clinic of Hospital São Paulo and in the Wound Outpatient clinic at Conjunto Hospitalar de Sorocaba. The case series was formed by 50 patients in the Control Group (CG) and 50 patients in the Study Group (SG) both with diagnosis of venous ulcer and indication for skin graft. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Universidade Federal de São Paulo, under authorization #: 0945 / 08. Data collection was carried out from July 2008 and December 2010. In the CG, data collection was carried out at the time patients were included in the study, and then 30, 90 and 180 days after the first collection. In the SG, the first collection was carried out in the preoperative period and then 30, 90 and 180 days after skin graft. All patients of the CG were operated on after 180 days. Inclusion criteria were: being over 18 years old and having a diagnosis of venous ulcer with referral for skin coverage with skin graft. Exclusion criteria were: Skin lesions that were not completely characterized as venous ulcer, patients with clinical conditions that contraindicated surgery, and patients that had already undergone skin graft. The instruments used for data collection were: Short Form- 36, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale/UNIFESP–EPM, the Health Assessment Questionnaire- 20 (HAQ- 20), the Numeric Pain Scale, and the Mc Gill pain questionnaire. For statistical analysis, we have used Students’ t test, Kruskal-Wallis test and the Chi-square test of independence. It was fixed in 0. 05 or 5 % (p ≤ 0. 05). Outcomes: In the initial assessment of patients with venous ulcer, the SF- 36 scores were low, with a mean score of 18. 10 in the CG, and 32. 34 in the SG. One month after skin graft was carried out, patients in the SG presented higher scores in the SF- 36 (71. 38) compared to the CG (18. 42). After 90 and 180 days there was also an increase in the scores of the SG compared to the CG (p= 0. 0001). Mean scores in the HAQ- 20 was 2. 42 in the CG and 2. 65 in the SG, and in the SG there was an improvement in the scores 90 and 180 days after skin graft was carried out (p= 0. 0001). As for the Rosenberg self-esteem scale/UNIFESP–EPM, in the inclusion of patients in the study, the mean score was 25. 50 in the CG, and 25. 86 in the SG, and after 90 days and 180 days the SG presented better score compared to the CG (p= 0. 0001). As for pain assessment using the Numeric Scale and the McGill pain questionnaire, both groups of patients presented pain during the first data collection, however, in the SG 90 and 180 days after surgery, patients presented less pain (p= 0. 0001). Conclusion: Patients with venous ulcers, that underwent skin graft presented improvement in the quality of life, self-esteem, functional capacity and less pain.

Instrumentos: Short Form- 36, Escala de autoestima Rosenberg/UNIFESP–EPM, Health Assessment Questinnaire- 20 (HAQ- 20), Escala Numérica de dor, questionário de Dor de Mc Gill. Análises estatísticas: Teste t Student, o TesteKruskal- Wallis, Teste Qui-Quadrado de Independência, considerando-se os níveis de significância p ≤ 0, 05. Resultados: avaliação inicial do paciente com úlcera venosa: escores do SF- 36 baixos: média 18, 10 - Grupo Controle e 32, 34 - Grupo Estudo. Um mês após enxerto, pacientes Grupo Estudo apresentaram escores mais elevados no SF- 36 (71, 38) comparados ao GC (18, 42). Após 90 <b>e</b> <b>180</b> dias, aumento dos escores no GE comparados ao Grupo Controle(p= 0, 0001). Escore médio no HAQ- 20 : 2, 42 - Grupo Controle e 2, 65 - Grupo Estudo. Grupo Estudo: melhora nos escores após 90 dias <b>e</b> <b>180</b> dias do enxerto (p= 0, 0001). Pela Escala de Autoestima Rosenberg/UNIFESP–EPM, na inclusão dos pacientes no estudo, escore médio no Grupo Controle: 25, 50, Grupo Estudo: 25, 86. Após 90 dias <b>e</b> <b>180</b> dias, Grupo Estudo: melhor escore comparado ao Grupo Controle (p= 0, 0001). Pela Escala Numérica e pelo Questionário de Dor de Mc Gill, os dois grupos apresentaram dor durante a primeira coleta de dados. Grupo Estudo: após 90 dias <b>e</b> <b>180</b> dias de pós-operatório, houve declínio da dor (p= 0, 0001). Conclusão: Pacientes com úlcera venosa após enxerto de pele melhoraram qualidade de vida, autoestima, capacidade funcional e dor. TEDEBV UNIFESP: Teses e dissertaçõe...|$|E

40|$|A temperature-sensitive {{lethal mutant}} of Escherichia coli has been {{constructed}} by combining two temperature-insensitive mutations: a rif 180 mutation that modifies RNA polymerase (RNA nucleotidyltransferase; nucleosidetriphosphate:RNA nucleotidyltransferase, EC 2. 7. 7. 6) and a strA 24 mutation that modifies the ribosomal protein S 12. The temperature sensitivity is a {{property of the}} combination of these two particular alleles; replacement of either of the alleles relieves the temperature sensitivity. An isogenic strain containing a different strA mutation (i. <b>e.,</b> rif <b>180</b> strA 11) is not temperature sensitive. Evidently ribosomes modified by the particular strA 24 polymerase altered by the rif 180 mutation, which suggests that in vivo there may exist some interaction between structures of ribosomes and the RNA polymerase...|$|R
