40|$|Karstic {{aquifers}} {{are well}} known for their vulnerability to groundwater contamination. This is due to characteristics such as thin soils and point recharge in dolines, shafts, and swallow holes. In karstic areas, groundwater is often the only freshwater source. This {{is the case of}} the Apulia region (south-eastern Italy), where a large and deep carbonate aquifer, affected by <b>karstic</b> and fracturing <b>phenomena,</b> is located. Several methods (GOD, DRASTIC, SINTACS, EPIK, PI, and COP) for the assessment of the intrinsic vulnerability (Iv) were selected and applied to an Apulian test site, for which a complete data set was set up. The intrinsic vulnerability maps, produced using a GIS approach, show vulnerability from low to very high. The maximum vulnerability is always due to karstic features. A comparison approach of the maps is proposed. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. In general terms, three groups can be distinguished. The GOD method is useful for mapping large areas with high vulnerability contrasts. DRASTIC and SINTACS are "any-type aquifer" methods that have some limitations in applications to karstic aquifers, {{especially in the case of}} DRASTIC. EPIK, PI, and COP, which were designed to be applied to carbonate or karstic aquifers, supply affordable results, highly coherent with karstic and hydrogeological features, and reliable procedures, especially in the case of PI and COP. The latter appears simpler to apply and more flexible in considering the role of climatic parameters. If Iv of each method is considered, the highest variability is observed in cells in the neighbourhood of karstic features.

It proposes an aerial view that, through different viewpoints, allows the observer to recogniseelements of the landscape that are difficult to see from the ground, such as the long faults shapingthe steep slopes and the largest landslides of the Emilia-Romagna Apennines. The broad bed of the Secchiariver flows in a straight course for 5. 5 kilometres between towering rock-faces of white, pink and lightgray gypsum, rising up 200 metres in some point. Triassic Gypsum contains a number of different lithologies:gypsum, anhydrites, dolomite and quartzite, which form a distorted rock structure with fragments of layersthat present ruptures and folding. They were deposited during the Upper Triassic (215 - 200 million years ago) and therefore are the oldest rock outcrops in the Emilia-Romagna Apennines.

40|$|As {{a part of}} {{a broader}} {{research}} programme on the stones used in the historical buildings of the Siena area, we performed a mineralogical-petrographic study of the Calcare Cavernoso outcropping in the Montagnola Senese. It is a dolomitic limestone genetically related to the epidiagenetic evolution of the Triassic evaporitic-dolomitic succession known as Burano Anhydrite Formation. Various investigations (using polarizing microscope, X-ray diffractometry, SEM/EDS, cathodoluminescence, WDS electron microprobe) were carried out on the Calcare Cavernoso and its parent-rock, aimed to the characterization of the material. Our observations have allowed us to propose an outline of the petrogenetic evolution of the rock.

The intense tectonic fracturation of the dolomite favoured the circulation of meteoric waters in continental phreatic environment, with the consequent dissolution of sulphates and dolomite and the neoprecipitation of calcite.

Dolines are a typical morphological expression of karst rocks' dissolution and collapse and, usually, they represent a potential hazard for human activities and, in particular, in the care and maintenance of cultural heritage sites. In this study, we observed {{that the development of}} a subsidence doline caused severe damage to some archaeological structures at the Carsulae monumental site. According to the results obtained in our investigation, three sites at least with karst dissolution phenomena in the shallow calcareous tufa layer have been identified. One of them subsided probably in Roman times and produced a sharp deformation of the decumanus. In order to understand the evolution of this territory an integrated geomorphological and geophysical survey was carried out. The combination between the information derived from different geophysical techniques, such as: Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Frequency-Domain Electromagnetism (FDEM), and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) clearly pointed out that the calcareous tufa layer is characterized by an irregular geometry and this resulted in the investigated area being affected by karst dissolution in several parts. Four boreholes opportunely located, provided direct information about the depth and the alteration of the calcareous tufa basement and precious calibration data for the geophysical methods.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to show the {{relationship}} between karstic landforms and neo-tectonics in the southern sector of the Western Marsica region. The investigated area {{is located in the}} Colle Rotondo-Colle Terelle structure (southern Latium) between the towns of Pescosolido and Alvito. It is an elongated Apennine-trending morphological place, bounded by some of the most relevant regional tectonic features of the whole Apennines, such as the Simbruini-Ernici Mts. leading thrust and the Val Roveto-Atina-Caserta line. Here the Meso-Cenozoic carbonate deposits of the Latium-Abruzzi sequence, the Upper Miocene terrigenous and Plio-Quaternary continental deposits outcrop. In more detail the area belongs to a sector of the Apennines, which has been intensively deformed by Neogene-Quaternary compressional and extensional tectonics. This sector of the chain mostly formed in Neogene times {{in the context of the}} eastwards piggy-back propagation of thrust sequence and was broken up by Plio-Quaternary distensive tectonics. Intepretation of aerial photographs and field surveys allowed a detailed analysis of hydrography, karstic morphology and Quaternary tectonic evidence. The Colle Rotondo-Colle Terelle structure is a still active karstic area; the coexistence of epigeous forms and processes at different grades of evolution makes it a nearly unique zone. At the foot of the structure the copious Fibreno springs are located, which act as the present base level for karstic erosion. Along the Apenninic-trending tectonic alignments the greatest <b>karstic</b> <b>phenomena</b> of the whole area are present. The main dolines of the area, developed along tectonic directions with Apennine trend, show morphological evidence of stasis periods in their evolution, related with Quaternary tectonic activity.

The stratigraphical and hydrogeological data are kept in the archives of local agencies. The collected data were organised in a single database managed by an appropriate software (ARCVIEW). Numerous geological cross sections of the territory were studied in order to characterise the subsoil. Subsequently, multi-parameter surveys (O 2, pH, temperature, TDS, conductivity) were carried out on the water-column of certain wells selected from those studied in 1987.

40|$|The Gypsum Plain {{region of}} the Delaware Basin hosts {{approximately}} 1800 km 2 of the Castile Formation outcrop. A myriad of karstic developments from closed sinkholes to large multi-kilometer cave systems have been documented within the region. Karst studies on the distribution and speleogenetic evolution within Castile strata began within the last decade with ever increasing data resolution. In this study, {{a combination of both}} physical field surveys and analyses of high resolution (~ 30 cm accuracy) LiDAR data was used to create a theoretical model for karst development across the region. This idealized model considers speleogenetic formation type variations (hypogene and epigene), the density of karstic features based on lithology variations, and the connection between the local hydrostratigraphic setting and the regional hydrogeological framework. Field studies included physical mapping of 20 km 2 of the Gypsum Plain from the Castile’s western outcrop to where it dips into the subsurface to the east. These surface surveys involved the recording of all surfically-expressed <b>karstic</b> <b>phenomena</b> and the mapping of all enterable caves so that the speleogenetic evolution could be analyzed. The way in which hypogene and epigene caves are surfically expressed across the region indicates that many of the caves have been affected by either multi-stage epigenetic development or multi-stage hypogenetic development with epigenetic overprinting. Through the use of the methods outlined above, surficial karst manifestations vary across the region, from hypogenetic exposures in the west and epigenetic phreatic / vadose exposures in the east. Additionally, supplementary LiDAR data was used to create digital elevation models (DEM) so that the effectiveness of physical field surveys versus remote sensing techniques could be determined. Previous works in the area by Stafford et al., (2008 b) determined that remote sensing preserved only 36 % of all karstic features found through physical field surveys. Given today’s advancements in remote sensing accuracy, this study determined that on average LiDAR analysis identifies almost seven times more karstic features than physical surveys over a given area...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of vertebrate {{material from the}} Salento Peninsula (Italy), currently stored at the Museum of Paleontology of the University of Rome ‘Sapienza’ and the Natural History Museum in Verona, led us to conduct a preliminary field survey and prospection in order to localize suitable outcrops for paleontological excavations. As a result, new stratigraphic and sedimentological features of the Cretaceous limestones of the Apulian Carbonate Platform are here reported. The attention {{was focused on the}} northern sector of the Salento Peninsula, and in particular on an abandoned quarry about 2 km NE of Manduria (Taranto, Italy). About 8 meters of Upper Cretaceous ‘Plattenkalke’-type deposits referable to the Calcare di Altamura Fm., showing interesting paleontological and geological aspects, are here exposed. A high-resolution litho-biostratigraphical study of the succession was performed at a mm-scale in order to reconstruct the paleoenvironment setting of the area. From a stratigraphic and sedimentological point of view, the lithotypes outcropping in the quarry are dominated by the cyclic alternation of: i) mm- to cm-thick, dome-shaped, cyanoalgal laminites, sometimes cross-cut by mud-cracks; ii) ‘fenestral’ horizons made of prismatic-to-discoidal voids, in some cases larger than 1 cm, related to dissolution of evaporitic salts (mainly sodium chloride); iii) wedge-shaped pedogenetic horizons (terre rosse) and paleokarst structures, sometimes associated with syn-sedimentary tectonics. From a paleontological point of view, a unique and well-preserved thanatocoenosis characterizes the studied succession. The macrofauna is strictly oligotypic and consists of fish-remains, coprolites, regular sea urchins and few specimens of Chondrodonta sp., while the microfauna is totally absent. The main feature is represented by the kind of preservation of the echinoids and their spines. In fact, echinoids are preserved as “ghosts”, with the original high-Mg calcitic test completely leached. The moulds are partially filled by yellow-orange silt and clay, referable to incipient paleokarst features, or by crusts of microcrystalline calcite. Furthermore, a large number of isolated radioli were found, while no echinoid tests with articulated spines were recovered. The facies {{analysis of}} the “vuggy” and laminated limestones suggests a saline and dry, supratidal mudflat-type setting as depositional environment. Hypersaline conditions are highlighted by salt-rich levels, while periodical and ephemeral flooding of normal-salinity seawater allowed the colonization of the sea floor by benthic organisms (mainly echinoids), and occupancy by fishes. Extreme conditions of the depositional setting are marked by the total lack of the microfauna.

The term of karst {{is used in}} the meaning of "any feature of the classical karst morphology (caves, sink-holes, lapiaz [...] .) where dissolution plays the main genetic action and this in any kind of rocks". The cave of Guéssédoundou illustrâtes a karst in métagabbros. It opens {{at the top of a}} small hill, in a dépression twenty meters long and three to four meters deep. The walls of this dépression are subvertical and the bottom is partially occupied by angular pluridecimetric blocks. The cave is opened on several meters in the southern side of the dépression and is prolonged in the form of too narrow conduits to be explore. The bedrock is a metagabbro with fine grains, slightly weathered, crossed by decimetric quartzose veins. Gabbroïc texture is preserved, as well as part of magmatic plagioclases. The remainder is transformed into a mixture of white feldspar and clinozoisite. Pyroxene are pseudomorphosed in actinote and chlorite. The site dépression was created along a N 10 ° shear zone where rocks suffered important fracturation and fluid transfers, as shown by its silification and ferruginisation [...] Moreover, a East-West schistosity, former to shearing, structures the gabbro. The présence of angular blocks of variable size and the absence of human activity trace on the site show that the dépression was formed naturally by collapse of the roof of a more vast cavity whose current cave would be the visible residual prolongation. The absence of flow traces and mechanical abrasion means that this cavity is due only to chemical érosion. At the cave entry and on the subvertical walls of the dépression were formed by alveoli a few centimètres to a few décimètres in diameter. Thèse alveoli of wall are known in other lithologies, in particular in limestones. The absence of salts within the rock draws aside a formation by sait weathering. The smooth aspect and non fractured walls of the cells cannot resuit from a corrosion to a fracturing node. The closed aspect of the dépression and the absence of flow trace eliminate the assumptions from formation by water swirls or eolisation. The genesis of the cave must be earlier to the installation of a weathering cover since the rock is little deteriorated and the alveoli are not developed on a quite particular level which would correspond to a précise pedogenic horizon. Only a generalized dissolution of the métagabbros, in relation to a slow solution circulation, being carried out with the favour of the fracturing plans of the shearing zone makes it possible to explain the formation of the alveoli. The inversion of relief results from a weaker érosion of the rocks made more résistant to this place by the quartz seam mainstay and by the ferruginisation along the shearing zone. In the other hand, the crushed rocks, become porous, drained the infiltrations of meteoric water, facilitating the dissolution processes. The study of the site of Guéssédoundou shows that <b>karstic</b> <b>phenomena</b> can also exist in silico-aluminous formations of crystalline rock...|$|E
40|$|El objetivo del presente trabajo es el de presentar un cuadro estratigráfico para las sedimentitas del área del Cerro Verdún, Minas, Uruguay. Asimismo presentar algunas consideraciones sobre sus características sedimentológicas y sus estromatolitos, a fin de {{discutir}} sus condiciones paleoambientales. En el mismo sentido, se realizan inferencias sobre la edad abarcada por estas rocas y sus potenciales correlaciones regionales. Esta sucesión ha permanecido indefinida en general, mientras que sus calizas fueron alternativamente asignadas a diversas unidades litoestratigráficas. En esta contribución se incluye al conjunto en el Grupo Mina Verdún, el cual está conformado de base a techo por: i) Formación Don Mario (40 m, base no expuesta, lutitas negras), ii) Formación La Toma (15 m, margas verdes oscuras a negras), iii) Formación El Calabozo (170 m, calizas grises, masivas, laminadas y estromatolíticas) y iv) Formación Gibraltar (60 m, techo no expuesto, dolomías en tonalidades pálidas amarillentas, verdes y rosas hasta gris oscuras más calizas rosas y pelitas y margas negras). Conglomerados polimícticos de la Formación Las Palmas cubren a esta unidad mediante una discordancia angular. En contraposición, las cuarcitas del Cerro Verdún se apoyan sobre el Grupo Mina Verdún por contacto tectónico. Las pelitas negras de la Formación Don Mario se habrían depositado en un ambiente reductor de aguas calmas. Se identifica para las mismas, de manera preliminar, {{un aporte}} desde una corteza continental superior diferenciada que sufrió una importante meteorización y retrabajo. Las margas de la Formación La Toma reflejan un cambio en la sedimentación, con un pasaje hacia un ambiente de rampa carbonática. Niveles con estromatolitos aparecen en las calizas de la Formación El Calabozo, constituidos esencialmente por columnas de laminación cónica asignables a Conophyton fm. y muy escasos estromatolitos columnares dendroides, mal preservados. Conophyton es considerado como un estromatolito submareal de aguas relativamente profundas. Esto último, sumado a la baja diversidad, sugiere un ambiente marino submareal externo para esta unidad. Correlaciones entre afloramientos locales, definirían una evolución desde una rampa carbonática hasta una plataforma, en las inmediaciones del talud de la misma. La edad de esta unidad aún no se conoce con precisión. Sin embargo, interpretaciones geológicas regionales, sobre la base de los estromatolitos presentes y de datos geoquímicos, sugieren un tiempo de depositación post-arqueano a pre-ediacareano. The {{aim of this}} contribution is to introduce the stratigraphic framework of the Mina Verdún Quarry, located in {{the eastern side of}} Verdún Hill, Minas, Uruguay (Fig. 1), and to characterise their sedimentary units. The paleoenvironments involved are outlined as well as the sedimentological significance of the very well developed stromatolites. The stratigraphic position and composition of this sedimentary succession used to be uncertain and the limestone from the Mina Verdún Quarry was alternatively considered part of diverse litostratigraphic units (Mac Millan, 1933; Caorsi and Goñi, 1958; Bossi et al., 1965; Midot, 1984; Preciozzi et al., 1985; Bossi and Navarro, 2000; Sánchez Betucci, 1998; Sánchez Betucci et al., 2001). From the base to the top (Fig. 2), the sedimentary succession consists of the Mina Verdún Group, Las Palmas Formation and the quartzites of the Verdún Hill (Fig. 3). Mina Verdún Group (Poiré et al., 2003 b) is conformed by: Don Mario Formation (Poiré et al., 2003 b) : 40 m thick, base not exposed; massive and laminated, black shales (Fig 4 a), which are rich in organic matter (Fig. 5 a). XRD analysis shows manly quartz, with scarce calcite, clay (illite, chlorite, and IS and CS interlayer) and feldspars (Fig. 6). Applying the Bhatia and Crook (1986), Taylor and McLennan (1985) and McLennan et al. (1990, 1993) plots (Fig. 7) their geochemistry suggests a high degree of weathering and reworking in the source area compose of a differentiated upper continental crust. La Toma Formation (Poiré et al., 2003 b) : 15 m thick; fine-grained, dark green marls (Fig. 4 b and c), bearing up to 45 % of silica and 35 % of CaCO 3. Petrographically they show micritic crystals of calcite and dolomite, quartz and feldspars (Fig. 5 b); lamination is interrupted by stilolytes. Clay minerals are composed mainly by illite and scarce chlorite (Fig. 6). El Calabozo Formation (Poiré et al., 2003 b) : 170 m thick; grey massive, laminated, and stromatolite limestones (Fig. 4 d), bearing up to 93 % of CaCO 3 with some collapse breccias as resulting of probably <b>karstic</b> <b>phenomena.</b> In thin section they show homogeneous mosaic of micrite and subsparite calcite (Fig. 5 c and d) with stilolites and corrugated stromatolite lamination. Very abundant calcite with rare quartz, feldspars and illite have been recorded by XRD (Fig. 6). This sedimentary sequence is affected by diagenetic features and a fragile deformation (cleavage foliation, shear zones) which are slightly hiding the stromatolite morphologies (Fig. 8), but the main features of the stromatolites from El Calabozo Formation are still well preserved. Columnar stromatolites assignable to Conophyton fm. are the most abundant group of these organic sedimentary structures. This Conophyton fm. consists of unbranching subcylindrical columnar stromatolites with strikingly conical internal laminae whose apexes define a distinctive axial zone (Figs. 10 a, b, c) and their horizontal section display a conspicuously and regularly concentric structure (Figs. 10 c, d, f). The internal laminae are commonly continuous from one column to another, in which case vertical sections show upward laminae apexing. Their profile is angulate to geniculate and their plant outline could be round circular to oblong, in which case the axes are strongly orientated. The attitude of the columns is usually straight but sometimes they adopt a recumbent and sinuous posture. The column height is up to 70 cm and the column width is 5 to 20 cm. However, scarce but preserved dendroid branching style stromatolites have been recorded on the field, as well as small, rounded plant outline columnar stromatolites have been observed in cores, which could represent digitate branching stromatolites. Five kilometres to the south, this stromatolitic limestone facies change to deformed laminate limestones (Figs. 4 e, f). Furthermore, 40 km to south, the El Calabozo Formation bearing Conophyton stromatolites has been reported by Gaucher et al. (2004 a). Gibraltar Formation (Poiré et al., 2003 b) : 60 m, top not exposed; black marls and shales (Figs, 10 a, b, c), pink limestones and dolomite limestones, and light yellow, green, reddish, black and grey dolomites (Fig. 10 d, e). The unconformity between the El Calabozo and Gibraltar formations is very irregular, which is interpreted as a karstic palaeorelief. A 4 m thick diagenetic breccia is often in the base of the unit. The Mina Verdún Group is overlaid by red polymictic conglomerates and sandstones (Fig. 10 f) of Las Palmas Formation (Poiré et al., 2003 b) and is intruded by a subvolcanic longitudinal (E-W) dike swarm. This shows a K-Ar whole rock datum of 485, 2 ± 12, 5 Ma considered as a minimum cooling (Gonzalez et al., 2004). The quarzites from the Verdún Hill are overlying these units by a tectonic contact. They have been assigned to the Cerro Espuelitas Formation by Gaucher (2000), which are Ediacarean in age. Sedimentological and stratigraphic implications The black shales and claystones of the Don Mario Formation are interpreted as fine deposits in a low energy environment with euxinic conditions, which becomes calcareous to form a carbonatic ramp (La Toma Formation). The latter shows and evolution to a carbonatic algae platform very rich in stromatolites. From a sedimentological point of view, the group Conophyton has been assigned as a deep subtidal stromatolite by Poiré (1987, 2002) based on Precambrian stromatolite cycles from Villa Mónica Formation, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, and Logan et al. (1964) and Donaldson (1976) ideas. In this sense, the low biodiversity, Conophyton abundance and the plant view axes orientation allow to suggest a subtidal marine environment for the El Calabozo Formation, with tidal currents influence (Fig. 11). The strong dolomitization of the Gibraltar Formation and their poor exposure do not allow doing detailed interpretation about paleoenvironments. The age of the Mina Verdún Group is Precambrian but there are not major precisions about that. Unfortunately, the group Conophyton has a wide range during the Precambrian, from Early Proterozoic to Ediacarean, being impossible to define the age of these limestones. More detailed future studies about microstructure of this Conophyton could be useful to distinguish the taxonomy and to determinate its possible age. Pre-Ediacarean stromatolites have also been described 30 km to the north by Sprechmann et al. (1994) and Gaucher et al. (1996) in the Villalba Formation of the Basal Group (Gaucher y Sprechmann, 1995), but their morphologies are completely different. They have recorded stratiform, nodular-stratiform (LLH-C, LLHV) and columnar (SH-V) stromatolites associated with stromatolitic breccias, which were interpreted as intertidal to supratidal deposits. It could represent shallower stromatolite assemblages than the stromatolites from the Mina Verdún. Unfortunately, there are no radiometric data to prove this idea. Very well developed Conophyton ?ressotti and Conophyton fm. have been also recorded in the dolomites of the Villa Mónica Formation (Poiré, 1993) companied by Colonella fm., Cryptozoon fm., Gongylina fm., Gymnosolem fm., Inzeria fm., Jacutophyton fm., Jurusonia nisvensis, Katavia fm., Kotuikania fm., Kussiella fm., Minjaria fm., Parmites fm., Parmites Cf. cocrescens and Stratifera fm. (Poiré, 1989 y 1993), which radiometric age for diagenesis is 795 My (Cingolani y Bonhomme, 1988). This sequence could be correlated with El Calabozo Formation but it shows a poor biodiversity. The Mina Verdún Group is considered as a new lithostratigraphic unit in the Uruguayan stratigraphic framework, which is probably located somewhere between the Basal and Arroyo del Soldado groups...|$|E
