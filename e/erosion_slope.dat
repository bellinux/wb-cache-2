On the slope grounds, as result of the gradient of the hill side, there is a permanent potential danger of starting <b>erosion.</b> <b>Slope</b> ditches and outlets were desinged as antierosion works. The determination of the compensation slope was carried out by verifying the velocity of water discharge resulting in case of the mechanical consolidation type by stone masonry a maximum slope of 7 % with a velocity of discharge of 4, 96 m/s, and in case of consolidation by grassing a slope of 0, 09 % at a velocity of 0, 9 m/s...|$|E

In combination with ground control points, the UAV images were used to create orthophotos and 3 D point clouds using the Structure from Motion (SfM) software Photoscan. The TLS surface models indicate seasonal differences in erosion and deposition. The surface change measured with SfM showed nearly 6. 700 m 3 of net material loss, resulting from 8. 700 m 3 erosion and 2. 000 m 3 deposition. These values reveal a mean annual surface lowering of 5. 3 cm for the catchment. Additionally, several geomorphological processes, such as rill <b>erosion,</b> <b>slope</b> wash and translational slides could be detected in the one-year monitoring period.

40|$|Soil erosion is a {{widespread}} problem in semi-arid Mediterranean countries where irregular, intense rainfall can result in rapid erosion in areas of steep slope, soft lithology and sparse vegetation. This paper presents an integrated remote sensing/GIS approach to identify areas vulnerable to rapid erosion in Almera Province, Southeast Spain. ERS SAR multitemporal interferometric coherence imagery is used to extract information on the erosion process, which causes random changes in the micro-topography of the land surface. This results in reduced coherence of the radar signals between the initial and eroded states. A known case of rapid erosion within the study area has been investigated using coherence images with 70, 140 and 210 days temporal separation. A GIS is then used to derive criteria {{for a set of}} environmental conditions causing susceptibility to rapid <b>erosion.</b> <b>Slope</b> is extracted from SAR interferogram; vegetation and lithology from ETM+ imagery. The areas predicted to be most vulnerable to rapid erosion across the imagery are then identified.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A dam {{may fail}} when the loading (overtopping flood, flow through or beneath the dam, {{earthquake}} or blasting loading, terrorist attacks, deterioration etc.) exceeds the resistance against overtopping, internal <b>erosion,</b> <b>slope</b> instability, sliding/overturning, excessive deformation etc. To properly describe {{the causes of}} dam failures, {{it is necessary to}} study characteristics of the dams which have experienced failures. In this work, more than 900 dam failure cases throughout the world excluding China are compiled into a database, including details of the dams, the reservoirs, the triggers, and the failures. This paper focuses on failure of earth dams, which makes up 66 % of the whole failure cases in the database. A statistical analysis of the failure characteristics is conducted. According to dam zoning and corewalls, earth dams are divided into four typical categories: (1) homogeneous earthfill dams, (2) zoned earthfill dams, (3) earthfill dams with corewalls, and (4) concrete faced earthfill dams. Further analysis of the failure modes and causes of these subdivided earth dams is carried out. Potential locations at risk are also described to provide the reader with a better understanding of earth dam failures...|$|E

This model enables to approach the probability of failure on every levee sections and to integrate and cross different “stability” parameters such topography and included structures, geology and material geotechnical characteristics, hydraulic loads… and observations of visual inspections or instrumentation results considered as disorders (seepage, burrowing animals, vegetation, pipes, etc.).

40|$|Arctic {{amplification}} {{of climate}} warming is intensifying the thaw and coastal {{erosion of the}} widespread and carbon-rich Siberian Ice Complex Deposits (ICD). Despite the potential for altering long-term carbon dynamics in the Arctic, the susceptibility of organic carbon (OC) to degradation as the ICD thaw is poorly characterised. This study identifies signs of OC degradation in three Siberian ICD regimes of coastal erosion through elemental, isotopic and molecular analyses. The degree of erosion appears {{to determine the extent}} of degradation. The moisture-limited and beach-protected ICD bluff near Buor-Khaya Cape, characterised by thermokarst mounds (baydzherakhs), represents a dormant regime with limited ongoing degradation. Conversely, the more exposed ICD scarps on eroding riverbanks (Olenek Channel, Lena Delta) and coastal slopes (Muostakh Island) showed more pronounced signs of ongoing OC decay. Different parameters suggest that degradation can partially explain the shift of the OC signature with 14 C age in the thawing ICD. Exposure time, degree of <b>erosion,</b> <b>slope</b> gradient and moisture conditions appear to be key factors determining the degradation propensity of OC in exposed ICD. These field results document the lability of OC in ICD upon thaw and illustrate the potential for transferring old OC into the rapidly cycling atmosphere-biosphere carbon pools...|$|E

These embankments protect about 900 people against Sierroz river floods. Hydraulic studies performed in the frame of the Aix-les-Bains Inundation Risk Prevention Plan (PPRI in French) have shown that these embankments have a high risk of failure by overtopping during a 100 year return period flood of the Sierroz River. These studies have defined inundation maps with High Danger areas. From these results, the city of Aix-les- Bains asked EDF to perform a safety assessment study, in order to assess the safety margins of these embankments for each of their potential failure modes: overtopping erosion, internal <b>erosion,</b> <b>slope</b> sliding and liquefaction. This study confirmed that the main risk is breaching by overtopping erosion during flood. This diagnosis led the city of Aix-les-Bains to launch two parades: (i) the embankment refurbishment in order to provide them satisfactory safety margins during a 100 year return period flood and (ii) a monitoring and early-warning system able to alert population at risk as early as possible when breaching is imminent.

Moreover，a comparison of the types and scale of <b>erosion</b> and <b>slope</b> failure caused by the typhoon Nabi，in September 2005 ，and the above heavy rainfall event was also conducted within the study area. Characteristic results were as follows: (1) The geological composition {{of the study area}} was shown to be of sandstone and shale base overlaid with pyroclastic fall and pyroclastic flow deposits originating from eruptions of Ata Volcano and Aira Volcano and volcanic ash and volcanic pumice originating from eruptions of Sakurajima Volcano. Two types of <b>erosion</b> and <b>slope</b> failure were observed {{as a result of the}} heavy rainfall event: failure of the sub-base and sub-grade-bearing body of the forest road itself as a result of groundwater between the bedrock and pyroclastic fall deposits combined with the influx of rain water，and a shallow landslide resulting from infiltration and concentration of rain water in the surface soil on the cutting slope. (2) Areas of slope failure and sediment yield due to slope failure within the study area were also investigated. The area of slope failure ranged from 5 to 80 ㎡ (average: 31 ㎡) and the sediment yield due to slope failure from 5 to 336 ㎥ (average: 49 ㎥). A larger area was affected and more sediment yield occurred with failure of the sub-base and sub-grade-bearing body compared with the shallow landslide. (3) A greater number of slopes were damaged and more types of <b>erosion</b> and <b>slope</b> failure resulted from typhoon Nabi compared to the heavy rainfall event. Moreover，when <b>erosion</b> and <b>slope</b> failure were of the same type，the scale，especially the sediment yield due to slope failure caused by typhoon Nabi was much larger than with the heavy rainfall. 2006 年 7 月 5 日の豪雨に伴う鹿児島大学農学部附属高隈演習林の林道法面における侵食・斜面崩壊の実態を調査した。さらに，高隈演習林内の同じ地域を対象として調査した， 2005 年 9 月の台風 14 号と 2006 年 7 月の豪雨に伴う林道法面の侵食・斜面崩壊の形態および規模についても比較した。得られた結果は以下の通りである。(1) 調査地は砂岩・頁岩が基盤岩となりそれを阿多カルデラおよび姶良カルデラから噴出した降下火砕物や，桜島火山から噴出した火山灰・軽石が被覆した地質構造となっている。調査地でみられた侵食・斜面崩壊の形態として，基盤岩とその上部を覆う大隅降下軽石層の間に集中した雨水および地下水に起因して発生した路体を支持する路盤の決壊，ならびに切り取り斜面への雨水の浸透に起因した表層崩壊の 2 つが挙げられる。(2) 調査地において，斜面崩壊の面積および斜面崩壊による生産土砂量の測定を行った。その結果，斜面崩壊の面積は 5 ～ 80 ㎡の範囲（平均 31 ㎡) ，斜面崩壊による生産土砂量は 5 ～ 336 ㎥の範囲（平均 49 ㎥) であった。路体を支持する路盤の決壊は，切り取り斜面における表層崩壊に比べ大きな規模を示した。(3) 同じ調査地で比較すると， 2005 年 9 月の台風 14 号に伴う林道法面の被害箇所数および林道法面における侵食・斜面崩壊の形態の数は， 2006 年 7 月の豪雨に伴うそれらよりはるかに多かった。さらに，同じ形態の侵食・斜面崩壊で比較すると， 2005 年 9 月の台風 14 号に伴う林道法面における侵食・斜面崩壊の規模特に斜面崩壊による生産土砂量は， 2006 年 7 月の豪雨に伴うそれに比べはるかに大きかった...|$|R

40|$|This project {{endeavored}} to expand experimental data on erosion control blankets and develop {{greater understanding of}} how blankets and erosion principles interact. Blankets that are effective in reducing raindrop impact may become ineffective in controlling soil detachment and runoff (rill erosion) on longer slopes. This field study of erosion control products under artificial rainfall conditions was conducted at the Highway 10 overpass in Coon Rapids, Minnesota. Examining long slope lengths (60 feet and 100 feet), bare soil erosion was compared to erosion under straw blankets, wood fiber blankets, straw mulch, and sprayed emulsion. Measurements of runoff, erosion, and biomass (vegetative growth) were made in spring and fall under wet and dry conditions. Sediment loads for bare soil were 8 times larger than other treatments. Sediment loads were substantially smaller for the fall runs than the spring runs, {{largely due to the}} substantially increased vegetative cover (biomass). Shear stress partitioning for erosion control blankets was evaluated using a laboratory flume and hot-film anemometry. Erosion control blankets partition shear stress into form shear (the portion that acts on the blanket) and particle shear (the portion that acts on the soil particles). Blanket type, flow conditions, and fastener impacts were considered. Shear partitioning was found to be an important process in design and erosion modeling. Attempts were made to correlate sediment load and vegetative density data gathered by Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) with manufacturer's information on blanket characteristics.
