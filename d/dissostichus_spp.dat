40|$|Dissostichus eleginoides is {{proposed}} {{to be included}} in accordance with Article II 2 (a). It is known that the accumulated harvesting from the wild of this species for international trade by illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing operators has a detrimental impact on the species due to these activities making the annual harvest continually exceed the level that can be continued in perpetuity. Listing of Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsonii) on Appendix II of the Convention, in accordance with Article II 2 (b). Dissostichus mawsoni {{is proposed}} for inclusion in accordance with Article II 2 (b) in that the species resembles Dissostichus eleginoides closely such that a non-expert with reasonable effort is unlikely to be able to distinguish between them.

40|$|Exploratory {{fishing for}} {{toothfish}} (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>spp.)</b> in East Antarctica (Divisions 58. 4. 1 and 58. 4. 2) began in 2003. Robust stock assessments and catch limits according to CCAMLR decision rules {{remain to be}} determined for these Divisions. WG-FSA- 16 / 29 outlines the first multi-member toothfish exploratory fishery research plan for East Antarctica, including research objectives, methods and milestones in accordance with ANNEX 24 - 01 /A. In 2016, the Scientific Committee agreed that the research plan was appropriate to achieve its objectives (SC-CAMLR-XXXV, para. 3. 244). We present here a proposal for {{the continuation of the}} research plan as set out in WG-FSA- 16 / 29. All significant changes to the plan are outlined in Section A. A summary of data collection in 2016 / 17 (Section B), and issues arising from the 2016 / 17 season (Section C) are also provide...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} {{was carried out in}} February 1999 at South Georgia (Subarea 48. 3) {{to examine the effects of}} different weighting regimes on the incidental mortality of birds caught on longlines fishing for toothfish (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>spp.).</b> Three regimes were examined, with weights of 4. 25, 8. 5 and 12. 75 kg attached at 40 m intervals on a Spanishrigged longline. There was a significant reduction in bird mortality when 8. 5 kg was used compared to 4. 25 kg, but no further significant reduction when 12. 75 kg was used. Therefore to minimise seabird by-catch, line-weighting regimes of at least 8. 5 kg at 40 m intervals should be used. Results suggested that seabird by-catch on lines using effective weighting regimes may be even further reduced where all lines being set in the vicinity use effective line-weighting regimes. The importance of a good design in experiments of this type is emphasised, because even though conditions may be held as constant as possible within experiments, the ability to separate treatment effects from other sources of variation (e. g. environmental factors) must be preserved...|$|E
40|$|Key {{aspects of}} illegal, unreported and {{unregulated}} (IUU) fishing are grouped within four tactical challenges. These challenges are {{analogous to the}} four-block military dimensions of immediate action, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and psychological/information operations. They are nested within an overarching strategy focused on sustainable and responsible fishing, and are grouped within a tactical construct of five operational entities (beneficial owner, regulatory authority, Flag State, Port State and consumer). Sustainable and responsible fishing activities converge to meet the tactical challenges above through conservation measures agreed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). For fisheries management purposes, adaptable, flexible and tactical, execution of strategically formulated compliance-enforcement measures must be tailored to address higher-order goals, including coherent action for effective compliance-enforcement. CCAMLR 2 ̆ 7 s countering of Toothfish (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>spp.)</b> IUU fishing demonstrates how 2 ̆ 7 intuitive competences 2 ̆ 7 could be applied in a formative decision-making framework directed at overcoming situational disadvantages. Examples from contemporary military strategies (the three-block-war construct, the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide and Act) doctrine and manoeuvre conflict model) indicate that dynamic application of OODA competencies in a manoeuvre conflict framework are a useful, and novel, way to enhance the success of current efforts to counter IUU fishing activity and promote responsible fishing...|$|E
40|$|In the 2012 / 13 {{fishing season}} Spain began {{implementing}} a multi-annual Research Plan for Divisions 58. 4. 1 and 58. 4. 2 {{in order to}} estimate local biomass of <b>Dissostichus</b> <b>spp.</b> by means of two methods: depletion and tagging. In 2014 / 15 the vessel was unable to conduct the proposed research experience due to problems with a blade of the propeller, During the season 2015 / 16 is intended {{to make the same}} proposed research with some minor changes, always subject to the ice conditions, fulfilling Spain's commitment to return to the same fishing areas in order to study inter-annual variability and maximize tag recovery, as well as, to progress research in these SSRUs (58. 4. 1 H, G, D and C). Two research surveys have been already implemented in Division 58. 4. 1 and preliminary estimates of local biomass using Leslie depletion analyses have been obtained. Some recoveries of tagged toothfish have been made, both within-season and between-seasons recaptures and a preliminary Age-Length Key of Dissostichus mawsoni has been built after otholits reading from 58. 4. 1 division specimens. All these data will allow a robust stock assessment attempt {{by the end of this}} multiyear research survey...|$|E
40|$|China's rapid {{economic}} development has determined profound changes in seafood consumption patterns, and nowadays besides the traditional luxury seafood, high-quality marine fish are consumed. Among these is Anoplopoma fimbria (Sablefish), a highly priced {{species on the}} Chinese market. A recent molecular survey on products sold online in China found that all the analyzed products sold as Yin Xue, used to indicate A. fimbria, were instead <b>Dissostichus</b> <b>spp.,</b> a genus of fish extremely vulnerable to overfishing (Xiong et al., 2016). Considering this {{and the lack of}} a standardized naming system for seafood species in China, an initial search was conducted to identify all the possible Chinese names indicating A. fimbria. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the challenges of the online market with regards to frauds for fish species substitution. DNA barcoding was employed to verify the identity of 42 products sold on e-commerce platforms as Sablefish. Moreover, the information reported on the webpage and on the label was analyzed according to the Chinese regulation in force. All the PCR products gave readable sequences. By using the IDs analysis on BOLD and the BLAST analysis on GenBank all the samples were unambiguously identified at the species level. Of the 42 products sold as Sablefish, only 6 (14. 3 %) were molecularly identified as this species, while 32 (76. 2 %) were identified as Dissostichus eleginoides (Patagonian Toothfish) and 4 (9. 5 %) as D. mawsoni (Antarctic Toothfish), highlighting an alarming overall misrepresentation rate of 85. 7 % and implications for the management of these species' fisheries. The combined analysis of all the information of the webpages and the labels allowed us to hypothesize unintentional and intentional mislabeling. Our findings suggest the possible existence of a trade pattern enabling IUU fishing operators to launder illegal catches of Toothfish through mislabeling...|$|E
40|$|Exploratory {{fishing for}} {{toothfish}} (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>spp.)</b> in East Antarctica (Divisions 58. 4. 1 and 58. 4. 2) began in 2003. Robust stock assessments and catch limits according to CCAMLR decision rules {{remain to be}} determined for these Divisions. Multiple research plans are currently in place by Australia (commenced 2015 / 16), France (commencing 2016 / 17), Japan (commencing 2016 / 17), Republic of Korea (commenced 2012 / 13) and Spain (commenced 2012 / 13). WG-SAM- 16 welcomed plans for one consolidated research plan to be presented by all proponents of research in Divisions 58. 4. 1 and 58. 4. 2 to WG-FSA- 16 (WG-SAM- 16 para. 3. 12). The Working Group also requested that measurable research milestones be developed to progress an assessment of toothfish stock/s in the area (WG-SAM- 16 para. 3. 13). We present here an updated research proposal including the research plans of Australia (WG-SAM- 16 / 09), France (WG-SAM- 16 / 01 & 16 / 02), Japan (WG-SAM- 16 / 04 & 16 / 05), Republic of Korea (WG-SAM- 16 / 17) and Spain (WG-SAM- 16 / 10). The continuation of standardised longline surveys, in conjunction with fish tagging, biological measurements, aging and genetic approaches {{will be used to}} develop stock assessments and inform the necessary considerations of spatial structure, biomass and connectivity of toothfish populations. Environmental data from CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) loggers, benthic video cameras (BVC) and archival tags will contribute to models of toothfish habitat use. These models will inform spatial management approaches for toothfish, and the conservation of representative areas of benthic biodiversity. Additional outcomes include improving our understanding of trophic relationships and ecosystem function through a stable isotope study; providing information on the distribution, relative abundance, and life histories of bycatch species; and mapping of the bathymetry of fishable areas...|$|E
