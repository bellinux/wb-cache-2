5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes {{can be seen in the}} lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional <b>joiners</b> who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{people became}} very rich from <b>Joiner's</b> {{discovery}} (including Hunt) but <b>Joiner</b> {{was not one}} of them. At his death his assets were listed as [...] "of nominal value". <b>Joiner</b> died penniless on March 27, 1947.|$|R
50|$|Michael <b>Joiner</b> aka Michael Jeffrey <b>Joiner</b> (born 1958) is an American actor, {{stand-up}} comedian, {{and film}} maker. <b>Joiner</b> gained exposure when he starred in Sony Picture's The Grace Card with Oscar winner Louis Gossett, Jr. in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|A. D. [...] "Doc" [...] Lloyd {{convinced}} <b>Joiner</b> {{to drill}} {{for oil in}} East Texas. <b>Joiner</b> mailed out a prospectus written by Lloyd to seek financing for his wildcatting. After collecting enough financial backing, <b>Joiner</b> began drilling in Rusk County. <b>Joiner</b> and his crew drilled for three years beginning in 1927 with rusted, third-hand equipment. At one point, a geologist from Texaco came by and joked, [...] "I'll drink every barrel of oil {{you get out of}} that hole." [...] Despite the opposition, <b>Joiner</b> was convinced of the possibility of oil in Rusk County. Beginning in 1930, <b>Joiner</b> began to drill eight miles west of Henderson, Texas, on the farm of Daisy Bradford. Using a flimsy pine rig and battered tools, his first two wells were unsuccessful. Eventually, at 8 p.m. on October 3, 1930, the Daisy Bradford Number 3 struck oil. The ensuing gusher sent the area into a frenzy. <b>Joiner</b> was nicknamed [...] "Dad" [...] because he was the father of the oil strike.|$|R

50|$|In 1944, Steiner {{opened his}} {{carpenters}} shop in Liestal, Switzerland. He invented {{a system in}} 1956 that he called the Lamello Joining System which {{is now known as}} the biscuit <b>joiner</b> or plate <b>joiner.</b> He also produced the first portable plate <b>joiner</b> in the late 1960s. In 1969, his family operation was incorporated under the name Lamello AG.|$|R
25|$|These include, {{from the}} period 1887–1901: <b>joiners,</b> contractors, carters, midwives, ladies' nurses, invalid attendants, seamen, master mariners, {{apprentice}} engineers, wire-weavers, spirit merchants, fruiterers, master bakers, elementary teachers and scholars.|$|E

25|$|For most {{portable}} plate <b>joiners,</b> a nominal 4 inch or 100mm diameter blade {{is used for}} the #0, #10, #20 biscuit cuts. The blade is set deeper for joining the larger biscuits. Most blades have 4, 6, or 8 teeth and fit a 7/8 inch or 22mm arbor. The thickness of the blade is typically 0.156 to 0.160 inch or nominally 4mm.|$|E

50|$|<b>Joiner</b> {{had worked}} around {{transformers}} as an electrician since 1973. During his electrical work, the dielectric fluid {{used as a}} coolant for the transformers got {{into his eyes and}} mouth, and stuck to his arms and hands. In 1983, it was discovered that the fluid in some of its transformers contained toxic PCBs. Later, in 1991, <b>Joiner</b> was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. He sued General Electric, the manufacturer of the transformers and dielectric fluid. <b>Joiner</b> had been a smoker for eight years and there was a history of lung cancer in his family. <b>Joiner</b> alleged that his exposure to PCBs “promoted” his cancer. He claimed that, {{had it not been for}} his exposure to these substances, his cancer would not have developed for many years, if at all. General Electric claimed there was no evidence that <b>Joiner</b> suffered significant exposure to PCBs and that there was no admissible scientific evidence that PCBs promoted <b>Joiner's</b> cancer.|$|R
25|$|Apart from {{agriculture}} and related industries, village life comprised many other trading activities necessary to a self-sufficient community. <b>Joiners,</b> plumbers, builders, drapers, bakers, butchers, fishmongers, publicans, carters, undertakers and bankers all {{managed to make}} a living from premises within the village boundaries. Modern life, ease of travel and changes in the nature of economic thinking have inevitably led to the depletion of local businesses.|$|E
25|$|The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and <b>Joiners</b> of America often simply, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters (UBC) {{was formed}} in 1881 by Peter J. McGuire and Gustav Luebkert. It {{has become one of}} the largest trade unions in the United States, and through chapters, and locals, there is {{international}} cooperation that poises the brotherhood for a global role. For example, the North American Chapter has over 520,000 members throughout the continent.|$|E
25|$|The {{generators}} {{were built}} at the Washington Navy Yard by master <b>joiners</b> who fashioned a contraption of copper plumbing and tanks which, when filled with sulfuric acid and iron filings, would yield hydrogen gas. The generators were Lowe's own design and were considered a marvel of engineering. They were designed to be loaded into box crates that could easily fit on a standard buckboard. The generators took more time to build than the balloons and were not as readily available as the first balloon.|$|E

25|$|Ullico {{was caught}} up in a second {{conflict}} of interest scandal in 2002. In June 1998, the New York City local of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and <b>Joiners</b> of America hired Zenith Administrators, a former Ullico subsidiary, to oversee the union's $1.7 billion pension and benefit funds. In 2002, federal prosecutors and the United States Department of Labor investigated the company for allegedly obtaining the contract through the influence of international union president Douglas J. McCarron—who was a director of Ullico. The Labor Department ended up suing Ullico and Zenith Administrators for mismanaging the union's funds.|$|E
25|$|Matrix schemes use {{the same}} {{fraudulent}} non-sustainable system as a pyramid; here, the participants pay to join a waiting list for a desirable product, which {{only a fraction of}} them can ever receive. Since matrix schemes follow the same laws of geometric progression as pyramids, they are subsequently as doomed to collapse. Such schemes operate as a queue, where the person at head of the queue receives an item such as a television, games console, digital camcorder, etc. when a certain number of new people join the end of the queue. For example, ten <b>joiners</b> may be required for the person at the front to receive their item and leave the queue. Each joiner is required to buy an expensive but potentially worthless item, such as an e-book, for their position in the queue. The scheme organizer profits because the income from <b>joiners</b> far exceeds the cost of sending out the item to the person at the front. Organizers can further profit by starting a scheme with a queue with shill names that must be cleared out before genuine people get to the front. The scheme collapses when no more people are willing to join the queue. Schemes may not reveal, or may attempt to exaggerate, a prospective joiner's queue position, a condition that essentially means the scheme is a lottery. Some countries have ruled that matrix schemes are illegal on that basis.|$|E
25|$|Variation {{selectors}} are {{not required}} for Arabic and Latin cursive characters, where substitution of glyphs can occur based on context: glyphs may be connected together {{depending on whether the}} character is the initial character in a word, the final character, a medial character or an isolated character. These types of glyph substitution are easily handled by the context of the character with no other authoring input involved. Authors may also use special-purpose characters such as <b>joiners</b> and non-joiners to force an alternate form of glyph where it would not otherwise appear. Ligatures are similar instances where glyphs may be substituted simply by turning ligatures on or off as a rich text attribute.|$|E

30|$|In addition, Mathieu and Zajac’s (1990) {{meta-analysis}} {{provided evidence}} that married employees {{are likely to}} exhibit slightly higher levels of organizational commitment than those of unmarried employees (Chiu & Ng 1999 : p. 489). For instance, <b>Joiner</b> and Bakalis (2006) provided similar findings to those of Mathieu and Zajac’s study (1990). Also, tenure (<b>Joiner</b> and Bakalis 2006; Hrebiniak and Alutto 1972; Angle and Perry 1983; Mottaz 1988; Iverson and Buttigieg 1999), education level and marital status (<b>Joiner</b> and Bakalis 2006) {{have been shown to}} be related to organizational commitment. <b>Joiner</b> and Bakalis (2006) also found that tenure was negatively associated with commitment.|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time there were five cotton {{manufacturers}} in the area: J.G. Clayton and Nelson, Greenhalgh & Co (both at Albert Mills, on what was then Workhouse Lane); Lord, Frears & Bro. (Whitefield New Mill); Francis Mather (Whitefield Mill); and Worthington & Co (Victoria Mills, Unsworth). There were also two smallware manufacturers in the area, being Prestwich Smallware Co (on Hardmans Green, Besses) and the Victoria Smallware Co on Narrow Lane. There were also at least two firms in the building trade: John Jackson & Son, builder and <b>joiners,</b> on Livesey Street; and F.M. & H. Nuttall, builders and stonemasons, who were on Moss Lane and later had their stoneyard adjoining the west side of Whitefield railway station.|$|E
25|$|The Iron Workers {{soon found}} {{themselves}} {{at war with}} the AFL and, in particular, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and <b>Joiners</b> of America. The Carpenters claimed that pile-driving work, which was done primarily by Iron Workers in many areas, belonged to them and convinced the Building Trades Department to go along with them. When the Iron Workers refused to relinquish this work the AFL suspended it from membership in 1917. Other unions, such as the Lathers, then claimed that work that had historically been done by iron workers belonged to them instead. Unable to call on the support of other AFL unions in its fights with employers, the Iron Workers relented the following year and ceded pile driving work, with the exception of work related to bridge building, to the Carpenters.|$|E
25|$|In London, {{he joined}} a small trade union, the Progressive Society of Carpenters and <b>Joiners,</b> {{to which he was}} elected {{secretary}} in 1854, and chairman in 1858. He believed that progress could be made if all trade unions representing the building trades were united in one society, so in 1859 organised the Building Trades Conference. At the conference, the unions agreed to demand a maximum working day of nine hours from their employers. The employers refused, resulting in strike action and a lockout. Eventually the unions conceded, but due to his actions Potter became a prominent figure in the New Model Unions movement. He was regarded as a more intellectual, 'respectable' trade unionist, due in part to his smart appearance and restrained public speaking style. He was made an executive member of the London Trades Council (LTC).|$|E
