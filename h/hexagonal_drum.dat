50|$|The {{church of}} Norashen is {{cruciform}} in plan {{with a single}} dodecagonal drum above, and twelve long windows located under a conical umbrella style dome. A small cupola sits {{at the peak of}} a gable on the roof. It has six slender columns that hold up a decorative arched <b>hexagonal</b> <b>drum</b> and small conical dome.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 the {{lighthouse}} was converted to operate using Light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, the first lighthouse in Europe to do so. The new lighting system consists of six vertical panels each with four bulbs; these panels are {{mounted on a}} rotating <b>hexagonal</b> <b>drum,</b> which reproduces the original light characteristic of one flash every five seconds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church is}} located on a rise above a county highway. It is a simple frame {{building}} that rests on a concrete foundation. [...] There are four stained glass windows on the side walls. On the roof above the main entrance is a spire that rests on a square base and a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>drum.</b> To {{the north of the}} church building is the cemetery.|$|E
40|$|Graphene, a {{carbon-based}} two-dimensional material, has remarkable {{electrical and}} mechanical properties, {{making it an}} ideal material for studying the Nanoelectromechanical Systems (NEMS). In this thesis, {{we focus on the}} performance of few-layer graphene NEMS resonators in drumhead geometry. We will discuss the experimental techniques and studies on their intrinsic properties, nonlinear dynamics and quality factor. We report our measurement on the coefficient of the Duffing nonlinearity, suggesting a geometric origin of this term. The line width of resonance at large drives is enhanced by nonlinear damping, in qualitative agreement with recent theory of damping by radiation of in-plane phonons. The amplitude of response is parametrically amplified due to periodic thermal expansion from the ac source-drain voltage, resulting an anomalously large line width at the largest drives. We observe Q scales inversely with the temperature. We develop a model that includes the intermodal coupling in tensioned graphene resonators and demonstrate Q is determined by the stochastic frequency broadening rather than frictional damping. We will also report our work on a graphene/h-BN (<b>hexagonal</b> boron nitride) <b>drum</b> resonator and discuss its potential applications...|$|R
50|$|Christ Church is {{constructed}} in red sandstone with slate roofs. Its plan {{consists of a}} five-bay nave, a short chancel, and a steeple at the southwest corner. The tower is square with angle buttresses, a doorway on the east side, lancet windows on {{the south and west}} faces, and bell openings consisting of twin louvred lancets. The summit of the tower broaches into a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>drum</b> with louvred lucarnes, above which is the spire, also containing lucarnes. All the windows in the church are lancets.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{consists of}} a domed structure with two concentric open arcades, that is: with no lateral walls closing it in. The dome, resting on a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>drum,</b> is made of timber and is supported by six columns which together create the inner arcade. The second, outer row of eleven columns creates an eleven-sided outer arcade. The qibla wall contains the mihrab or prayer niche and is flanked by two smaller columns. There are a total of seventeen columns in the structure, excluding the mihrab. It is known from historical sources that initially {{there used to be}} twenty columns, indicating a radical rebuilding phase, probably in the 13th century. The Dome of the Chain has a diameter of 14 m, making it the third largest building on the Haram after the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock.|$|E
