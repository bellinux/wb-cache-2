40|$|The authors {{report the}} {{sequence}} {{analysis of the}} capsid protein-encoding gene (ORF 2) of a calicivirus strain recently isolated in Italy from a pup with enteritis. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate is highly similar to field and reference feline caliciviruses (FCVs).

40|$|Leishmaniasis is {{a global}} disease found {{anywhere}} the temperature is warm enough for the sandfly vector to survive and anywhere that lacks rigorous vector control programs. Twelve million people are infected annually with this parasitic disease. Symptoms range from a minor cutaneous lesion at the bite site caused by dermotropic species such as L. major, to a life-threatening disease with multiple organ involvement, caused by viscerotropic species such as L. infantum. Both species of Leishmania co-occur in multiple countries, leading {{to the risk of}} co-infection. Previous research has shown that BALB/c mice first infected with the cutaneous form of leishmaniasis, followed by later infection with the visceral form of the disease, show increased disease severity. My research has focused on exploring how antibodies can be used to measure this disease exacerbation. Studies have shown that there is a strong association between L. major specific antibodies and increased disease upon secondary infection with L. infantum. Control animals inoculated with serum from uninfected mice did not have any disease enhancement. Overall, mice exposed previously to either L. major induced antibodies or L. major infection followed by exposure to L. infantum have increased parasitemia in visceral organs relative to control mice. Antibody enhancement due to <b>interspecies</b> <b>infection</b> has not previously been described in Leishmania infections. This research could have real world consequences on the practice of leishmanization that many parents practice to prevent disfiguring scars on their children.

40|$|AbstractAlpha human papillomaviruses (HPVs) {{are among}} the most common sexually {{transmitted}} agents of which a subset causes cervical neoplasia and cancer in humans. Alpha-PVs have also been identified in non-human primates although few studies have systematically characterized such types. We cloned and characterized 10 distinct types of PVs from exfoliated cervicovaginal cells from different populations of female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) originating from China and Indonesia. These include 5 novel genotypes and 5 previously identified genotypes found in rhesus (Macaca mulatta) (RhPV- 1, RhPV-a, RhPV-b and RhPV-d) and cynomolgus macaques (MfPV-a). Type-specific primers were designed to amplify the complete PV genomes using an overlapping PCR method. Four MfPVs were associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The most prevalent virus type was MfPV- 3 (formerly RhPV-d), which was identified in 60 % of animals with CIN. In addition, the complete genomes of variants of MfPV- 3 and RhPV- 1 were characterized. These variants are 97. 1 % and 97. 7 % similar across the L 1 nucleotide sequences with the prototype genomes, respectively. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses indicate that these novel MfPVs cluster together within the α 12 PV species closely related to the α 9 (e. g., HPV 16) and α 11 species (e. g., HPV 34), and all share a most recent common ancestor. Our data expand the molecular diversity of non-human primate PVs and suggest a recent expansion of alpha-PV species groups. Moreover, identification of an overlapping set of MfPVs in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques indicates that non-human primate alpha-PVs might not be strictly species-specific and may represent past <b>interspecies</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|E
40|$|A PCR typing assay was {{developed}} to identify rotavirus P types (VP 4 specificity) of bovine NCDV, UK, and B 223 strains and porcine OSU and Gottfried strains. Thirty-nine human and animal strains representing all known, and some undefined, rotavirus P types were used to develop and evaluate the specificity of the method. No cross-amplification was observed. The PCR results agreed with previous characterizations by monoclonal antibodies, sequence analysis, and hybridization assays, except for the Gottfried strain, which showed a P type distinct from the human asymptomatic strains. Analysis of {{a small number of}} field specimens suggested a high level of VP 4 polymorphism among porcine strains. The assay should be of value in typing field isolates and tracing <b>interspecies</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R
40|$|From {{immunological}} and phylogenetic {{analyses of}} H 3 influenza viruses isolated from pigs and ducks in the People's Republic of China (China), Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan, between 1968 and 1982, {{we arrived at}} the following conclusions. The H 3 haemagglutinin and N 2 neuraminidase genes from swine isolates can be segregated into four mammalian lineages, including: (i) the earliest human strains; (ii) early swine strains including Hong Kong isolates from 1976 - 1977; (iii) an intermediate strain between the early swine and recent human strains; and (iv) recent human strains. In this study we found an unusual swine strain (sw/Hong Kong/ 127 / 82) belonging to the third lineage which behaved like those of the early swine-like lineage in the haemagglutination inhibition test; but neuraminidase inhibition profiles with monoclonal antibodies indicated that this virus is related to late human strains. On the basis of pairwise comparisons of complete or partial nucleotide sequences the genes encoding the three polymerase proteins (PB 2, PB 1, PA), the nucleoprotein, the membrane protein and possibly the nonstructural proteins of sw/Hong Kong/ 127 / 82 are of the swine H 1 N 1 lineage, whereas genes encoding the two surface glycoproteins belong to the human H 3 N 2 lineage. In contrast, all RNA segments of one swine isolate (sw/Hong Kong/ 81 / 78) {{are similar to those of}} recent human H 3 N 2 viruses. This study indicated that frequent <b>interspecies</b> <b>infections</b> between human and swine hosts appeared to occur during 1976 - 82. Although the evolutionary rates of human (0. 0122 /site/year), swine (0. 0127 /site/year) and avian (0. 0193 /site/year) virus genes are similar when based upon synonymous substitutions, nonsynonymous substitutions indicated that viral genes derived from human and swine viruses evolved about three times faster (0. 0026 - 0. 0027 /site/year) than those of avian viruses (0. 0008 /site/year). Furthermore, the evolutionary mechanism by which human and swine H 3 haemagglutinin genes evolve at a similar rate, based on nonsynonymous substitutions, appeared to be quite different from previous evidence which showed that human H 1 haemagglutinin genes evolved three times faster than those of swine viruses. However, comparison of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions in the antigenic sites (A-E) of haemagglutinin molecules demonstrated that swine viruses evolve at a rate that is about one fifth to one tenth that of human viruses, reflecting the conservative nature of the antigenic structure in the former. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bovine viral {{diarrhea}} virus (BVDV) is a pestivirus which infects {{both domestic}} animals and wildlife species worldwide. In China, cattle are often infected with BVDV of different genotypes, {{but there is}} very limited knowledge regarding BVDV infection in Chinese yaks and the genetic diversity of the virus. The objectives {{of this study were}} to detect viral infection in yaks in Qinghai, China and to determine the genotypes of BVDV based on analysis of the 5 ′untranslated region (5 ′UTR) and N-terminal protease (N pro) region. Results: Between 2010 and 2012, 407 blood samples were collected from yaks with or without clinical signs in six counties of Qinghai Province. Ninety-eight samples (24 %) were found to be positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting a conserved region of BVDV- 1 and BVDV- 2. The nucleotide sequences of the 5 ′UTR and complete N pro region were determined for 16 positive samples. Phylogenetic reconstructions demonstrated that all 16 samples belong to subgenotypes BVDV- 1 b, BVDV- 1 d and BVDV- 1 q. Conclusions: This study provides, for the first time, molecular evidence for BVDV infection in yaks in Qinghai involving multiple subgenotypes of BVDV- 1. This may have occurred under three possible scenarios: <b>interspecies</b> transmission, natural <b>infection,</b> and the use of vaccines contaminated with BVDV. The results have important implications for yak production and management in China, and specifically indicate that unscientific vaccination practices should be stopped and bio-security increased...|$|R
