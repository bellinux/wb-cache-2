5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion <b>is</b> <b>likely.</b> A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion <b>is</b> <b>likely,</b> the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion <b>is</b> <b>likely,</b> and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E
