5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and <b>kneading</b> of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited {{by one of the}} cats raising and tilting its head.|$|E
25|$|Emigrant families, {{who were}} mostly middle-class, prided {{themselves}} on preparing a good table. Although operating Dutch ovens and <b>kneading</b> dough was difficult on the trail, many baked good bread and even pies.|$|E
50|$|Cats have scent glands on the {{underside}} of their paws. When they <b>knead</b> or scratch objects or people, it is likely these pheromones are transferred to the person or object being <b>kneaded</b> or scratched.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>kneaded</b> erasers do {{not wear}} away like other erasers, {{they can become}} {{saturated}} and unable to absorb any more graphite or charcoal. In that case a <b>kneaded</b> eraser will actually leave marks on the paper instead of erasing them.|$|R

25|$|During the crushing, <b>kneading</b> and {{extraction}} of olive fruit to obtain olive oil, oleuropein, demethyloleuropein and ligstroside are hydrolyzed by endogenous beta-glucosidases to form aldehydic aglycones. The aglycones become soluble {{in the oil}} phase, whereas the glycosides remain in the water phase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kneading</b> {{is not a}} very {{accurate}} translation of this activity. It may better be translated as '' or the like. The key principle of this creative activity is the combining of solid and liquid together to make a paste or dough-like substance.|$|E
25|$|Massage devices {{included}} two- or four-person foot vibrators, {{a mechanical}} slapping massage device, and a <b>kneading</b> apparatus that was advertised in 1909 {{to sell for}} $150.00. Kellogg advocated mechanical massage, a branch of mechanotherapy, for cases of anemia, general debility, and muscular or nervous weakness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kneaded</b> erasers {{are also}} useful for making impromptu sculptures to sketch from. <b>Kneaded</b> erasers are mostly used for {{slightly}} erasing but not fully erasing {{the content of}} graphite.

25|$|Traditionally, Nunivaarmiut Cup'ig skin {{clothing}} was washed in urine, but by 1939 only one family {{was doing this}} regularly. The dirty parts of a parka were immersed in a wooden urine dish and the fur kneaded down into the urine with a movement like <b>kneading</b> bread dough. Then the garment was shaken out and hung up to dry. Sometimes it was rinsed in clear water.|$|E
25|$|Extrusion is {{the process}} of <b>kneading</b> and shaping {{at the same time and}} in the matter of a few minutes. This process takes place in an {{extruder}} which is a grooved extrusion cylinder equipped with an extrusion worm which is a shaft with deep thread around its core. The extrusion worm kneads and moves the dough forward and presses it through the dies in the head of the extruder. The longitudinal grooves in the cylinder reduce the friction and improves the movement of the dough. Both the worm and the cylinder are made of stainless steel, but the worm has a Teflon coating to decrease friction.|$|E

Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry coupled with evolved gas analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy {{were used for the}} thermal studies and X-ray powder diffraction and infrared spectroscopy provided complementary information. Thermal studies of benzoic acid with the cyclodextrins showed significant interactions in both physical and <b>kneaded</b> mixtures of benzoic acid/b-cyclodextrin and benzoic acid/hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin. Interactions in the <b>kneaded</b> benzoic acid/g-cyclodextrin mixtures were the most extensive as might be expected for the cyclodextrin with the largest molecular cavity. The results for the salicylic acid/b-cyclodextrin and salicylic acid/hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin mixtures were similar to those for benzoic acid/b-cyclodextrin and benzoic acid/hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin. Again, the <b>kneaded</b> salicylic acid/g-cyclodextrin mixture showed the most interaction...|$|R
25|$|For {{a number}} of days, Jaynes is forced to labor for his master Augustus by {{cleaning}} his ice cave and <b>kneading</b> krakt (the Snow Honkies' word for whale blubber). Augustus eventually gestures to Jaynes that he wants Little Debbie cakes by showing him an empty wrapper, which leads {{them back to the}} campsite and Garth. Jaynes and Garth then plot an escape plan for the enslaved crew as Augustus eats out of a bag of sugar and eventually falls ill and vomits. Jaynes and Garth drag the Snow Honkie back to the mouth of the ice caves, where they secretly plan to meet with the others. After returning, Augustus (who is translated by Pym) drunkenly announces to Jaynes that he has been sold to Sausage Nose, an abusive master who owns both Jeffree and Carlton. Jaynes realizes that he must escape with the crew soon or they will be enslaved forever. He attempts to convince Booker Jaynes to escape with him and Garth, but fails to persuade him as Booker is in an intimate relationship with his mistress, Hunka. Jaynes manages to escape by himself to the mouth of the cave, but sees that both snowmobiles have been destroyed by Pym. Garth and Jaynes tie Pym up and begin {{to walk away from the}} ice caves with a ration of seasoned krakt from Booker as their own source of food. Garth unfortunately eats it all and leaves everyone to starve.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is <b>kneading</b> dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E
500|$|Disruption: Known in the Western tea {{industry}} as [...] "disruption" [...] or [...] "leaf maceration", the teas are bruised or torn {{in order to}} promote and quicken oxidation. The leaves may be lightly bruised on their edges by shaking and tossing in a bamboo tray [...] or tumbling in baskets. More extensive leaf disruption can be done by <b>kneading,</b> rolling, tearing, and crushing, usually by machinery. The bruising breaks down the structures inside and outside of the leaf cells and allows from the co-mingling of oxidative enzymes with various substrates, which allows for the beginning of oxidation. This also releases some of the leaf juices, which may aid in oxidation and change the taste profile of the tea.|$|E

500|$|... "Power Hungry" [...] {{was written}} by {{consulting}} producer Jason Cahill and playwright Julia Cho, each of which {{would go on to}} write other first season episodes. Christopher Misiano directed the installment. According to Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci, series writers often approached episodes' fringe cases by coming up with an idea and then asking science consultants to [...] "justify it scientifically." [...] For [...] "Power Hungry", Cho and others brainstormed the concept of a computer virus being able to spread to humans. She explained, [...] "And through <b>kneading</b> that idea over and over again, we {{came up with the idea}} of a character, Joseph, who would start waking up to this power of his to be able to actually control electronic- or computer-driven devices." [...] New Media consultant and scientist Glen Whitman, who later co-wrote some Fringe episodes, noted that the science depicted in the episode was not totally impossible. [...] "It is true that human beings as a result of the electrical activity in our brains, we do all have a very very weak magnetic field around our heads," [...] he said. [...] "And that's in part what is sensed by an EEG. So the notion was, 'how can you amplify that'"? ...|$|E
500|$|The {{technique}} for producing black tea was first {{developed during the}} late Ming Dynasty Wuyishan, Fujian either resulting from the over-oxidation of tea-leaves during the manufacture of oolong tea [...] or indirectly from the methods of manufacturing green and white teas. In the early 1600s, tea producers in the Wuyi Mountains began <b>kneading</b> the sun-withered tea leaves to macerate them, then allowed them to dry under the sun, thus reaching full oxidation and producing [...] "Gongfu" [...] black tea (工夫紅茶). When there was insufficient sun and temperatures were low, the withered leaves would be processed indoors in warmed rooms and allowed to fully oxidize, then smoked dry over pine fires thus producing lapsang souchong. According to oral traditions of the region, the discovery of lapsang souchong processing was due to military troops passing through a Wuyi's tea factory during {{the last years of}} the Ming Dynasty, causing delays to tea leaf processing thus resulting in a completely oxidized leaf that the producer salvaged by drying over a fire built from pine branches. By the Qing Dynasty, both lapsang souchong and gongfu black tea were well recognized in China and noted in [...] "Records on Yiwu mountain" [...] (武夷山志) by the scholar Dong Tiangong (董天工).|$|E
500|$|Like {{almost all}} members of the Felidae, cats have protractable and {{retractable}} claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, <b>kneading,</b> or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The fifth front claw (the dewclaw) is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth [...] "finger". This special feature of the front paws, {{on the inside of the}} wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and dogs. It has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyly (extra toes and claws). These are particularly common along the northeast coast of North America.|$|E
