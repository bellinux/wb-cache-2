40|$|Big {{sagebrush}} (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) steppe is {{a widespread}} habitat throughout eastern Montana and supports several sagebrush-dependent species including Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). We sampled 24 burned-unburned paired sites in central and southeastern Montana dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush (ssp. wyomingensis). Time since fire ranged from 4 to 67 years. Prescribed burns and wildfires typically resulted in the complete mortality of big sagebrush. We found negligible post-fire Wyoming big sagebrush recovery for 17 of the 24 sites and the oldest burn (67 years) was only 8 percent recovered. Perennial grass cover increased 27 percent and 20 percent following prescribed fire and wildfire, respectively; western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii) accounted {{for most of this}} increase. Annual grass cover increased by 11 percent due primarily to <b>field</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus arvensis, formerly B. japonicus). Plant species richness significantly declined in burned plots compared to unburned controls. There was no change after burning in overall sub-shrub or forb cover or the density of Cichorieae forbs that are important for successful Greater Sage-grouse brood rearing. Managers concerned about Greater Sage-grouse and other sage-dependent species should be extremely cautious with prescribed burns and wildfires in this region. Fire will likely eliminate sagebrush habitat, increase weedy annual grass cover and reduce species richness; sagebrush cover could take a century or more to recover to pre-burn conditions...|$|E

The archeological site Kalnik-Igrišče has {{during the}} last two decades {{become one of the most}} {{prominent}} Bronze Age sites in Croatia primarily thanks to the results of the systematic archeological excavations which have been conducted since 1988 (Majnarić-Pandžić 1992; Vrdoljak 1992; Vrdoljak, Forenbaher 1995). The site – where the remains of settlements from the Copper, Bronze, Late Iron Age and Roman period were found during the years – is situated on the southern terraces of the Kalnik at 500 meters above sea level. Based on the settlement remains and archaeological artefacts analysis and according to the potential of the Kalnik-Igrišče site, new systematic excavations were initiated by the Institute for Archeology under the leadership of Dr. Sc. Snježana Karavanić. Research began in 2006, and the very next year it was clear that Kalnik is extremely complex multilayered site with layers from different periods of prehistory. The most abundant finds date to the Late Bronze Age. In 2008 archaeological excavations at Kalnik-Igrišče yielded the remains of a Late Bronze Age structure, dated to the 9 th century BC based on the radiocarbon measurements of charred cereal grains (Karavanić 2008, Karavanić 2009). On the house floor among broken pottery an abundant sample of carbonised grains were discovered. The collected samples were preserved in an excellent condition, carbonized by the fire that destroyed the house. A hearth was also discovered at the floor level, while the rest of the structure extends eastwards beyond the limits of the archaeological trench. A smaller section of the house was explored, measuring approximately 35 square meters. In 2012 the trench was investigated fully and it was concluded that the house rested on wooden pillars which were firmly implanted in the rocky subsoil. Non-destructive investigation methods such as field surveying and geophysical probing were conducted on the site during 2012 and 2013. The further article elucidates the context of the uncovered Bronze Age structure and contains a short overview of the pottery finds, together with a detailed analysis of the archeobotanical material. The pottery are classified into four basic functional groups: bowls (most numerous), pots used to prepare food in the fireplace, amphorae and smaller vessels of different purposes and finer texture. The analysis of the full sample of the archeobotanical finds was conducted as part of a doctoral dissertation at the Department of Biology of the Faculty of Science in Zagreb (Mareković 2013). According to the archeobotanical analysis of the macrofossils, the following plant species were found in the analyzed sample ranging from most numerous to least: millet (Panicum miliaceum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), broad bean (Vicia faba L.), common wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum), emmer (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon), lentil (Lens culinaris), spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta), while oats (Avena), rye (Secale cereale), peas (Pisum sativum), acorn (Quercus), European wilde apple (Malus sylvestris), European cornel (Cornus mas) were not present to such an extent. The mentioned species were divided into four groups: These species were divided into 4 basic groups: 1. 	Cereals: millet (Panicum miliaceum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), common wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum), emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon), spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. Spelta), oat (Avena), rye (Secale cereale), foxtail millet (Setaria italica) 2. 	Legumes: broad bean (Vicia Faba L.), lentil (Lens culinaris), pea (Pisum sativum), 3. 	Useful wild woody plants: acorn (Quercus), wilde apple (Malus sylvestris), Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas) 4. 	Crop weeds. <b>Field</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus arvensis), rye brome (Bromus secalinus), barnyard millet (Echinochloa crus-galli), cleavers (Galium aparine), false cleavers (Galium spurium) The finds consist mostly of cereals (millet and barley). On the basis of the findings of weed (Galium aparine), which is connected with winter wheat, it can be concluded that the community gave preference to the autumn harvest by sowing winter wheat, while millet was sowed during the spring. Based on the very small proportion of weeds in the sample we assume that the community was well organized, and that it stored thoroughly cleaned cereals. The space in which the analysed samples were found might be associated with a domestic storage of food, that is, a store of a single household. The presence of isolated, but also mixed grains in the context of finds speaks of the storing of individual species on the one hand and mixed species on the other, which may point to the way food was prepared in the household...|$|E
40|$|Saline {{wastewater}} {{coming from}} the coal-fired power plants, {{owned and operated by}} PacifiCorp (Utah Power), has been applied at the Hunter and Huntington Research Farms in central Utah, U. S. A., since 1987, for irrigation of agricultural crops such as alfalfa, wheat, barley, etc. Researchers from Utah State University (USU), Brigham Young University (BYU), and PacifiCorp are involved in this multipurpose project. The primary goals of this research are to maximize crop production and evapotranspiration, to minimize runoff from the soil surface, to minimize leaching to the ground water, to determine the effect of salt accumulation on the transpiration of alfalfa and other forage crops, to create models of plant-soil-water-atmosphere interactions for use in predicting farm longevity and in determining the effects of farm management practices, to develop a data base for model validation, and to study the health hazards to the animals that consume the agricultural crops irrigated with saline wastewater. Only the first three goals are addresses in this report. We used the water balance approach, along with the continuous measurement of precipitation, irrigation (using the sprinkler system), and evapotranspiration (using the Bowen ratio system) to evaluate the annual and seasonal water balances of the alfalfa,, wheat, barley, and Hungarian <b>brome</b> <b>fields</b> irrigated with saline wastewater throughout the years (1987 - 2003). The results show that the soil moisture contents measured by neutron probe in the root zone and beyond are slightly lower {{at the end of the}} irrigation season compared to that measured in the beginning of the season. Also, the results indicate that by monitoring the amount of irrigation during the past 16 years, no surface runoff (which pollutes the fresh river water) or deep percolation (which pollutes the ground water) occurred. Also yield and evapotranspiration are likely to decrease only slightly for the coming years if saline wastewater is used for irrigation, and the meat products are safe for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|North American {{populations of}} {{grassland}} birds have been declining consistently {{for the past}} several decades. Grassland birds respond to multiple scales which encompass a spectrum of habitat variables, and the habitat scale of importance may depend on the response of interest. For practitioners, having knowledge of the effect of scale is useful because conservation efforts can be focused at the most appropriate scale. However, previous multi-scale studies of grassland birds and other taxa have rarely incorporated on-the-ground habitat management while simultaneously investigating site-specific species turnover dynamics (Chapter 1) and daily nest survival (Chapter 2). Also, habitat management-related studies often suffer when not accounting for inherent variation between fields, field landscapes, and study year; thus, to disentangle specific effects of management, it is important to account for this variation by using these factors as random effects within mixed-effects models (Chapter 3). Understanding multi-scale habitat relationships affecting site turnover, also known as dynamic occupancy, and daily nest survival rate (nest survival or DSR), as well as how multiple avian responses vary with grassland management would further benefit conservation decision making for focal species. I investigated dynamic occupancy and nest survival of both obligate and facultative grassland species relative to multi-scale habitat factors on private lands (Conservation Reserve Program) in northwest Illinois during 2011 - 2014. I also conducted a separate analysis focusing on how multiple avian responses, ranging from species presence/absence (P/A) to species-specific nest survival, are influenced by non-fire grassland management treatments. 	For dynamic occupancy, a combination of ≥ 2 scales always outperformed single-scale models for all species. Three of 7 species responded to either cumulative habitat management (proportion of field managed over the study period) or yearly management (33 % of field managed before a particular breeding season) regardless of dominant grass type. Of the 48 covariates appearing in top models across species for both dynamic and single-season occupancy, microhabitat covariates (42 %) were represented most often, followed by patch-scale (33 %) and landscape-scale (25 %) factors. Covariates with the most consistent effects and the greatest frequencies appearing in competitive (∆AIC ≤ 4) dynamic and single-season occupancy models included landscape forest cover (n = 10), surrounding patch grassland cover (n = 7), and field size (n = 6). In general, increasing levels of forest cover adjoining fields had consistently negative effects on occupancy, colonization, and persistence across species, while grassland surrounding fields and field size had positive effects on these responses. Microhabitat covariates better explained colonization and extinction across the focal species. Of the 22 habitat covariates in top colonization and extinction models, microhabitat variables were represented 50 % of the time, compared to 32 % and 18 % representation for patch-scale and landscape-scale covariates, respectively. I recommend that wildlife biologists utilize habitat management techniques to ensure grassland birds have different successional stages within their range of preferences. My results suggest that grassland disturbance, while influencing turnover dynamics of different species, may be less influential within smaller fields and landscapes dominated by forest cover. 	I analyzed the daily nest survival rate for 2 species (red-winged blackbirds and dickcissels) and 2 groups of nesting communities (ground and above-ground nesters). Temporal variables such as Julian date and stage of nest were significant predictors of nest survival for red-wings (50. 58 ∆AICc = best temporal model) and dickcissels (2. 28 ∆AICc = best temporal model) in addition to habitat covariates. In 3 of 4 analyses ≥ 2 habitat scales were better predictors of nest survival over one scale. For ground nesters the patch scale was be best predictor of nest survival. However, the best model for ground nesters did not have overwhelming support compared to the random model (1. 43 ∆AICc). The ground-nesting community appeared to suffer decreased nest survival with increasing proportion of surrounding grassland. The blackbird top model included nest- and landscape-scale covariates, and top models for dickcissels and the above-ground nesting community included the nest- and patch-scale covariates. Blackbirds had a significant increase in nest survival when nests were placed in areas with higher vegetation density and height (greater visual obstruction). Comparatively, the predictive ability of habitat covariates was not as strong for the other 3 analyses; however, notable patterns include dickcissel nest survival decreasing with increasing nest distance to edge and above-ground nests had increased nest survival with increasing patch perimeter-area-ratio. My results suggest different species are responding to different scales, but finer-scale habitat covariates generally help predict nest survival over course-scale habitat features, such as landscape covariates. Songbird nest survival maybe more influenced by fine-scale habitat characteristics such as nesting cover and field vegetation complexity and density, which can deter nest predators and reduce their search efficiency. In a way, this is positive news for practitioners working in grasslands patches located in less than ideal patch or landscape configurations, suggesting more effort could be focused on improving conditions for colonization and persistence of focal species (Chapter 1). By focusing management on dynamic occupancy responses, increasing potential nesting habitat and territory quality for focal species will likely follow. 	When investigating multiple avian responses to management, within a consistent mixed-effect modeling framework, it appeared that avian survey related responses were best supported, having consistently larger ∆AICc values for top models, when compared to nesting-related data. One explanation of this relative difference could be attributed sample size difference between analyses. Focusing on the effects of management, this analysis accounted for inherent variation across fields, year, and potentially field landscape, as random effects within all models. As suggested from Chapter 2, and despite a large sample of nests, explanation of DSR across all species and focal species showed little improvement with management covariates. <b>Brome</b> <b>fields</b> cumulatively managed with spray or spray/seed treatments (Chapter 1) appeared to respond most and likely explained general positive effects for red-winged blackbird and dickcissel abundance; however, this was at a cost to species abundance for bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Henslow’s sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), due to the release of tall forbs within the seed bank after spraying <b>brome</b> dominated <b>fields.</b> Dramatic vegetation responses in sprayed <b>brome</b> <b>fields</b> likely led to an overall decrease in obligate-grassland bird richness and conservation value on <b>brome</b> <b>field</b> types that were cumulatively management {{over the course of the}} study. These results suggest the importance of non-native <b>brome</b> CRP <b>fields</b> for certain grassland-obligate bird species, while also revealing the apparent decoupling of nest survival and other avian responses measured commonly. I suggest managers and researchers pay closer attention to variables affecting nesting abundance/density in grassland systems when possible and recognize the potential importance of non-native grasses for grassland-obligate birds in some regions...|$|R
40|$|As {{invasive}} plants {{become a}} greater threat to native ecosystems, {{we need to}} improve {{our understanding of the}} factors underlying their success and persis-tence. Over the past 30 years, the C 3 nonnative plant Bromus inermis (smooth brome) has been spreading throughout the central grasslands in North America. Invasion by this grass has resulted in the local displacement of natives, including the tallgrass species Panicum virgatum (switchgrass). To determine if factors related to resource availability and plant–soil interactions were conferring a com-petitive advantage on smooth <b>brome,</b> <b>field</b> plots were set up under varying nitrogen (N) levels. Plots composed of a 1 : 1 ratio of smooth brome and switchgrass were located in a restored tallgrass prairie and were randomly assigned one of the following three N levels: (a) NH 4 NO 3 added to in-crease available N, (b) sucrose added to reduce available N, and (c) no additions to serve as control. In addition, soil N status, soil respiration rates, plant growth, and litter decomposition rates were mon-itored. Results indicate that by the 2 nd year, the addition of sucrose significantly reduced avail-able soil N and additions of NH 4 NO 3 increased it. Further, smooth brome had greater tiller density, mass, and canopy interception of light on N-en-riched soils, whereas none of these characteristics were stimulated by added N in the case of switch-grass. This suggests that smooth brome may have a competitive advantage on higher-N soils. Smooth-brome plant tissue also had a lower carbon–nitro-gen (C:N) ratio and a higher decomposition rate than switchgrass and thus may cycle N more rap-idly in the plant–soil system. These differences suggest a possible mechanism for the persistence of smooth brome in the tallgrass prairie: Efficient recycling of nutrient-rich litter under patches of smooth brome may confer a competitive advantage that enables it to persist in remnant or restored prairies. Increased N deposition associated with human activity and changing land use may {{play a critical role in}} the persistence of smooth brome and other N-philic exotic species.

40|$|In a {{three year}} study, {{wintering}} systems utilizing the grazing of stockpiled perennial hay crop forages or corn crop residues {{were compared to}} maintaining cows in a drylot. In the summer of 1992, two cuttings of hay were harvested (June 22 and August 2) from three 10 -acre fields containing “Johnstone” endophyte-free tall fescue and “Spreador II” alfalfa, and one cutting of hay was harvested from three 10 - acre <b>fields</b> of smooth <b>brome</b> grass. “Arlington” red clover was frost-seeded into the smooth bromegrass fields in 1993 and into tall fescue-alfalfa and smooth bromegrass fields into 1994. Two cuttings of hay were harvested from all fields in subsequent years, and three-year average hay yields for tall fescue-alfalfa and smooth bromegrass-red clover were 4, 336 and 3, 481 pounds per acre, respectively. Regrowth of the forage following the August hay harvest of each year was accumulated for winter grazing. Following a killing frost in each year, two fields of each stockpiled forage were stocked with cows in midgestation at two acres per cow. Two 10 -acre fields of corn crop residues were also stocked at two acres per cow, following the grain harvest. Mean dry matter forage yields at the initiation of grazing were 1, 853, 2, 173 and 5, 797 pounds per acre for fields containing tall fescue-alfalfa, smooth bromegrass-red clover, and cornstalks, respectively. A drylot was stocked with 18 cows in 1992 and 1993 and 10 cows in 1994. All cows were fed hay as necessary to maintain a body condition score of five. During grazing, mean losses of organic matter were - 6. 4, - 7. 6, and - 10. 7 pounds per acre per cow from tall fescue-alfalfa, smooth bromegrass-red clover, and cornstalk fields. Average organic matter loss rates from stockpiled forages due to weathering alone were equal to only 30 % of the weathering losses of the corn crop residues. In vitro digestibility of both stockpiled forages and cornstalks decreased at equal rates during grazing each year, with respective annual loss rates of. 14,. 08, and. 06 % per day. Cows grazing corn crop residues required an average of 1, 321 pounds per cow less hay than cows maintained in the drylot to maintain equivalent body condition during the grazing season. Cows grazing tall fescue-alfalfa or smooth bromegrass-red clover had body weight gains and condition score changes equal to cows maintained in a drylot but required 64 % and 62 % less harvested hay than cows in the drylot during the grazing season. Over the entire stored forage cows grazing tall fescue-alfalfa and smooth bromegrass-red clover required an average of 2, 390 and 2, 337 pounds per cow less than those maintained in the drylot. Because less hay was needed to maintain cows grazing stockpiled forages, average annual excesses of 5, 629 and 3, 868 pounds of hay dry matter per cow remained in the stockpiled tall fescue-alfalfa and smooth bromegrass-red clover systems...|$|R
