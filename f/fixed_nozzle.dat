5000|$|Except for {{low-power}} applications, {{turbine blades}} {{are arranged in}} multiple stages in series, called compounding, which greatly improves efficiency at low speeds. A reaction stage is a row of <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzles</b> followed by a row of moving nozzles. Multiple reaction stages divide the pressure drop between the steam inlet and exhaust into numerous small drops, resulting in a pressure-compounded turbine. Impulse stages may be either pressure-compounded, velocity-compounded, or pressure-velocity compounded. A pressure-compounded impulse stage is a row of <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzles</b> followed by a row of moving blades, with multiple stages for compounding. This {{is also known as}} a Rateau turbine, after its inventor. A velocity-compounded impulse stage (invented by Curtis and also called a [...] "Curtis wheel") is a row of <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzles</b> followed by two or more rows of moving blades alternating with rows of fixed blades. This divides the velocity drop across the stage into several smaller drops. A series of velocity-compounded impulse stages is called a pressure-velocity compounded turbine.|$|R
50|$|Turbine blades are of {{two basic}} types, blades and nozzles. Blades move entirely {{due to the}} impact of steam on them and their {{profiles}} do not converge. This results in a steam velocity drop and essentially no pressure drop as steam moves through the blades. A turbine composed of blades alternating with <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzles</b> is called an impulse turbine, , Rateau turbine, or Brown-Curtis turbine. Nozzles appear similar to blades, but their profiles converge near the exit. This results in a steam pressure drop and velocity increase as steam moves through the nozzles. Nozzles move due to both the impact of steam on them and the reaction due to the high-velocity steam at the exit. A turbine composed of moving <b>nozzles</b> alternating with <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzles</b> is called a reaction turbine or Parsons turbine.|$|R
50|$|The RD-0110 is {{a rocket}} engine burning liquid oxygen and {{kerosene}} in a gas generator combustion cycle. It has four <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzles</b> and {{the output of}} the gas generator is directed to four secondary vernier nozzles to supply vector control of the stage. It has an extensive flight history with its initial versions having flown more than 55 years ago (as of June 2015).|$|R
50|$|Titan III/IV SRBs were <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> and for roll control, a small tank of {{nitrogen}} tetroxide was mounted to each motor. The N2O4 would be {{injected into the}} SRB exhaust to deflect it in the desired direction.|$|E
50|$|Launch at {{altitude}} {{allows a}} larger, more efficient, yet cheaper first-stage nozzle. Its expansion ratio {{can be designed}} for low ambient air pressures, without risking flow separation and flight instability during low-altitude flight. The extra diameter of the high-altitude nozzle {{would be difficult to}} gimbal. But with reduced crosswinds, the fins can provide sufficient first-stage steering. This allows a <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle,</b> which saves cost and weight versus a hot joint.|$|E
50|$|The RD-0210 (GRAU Index: 8D411K) is {{also known}} as the RD-465. It and its twin, the RD-0211, are rocket engines burning N2O4 and UDMH in a {{oxidizer}} rich staged combustion cycle. They have single nozzle, possess TVC and are the latest evolution in the RD-0203/4 lineage. They are the engines used on the Proton second stage. The RD-0213 is a <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> variation that is used on the RD-0212 module of the Proton third stage.|$|E
5000|$|These {{systems can}} be mounted on vehicles, skid mounts or {{permanent}} stations. Application is from twin hose lines connected together at the nozzle, one flows the dry chemical agent and the other foam. Twin agent systems are also used in <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzles</b> off vehicles(i.e. AR-FF vehicles) or ground mounted monitors in high hazard locations in facilities storing or producing flammable liquids.

50|$|The {{major part}} of exhaust gases thermal {{gradient}} was distributed equally on both turbine stages; the remainder converted to a thrust of 3150kp, using a <b>fixed</b> thrust <b>nozzle.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{computerized}} {{preliminary design}} procedure {{has been used}} to determine rocket-engine bell-nozzle configurations which achieve either minimum gross mass or minimum dry mass on an advanced technology winged single-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. This procedure evaluates the trade offs between the optimized ascent flight trajectory performance and the flight vehicle sizing driven by the engine mass and propellant requirements. Numerous mission, flight, and vehicle related requirements and constraints are satisfied in this process. Propulsion system configurations which incorporate dual-position nozzles are evaluated and compared to configurations using all <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzles...</b>|$|R
50|$|For the UR-100N project, while {{first stage}} {{propulsion}} {{was based on}} the more powerful RD-0233 engine. The second stage used a variation of the RD-0217 called the RD-0235 (GRAU Index 15D113). It used a vacuum optimized nozzle extension, and thus had an extra 10s of isp and 21 kN of more thrust. It has a <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> and relies on the RD-0236 vernier engine for thrust vectoring. While the engine has been out of production for a while, the UR-100NU and the Rokot and Strela use it as of 2015.|$|E
50|$|To {{implement}} TVFC {{a variety}} of nozzles both mechanical and fluidic may be applied. This includes convergent and convergent-divergent nozzles that may be fixed or geometrically variable. It also includes variable mechanisms within a <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle,</b> such as rotating cascades and rotating exit vanes. Within these aircraft nozzles, the geometry itself may vary from two-dimensional (2-D) to axisymmetric or elliptic. The number of nozzles on a given aircraft to achieve TVFC can vary from one on a CTOL aircraft to a minimum of four {{in the case of}} STOVL aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The M-20 was a two-stage, solid propellant, intermediate-range {{ballistic}} missile, 10.4 m {{in length}} and 1.5 m in diameter. Launch weight was 20,000 kg and the missile had a range of 3,000 km. Control of the first stage was by four gimballed nozzles; the second stage by thrust vector control through a single <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The first stage propellant weighed 10,000 kg and burned for 55 seconds, the second stage propellant weighed 6,015 kg and burned for 58 seconds. Guidance was inertial. The payload was believed to include some penetration aids and the single re-entry vehicle had some hardening against nuclear effects. The TN-60 warhead was reported to yield 1.2 Mt.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used nozzle is the de Laval <b>nozzle,</b> a <b>fixed</b> geometry <b>nozzle</b> with a high expansion-ratio. The large bell- or cone-shaped nozzle extension beyond the throat gives the rocket engine its characteristic shape.|$|R

50|$|The Lyulka TR-3A was redesignated as the AL-5 {{to honor}} Arkhip Mikhailovich Lyulka in 1950. It was a {{single-shaft}} turbojet with a seven-stage axial compressor. It had an annular combustion chamber with 24 nozzles and a single-stage turbine. It had a <b>fixed</b> exhaust <b>nozzle</b> {{and had a}} turbine starting unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} a rocket being launched by a high flying airplane is that it need not fly through the low, dense atmosphere, the drag of which requires {{a considerable amount of}} extra work and thus mass of propellant. Higher densities at lower altitudes result in larger drag forces acting on the vehicle. In addition, thrust is lost due to over-expansion of the exhaust at high ambient pressure and under-expansion at low ambient pressure; a <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometry cannot provide optimal exhaust expansion over the full range of ambient pressure, and represents a compromise solution. Rockets launched from high altitude can be optimized for lower ambient pressure, thus achieving greater thrust over the entire operating regime.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, {{getting a}} bidet meant {{installing}} {{a completely new}} plumbing unit into the bathroom. Newer bidets are often no longer standalone units: A bidet may be a movable or <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> attached to an existing toilet on back or side toilet rim, or {{a part of the}} toilet itself. In these cases, their use is restricted to cleaning the anus and genitals. Some bidets of this type produce a vertical water jet and others a more or less oblique one. Others have one nozzle on the side rim for both anal and genital areas, and other designs have two nozzles on the back rim, the shorter one, called the [...] "family nozzle", is used for washing the area around the anus, and the longer one ("bidet nozzle") is designed for women to wash their vulvas.|$|E
50|$|To simplify {{design and}} manufacture, the engine {{would be used}} both on {{the first and the}} second stages. The first stage would use a module - the RD-0202 - that {{comprised}} three RD-0203 and one RD-0204, while the upper stage would use a RD-0205 module comprising a RD-0206 main engine plus an auxiliary vernier engine, the RD-0207. The RD-0204 only difference to the RD-0203 was that it included a heat exchanger to heat the pressurant gases for the first stage tank. The RD-0206 was very similar to the RD-0204, but its nozzle was vacuum optimized and had a <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The thrust vector control task was delegated to the four nozzle RD-0207 vernier engine. While the UR-200 project was in direct competition to the R-36 and was cancelled in favor of the latter, it did had a few test launches and thus was a proven design.|$|E
50|$|An {{impulse turbine}} has <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzles</b> that orient the steam flow into high speed jets. These jets contain {{significant}} kinetic energy, which is converted into shaft rotation by the bucket-like shaped rotor blades, as the steam jet changes direction. A pressure drop occurs across only the stationary blades, {{with a net}} increase in steam velocity across the stage.As the steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from inlet pressure to the exit pressure (atmospheric pressure, or more usually, the condenser vacuum). Due to this high ratio of expansion of steam, the steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity. The steam leaving the moving blades has {{a large portion of}} the maximum velocity of the steam when leaving the nozzle. The loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the carry over velocity or leaving loss.|$|R
50|$|This type of nozzle {{provides}} a high impact {{per unit area}} and is used in many cleaning applications, for example, tank-cleaning <b>nozzles</b> (<b>fixed</b> or rotary).|$|R
2500|$|Ikaluk had a diesel-mechanical {{propulsion}} system with four medium-speed diesel engines driving two shafts through twin input-single output gearboxes.

5000|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{operates}} on {{basic principles of}} thermodynamics using the part 3-4 of the Rankine cycle shown in the adjoining diagram. Superheated steam (or dry saturated steam, depending on application) leaves the boiler at high temperature and high pressure. At entry to the turbine, the steam gains kinetic energy by passing through a nozzle (a <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> in an impulse type turbine or the fixed blades in a reaction type turbine). When the steam leaves the nozzle it is moving at high velocity towards the blades of the turbine rotor. A force is created on the blades due to {{the pressure of the}} vapor on the blades causing them to move. A generator or other such device can be placed on the shaft, and the energy that was in the steam can now be stored and used. The steam leaves the turbine as a saturated vapor (or liquid-vapor mix depending on application) at a lower temperature and pressure than it entered with and is sent to the condenser to be cooled. The first law enables us to find a formula for the rate at which work is developed per unit mass. Assuming there is no heat transfer to the surrounding environment and that the changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible compared to the change in specific enthalpy we arrive at the following equation ...|$|E

The linear engine system has been developed and fired demonstrating high performance and long life with firing durations exceeding 500 seconds. The application of the split or dual combustor to the linear engine permits the uses of two different propellant combinations in a single engine system. The split combustor possesses the advantages of the two position extendible bell nozzle in a <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> configuration.

40|$|The {{design of}} a simple, variable-geometry nozzle for a {{supersonic}} wind tunnel is described. The method of construction enables the Mach number of the flow to be continuously and accurately altered while tests are proceeding. Although designed to be incorporated {{as part of a}} flight simulator, the installation is suitable for normal wind tunnel testing especially where tests at a particular Mach number are essential.

40|$|Assuming Space Shuttle {{technology}} to be state-of-the-art, projected technological advances {{to improve the}} capabilities of single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) derivatives are examined. An increase of about 30 % in payload performance can be expected from upgrading the present Shuttle system through weight and drag reductions and improvements in the propellants and engines. The ODINEX (Optimal Design Integration Executive Computer Program) program {{has been used to}} explore design options. An advanced technology SSTO baseline system derived from ODINEX analysis has a conventional wing-body configuration using LOX/LH engines, three with two-position nozzles with expansion ratios of 40 and 200 and four with <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzles</b> with an expansion ratio of 40. Two assisted-takeoff approaches are under consideration in addition to a concept in which the orbital vehicle takes off empty using airbreathing propulsion and carries out a rendezvous with two large cryogenic tankers carrying propellant at an altitude of 6100 m.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the capacity of existing landscape irrigation equipment to deliver the expected irrigation depth {{at a level of}} uniformity that can potentially be used in a precision irrigation management environment. Popular pop-up sprayer systems from two leading manufacturers (Rain-bird and Hunter variable arc and <b>fixed</b> arc <b>nozzles)</b> were subject to spatial distribution tests, in order to establish the application patterns under ideal conditions. The results indicate that {{it is not possible to}} fully rely on the catalog application depth values, with some variable arc nozzles applying up to 200 % of the catalog values. These nozzles can have low values of uniformity, with Christiansen´s uniformity coefficient, CU, of between 0. 31 and 0. 70, making it difficult to obtain good uniformity even under a back-to-back setting. These results indicate that variable arc nozzles are not recommended for use in precision agriculture. It is preferable to use <b>fixed</b> arc <b>nozzles,</b> after actual field evaluation...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a high bypass-ratio (BPR) is {{necessary}} for efficiency enhancement of commercial aircraft engines. This can also be seen in the properties of the current re-engined midrange aircraft. Compared to their predecessors (BPR � 5 to 6), the new generation of mid-range aircraft with about 150 to 200 seats feature a take-o� BPR of � 10 to 12. A frequently studied but as yet not adopted technology uniquely aimed at these types of engines is the variable area fan nozzle (VAFN). This concept allows an adjustment of the engine operating point and the nozzle flow via a variable nozzle geometry. Previous studies show that it can eliminate flutter problems and provide an additional degree of freedom in optimizing the thermodynamic e�ciency of an aircraft engine. But what is the effect of the employment of these concept on the external aerodynamics and hence on the e�ciency of the whole aircraft? This is discussed in the present paper for a VAFN-layout utilized for wind-tunnel testing that uses a mere translative adjustment of the nacelle aftbody for changing the nozzle area. The CFD-results for several VAFN-settings of two high-lift configurations with a close coupled UHBR-TPS engine (BPR � 15 to 20) show an impact on the overall airframe lift and drag due to the jet flow, differing from that of a <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> engine. The comparison with the <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> engine also shows different flow conditions at the engine intake. The discussion of the outcomes is done by including the estimation of the impact on fan aerodynamics and the produced thrust...|$|E
40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{predicting}} {{the noise of}} high speed jets are largely empirical. These empirical methods {{are based on the}} jet noise data gathered by varying primarily the jet flow speed, and jet temperature for a <b>fixed</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometry. Efforts have been made to correlate the noise data of co-annular (multi-stream) jets and for the changes associated with the forward flight within these empirical correlations. But ultimately these emipirical methods fail to provide suitable guidance in the selection of new, low-noise nozzle designs. This motivates {{the development of a new}} class of prediction methods which are based on computational simulations, in an attempt to remove the empiricism of the present day noise predictions...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of Synthetic Jet (SJ) flow manipulators to the thrust vectoring of supersonic nozzles is investigated numerically. The thrust vectoring is obtained here by SJ induced flow separations, which generate the required asymmetry of the nozzle wall pressure distribution.

The domain-decomposition approach is adopted for coupling the flow in the actuators with the nozzle flow. Nozzle performances and thrust vector angles have been computed for a <b>fixed</b> <b>Nozzle</b> Pressure Ratio. Application of SJ to Shock Vector Control and to Dual-Throat Nozzle technologies is investigated.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} to produce identical beam emittances in the transverse phase planes from a severely asymmetric beam extracted from a slow-cycling synchrotron. This {{is important to}} obtain a good beam distribution at the irradiation spot when the spot scanning method {{is used for the}} treatment in hadron therapy. The method makes use of the beam rotation effect either by a solenoid or by a rotational quadrupole section, referred to as rotator, to produce identical emittances in the two transverse phase planes. It is also helpful for the stabilization of the beam spot at the irradiation point. Simulation studies with an artificially generated beam have been carried out to prove the principle. The method is not only applicable to <b>fixed</b> treatment <b>nozzles</b> but also to rotational gantry nozzles. Both a solenoid and a section of quadrupole rotator can be used, with the former being ideal for proton gantries and the latter for <b>fixed</b> carbon <b>nozzles.</b> There is a practical limit in using room-temperature solenoid due to the high beam rigidity {{in the case of a}} carbon beam, for which a superconducting solenoid has to be used.
