40|$|A {{brief history}} is given of traffic testing {{performed}} at the Federal Aviation Administration’s National Airport Pavement Test Facility (NAPTF) since the facility was commissioned in 1999. Three construction cycles are described, with associated traffic test results and data analysis. The first construction cycle consisted of three rigid pavement test items and six flexible pavement test items. The second construction cycle consisted of a 100 ft by 40 ft (30. 5 m by 12. 2 m) rigid pavement test strip, a 15 ft by 15 ft (4. 6 m by 4. 6 m) <b>free-standing</b> <b>test</b> slab, and three 100 ft (30. 5 m) long by 60 ft (18. 3 m) wide rigid pavement test items. The third consisted of four flexible pavement test items in a 300 ft (91. 4 m) long by 60 ft (18. 3 m) wide test section. Results from the flexible pavement traffic tests have been incorporated in the FAA layered elastic flexible airport pavement thickness design procedure and for establishing new alpha factors for the CBR airport pavement thickness design procedure. Traffic testing of the second construction cycle is still in progress {{at the time of}} writing...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface of}} water {{provides}} an excellent environment for gliding movement, in both nature and modern technology, from surface living animals such as the water strider, to Langmuir– Blodgett films. The high surface tension of water keeps the contacting objects afloat, and its low viscosity enables almost frictionless sliding on the surface. Here we utilize the water surface as a nearly ideal underlying support for free-standing ultra-thin films and develop a novel tensile testing method for the precise measurement of mechanical properties of the films. In this method, namely, the pseudo <b>free-standing</b> tensile <b>test,</b> all specimen preparation and testing procedures are performed on the water surface, resulting in easy handling and almost frictionless sliding without specimen damage or substrate effects. We further utilize van der Waals adhesion for the damage-free gripping of an ultra-thin film specimen. Our approach can potentially be used to explore the mechanical properties of emerging two-dimensional materials...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{activities that}} have already been completed as well as yet to be performed by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to develop a plan to quantify the behavior of radioactive low-level waste forms. It briefly describes the status of various tasks, including DOE approval of the proposed work, several regulatory and environmental related documents, tests to qualify the waste form, preliminary schedule, and approximate cost. It is anticipated that INEEL and Brookhaven National Laboratory will perform the majority of the tests. For some tests, services of other testing organizations may be used. It should take approximately nine months to provide the final report on the results of tests on a waste form prepared for qualification. It is anticipated that the overall cost of the waste quantifying service is approximately $ 150, 000. The following tests are planned: compression, thermal cycling, irradiation, biodegradation, leaching, immersion, <b>free-standing</b> liquid <b>tests,</b> and full-scale testing...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, three {{different}} coatings (epoxy, alkyd, polyurethane paints) {{were characterized by}} electrochemical impedance measurements, permeability <b>tests,</b> <b>free-standing</b> film impedance and local impedance measurements. The increase in resistance with immersion time of alkyd paint {{was linked to the}} nature of the polymeric network and not to phenomena occurring at the metal/paint interface. For polyurethane paint, local impedance was not able to detect defects in the paint, which was attributed to the fact that the defects are smaller than those observed in alkyd paint and also that they are less active and homogeneously distributed through the coating. Although electrochemical impedance methods (global and local) are excellent tools to monitor the behaviour of organic coatings, these techniques alone are not sufficient to screen different paints...|$|R

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the aerodynamic characterization of a cable-stayed bridge tower in <b>free-standing</b> configuration; experimental <b>tests</b> were performed at Politecnico di Milano Wind Tunnel under smooth and turbulent flow conditions. The aerodynamic behavior of the tower was investigated through static and dynamic tests on a 1 : 30 scale sectional model; the whole structure response has been studied using a 1 : 100 scale full aeroelastic model in stand-alone configuration. Aim {{of this paper is to}} compare wind tunnel test results obtained on the two models for different wind exposures, discussing the problems related to scale effects in scale model testing. Some inconsistencies found during the experimental campaign confirm that scale effects in wind tunnel testing represent a serious issue especially for bluff body structures whose vortex shedding response is strongly affected by Reynolds number...|$|R
40|$|Symptom {{validity}} {{assessment is}} an important part of neuropsychological evaluation. There are currently several <b>free-standing</b> symptom validity <b>tests</b> (SVTs), as well as a number of empirically derived embedded validity indices, that have been developed to assess that an exam-inee is putting forth an optimal level of effort during testing. The use of embedded validity indices is attractive since they do not increase overall testing time and may also be less vulnerable to coaching. In addition, there are some instances where embedded validity indices are the only tool available to the neuropsychological practitioner for assessing an examinee’s level of effort. As with free-standing measures, the sensitivity and specificity of embedded validity indices to suboptimal effort varies. The present study evaluated the diagnostic validity of 17 embedded validity indices by comparing performance on these indices to performance on combinations of free-standing SVTs. Results from the current medico-legal sample revealed that of the embedded validity indices, Reliable Digit Span had the best classification accuracy; however, the findings do not support the use of this embedded validity index in the absence of free-standing SVTs...|$|R
40|$|A large hemi-anechoic (absorptive {{walls and}} acoustically hard floor) noise control {{enclosure}} has been erected around {{a complex of}} test stands at the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. This new state-of-the-art Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory (APL) provides an all-weather, semisecure test environment while limiting noise to acceptable levels in surrounding residential neighborhoods. The 39. 6 m (130 ft) diameter geodesic dome structure houses the new Nozzle Aeroacoustic Test Rig (NATR), an ejector-powered M = 0. 3 free jet facility for acoustic testing of supersonic aircraft exhaust nozzles and turbomachinery. A multi-axis, force-measuring Powered Lift Facility (PLF) stand for testing of Short Takeoff Vertical Landing (STOVL) vehicles is also located within the dome. The design of the Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory efficiently accomodates the research functions of two separate test rigs, one of which (NATR) requires a specialized environment for taking acoustic measurements. Absorptive fiberglass wedge treatment on the interior surface of the dome provides a hemi-anechoic interior environment for obtaining the accurate acoustic measurements required to meet research program goals. The APL is the first known geodesic dome structure to incorporate transmission-loss properties as well as interior absorption into a <b>free-standing,</b> community-compatible, hemi-anechoic <b>test</b> facility...|$|R
40|$|This paper synthesizes the rates, barriers, and {{outcomes}} of HIV serostatus disclosure {{among women in}} developing countries. We identified 17 studies from peer-reviewed journals and international conference abstracts - 15 from sub-Saharan Africa and 2 from south-east Asia - that included information on either the rates, barriers or outcomes of HIV serostatus disclosure among women in developing countries. The rates of disclosure reported in these studies ranged from 16. 7 % to 86 %, with women attending <b>free-standing</b> voluntary HIV <b>testing</b> and counselling clinics more likely to disclose their HIV status to their sexual partners than women who were tested {{in the context of}} their antenatal care. Barriers to disclosure identified by the women included fear of accusations of infidelity, abandonment, discrimination and violence. Between 3. 5 % and 14. 6 % of women reported experiencing a violent reaction from a partner following disclosure. The low rates of HIV serostatus disclosure reported among women in antenatal settings have several implications for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (pMTCT) programmes as the optimal uptake and adherence to such programmes is difficult for women whose partners are either unaware or not supportive of their participation. This article discusses these implications and offers some strategies for safely increasing the rates of HIV status disclosure among women...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} and tested the world’s smallest material testing {{system for the}} in situ mechanical testing of nanostructures in scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). The testing system consists of an actuator and a load sensor fabricated by means of surface micromachining. The specimen can be either cofabricated or mounted to the testing platform by other external means. Two types of actuators are implemented: thermal actuator for displacement control and comb drive actuator for force control. The load sensor is based on differential capacitance measurement, from which load history of the specimen is recorded. We demonstrated the system capabilities by <b>testing</b> <b>free-standing</b> polysilicon films and metallic nanowires. This is the first nanoscale material testing system, which makes possible continuous observation of the specimen deformation and failure with sub-nanometer resolution, while simultaneously measuring the applied load electronically with nano-Newton resolution. It provides {{a powerful tool for}} nanomechanical characterization of materials. In addition, it represents a milestone within the path anticipated by Richard Feynman in his talk “There is Plenty of Room at the Bottom ” [1]. In fact the entire system can be placed on the head of a pin with dimensions of one sixteenth of an inch across. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In situ {{mechanical}} characterization of nanostruc-tures, such as carbon nanotubes and metallic nanowires, in scan-ning and {{transmission electron microscopes}} {{is essential for the}} understanding of material behavior at the nanoscale. This pa-per describes the design, fabrication, and operation of a novel microelectromechanical-systems (MEMS) -based material testing system used for in situ tensile testing of nanostructures. The device consists of an actuator and a load sensor with a specimen in between. Two types of actuators, in-plane thermal and comb drive actuators, are used to pull the specimens in displacement control and force control modes, respectively. The load sensor works based on differential capacitive sensing, from which the sensor displacement is recorded. By determining sensor stiffness from mechanical resonance measurements, the load on the specimen is obtained. Load sensors with different stiffness were fabricated. The best resolutions were achieved with load sensors that are designed for testing nanotubes, reaching 0. 05 fF in capacitance, 1 nm in displacement, and 12 nN in load. For the first time, this MEMS-based material testing scheme offers the possibility of continuous observation of the specimen deformation and frac-ture with subnanometer resolution, while simultaneously measur-ing the applied load electronically with nano-Newton resolution. The overall device performance is demonstrated by <b>testing</b> <b>free-standing</b> cofabricated polysilicon films and multiwalled carbon nanotubes.

40|$|Croton pullei (Euphorbiaceae) is a woody climber of {{the lowland}} {{rainforest}} in French Guyana and Surinam. During ontogeny, {{a shift from}} a juvenile free-standing growth phase to an older supported growth phase is observed. The following biomechanical parameters were studied: structural Young's modulus, structural torsional modulus, flexural stiffness and bend to twist ratios. Changes in anatomical development were also analysed for different stages of development of C. pullei which differ significantly in their mechanical properties. Free-standing plants show a nearly constant structural Young's modulus and structural torsional modulus during ontogeny, with flexural stiffness increasing proportionally with the axial second moment of area. These patterns are typical for “semi-self-supporting plants”. In contrast, supported plants show {{a significant decrease in}} structural Young's modulus in older stem parts, as well as a decrease in structural torsional modulus. Due to the decrease in structural Young's modulus, flexural stiffness does not increase proportionally with the axial second moment of area. These patterns are typical for non-self-supporting lianas. In all supported plants, a sudden transition occurs from early dense wood to a wood type with a much higher proportion of large diameter vessels. In contrast, only the dense wood type is present in all <b>tested</b> <b>free-standing</b> plants. The data are compared with results from other climbing species of the same study area and discussed with reference to observed features characterizing the growth form and life history of C. pullei...|$|R
40|$|Commentators {{frequently}} {{claim that}} there is no single, coherent doctrine of extra-territorial personal jurisdiction, and, unfortunately, they are correct. The International Shoe case, commonly (but inaccurately) thought of as the wellspring of the modern form of the doctrine, announced a relatively straightforward, two-factor, four-permutation test that worked well for resolving most cases. In the nearly sixty-year period following Shoe, however, as the Supreme Court expanded and refined the standard, what was once straightforward and uncomplicated became serendipitous and convoluted. Two general, and generally incompatible, versions of the doctrine competed for dominance. The first, what might best be described as a totality-of-the-circumstances view, is essentially a balancing test which weighs the convenience interests of litigants against the sovereignty interests of state and federal governments to situate litigation wherever those collective interests are reasonably accommodated. The second, perhaps best described as a defendant-veto view, is a kind of single-factor test that permits defendants to escape the extra-territorial reach of a state 2 ̆ 7 s personal jurisdictional power by avoiding certain kinds of purposeful contacts with the state. There is some overlap between these two versions of the doctrine, of course, but also a considerable area of difference, and the two views dictate opposite results when the forum a defendant has studiously avoided is a (or even the most) convenient forum. In the decade immediately after Shoe, the competition between the two views remained in relative equilibrium, with neither view gaining a clear upper hand, {{but at the end of}} that period, in the bookend cases of Hanson v. Denckla and McGee v. International Life Insurance Company, the Supreme Court reached opposite results, relying on the defendant-veto view in Hanson and the totality-of-the-circumstances view in McGee, when the reverse outcomes seemed to make more sense. It was as if, after ten years of thinking about it, the Court was no clearer on what form the doctrine should take than it was when it started. The doctrine then sat nearly dormant for about twenty years, during which the Court made few systematic attempts to restate or reformulate it. It was not until the early 1980 s, in a spate of now well-known cases (Kulko, Helicol, Ireland, Keeton, Calder, Woodson, Burger King, and Asahi, among others), that the Court got back into the field, mostly to reinforce the defendant-veto view, which had been losing ground in the lower federal and state courts. In this important series of cases the Court added considerable sophistication to the doctrine, but introduced a number of confusing elements as well. The confusion was caused principally by the Court 2 ̆ 7 s unfortunate propensity to use key concepts to mean more than one thing, to change doctrinal terminology without indicating that it was doing so, to use more than one term to express the same idea, to fail to ground the doctrine adequately in the Constitution (causing many to question its legitimacy), and to mix and match substantive law and jurisdictional concerns in developing doctrinal principles, all the while professing that it was not doing any of these. Lower federal and state courts were confused by all of this, of course, and began to add layers of confusion of their own, relying sometimes on one part of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s thinking and other times on other parts. Many courts, for example, all but eliminated the category of general jurisdiction, at least as originally understood and articulated in Shoe, by making its requirements either identical to, or less demanding than, those required for the supposedly easier-to-satisfy category of specific jurisdiction. Courts also ignored the distinction between contacts and fairness considerations in the specific jurisdiction standard, and began to treat both types of factors as interchangeable and <b>free-standing</b> jurisdictional <b>tests</b> in their own right. And still other courts defined the nexus requirement of specific jurisdiction to include almost any kind of relationship between the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s forum contacts and the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s claim, confusing litigants and undercutting the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s veto right. These and equivalent doctrinal frolics-and-detours have caused serious problems for litigants, lawyers, and judges, of course, who want to know where suits may be brought and where they will have to defend. The problem is especially serious in periods when the Supreme Court is not taking personal jurisdiction cases, since there is little prospect of reversing erroneous lower court decisions. The lack of a clear standard also exacerbates the pressure on litigants to forum shop, and forum-shopping, in turn, reinforces the familiar rule-of-law criticism of American courts, that their decisions lack legitimacy because they are based more on home court prejudice than on substantive entitlement. It may be that the Supreme Court is about to get back into the personal jurisdiction business, however, in part to clear up the difficulties described above, and in part to resolve new kinds of problems raised by cases in which the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s forum contacts are made over the internet. The roughly twenty year dormancy period in which the Court, historically, has not taken personal jurisdiction cases is coming to an end, for one thing, and many of the internet-contacts cases that have now begun to proliferate present interesting questions not easily resolved by existing doctrinal formulations. Early internet (mostly commercial dealing) cases were not all that different from the telephone contacts and stream-of-commerce pollution contacts cases familiar in the Shoe era, but the newest set of cases, principally those involving libel and intellectual property claims, present questions not easily answered by earlier formulations of the standard, and they have produced a wide variety of not always consistent or satisfactory responses in the lower federal and state courts. In this article I hope to sort out some of these confusions, and offer suggestions for how the Court, using the internet cases, might get the personal jurisdictional doctrine back on track...|$|R
