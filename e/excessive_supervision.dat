To fill this gap, we outline an incentive-based preventive supervision strategy that eliminates bad asset management in banks. Two supervision techniques are combined: temporary regulatory administration and random audits. Our design ensures good management without <b>excessive</b> <b>supervision</b> costs, through a gradual adjustment of supervision efforts to the bank's financial health. We also allow random audits to be delegated to an independent audit agency and show how to induce agency compliance with regulatory instructions in the least costly way...|$|E

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important in the observation of physical phenomena. Indeed, they offer no less than {{a new type of}} instrument with the potential of advancing knowledge by monitoring the world at unprecedented scales and resolutions to reveal previously unobservable details. However, for this to happen, it is crucial that one be able to trust that the information from a sensor network is of sustained high quality. While recent research has led to tremendous progress in the enabling platforms and technologies, the issue of integrity of sensed information has received little attention. There is both a lack of systematic understanding of the causes of integrity compromise, and a lack of algorithms and system support to cope with them. As a result, current systems are too fragile for sustained operation without <b>excessive</b> manual <b>supervision</b> and close involvement by the designers themselves. Our objective is to comprehensively address the data integrity problem by studying its causes, deriving fundamental limits, developing algorithms and system support, and validating the approach in real-life. The causes of decreased information integrity in sensor {{networks are}} many, and include many internal and external uncertainties in the sensing, processing, and communication elements of the system. The proposed research specifically focuses on integrity problems due to non-malicious causes such as noise, drift, faults, and channel (sensing, communication) impairments, and excludes integrity compromise du...|$|R

Microfiche. xvi, 191 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmWith {{the advent}} of the information era, line-drawing with digital form has become increasingly important in engineering applications. Unfortunately, there is a big media gap between paper and computer. For line-drawings to be useful and manageable they must be archived and understood by computers. However, the mere gathering of those digitized line-drawings certainly does not provide an economic way to store and retrieve. The need has always existed for a real-time system that automates the conversion process to obtain the symbolic descriptions of line-drawing images. Current technology for line-drawing interpretation involves <b>excessive</b> human <b>supervision</b> and is not easily extendible. Furthermore, it also fails to achieve both objectives of minimal model storage requirement and object matching time. A general paradigm for both 2 D and 3 D line-drawing interpretation systems is here developed and demonstrated with three major phases: labeling, modeling and recognition. The labeling module extracts a set of features known as symbolic labels of the corresponding objects from the image. These strategically selected labels facilitate automatic modeling and fast recognition dramatically. For interpreting 2 D line-drawings, an automatic symbol segmentation approach for the electrical engineering drawings via the process of image blurring is first devised. A hierarchical neural network is then deployed for symbol modeling and recognition, thereby minimizing human intervention and achieving incremental extendibility capability. For interpreting 3 D line-drawings. a linear-time-complexity polygon-division-based surface extraction algorithm for the projected trihedral objects is proposed. Then, a robust and efficient labeling approach is developed under a Cascaded Constrained Resource Planning (CCRP) model. Its near-linear-time complexity to the classical NPVI complete problems enables extensive usage of symbolic labels for modeling and recognition. Traditional viewer-centered object representation and matching approach requires excessive storage and computation time. Numerous less informative and redundant views are designated to be eliminated and thus gaining the efficiency for model searching. Each valid view is assigned a signature for automatic model base indexing. From the labeled line-drawing, valid-view modeling and multi-view matching are implemented to achieve the goals of lesser storage and faster retrieval time, which combine to realize a real-rime and geometrically invariant line-drawing interpretation system...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{employed a}} case study approach positioned in an interpretive paradigm to investigate the current obstetric sonography practice at an urban public hospital in Fiji. The primary aims of this research were firstly, to evaluate the current practices and procedures used for the mid-trimester obstetric sonography examinations at an urban public hospital in Fiji; and secondly, to examine the potential need {{for the development of}} a standard protocol for the mid-trimester obstetric sonography examinations at the hospital where this research was located. Multiple data collection methods were employed to collect predominantly qualitative data through observations, questionnaires and interviews. The participants, who were purposively selected, comprised six ‘on-the-job’ trained radiographers performing obstetric sonography and four sonography specialists (two radiologists and two obstetricians). While the quantitative data was obtained from the observations made on the scanning criteria used by the radiographers, most of the qualitative data was obtained from the radiographers’ questionnaires and the specialists’ interviews. The findings of this study revealed that there are obvious omissions in the current practice of obstetric sonography in Fiji. The evaluation of the radiographers’ guidelines for the mid-trimester obstetric sonography examinations at the host hospital showed inconsistencies in their current practice. Absence of a standard written protocol, insufficient expertise, training and <b>supervision,</b> <b>excessive</b> workload and lack of resources, have been identified as some of the major factors influencing the radiographers’ sonography practice at the host hospital. It is surmised that due to the identified limitations and constraints, the current obstetric sonography practice at the host hospital neither meets the international standards nor the expectations of the sonography specialists in their entirety. Hence, there is a genuine need for the implementation of standard obstetric sonography examination protocols at the host hospital and continuing professional development in medical sonography in Fiji...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} school counsellor development, paying particular attention to (a) what experiences school counsellors identify as significant markers in the development of their professional beliefs and practices, and (b) how such events come to attain their significance. Narrative methodology was utilized, with the intent of eliciting storied material and presenting the findings in storied format. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with four participants: two school counsellors and two school social workers. A narrative was composed for each participant based on the researcher’s analysis of the interview transcripts. The researcher discussed the individual participants’ contributions to the research questions as well as some emergent across-cases themes. Participants identified a wide range of experiences that had impacted upon their personal and professional development. There were several factors contributing to an experience’s significance: (a) emotional intensity, (b) readiness to learn, (c) goodness of fit, (d) positive reinforcement, and (e) cognitive accommodation. Across-cases themes with reference to critical experiences included the influence of childhood, the challenging or painful nature of incidents, and the simultaneous strength and vulnerability of empathy. Issues in the practice of school counselling included a necessarily remedial focus, insufficient supervision, and interventions beyond counselling. Self-care practices and metaphors of counselling also frequently appeared in the narratives. The narrative design of this study allowed for detailed descriptions of experiences that underlie general developmental trends identified in the counsellor development literature. The data suggested that school counsellors develop in much the same way as the wider counsellor population. However, they face impediments to optimal professional development in the form of <b>excessive</b> caseloads, inadequate <b>supervision,</b> and role confusion. Implications for future research and the practice of school counselling are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The study {{compares the}} {{efficiency}} of Islamic and conventional banks, during the period 2006 - 2012, by employing a non-parametric approach- the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). In order to minimise the bias resulting from the inherent dependency {{in the first stage}} of the DEA, the DEA outcomes were replaced with the bootstrapped estimators and replicated them 500 times. Accordingly, confidence intervals are constructed for efficiency measures, which subsequently, improved further the accuracy of the findings and provided more reliable arguments for policy implications. The study applies a two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis. The first stage of the DEA compares banks based on their Overall Technical Efficiency (OTE) and its components (Pure Technical Efficiency (PTE) and Scale Efficiency (SE)). Although proven to be more resilient during the financial crisis (Farooq and Zaheer, 2015), the research found that Islamic banks to be normally on a par with their conventional counterparts in terms of PTE and that they were significantly higher in terms of OTE and SE. In addition, according to the study’s results, both Islamic and conventional banks suffered from managerial underperformance rather than a failure in operating at optimal production levels. In other words, Islamic and conventional banks were managerially inefficient in controlling their operating costs and utilising their resources. The second stage of the DEA, which accounts for the country- and bank- specific factors, confirms the findings that {{there was no significant difference}} in PTE between Islamic and conventional banks. Moreover, the findings imply that Islamic banks have no significance on pooled PTE and show no significant difference in PTE when compared to conventional banks during the entire period of the study including the financial crisis (2007 - 2009). In the light of the study’s empirical findings, Islamic banks should explore the benefits of moving to more diversified investments and tools in order to make use of their liquidity. Moreover, Islamic banks have to employ more solid risk management techniques in order to limit the number of risks, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk, which may arise in the shari’ah banking industry. The research is extended to study the PTE determinants of four regions, namely, MENA, East Asia and Pacific, South Asia, and Europe and Central Asia. The outcomes show that PTE had a different significance for each region’s determinants related mainly to the levels of the indicators of governance, namely, Voice Accountability (VACC) and Regulation Quality (REGQ). The findings suggested that the more developed and democratic countries were favourable to banks having more operations that are efficient. In addition, these countries’ <b>excessive</b> regulation and <b>supervision</b> (i. e. limited financial freedom), encouraged financial institutions to create unclear new instruments and misjudge the risks. These resulted in the banks being less efficient. The study found, also, that there were different determinants for Islamic and conventional banks operating in Muslim and non-Muslim countrie...|$|R
