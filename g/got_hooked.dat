500|$|Wheeler {{questioned}} how he <b>got</b> <b>hooked</b> up with Easton; Joseph {{answered that}} he was recommended by a former road manager. He was included in a try-out with four others, rehearsed with the band, they then cut it down to two, and rehearsed with Sheena for the final cut. Joseph anticipated they would ask him to do a solo {{on at least one}} of the songs he was asked to play during the audition, so he wrote a solo for all three songs, which was ultimately the reason he was hired for the job.|$|E

Disney agreed and Peet created an original treatment, with little supervision, as he had done with One Hundred and One Dalmatians and The Sword in the Stone. However, after the disappointing reaction to The Sword in the Stone, Walt Disney decided to become more involved in the story than he had been with the past two films, with his nephew Roy E.

500|$|... 2001 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated, [...] "2001 isn't as consistent or striking as Slim Shady, {{but the music}} is always brimming with character." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair praised the production, calling it [...] "uncharacteristically sparse sound" [...] from Dr. Dre {{and that it was}} as [...] "addictive as it was back when over 3million record buyers <b>got</b> <b>hooked</b> on The Chronic and Snoop Dogg's Dre-produced Doggystyle" [...] and went on to commend Dr. Dre, stating, [...] "If any rap producer deserves the title [...] "composer", it's he." [...] NME mentioned that Dr. Dre didn't expand the genre, but it was [...] "powerful enough in parts, but not clever enough to give Will Smith the fear". PopMatters writer Chris Massey declared that [...] "Musically, 2001 is about as close to brilliant as any one gangsta rap album might possibly get." [...] Christopher John Farley of Time stated that [...] "The beats are fresh and involving, and Dre's collaborations with Eminem and Snoop Dogg have ferocity and wit." [...] Although he was ambivalent towards the album's subject matter and guest rappers, Greg Tate of Spin was pleasantly surprised by [...] "the most memorable MC'ing on this album com from Dre himself, Eminem notwithstanding" [...] and stated, [...] "Whatever one's opinion of the sexual politics and gun lust of Dre's canon, his ongoing commitment to formal excellence and sonic innovation in this art form may one day earn him a place next to George Clinton, if not Stevie Wonder, Duke Ellington, or Miles Davis." ...|$|E
500|$|Described {{as one of}} [...] "R's most {{important}} artists" [...] during the 1990s, her second studio album, One in a Million, {{became one of the}} most influential R albums of the decade. Music critic Simon Reynolds cited [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] as [...] "the most radical pop single" [...] of 1998. Kelefah Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that rather than being the song's focal point, Aaliyah [...] "knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line", and consequently [...] "helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of Destiny's Child owe a clear debt to 'Are You That Somebody'." [...] Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah [...] "had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years." [...] Music publication Popdust called Aaliyah an unlikely queen of the underground due mainly to her influence on the underground alternative music scene, which consists of heavy sampling and references to her music by underground artists. Popdust also mentioned that the forward-thinking music Aaliyah did with Timbaland and the experimental music being made by many underground alternative artists are somewhat cut from the same cloth. While compiling a list of artists that take cues from Aaliyah, MTV Hive mentioned that it's easy to spot her influence on underground movements like dubstep, strains of indie pop, and lo-fi R movements. With sales of 8.1 million albums in the United States and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide, Aaliyah earned the nicknames [...] "Princess of R" [...] and [...] "Queen of Urban Pop", as she [...] "proved she was a muse in her own right". Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone dubbed her as the [...] "undisputed queen of the midtempo come-on". Aaliyah has been referred to as a pop icon and a R icon for her impact and contributions to those respective genres. Japanese pop singer Hikaru Utada has said several times that [...] "It was when I heard Aaliyah's Age Ain't Nothing but a Number that I <b>got</b> <b>hooked</b> on R", after which Utada released her debut album First Love with heavy R influences. Another Japanese pop singer Crystal Kay has expressed how she admired Aaliyah when she was growing up and how she would practice dancing while watching her music videos.|$|E

Dye entered the Airborne School at Fort Benning in Georgia to be a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division, but the war ended {{while he was in}} training.

However, the [...] "much-quoted claims that she taught him the joys of oral sex is viewed with skepticism by other lovers of the King." [...] In an interview, Shepherd reveals that Presley kissed her all over her naked body – but refused to have oral sex with her. His slow tender kisses ended at her bellybutton. Elvis explained to her, [...] "Me and the guys talk and, well, we don't eat pussy." [...] She always knew their relationship was doomed and they wouldn't last as a couple.

60|$|But I did {{go back in}} 1915. Long ago on my lonely desert trips I {{learned the}} value of companions and I dreaded the strain of this swordfishing game. I needed some one to help lessen it.

60|$|Basil Grant had {{comparatively}} {{few friends}} besides myself; {{yet he was}} the reverse of an unsociable man. He would talk to any one anywhere, and talk not only well but with perfectly genuine concern and enthusiasm for that person's affairs. He went through the world, as it were, {{as if he were}} always on the top of an omnibus or waiting for a train. Most of these chance acquaintances, of course, vanished into darkness out of his life. A few here and there <b>got</b> <b>hooked</b> on to him, so to speak, and became his lifelong intimates, but there was an accidental look about all of {{them as if they were}} windfalls, samples taken at random, goods fallen from a goods train or presents fished out of a bran-pie. One would be, let us say, a veterinary surgeon with the appearance of a jockey; another, a mild prebendary with a white beard and vague views; another, a young captain in the Lancers, seemingly exactly like other captains in the Lancers; another, a small dentist from Fulham, in all reasonable certainty precisely like every other dentist from Fulham. Major Brown, small, dry, and dapper, was one of these; Basil had made his acquaintance over a discussion in a hotel cloak-room about the right hat, a discussion which reduced the little major almost to a kind of masculine hysterics, the compound of the selfishness of an old bachelor and the scrupulosity of an old maid. They had gone home in a cab together and then dined with each other twice a week until they died. I myself was another. I had met Grant while he was still a judge, on the balcony of the National Liberal Club, and exchanged a few words about the weather. Then we had talked for about an hour about politics and God; for men always talk about the most important things to total strangers. It is because in the total stranger we perceive man himself; the image of God is not disguised by resemblances to an uncle or doubts of the wisdom of a moustache.|$|E
