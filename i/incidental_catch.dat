5|$|Though {{not highly}} {{dangerous}} to humans, the pink whipray's venomous sting {{makes it difficult}} to handle when it is thrashing in a fishing net. Usually, it must be thrown overboard before the rest of the catch can be sorted. Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia, and probably elsewhere in its range, this species is a regular <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> of coastal fisheries using tangle nets, bottom trawls, gillnets, seine nets, {{and to a lesser extent}} longlines. When retained, the meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized. Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated, and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate. The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. Off northern Australia, the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), but bycatch levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) became compulsory in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The Australian sawtail {{catshark}} is {{a frequent}} <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> of bottom trawl commercial fisheries operating throughout its range, including the Western Australian Deep Water Trawl Fishery, the South East Trawl Fishery, and the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. It may be retained and utilized, but is more commonly discarded; the survival rate of discarded sharks is unknown. This species remains widespread and common, and fishing activities {{do not appear to}} pose a substantial threat to its population at present. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E

25|$|These new {{technologies}} adversely affected the Northern Cod population in two important ways: {{by increasing the}} area and depth that was fished, the cod were being depleted {{to the point that}} the surviving fish were incapable of replenishing the stock lost each year; and secondly, the trawlers caught enormous amounts of non-commercial fish, which although economically unimportant, held huge ecological significance: <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> undermines the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole, depleting stocks of important predator and prey species. In the case of the Northern Cod, significant amounts of capelin – an important prey species for the cod – were caught as bycatch, further undermining the survival of the remaining cod stock.|$|E
25|$|Shrimp {{trawling}} {{can result}} in very high <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> rates of non-target species. In 1997, the FAO found discard rates up to 20 pounds for every pound of shrimp. The world average was 5.7 pounds for every pound of shrimp. Trawl nets in general, and shrimp trawls in particular, {{have been identified as}} sources of mortality for species of finfish and cetaceans. Bycatch is often discarded dead or dying by the time it is returned to the sea, and may alter the ecological balance in discarded regions. Worldwide, shrimp trawl fisheries generate about 2% of the world's catch of fish in weight, but result in more than one third of the global bycatch total.|$|E
25|$|Only five {{specimens}} of the marbled whipray have been deposited in museums. However, it is reportedly locally common in some rivers and streams. It is an infrequent <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> of intense fishery activities taking place {{across much of}} its range, using demersal tangle nets, fish traps, and hook-and-line. These attractively colored rays, especially the young, are valued by the aquarium trade. Another major threat to the marbled whipray is habitat loss and degradation, from pollution, logging, and dam construction. In Thailand, dams on the Chao Phraya have prevented stingrays in different stretches of the river from intermingling, with {{a negative effect on}} genetic diversity. Citing these threats, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Endangered. During the 1990s, the Thai government initiated a captive breeding program for this and other endangered freshwater stingrays at Chai Nat, but by 1996 the program had been placed on hold.|$|E
40|$|The {{abundance}} {{of the three}} species of endemic Black Sea marine mammals represented by Delphinus delphis ponticus (Barabasch-Nikiforov 1935), Tursiops truncatus ponticus (Barabasch-Nikiforov 1940) and Phocoena phocoena relicta (Abel 1905) has shown a dramatic decline due to direct killing practiced in earlier times, <b>incidental</b> <b>catches</b> in fishing gears, depletion of the fish populations entering the cetacean food web, and habitat degradation. These threats are more severe in the Black Sea owing to its semi-enclosed nature, high human density, and human activities being carried out especially in coastal zones. Each year, <b>incidental</b> cetacean <b>catches</b> are registered on the Romanian littoral and, consequently, mortalities occur among individuals which strand on the beaches. These mortalities affect in particular the species Phocoena phocoena, considered the most vulnerable one to gillnet fishing.

25|$|The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) was {{established}} by the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean. On 11 February 1992, the Convention was signed by Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America, and took effect on 16 February 1993. The Republic of Korea later acceded to the Convention on 27 May 2003. As indicated in the Convention, the main objective of the NPAFC is to promote the conservation of anadromous stocks in the North Pacific Ocean. The NPAFC provides a framework for international cooperation on the scientific research of anadromous species and enforcement of fisheries regulations in the Convention Area. The Convention prohibits directed catch of anadromous fish in the Convention Area, but allows for some fishing of these species for scientific purposes under national and joint research programs with prior approval of the NPAFC. The Convention also includes measures to reduce <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> of anadromous fish in other high seas fisheries and prohibits the retention of these species on board fishing vessels in the Convention Area.|$|E
2500|$|The venomous tail {{spine of}} the red {{stingray}} is potentially injurious to humans. The Ainu once used the dried tail spine, with the toxic sheath intact, as a weapon. This species is an <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> of commercial fisheries targeting flounder and other bottom-dwelling fishes, using bottom trawls, gillnets, set nets, and line gear. It is valued as food in Japan, especially in the Tokyo Bay area where it is consumed in autumn and winter; it may be prepared hard boiled, with miso soup, or as kamaboko. However, {{the small size of}} the red stingray limits its economic importance. [...] Annual catches reported by Japanese fisheries have steadily declined from 20,000 tons in 1950 to varying between 3,959 and 5,388 tons from 1997 to 2004. Such apparent depletion, coupled with continuing heavy fishing pressure and a slow reproductive rate, have led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess this species as Near Threatened.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} number of studies worldwide have shown that <b>incidental</b> <b>catches</b> (by-catch) of seabirds in fishing gear might pose a considerable risk {{for the conservation of}} their populations.

A study by Caswell et al. in the western North Atlantic combined the mean annual rate of increase of the harbour porpoise with the uncertainty of incidental mortality and population size. It was found that the incidental mortality exceeds critical values and therefore by-catch is a significant threat to the harbour porpoise.
