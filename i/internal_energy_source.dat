Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source.

If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the thesis is two {{different}} approaches for establishing wireless communication, by means of electromagnetic fields, between an implanted glucose sensor and an external device in a glucose monitoring system for diabetics. In the first approach, called a passive system design, the implant is constructed without an <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> Here the energy is transferred to the implant via an inductive link, which {{at the same time}} is used for communication. In the second approach, called an active system design the internal device is equipped with an <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> The discussion focuses on limitations and ways of optimizing the performance of the two approaches for the application in question. The nature of the operating medium, the human body, is complex and this causes challenges not faced with short range systems in more traditional environments. An instrumental setup used to investigate the performance of the passive approach in air and in a sodium chloride solution, is also presented. Although the discussion is based on the design of a communication system for a glucose monitoring system, it will be of relevance for other applications of short range communication systems on medical implants or with similar operating environments...|$|E

However, plate tectonics theory depends critically upon physically impossible mantle convection.

Magnetars form a special group of neutron stars 1 which contain soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). They seem to be hot, isolated, slowly spinning neutron stars of age t ∼ 10 14 G. There is no strict theory of magnetar activity and evolution.

The structural dynamics required for the swimmer to move in the desired direction is discussed and two simple models, based respectively on the presence of an elastic structure, and on an orientation dependent friction, to control the deformations induced by the external flow, are analyzed.

40|$|Integrated dynamic {{systems such}} as {{mechatronic}} or control systems generally contain passive elements and <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> that are appropriately modulated to perform the desired dynamic actions. The overall passivity of such systems is a useful property that relates to the stability {{and the safety of}} the system, {{in the sense that the}} maximum net amount of energy that the system can impart to the environment is limited by its initial state. In this paper, conditions under which a physical system containing internal modulated sources is globally passive are investigated using bond graph modelling techniques. For the class of systems under consideration, bond graph models include power bonds and active (signals) bonds modulating embedded <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> so that the continuity of power (or energy conservation) in the junction structure is not satisfied. For the purpose of the analysis, a so-called bond graph pseudo junction structure is proposed as an alternative representation for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) bond graph models with internal modulated sources. The pseudo junction structure highlights the existence of a multiport coupled resistive field involving the modulation gains of the internal sources and the parameters of dissipative elements, therefore implicitly realising the balance of <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> generation and dissipation. Moreover, it can be regarded as consisting of an inner structure which satisfies the continuity of power, and an outer structure in which a power scaling is performed in relation with the dissipative field. The associated multiport coupled resistive field constitutive equations can then be used to determine the passivity property of the overall system.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, elaborating the {{statistical}} approach recently proposed {{by one of}} the present authors (A. G.

The mean statistical characteristics of the LTE line radiation such as the mean intensity and its Relative Mean Square Deviation (RelMSD) emerging from a multi-component atmosphere with randomly varying properties are derived as the functions of the frequency within a line. The results previously obtained are extended to encompass more realistic models when uctuations of the observed line intensities represent a combined eect of variation of dierent physical and geometrical parameters of the medium (<b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> optical thickness, velocity eld, the number of structural elements along the line of sight etc.). It is shown that the center-to-wings evolution of the RelMSD essentially depends on the mentioned features of the atmosphere, which are responsible for the spatial variations we observe. The obtained results are applied to the EUV-lines through SUMER spectrometer in frameworks of the SOHO space mission. As a rule, the observed values of RelMSD in the central frequencies of the observed lines are less than those in the wings. This points out that the observed uctuations are mainly due to the changes in <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> in the prominence.

40|$|Feeding {{behavior}} is influenced primarily by two factors: nutritional needs and food palatability. However, {{the role of}} food deprivation and metabolic needs {{in the selection of}} appropriate food is poorly understood. Here, we show that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, selects calorie-rich foods following prolonged food deprivation in the absence of taste-receptor signaling. Flies mutant for the sugar receptors Gr 5 a and Gr 64 a cannot detect the taste of sugar, but still consumed sugar over plain agar after 15 h of starvation. Similarly, pox-neuro mutants that are insensitive to the taste of sugar preferentially consumed sugar over plain agar upon starvation. Moreover, when given a choice between metabolizable sugar (sucrose or d-glucose) and nonmetabolizable (zero-calorie) sugar (sucralose or l-glucose), starved Gr 5 a; Gr 64 a double mutants preferred metabolizable sugars. These findings suggest the existence of a taste-independent metabolic sensor that functions in food selection. The preference for calorie-rich food correlates with a decrease in the two main hemolymph sugars, trehalose and glucose, and in glycogen stores, indicating that this sensor is triggered when the <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> are depleted. Thus, the need to replenish depleted energy stores during periods of starvation may be met through the activity of a taste-independent metabolic sensing pathway...|$|R

Since the first international hyperthermia conference in 1975, Washington DC, techniques to increase tumour temperature have been developed and tested clinically. Hyperthermia can be applied by several methods: local hyperthermia by external or <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> perfusion hyperthermia of organs, limbs, or body cavities, and whole body hyperthermia. The clinical value of hyperthermia {{in combination with other}} treatment modalities has been shown by randomised trials. Significant improvement in clinical outcome has been demonstrated for tumours of the head and neck, breast, brain, bladder, cervix, rectum, lung, oesophagus, for melanoma and sarcoma. The addition of hyperthermia resulted in remarkably higher (complete) response rates, accompanied by improved local tumour control rates, better palliative effects, and/or better overall survival rates. Toxicity from hyperthermia cannot always be avoided, but is usually of limited clinical relevance. In spite of these good clinical results, hyperthermia has received little attention. Problems with acceptance concern the limited availability of equipment, the lack of awareness concerning clinical results, and the lack of financial resources.

40|$|The {{climate in}} cities differs {{significantly}} from {{those found in}} the surrounding area. These differences results from modifications of the Earth's surface that alters the disposition of “natural energy balance” at a micro-scale and the concentration of activities that results in anthropogenic emissions that change the composition of the atmosphere. These urban effects have distinctive temporal and spatial properties with different impacts on building energy performance depending on their purpose which are rarely accounted for. This paper examines performance implications of a change-of-use (from office to residential) {{in the context of the}} UK government's proposal to encourage regeneration and to meet housing needs. However, the diurnal occupation and activity patterns of these uses are distinct. For office buildings, with daytime occupation, focus is on the diurnal heating cycle driven by solar energy gains to which <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> must be added. For residential buildings occupation and activity are primarily associated with the diurnal cooling period, and lower levels of activity that results in a primary heating need. This paper highlights the link between the timing of the urban climate effects, the urban setting and energy performance in a typical city street, where buildings are currently designed for commercial use. It employs London's current and projected climate to simulate heating and cooling demands. By studying the role of urban form and its implications on the suitability of a buildings function we find that a ‘form first’ approach should be considered in the early design stages over the standard ‘fabric first’ approach...|$|R
