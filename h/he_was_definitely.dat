25|$|Robert Stone (29 January 1749 – June 1820) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer with amateur status. He {{was born}} in Brixton and was initially associated with Surrey but {{he went on to}} represent other teams. The full span of his career is uncertain but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> active between 1773 and 1780, playing in eight first-class matches. According to CricketArchive, Stone resurrected his career with two further matches in the 1790 season, but it cannot be said with certainty that this was the same man, especially as he seems to have moved from Surrey to Kent.|$|E

Knowledge of the early years of his career are sketchy {{due to the lack of}} detailed records before scorecards became common from 1772, but it is believed he began playing in top-class cricket during the 1750s and may well have taken part in the earliest known Hambledon matches, a tri-series against Dartford in 1756.|$|E
500|$|Mercury {{was noted}} for his live performances, which were often {{delivered}} to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked {{a great deal}} of participation from the crowd. A writer for The Spectator described him as [...] "a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself." [...] David Bowie, who performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded the song [...] "Under Pressure" [...] with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: [...] "Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> a man who could hold an audience {{in the palm of his}} hand." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make [...] "the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected". Mercury's main prop on stage was a broken microphone stand, which after accidentally snapping off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised could be used in endless ways.|$|E
5000|$|Miles Murphy: Miles {{is a very}} pompous and self-important character. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> {{the most}} obvious villain in the story.

500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me they were taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles' second {{recording}} {{session with}} Martin was on 4 September 1962, when they recorded [...] "How Do You Do It", heavily modified by The Beatles which Martin {{thought was a}} sure-fire hit, even though Lennon and McCartney {{did not want to}} release it, not being one of their own compositions or style. Martin was correct: Gerry & the Pacemakers' version, which Martin produced, spent three weeks at No. 1 in April 1963, before being displaced by [...] "From Me to You". On 11 September 1962, the Beatles re-recorded [...] "Love Me Do" [...] with session player Andy White playing drums. Ringo Starr was asked to play tambourine and maracas, and although he complied, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> [...] "not pleased". Due to an EMI library error, a 4 September version with Starr playing drums was issued on the British single release; afterwards, the tape was destroyed, and the 11 September recording with Andy White on drums was used for all subsequent releases. Martin would later praise Starr's drumming, calling him [...] "probably... the finest rock drummer in the world today". As [...] "Love Me Do" [...] peaked at number 17 in the British charts, on 26 November 1962 Martin recorded [...] "Please Please Me", which he did only after Lennon and McCartney had almost begged him to record another of their original songs. Martin's crucial contribution to the song was to tell them to speed up what was initially a slow ballad. After the recording Martin looked over the mixing desk and said, [...] "Gentlemen, you have just made your first number one record". Martin directed Epstein to find a good publisher, as Ardmore & Beechwood had done nothing to promote [...] "Love Me Do", informing Epstein of three publishers who, in Martin's opinion, would be fair and honest, which led them to Dick James.|$|E

One historian noted that Lee separated slave families, which was not the custom at the time. In 1862, Lee freed the slaves that his wife inherited, but that was in accordance with his father-in-law’s will.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{many have}} assumed that EPMD {{produced}} the music on the album because of their executive production credit, Weston stated [...] "in the studio back then it was just me, Skoob, Chris, and Derek, and that was it.

[...] Weston referred to Charity, {{who died in the}} year 2000, as [...] "the brains of the operation, definitely... <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> the boss and the real executive producer of the first album.

2500|$|It {{is almost}} certain that Slindon {{was not just a}} village team and that it was in fact a Sussex county team, just as Dartford Cricket Club had always formed the nucleus of the Kent team. [...] There {{can be little doubt that}} Richmond cast his net wide and that players from {{elsewhere}} in Sussex played for Slindon. [...] But Richard Newland was the star and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> local. [...] It seems that Richmond built the team around Newland and so it was perhaps natural that the name of the team, even if it were a Sussex county XI, should be that of Newland's village.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Dick lit a {{cigarette}} and blew smoke in Jen's direction while she was eating. Jen asked for Dick to stop, but he did not.

This incident ended with Dick yelling at Jen. Jen burst into tears and Jameka pulled Jen away from the confrontation and to the bathroom. Neither Jen nor Dick was expelled from the House and Jen was evicted on Day 55. Jen said to the Associated Press: [...] "I definitely think he should have been kicked out, but obviously <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> entertainment for the show, so that's why he was not." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1174, Ponce {{was with}} the court of Alfonso VIII at Toledo for a major {{gathering}} the kingdom's leading men.

By October he had joined the court of Ferdinand II at Ciudad Rodrigo, where the king officially declared their reconciliation by granting [...] "to you, my beloved Count Ponce, and your wife, the countess Doña Estefanía" [...] a privilege exempting the couple from taxes on all their lands and exempting all their vassals from taxes also. On 18 November, Ponce met Alfonso VIII at Fuentedueña, perhaps remaining with the court until 9 May 1175, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> in attendance at Medina del Campo.

50|$|A {{detailed}} discussion of the sources is devoted by Dumézil to showing {{that they do not}} support the theory of an agrarian Mars.

2500|$|At this time, {{the band}} first invited Jeff Lynne, {{a friend of}} Wood's, to join. He turned the offer down, as he was still working toward success in the Idle Race, another Birmingham-based group.

Some years later, Wayne recalled that to be nothing more than a publicity stunt; however, Marvin himself, in an article in Melody Maker in 1973 and elsewhere, has maintained that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>definitely</b> approached by Wood and invited to join the Move, but declined because their schedule was too hectic for him. Bevan confirmed in a 2014 interview that the band invited Marvin, but they never thought he would say [...] "yes". Burton was ultimately replaced in 1969 by Rick Price, another veteran of several Birmingham rock groups, who joined on a temporary, non-contractual basis. [...] Thus, the group in spring 1969 consisted of just Wayne (vocals), Wood (guitar), Bevan (drums), and Price (bass).|$|E

He did not enter either the national Carlist wartime executive, Junta Nacional de Guerra, or the Navarrese Junta Central Carlista de Guerra, but {{in the summer of}} 1936 the latter delegated him to Gabinete de Prensa of in early 1937 he entered Delegación de Cuestiones Sociales set up by Junta Central.

Lopez explained, [...] "Who you are at that time, what kind of music you like, what kind of beats you're into, what kind of state of mind you're in, what you're attracted to ... it's all very telling of where you are in your life at that point. ...
