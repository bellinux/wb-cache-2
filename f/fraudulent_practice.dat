Thus, the need to re-embark upon moral, religious, ethical and social re-orientation in the public sector on the path of economic progress and development and not for political advantages is eminent as well as rigorous campaigns to awaken the conscious and re-orientate public servants and the general society on the need to refrain from fraud or abetting it. The internal control system operating in the public sector needs to be strengthened. Also, there is need for institutionalizing, internalizing and building ownership for the multitude of reforms within the public sector so as to ensure that it sustains the changes in the anti-corruption campaign in Nigeria. These trends need to continue for the dividends of due process to be fully realized in the Nigerian public sector...|$|R
