25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{medication}} is dispensed in blister packaging. It is relatively simple to equip blister packages with printed conductive trace grids. These grids are then connected to an <b>electronic</b> <b>module.</b> The electronic monitor records the time a trace has been broken and can then transmit this information to an NFC smart phone or even be GSM enabled to transmit the information immediately if a suitable data network is available. A more reasonable solution at the moment would be to connect the package to a hub, handheld device, tablet or smart watch via low power Bluetooth. In this case the package data would be sent whenever the medication blister is in close proximity to the bluetooth receiver. It avoids the huge effort required to equip every single blister with a SIM module and expensive monthly data subscription.|$|E
2500|$|Realistic hi-hats - These newer [...] {{versions}} {{are no longer}} single cymbal pads but dual replicated cymbals, that can be mounted on regular stands like their acoustic versions. These cymbals allow for actual opened and closed hand/foot playing. A high-spec <b>electronic</b> <b>module</b> detects hi-hat movement/height and position, providing realistic variations of sound via degree of placement – open, partially open, and closed hi-hat strikes. Some modules, like the Roland TD-30, also feature foot close and quick close-open sounds, with pressure on the cymbals also being sensed and replicated when tightening or loosening the foot pressure, even on a closed hi-hat. [...] So, the audio sounds tighter when firm pressure is applied on an already closed hi-hat pedal (Roland's TD-30 Module, as demonstrated by Craig Blundell, Omar Hakim and Michael Schack on YouTube for Roland. [...] Tom Griffen for Yamaha also demonstrates cymbal sensitivities in a demo on YouTube).|$|E

50|$|Scanning {{near-field}} ultrasound holography combines atomic force {{acoustic microscopy}} and ultrasonic force microscopy. Two transducers producing high frequencies are used. Usually frequency {{is higher than}} the resonant frequency of the cantilever. One transducer is placed below the sample and the other attached to the cantilever. The cantilever can be called as SPM acoustic antenna which senses the interference of acoustic waves sent by the transducers. The interference of these waves forms surface acoustic standing waves. The wave's frequencies are slightly different. The perturbations to phase and amplitude of the surface acoustic standing wave are locally monitored by the antenna via the lock-in approach and the SPM <b>electronic</b> <b>module.</b> This <b>electronic</b> <b>module</b> was developed by Shekhawat and Dravid.
