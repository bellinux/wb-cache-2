The direct aerosol {{effect is a}} fundamental aspect of every climate and chemical transport model. Aerosol optical properties are incorporated into the Global Environmental Multiscale model with Atmospheric Chemistry (GEM-AC) which is equipped with the M 7 aerosol submodel. With the recent progress in atmospheric and chemical transport modelling, an interactive dust emission scheme and a sea-state <b>dependent</b> <b>sea</b> salt emission scheme are also implemented in GEM-AC. An option between volume fraction mixing and Bruggeman mixing for the mixing state of soluble aerosols is provided. In addition, there is an option to include the aerosol direct effect at all nine longwave spectral bands in GEM-AC. Eight experiments are performed to document the new direct effect of the M 7 aerosols and the effects of:the aerosols in all nine longwave spectral bands, the soluble aerosol mixing state options, the interactive dust scheme, and the sea-state <b>dependent</b> <b>sea</b> salt emission scheme. Aerosol optical properties are compared against three AERONET observation sites. Implementation of the aerosol direct effect and the new aerosol options in GEM-AC maintain the model as a practical tool for climate and chemical transport modelling...|$|R

40|$|Most marine teleosts have a pelagic phase {{during their}} early life history, but {{few studies have}} {{investigated}} how the timing of events within the planktonic larval fish assemblage is related to environmental variability. We examined this issue using a data series of 534 larval fish samples collected between 1975 and 1987 in the Western English Channel, near Plymouth, UK. Two sets of species were identified: spring spawning (April to July) and summer spawning (July to September). The timing of appearance of the spring-spawning group in the plankton was significantly <b>dependent</b> on <b>sea</b> temperatures the previous November and December, with earlier appearance during cooler years. We suggest {{that this could be}} due to colder years triggering earlier winter migration of adults from cool inshore habitat to warmer offshore overwintering grounds, which in turn results in earlier gonad maturation and spawning. In contrast, the timing of appearance of the summer-spawning group was significantly <b>dependent</b> on <b>sea</b> temperatures the preceding March, with earlier spawning during warmer years. This may be due exclusively to more rapid gonad maturation in offshore waters. These data emphasize that marine fish populations do not always respond uniformly to temperature change. Moreover, since appropriate timing of larval fish appearance in the plankton may be critical for the match or mismatch with essential trophic resources, the thermally induced phenological changes identified have potential to influence annual recruitment success...|$|R

50|$|Since its founding, Hartford kept a fort at {{the mouth}} of the Connecticut River - at present-day Old Saybrook - for {{protection}} against the Pequots, Wampanoags, Mohegans, and the New Netherland Colony. After Springfield broke ties with the Connecticut Colony, the remaining Connecticut settlements demanded that Springfield's ships pay tolls when passing the mouth of the Connecticut River. Springfield's ships refused to pay this tax without representation at Connecticut's fort. Hartford, in turn, refused to grant Springfield representation. In response, the Massachusetts Bay Colony solidified its friendship with Springfield by levying a toll on Connecticut Colony ships entering Boston Harbor. Connecticut, which was then largely <b>dependent</b> on <b>sea</b> trade with Boston, permanently dropped its tax on Springfield.

40|$|Abstract A global {{trend of}} a warming climate may seri-ously affect species <b>dependent</b> on <b>sea</b> ice. We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} climate on the Baltic ringed seals (Phoca hispida botnica), using historical and future climatological time series. Availability of suitable breeding ice is known to affect pup survival. We used detailed information on how winter temperatures affect the extent of breeding ice and a climatological model (RCA 3) to project the expected effects on the Baltic ringed seal population. The population comprises of three sub-populations, and our simulations suggest {{that all of them}} will experience severely hampered growth rates during the coming 90 years. The projected 30 730 seals {{at the end of the}} twenty-first century constitutes only 16 % of the historical population size, and thus reduced ice cover alone will severely limit their growth rate. This adds burden to a species already haunted by other anthro-pogenic impacts...|$|R
40|$|A {{multiple}} regression scheme with tropical cyclone intensity {{change as the}} dependent variable has been developed. The new scheme is titled the Typhoon Intensity Prediction Scheme (TIPS) and is similar to one used operationally at the National Hurricane Center. However, TIPS contains two major differences: it is developed for the western North Pacific Ocean, and utilizes digitized satellite data; the first time such satellite information has been combined with other predictors in a tropical cyclone {{multiple regression}} scheme. It is shown that the satellite data contains vital information that distinguishes between fast and slow developing tropical cyclones. The importance of other predictors (such as wind shear, persistence, climatology, and an empirical formula <b>dependent</b> on <b>sea</b> surface temperature) to intensity change are also clarified in the statistical analysis. A nor-malization technique reveals threshold values useful to forecasters. It is shown that TIPS may be competitive with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center in forecasting tropical cyclone intensity change. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{synthesis}} study assesses {{recent changes}} of Arctic Ocean physical parameters using a unique collection of observations from the 2000 s and places {{them in the}} context of long-term climate trends and variability. Our analysis demonstrates that the 2000 s were an exceptional decade with extraordinary upper Arctic Ocean freshening and intermediate Atlantic water warming. We note that the Arctic Ocean is characterized by large amplitude multi-decadal variability in addition to a long-term trend, making the link of observed changes to climate drivers problematic. However, the exceptional magnitude of recent high-latitude changes (not only oceanic, but also ice and atmospheric) strongly suggests that these recent changes signify a potentially irreversible shift of the Arctic Ocean to a new climate state. These changes have important implications for the Arctic Ocean’s marine ecosystem, especially those components that are <b>dependent</b> on <b>sea</b> ice or that have temperature-dependent sensitivities or thresholds. Addressing these and other questions requires a carefully orchestrated combination of sustained multidisciplinary observations and advanced modeling...|$|R
