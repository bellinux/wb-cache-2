5|$|In November 2008, after Sakurai {{was given}} the go-ahead to develop Uprising, he rented out an office in Takadanobaba, a {{district}} of Tokyo. At this stage, due to the game's platform still being in early development, there were no development tools available for Sakurai to use. Between November and March 2009, Sakurai finalized his vision for the game. During this period, to help design the game's settings and characters, Sakurai hired several outside illustrators to work on concept art: these artists were Toshio Noguchi, Akifumi Yamamoto and Masaki Hirooka. The art style was inspired by manga. In January 2009, development studio Project Sora was established for Uprisings development. At its inception, it had a staff of 30. With the start of active recruitment in March 2009, the game officially entered development: at the time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first game to be in development for the new platform. During this early stage, {{due to the lack}} of platform specific development tools, the team were developing the game on Wii hardware and personal computers. The changing specifications of the developing hardware resulted in multiple features undergoing major revisions. This hardware instability led to a protracted development cycle: in the event, the team managed to fully utilize the platform's capabilities, doing detailed work on how many enemies they could show on the screen at any one time. Debugging also took a long time due to the size and variability of gameplay built into Uprising.|$|E

25|$|The Irish Parliament {{was thus}} {{at a time}} of English {{commercial}} expansion left incapable of protecting Irish economic and trade interests from being subordinated to English ones. This in turn severely weakened the economic potential of the whole of Ireland and placed the new and largely Protestant middle-class at a disadvantage. The result was a slow but continual exodus of Anglo-Irish, Scots-Irish, and Protestant Irish families and communities to the colonies, principally in North America. Ironically, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> efforts to establish Anglicans as the primacy in Ireland which slowly subverted the general cause of the Protestant Irish which had been the objective of successive Irish and British Parliaments.|$|E

The game was fixed for Ashtown; however, upon arrival both teams refused to play there as somebody had neglected to have the grass cut.

The game itself turned into a rout as Cork scored a huge tally of 6-8 to Kilkenny’s 0-2. It was Cork’s second All-Ireland title in-a-row.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} century CE, the idea of magic was then absorbed by early Christian authors, who {{incorporated}} it into their developing Christian theology. They retained the Graeco-Roman negative connotations of the term and enhanced them by incorporating conceptual patterns borrowed by Jewish thought. Thus, for early Christian writers like Augustine of Hippo, magic was not merely fraudulent and unsanctioned ritual practices, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> opposite of religion because it relied upon cooperation from demons, the henchmen of Satan. Ever since, the idea that magic is something defined in opposition to religion has been pervasive throughout Western culture. Christian theologians believed that there were multiple different forms of magic, the majority of which were types of divination. For instance, Isidore of Seville listed geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy, and pyromancy as forms of magic alongside enchantment and ligatures.|$|E

25|$|The {{very first}} South-Eastern European Pride, called The Internationale Pride, {{was assumed to}} be a {{promotion}} of the human right to freedom of assembly in Croatia and some Eastern European states, where such rights of the LGBT population are not respected, and a support for organising the very first Prides in that communities. Out of all ex-Yugoslav states, at that time only Slovenia and Croatia had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in Belgrade, Serbia in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in Zagreb, Croatia from June 22–25, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and Southeastern European countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania and Latvia have been organizing Prides. Slovakia also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from Slovenska pospolitost (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Lithuania have never had Prides before. There were also representatives from Kosovo, that participated apart from Serbia. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event.
