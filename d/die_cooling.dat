40|$|Abstract. To prevent local {{overheating}} of the workpiece material in hot aluminum extrusion {{the influence of}} <b>die</b> <b>cooling</b> was investigated. Numerical simulations of extrusion revealed an advantage of the die bearing cooling, which {{can be accomplished by}} locating the cooling channels close to the die/bearing surface. Since the fabrication of especially geometric complex cooling channels located near the die surface is not possible by conventional manufacturing technologies, the technology of rapid tooling was introduced into hot aluminum extrusion and experimentally tested. Cooling channels near to the bearings show promising results allowing extensions of extrusion limits, especially the extrusion speed and therefore productivity. Cooling of extrusion dies- state of the art In hot metal extrusion of homogeneously preheated billets, the exit temperature of the extrudate increases immediately after starting the process due to heat generated in the forming zone. Heat is also generated as the ram displacement increases because of friction and shear in the peripheral zone of the billet [1]. Surface extrusion defects like hot cracks can occur [2]. In typical wrought aluminum alloys these type of defects are caused by local melting of particular low temperature microstructure phases, e. g. along the grain boundaries, where temperatures exceed the solidu...|$|E

FE simulation of material flow, temperature distribution, die deflection and dimensional variation of the component during extrusion, punch retraction, component ejection and cooling was conducted using a coupled thermo-mechanical approach for the forward extrusion of pure aluminium and low-carbon steel in tools of steel. Heat generated by the deformation of the work material and that generated by friction at the component–die interface, heat transfer from the component to the <b>die,</b> <b>cooling</b> of the component, die deflection due to elasticity and temperature changes and the dimensional variation of the component resulting from thermal and elasticity factors with different process conditions were investigated. The results show that the thermal and elastic behaviour of the process have a significant influence on the accuracy of formed components not only during tool loading and unloading, but also during component ejection and cooling. The thermal behaviour of the component has a greater impact on component form errors than has the elastic behaviour of the tool and the component for aluminium components. For low-carbon steel, the elastic behaviour of the tool and the component has a more dominant influence on the accuracy of the component. Changes in the process conditions including the punch velocity, the interfacial friction, the die transition radii and the die land also affect the accuracy of the component. Temperature changes in the die during a single forming cycle do not cause significant changes in its dimension; consequently, die deflection is dependent mainly on the elastic deformation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a hybrid {{optimization}} {{of the degree of}} cure and temperature field into the work piece during the pultrusion manufacturing process. The procedure is based on the consecutive application of a heuristic technique (Genetic Algorithms), with an analytical method (simplex technique), to minimize an opportunely defined fitness function. The objective function measures the uniformity of the degree of cure, with a satisfactory mean value, in the exit cross section of the forming die, taking into account constraints related to the degradation of the processing resin system, due to an exothermic peak temperature major than the carbonisation temperature of the polymeric matrix. Optimal values of the temperatures of the die heating platens have been evaluated by applying the proposed procedure to a three dimensional thermo-chemical numerical model, solved using a finite difference scheme. The robustness of the developed optimization procedure has been tested using several combinations of process parameters, such as temperature of the resin bath, temperature of the <b>die</b> <b>cooler,</b> and composite material pull speed. A finite element model is used to analyze temperature field and degree of cure profiles after the optimization of the temperatures of the heating platens.

40|$|A novel {{continuous}} casting process used {{to form a}} highly filled, thermoplastic paste into a net shape ceramic body has been investigated, a method termed thermal paste processing (TPP). TPP uses a long cylindrical <b>die</b> <b>cooled</b> below the solidification temperature of the continuous phase, so that the extrudate merges from the die as a solid rod. Thermal processes were investigated using standard and novel power compensated DSC techniques, yielding both enthalpic response and thermal transport properties. The rheological behaviour was characterised over 9 decades of apparent shear rate, for temperatures from the melt to mushy range. Steady and dynamic shear responses were probed with controlled stress and controlled strain rotational rheometers, using smooth or serrated parallel disks, concentric cylinders, or vane-type geometries. Capillary rheometry using the multi-pass technique was also performed. The rheological characterisation revealed a mismatch between expected and measured onset temperatures when using a parallel disk rheometer; {{this led to the}} measurement and simulation of the sample’s and rheometer’s temperature fields. These results were incorporated into the description of the paste’s rheological response to temperature. The thermal and rheological parameters yielded by the above characterisations were incorporated into a 2 -D axisymmetric model of the TPP die system using the finite element method (FEM). The numerical code performance was compared against three suitable benchmark problems reported in the literature.
