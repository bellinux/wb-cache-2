40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the subject <b>of</b> the <b>interference</b> {{modelling}} for xDSL technologies. First, the xDSL technologies are explained. Following is the presentation and description of the different kinds of the xDSL technologies. The next part deals with the basic parameters of metallic cable lines – especially the primary and secondary parameters. Nowadays wider bandwidths are used for the achievement of higher data transmission rates. During a higher frequency signal transmission a more intensive line attenuation appears. To identify the transfer characteristics of the lines while using an xDSL system, mathematic models of transmission lines are applied. That is why these mathematic models are dealt with in the next chapter. At the end of this section the mathematic models are compared using the modular and phase characteristics. The main aim of the work is to describe the different impacts which influence the efficiency of the xDSL systems. First, the causes interfering from the inside of the cable are deeply explained: Near End Crosstalk (NEXT), Far End Crosstalk (FEXT), Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). Following is the explanation of the external interfering impacts: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) and Impulse Noise. The next goal of this thesis is a design of a workstation for the tests of spectral features and the efficiency of the xDSL systems. The work also presents a designed GUI application and its description. The GUI application is an instrument for the choice or data <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> the final <b>interference.</b> The last chapter describes a realization of a measurement and shows the measured characteristics which were recorded on the ADSL tester and oscilloscope...|$|R

The relatively slower forward stepping of the rods in an extended bottleneck region, located in between the two entry sites, controls the extent <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> <b>of</b> the co-directional flow of the two species of rods. The relative positions of the sites <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> the two species of rods {{with respect to the}} location of the bottleneck are motivated by a biological phenomenon. However, the primary focus of the study here is to explore the effects <b>of</b> the <b>interference</b> <b>of</b> the flow of the two species of rods on their spatio-temporal organization and the regulations <b>of</b> this <b>interference</b> by the extended bottleneck. By a combination of mean-field theory and computer simulation we calculate the flux of both species of rods and their density profiles as well as the composite phase diagrams of the system. If the bottleneck is sufficiently stringent some of the phases become practically unrealizable although not ruled out on the basis of any fundamental physical principle. Moreover the extent of suppression of flow of the downstream entrants by the flow of the upstream entrants can also be regulated by the strength of the bottleneck. We speculate on the possible implications of the results {{in the context of the}} biological phenomenon that motivated the formulation of the theoretical model.

Previous {{research has shown that}} proactive interference has less impact for emotional than neutral study material (Levens & Phelps, 2008). However, it is unclear how emotional content affects the impact <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> in memory.

40|$|Betaretroviruses {{of sheep}} include two {{exogenous}} viruses, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), {{and a group}} of endogenous viruses known as enJSRVs. The exogenous JSRV and ENTV are the etiological agents of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) and enzootic nasal tumor (ENT), respectively. Sheep affected by OPA or ENT do not show an appreciable antibody response to JSRV or ENTV. Consequently, it is conceivable that enJSRV expression in the fetal lamb tolerizes sheep to the related exogenous viruses. In this study, possible mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> between the sheep exogenous and endogenous betaretroviruses were investigated. In situ hybridization detected enJSRV RNAs in lymphoid cells associated with the lamina propria of the small intestine and in the thymus of sheep fetuses.
