50|$|The {{other aspects}} of the film have been {{similarly}} skewered. The acting is usually described as flat and generally poor, and as not improving, or sometimes, worsening, the already weak script. One part of the film, on the other hand, has garnered almost universal praise: Godzilla's final attack on Megalon, a flying kick. It has been called the saving grace of the film, and was made famous by the mock <b>exclamations</b> <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> and awe displayed on Godzilla vs. Megalons appearance on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Through the end of season three to the middle of season five, that clip would be shown at the opening of each show.|$|E

60|$|Now Mr. Green was so {{completely}} {{a star of}} a confined orbit, that his ideas seldom described a tangent to their ordinary revolutions. He was so much accustomed to hear of England ruling colonies, the East and the West, Canada, the Cape, and New South Wales, {{that it was not}} an easy matter for him to conceive himself to be without the influence of the British laws. Had he quitted home with the intention to emigrate, or even to travel, it is probable that his mind would have kept a more equal pace with his body, but summoned in haste from his desk, and with the office spectacles on his nose, {{it is not so much}} a matter of wonder that he hardly realized the truths of his present situation. The man-of-war, in which everything was His Majesty's, sustained this feeling, and it was too sudden a change to expect such a man to abandon all his most cherished notions at a moment's warning. The irreverent <b>exclamation</b> <b>of</b> Captain Truck <b>shocked</b> him, and he did not fail to show as much by the disgust pictured in his countenance.|$|R
