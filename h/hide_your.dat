Thom Owens of Allmusic wrote of this album that [...] "They certainly can work a heavy, bluesy groove with dexterity, but they lack the gonzo charm they had on their debut, Pickin' on Nashville [...] — there simply isn't the sense of careening fun, nor is there the reckless fusions that resulted in such an invigorating listen."

So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to <b>hide</b> <b>your</b> shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from <b>Hide</b> <b>Your</b> Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she closes her eyes. She's in a sacred space and you feel that.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{a new trend}} also emerged in Japanese rock music: the visual kei, a {{movement}} notable by male bands who wore makeup, extravagant hair styles, and androgynous costumes. The most successful representatives of the movement are X Japan (formerly known as [...] "X") and Buck-Tick. X Japan released their first album Vanishing Vision on the indie label Extasy Records in 1988; their album Blue Blood was released on CBS Sony in 1989. Blue Blood sold 712,000 copies, and their 1991 album Jealousy sold over 1.11 million copies. Surprisingly, X Japan were a heavy metal band, but guitarist hide later came {{under the influence of}} alternative rock, releasing his first solo album <b>Hide</b> <b>Your</b> Face in 1994 and launching his successful solo career.|$|E

In addition to all vocals and songwriting, he played most of the guitars and bass {{on some of the}} tracks. The album's musical style differed significantly from the speed metal anthems and power ballads of X Japan, leaning more towards alternative rock. hide then went on the Hide Our Psychommunity Tour, for which a live band was hired that would later become his primary project, hide with Spread Beaver.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the outset}} of his solo career, hide experimented with {{instrumentations}} {{very different from what}} he usually had access to in X Japan. The <b>Hide</b> <b>Your</b> Face opening track [...] "Psychommunity", for example, has four guitar tracks and employs a full string section. As another example, [...] "Blue Sky Complex" [...] features guitars in drop C tuning, a trumpet section, and an organ. His music is also of genres uncharacteristic of X, with the bulk of his catalog being considered alternative rock or hard rock. The title track of his second album Psyence is a big band/jazz composition with full brass, however, most songs on the record are clearly industrial rock with varying uses of guitar effects. Of note is that most bass guitar tracks on the album were played by hide himself. Instrumentation and songwriting are less experimental on Ja, Zoo, with most songs featuring a fairly conventional two guitars, bass, drums, and keyboards. Traditional piano and violins, and a Hammond B-3 organ do, however, make an appearance.|$|E
