5|$|In 2001, the Ministry of Justice {{considered}} reorganizing {{the search}} and rescue services, and looked into moving the 330 Squadron from Banak to Hammerfest Airport. The rationale was the proximity to Hammerfest Hospital and a typical 40-minute shorter flight time to the coast. However, such a location would give longer travel time to the <b>inner</b> <b>parts</b> of Finnmark. The plans were hindered by opposition from the Air Force, {{as they would have}} to establish a military station at Hammerfest. The Norwegian Armed Forces announced in 2007 that they would carry out a major restructuring and decrease of activity in Finnmark, with the long-term plan to close the Garrison of Porsanger.|$|E

5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the <b>inner</b> <b>parts</b> of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E

40|$|An {{acceleration}} free {{research laboratory}} is provided that is confined within a satellite but {{free of any}} physical engagement with {{the walls of the}} satellite, wherein the laboratory has adequate power, heating, cooling, and communications services to conduct basic research and development. An <b>inner</b> <b>part</b> containing the laboratory is positioned at the center-of-mass of a satellite within the satellite's outer shell. The satellite is then positioned such that its main axes are in a position parallel to its flight velocity vector or {{in the direction of the}} residual acceleration vector. When the satellite is in its desired orbit, the <b>inner</b> <b>part</b> is set free so as to follow that orbit without contacting the inside walls of the outer shell. Sensing means detect the position of the <b>inner</b> <b>part</b> with respect to the outer shell, and activate control rockets to move the outer shell; thereby, the <b>inner</b> <b>part</b> is repositioned such that it is correctly positioned at the center-of-mass of the satellite. As a consequence, all disturbing forces, such as drag forces, act on the outer shell, and the <b>inner</b> <b>part</b> containing the laboratory is shielded and is affected only by gravitational forces. Power is supplied to the <b>inner</b> <b>part</b> and to the laboratory by a balanced microwave/laser link which creates the kind of environment necessary for basic research to study critical phenomena such as the Lambda transition in helium and crystal growth, and to perform special metals and alloys research, etc...|$|R

5|$|The Alversund Bridge was a toll bridge {{which was}} {{paying for the}} debt {{accumulated}} in its construction. By 1968, the debt would be paid off, but the Norwegian Public Roads Administration launched a plan whereby the tolls {{would continue to be}} collected and used to finance a bridge across Salhusfjorden. This was opposed by a group of locals, who brought the issue to the courts, claiming it to be illegal, as a bridge would never be built. Both Oslo District Court and Eidsivating Court of Appeal concluded that the tolls were legal, and the issue was rejected by the Supreme Court. Protests were also raised against the use of a pontoon bridge, as it would limit the vessel size and thus the commercial development in the <b>inner</b> <b>parts</b> of the fjord.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} {{encountered}} in deciphering {{the dynamics of}} the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50RJ. The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability. The process is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in hydrodynamics. In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere. The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>parts</b> of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter. This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.|$|E

25|$|The country {{experienced}} an economic boom starting in 1871, with demands {{throughout the country}} for railways to be built. Official planning of a railway through Vestfold to Brevik commenced with a royal resolution on 24 July 1871.

There was also at the time problems with the <b>inner</b> <b>parts</b> of the Oslofjord and the Drammensfjord icing during winter, {{and access to the}} ports on the outer fjord would ease the export situation for industry.|$|E
25|$|From the 1936 season a {{permanent}} {{location for the}} airport was needed. A key factor was the need to place it {{as close to the}} city center as possible.

The most costly part was a floating docks, which was built using twelve used oil drums. A barracks in the <b>inner</b> <b>parts</b> of the port was used as a terminal building.|$|E
30|$|The above {{discussions are}} {{mainly on the}} change in the {{inherent}} properties of materials.

25|$|In 1914, Russia {{entered the}} First World War by attacking the Germans and the Austrians from the east, but {{soon it was}} pushed back {{in a series of}} devastating German victories, which {{eventually}} left almost the entire Baltic region in German hands.

25|$|Planetesimals at a {{distance}} of 1astronomical unit (AU), the distance of the Earth from the Sun, probably did not contribute any water to the Earth because the solar nebula was too hot for ice to form and the hydration of rocks by water vapor would have taken too long. The water must have been supplied by meteorites from the outer asteroid belt and some large planetary embryos from beyond 2.5AU. Comets may also have contributed. Though most comets are today in orbits farther away from the Sun than Neptune, computer simulations show that they were originally far more common in the <b>inner</b> <b>parts</b> of the solar system.|$|E
