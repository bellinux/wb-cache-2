Traditional <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> and transfer utilizing laparotomy in goats frequently results in adhesions that can reduce the overall reproductive performance of the animal. The objectives of this study were to develop and compare the use and efficiency of less invasive techniques, laparoscopic and non-surgical, for <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> and transfer in goats. These techniques were evaluated by comparing the collection and pregnancy rates achieved during this project. Several parameters were recorded during these procedures; 1. superovulatory response, 2. morphological characteristics of the corpus luteum (CL) and its effect on collection and pregnancy rates, 3. length of time for ovarian observation, 4. ease of collection and transfer and 5. length of time for <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> and transfer. Spanish cross donor does (n= 75) were subjected to a synchronization and superovulatory regimen. Donor animals exhibiting signs of estrus (n= 59) were subjected to a laparoscopic ovarian evaluation. Of these, 13 (22 %) presented early regressing CL (ERCL). Of 43 synchronized recipients examined laparoscopically, 5 (11. 6 %) presented ERCL. Those animals that exhibited ERCL were not used for <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> or transfer. The time required to perform laparoscopic ovarian evaluation increased with the increasing number of ovulations (range I min 58 see to 12 min 34 see). Donor does demonstrated a mean L+SE) of 11. 8 + 1. 7 ovulations. Mean L+SE) percent embryo recovery rates of 46. 9 + 8. 0 and 60. 4 + 7. 6 were achieved using the non-surgical and laparoscopic techniques, respectively. The embryo/ova recovery rates as a function of ovulation rate were demonstrated to be higher for the laparoscopic technique when the ovulation rate was greater than 16. Both collection techniques required approximately 45 minutes to perform. The pregnancy rates (42. 1 % for both) achieved with both embryo transfer techniques demonstrated to be identical. The presence of an antral follicle and/or a CA concomitant with a CL did not statistically influence the mean pregnancy rate. The average time required to perform embryo transfers by laparoscopy was shorter than the time required for non-surgical transfer (4 : 00 vs [...] 9 : 54 min). The results of this research indicate that laparoscopic <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> resulted in a significantly higher embryo recovery rate than non-surgical <b>embryo</b> <b>collection,</b> however the rate of embryo recovery for individual animals ranged from 0 -I 00 % utilizing both techniques...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in nonsurgical deep uterine (NsDU) embryo transfer (ET) technology allow the noninvasive transfer of porcine embryos into recipients, overcoming {{the most important}} impediment for commercial ET in this species. Although many factors in the porcine ET-field have been recently evaluated, many others remain to be explored. We investigated here the future reproductive performance of donors and recipients after artificial insemination subsequent to the default surgical embryo recovery approach and to the NsDU-ET procedure, respectively. Although surgical <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> did not influence subsequent farrowing rates (90. 5 %), litter size decreased severely (8. 9 +/- 0. 8 piglets) compared to presurgery (10. 8 +/- 0. 3 piglets) and control group (10. 7 +/- 0. 3 piglets). In contrast, NsDU-ETs did neither affect fertility nor prolificacy of recipients in the cycle subsequent to ET, {{regardless of whether they}} were pregnant after NsDU-ET or not. These results indicate that while the surgical <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> procedure compromises the reproductive future of donor sows, the NsDU-ET approach does not affect the reproductive potential of the recipients after reintroduction to the breeding stock of the farm. Further research is thus needed to improve surgical <b>embryo</b> <b>collection.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Therefore follicular development as well as fertilization rates play important roles in the production of viable embryos. A large variation in response to the superovulatory procedure exists among females in ovulation rate and number of transferable embryos. Approximately one-third of the female cattle induced to superovulate do not respond with transferable embryos. Only 40 to 60 percent of the embryos transferred develop into calves.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficiency of non-surgical <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> in goats. Five lactating Saanen goats were tested alternately in a cross-over design for two treatments (T 1 and T 2). In both treatments, intravaginal progesterone devices were inserted (day 0 / 6 p. m.) and removed six days later (day 6 / 18 : 00 p. m.) and 22. 5 μg cloprostenol were administered by intravulvosubmucosal via (day 0). From day 4 (18 : 00 p. m.), goats received six decreasing doses of FSH (250 – 400 IU) at 12 h interval. Three doses of 50 mg flunixin meglumine were administered on days 9, 10, and 11. In T 1 and T 2, animals received two doses of saline or 250 mg of rbST on day 0 and on first detection of estrus, respectively. Goats were mated until the end of estrus and uteri were flushed by cervical route seven days after first mating. The <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> interval was 60 days.

40|$|Gonadotropin {{releasing}} hormone (GnRH) treatment was examined {{as a means}} of improving the efficacy of <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> in the sheep following intrauterine insemination of frozen-thawed semen. In summary, treatment consistently improved fertilization rates and the number of fertilized ova collected per ewe was enhanced compared with untreated ewes. The yield of fertilized ova in ewes treated with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) was maximized by administering GnRH 36 h after progestagen treatment; 24 h was the preferred time in ewes treated with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). There was a significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) increase in the percentage of unfertilized ova in the former treatment when GnRH was given at 24 h. An examination of the time of insemination (0, 6, 12 and 18 h before the median time of ovulation) indicated that fertilization rates were highest when inseminationo ccurred at 6 h in both GnRH-treatede wes and in untreated ewes. In GnRH-treated ewes, the recovery of ova was lowest when insemination occurred at the time of ovulation. The number of motile frozen-thawed spermatozoa required for fertilizat n treatment was estimated to be approximately 20 x +? following 10 per uterine horn. GnRH-treatment also improved the yield of fertilized ova in sheep that were naturally mated, although this yield was lower than that obtained with intrauterine insemination of frozen-thawed semen. It is concluded that fertilization failure, a major problem in sheep <b>embryo</b> <b>collection,</b> can be eliminated through judicious use of GnRH treatment and properly timed intrauterine insemination...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether or not reproductive performance in cattle produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is significantly different from that of their genetic donors. To address this question, we directed two longitudinal studies using different embryo production procedures: (1) superovulation followed by artificial insemination (AI) and <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> and (2) ultrasound-guided ovum pick-up followed by in vitro fertilization (OPU-IVF). Collectively, these two studies represent the largest data set available for any species on the reproductive performance of female clones and their genetic donors as measured by their embryo production outcomes in commercial embryo production program. The large-scale study described herein was conducted over a six-year period of time and provides a unique comparison of 96 clones to the 40 corresponding genetic donors. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study on the reproductive performance of cattle clones using OPU-IVF.

Heifers were superstimulated either with FSH (total of 26 milligrams) or HMG (total of 1, 050 international units) beginning on days 9 to 12 of an estrous cycle and PGF 2 a (40 milligrams) was administered at 60 and 72 hours after the beginning of superovulatory treatments. Heifers were artificially inseminated three times at 12 -hour intervals beginning 48 hours after PGF 2 a treatment. Blood serum samples were collected immediately before treatments began and at frequent intervals until <b>embryo</b> <b>collection</b> 288 hours later. Concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH were not affected by hormone treatments, route of PGF 2 a injection, or interactions between them. Estradiol- 17 ß (E 2 - 17 ß) levels were higher in HMG- than in FSH-treated heifers 60 hours after gonadotropin treatment.

Progesterone concentrations were not influenced by treatment or route of PGF 2 a administration. The progesterone:E 2 - 17 ß ratio was higher in FSH- than in HMG-treated heifers 24 hours after the LH peak.
