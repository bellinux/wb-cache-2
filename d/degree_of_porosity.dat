40|$|Ball Grid Array (BGA) {{technology}} {{has taken off}} in recent years due to the increased need for high interconnect density. Opposite to all the advantages BGA packages offer, porosity in collapsible BGA solder joints is often a major concern in the reliability of such packages. The effect of pores {{on the strength of}} collapsible BGA solder-joints was studied by manufacturing samples with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> and testing them under a shear load. It was found that the shear strength of the solder joints decreased in a linear fashion with increasing porosity. Failure occurred by internal necking of the interpore matrix. It was confirmed that entrapment of flux residues leads to porosity by manufacturing fluxless samples in a specially made furnace, and comparing them with samples assembled using flux. Also, contamination of Au electrodeposits (in substrate metallization) was determined to cause significant porosity. It was found that hard-Au (Co hardened Au) electrodeposits produce high <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> {{even in the absence of}} flux. Finally, increasing the time the solder spends in the molten state was proven to successfully decrease porosity...|$|R
40|$|A non-destructive, {{non-invasive}} technique for porosity detection in samples of dielectric materials is described. The sample porosity {{is derived from}} the variation of dielectric permittivity of the sample with respect to dielectric permittivity of the intrinsic material; the permittivity is assessed using a microwave sensor, whose resonance frequency depends on the dielectric constant of the material under test. Different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> have been artificially induced into samples of polymeric materials; measurements obtained by the described technique are in good accordance with conventional measurements based on physical characteristics (mass and volume) of the sample...|$|R

A typical Eco-Cement concrete block would be expected to fully carbonate within a year.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{condition}} {{plays an}} important role in determining the required deposit thickness and good field performance. For example, machined substrates alloyed with sulfur and/or lead are particularly vulnerable to a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity,</b> since these alloying constituents are catalytic poisons to the deposition process. Substrates with high roughness values require thicker deposits to provide adequate corrosion protection. This is primarily due to the formation of nodules on the roughened surface during the initial stages of deposition, resulting in microporosity of the ENP film.|$|E
50|$|All rocks have {{a certain}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{porosity}},</b> with some rock types having a much higher porosity than others. This means that between the individual grains of the rock, there are small pores which can be filled with a gas (usually air) or a fluid. The commonest pore fluid is water, {{and the presence of}} water can vary the friction on a fault to a large degree. As water accumulates in the pore space of a body of rock around a fault, the pressure inside the pores builds. On the interface of a presently stable fault, an increase in pore pressure has the effect of essentially pushing the fault apart at a microscopic level. This pore pressure increase can then decrease the surface area of the individual asperities in contact on the fault, causing them to then fracture and the fault to slip. However, the presence of water may not always cause a reduction in friction.|$|E

50|$|Since an engine's oil circulates at {{much higher}} {{pressures}} than its coolant, {{oil in a}} porous head {{has a tendency to}} gradually seep into the coolant galleries. A typical symptom of a porous head is usually a 'mayonnaise'-like substance forming somewhere inside the cooling system (usually, this can be found residing on the coolant reservoir cap). However, depending on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity,</b> symptoms of a porous head have a tendency to vary. Many C20XE operators have described the symptom as a curry-like residue or in more severe cases, a thick brown sludge which may overcome the entire cooling system. In such instances, engine oil will readily react with the sulfur in rubber components, hence quickly degrading coolant pipes and hoses to the point of failure. During the porous head debacle, GM faced bankruptcy - therefore dealers failed to recall affected models. Due in part, to the engine's immense prominence and demand, many businesses now specialize in the repair of porous GM C20XE/LET heads - by either sleeving the affected gallery or by injecting a polymer based substance into the porous region. Reportedly, a small number of total GM C20XE cylinder heads ever exhibited significant symptoms of porosity.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying {{separator}} membrane physical parameters such as <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity,</b> tortuosity and thickness, on battery delivered capacity was studied {{in order to}} optimize performance of lithium-ion batteries. This was achieved by a theoretical mathematical model relating the Bruggeman coefficient with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> and tortuosity. The inclusion of the separator membrane in the simulation model of the battery system {{does not affect the}} delivered capacity of the battery. The ionic conductivity of the separator and consequently the delivered capacity values obtained at different discharge rates depends on the value of the Bruggeman coefficient, which is related with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> and tortuosity of the membrane. Independently of scan rate, the optimal value of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> is above 50 % and the separator thickness should range between 1 μm at 32 μm for improved battery performance.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in regenerative medicine is promoting sufficient vascularisation of tissue-engineered constructs. One approach to overcome this challenge is to target the cellular hypoxia inducible factor (HIF- 1 α) pathway, which responds to low oxygen concentration (hypoxia) and results in the activation of numerous pro-angiogenic genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Cobalt ions are known to mimic hypoxia by artificially stabilising the HIF- 1 α transcription factor. Here, resorbable bioactive glass particles (38 μm and 100 μm) with cobalt ions incorporated into the glass network were used to create bioactive glass/collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffolds optimised for bone tissue engineering.

40|$|International audienceThe {{manufacturing}} processes of porous silicon (PoSi) by electrochemical etching now allow samples with variable depths and variable <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> to be obtained.

For this, an immersion insertion-substitution technique has been used. Samples with different porosities and depths are studied. The thickness of the wafer (550 microns) and high sound speed in pure silicon (8450 m. s- 1) require transducers with high central frequencies (from 15 to 50 MHz). The acoustic parameters of the wafer, such as velocity and attenuation are measured.

40|$|Objectives:The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> on the release of growth factors (PDGF AA, PDGF BB, bFGF) by healing PTFE grafts. Design and setting:Laboratory animal study. Materials: 1 cm long segments of non-reinforced PTFE grafts (30 microns fibril length, 2 mm internal diameter, 0. 39 mm thick) were placed as an abdominal aortic interposition in Lewis rats. Fifteen grafts served as control (Group A; porous grafts); in eight rats (Group B; non porous grafts) the PTFE graft was completely wrapped by a non-porous plastic envelope. Animals were killed 4 weeks after surgery. Outcome measures:The release of PDGF AA, PDGF BB, and bFGF was assessed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Results:The release of PDGF AA, PDGF BB and bFGF was statistically higher in porous grafts. The only histological difference between the two groups was that porous PTFE grafts were invaded by many tufts of capillaries from the surrounding tissue, whereas this phenomenon was absent in non porous PTFE grafts. Conclusions:The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>porosity</b> influences the release of growth factors by healing PTFE grafts.

The {{surface charge}} {{properties}} of two SiO 2 and three Al 2 O 3 mineral adsorbents with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> framework <b>porosity</b> were investigated using discontinuous titration and ion adsorption methodologies.
