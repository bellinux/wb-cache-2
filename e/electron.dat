5|$|<b>Electron</b> {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the <b>electron</b> interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in <b>electron</b> microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional <b>electron</b> microscopy is not limited by <b>electron</b> wavelength, but by the large aberrations of <b>electron</b> lenses.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{particle}} accelerators generate <b>electron</b> beams {{for treatment of}} superficial tumors in radiation therapy. <b>Electron</b> therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an <b>electron</b> beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5cm for <b>electron</b> energies in the range 5–20MeV. An <b>electron</b> beam {{can be used to}} supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The <b>electron</b> {{affinity}} of an atom is {{the amount}} of energy released when an <b>electron</b> is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although <b>electron</b> affinity varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive <b>electron</b> affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra <b>electron.</b> The <b>electron</b> affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so {{they may or may not}} have slightly negative values.|$|E
50|$|Core <b>electrons</b> are the <b>electrons</b> in an atom {{that are}} not valence <b>electrons</b> and {{therefore}} {{do not participate in}} bonding. The number of valence <b>electrons</b> of an element can be determined by the periodic table group of the element. With the exception of the transition metals in groups 3-12 and the Lanthanide and Actinide series, the number of valence <b>electrons</b> ranges from 0-8 <b>electrons.</b> All the non-valence <b>electrons</b> for an atom of that element are considered core electrons.Core <b>electrons</b> are tightly bound to the nucleus. Therefore, unlike valence <b>electrons</b> the core <b>electrons</b> play a secondary role in chemical bonding and reactions by screening the positive charge of the atomic nucleus from the valence shell of <b>electrons.</b> In transition metals, the distinction between core and valence <b>electrons</b> is less distinct with <b>electrons</b> in the highest d-shell acting more like valence <b>electrons</b> than core <b>electrons.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{outgoing}} <b>electrons</b> in non-sequential {{multiple ionization}} in intense laser fields are strongly correlated. The correlations {{can be explained}} within a classical model for interacting <b>electrons</b> {{in the presence of}} the external field. Here we extend the previous analysis for two and three <b>electrons</b> to cases with up to eight <b>electrons</b> and identify the saddle configurations that guard the channels for non-sequential multiple ionization. For four and fewer <b>electrons</b> the <b>electrons</b> in the dominant configuration are equivalent, for six and more <b>electrons</b> this is no longer the case. The case of five <b>electrons</b> is marginal, with two almost degenerate transition configurations. The total number of configurations increases rapidly, from 2 configurations for three <b>electrons</b> up to 26 configurations for eight <b>electrons.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
50|$|In metals, {{the charge}} {{carriers}} are <b>electrons.</b> One {{or two of}} the valence <b>electrons</b> from each atom is able to move about freely within the crystal structure of the metal. The free <b>electrons</b> are referred to as conduction <b>electrons,</b> and the cloud of free <b>electrons</b> is called a Fermi gas.|$|R
5|$|A more area-selective {{method is}} <b>electron</b> energy loss spectroscopy, which {{measures}} the energy loss of an <b>electron</b> beam within a transmission <b>electron</b> microscope when it interacts with {{a portion of}} a sample. The atom-probe tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one <b>electron</b> is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the <b>electron</b> energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the <b>electron</b> configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The <b>electron</b> configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn <b>electron</b> configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E
5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} <b>electron</b> affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional <b>electron</b> will be entering an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this <b>electron</b> would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher <b>electron</b> affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, {{this is due to the}} poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in <b>electron</b> affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E
50|$|As runaway <b>electrons</b> gain {{energy from}} an {{electric}} field, they occasionally collide with {{atoms in the}} material, knocking off secondary <b>electrons.</b> If the secondary <b>electrons</b> also have high enough energy to run away, they too accelerate to high energies, produce further secondary <b>electrons,</b> etc. As such, {{the total number of}} energetic <b>electrons</b> grows exponentially in an avalanche.|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional {{electrostatic}} particle simulations {{are performed}} {{in order to}} investigate energy transport associated with the propagation of energetic <b>electrons</b> through a flaring flux tube. Results indicate that as the energetic <b>electrons</b> flow outward, a return current of ambient plasma <b>electrons</b> is drawn inward (to maintain quasi-neutrality) which can be spatially separate from the primary current carried by the energetic <b>electrons.</b> Return current <b>electrons</b> are shown to accumulate {{on either side of}} the acceleration region of the energetic <b>electrons,</b> and depletions of ambient plasma <b>electrons</b> develop in the return current regions. Plasma ions accelerate across the field lines to produce current closure or charge neutralization, achieving energies comparable to those of the energetic <b>electrons...</b>|$|R
5|$|Bacteria {{are further}} divided into lithotrophs that use {{inorganic}} <b>electron</b> donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as <b>electron</b> donors. Chemotrophic organisms use the respective <b>electron</b> donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds {{as a source}} of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal <b>electron</b> acceptor in a redox reaction. This reaction releases energy {{that can be used to}} synthesise ATP and drive metabolism. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the <b>electron</b> acceptor. In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds, such as nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as <b>electron</b> acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Beta decay (and <b>electron</b> capture): these {{processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an <b>electron</b> and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in <b>electron</b> capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The <b>electron</b> or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. <b>Electron</b> capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an <b>electron</b> is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E
5|$|De Broglie's {{prediction}} {{of a wave}} nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving {{under the influence of}} the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how <b>electron</b> waves propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an <b>electron</b> over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an <b>electron</b> near a position, especially a position near where the <b>electron</b> was bound in space, for which the <b>electron</b> wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an <b>electron</b> in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum. Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the quantum}} electrodynamics, {{we present a}} generic {{formalism}} of the polarization for beamed monochromatic photons scattered by <b>electrons</b> in any spectral distribution. The formulae reduce to {{the components of the}} Fano matrix when <b>electrons</b> are at rest. We mainly investigate the polarization in three scenarios, i. e., <b>electrons</b> at rest, isotropic <b>electrons</b> with a power law spectrum and thermal <b>electrons.</b> If the incident beam is polarized, the polarization is reduced significantly by isotropic <b>electrons</b> at large viewing angles, and the degree of polarization due to thermal <b>electrons</b> is about one times less than that of <b>electrons</b> in a power law. If the incident bean is unpolarized, soft γ-rays can lead to about 15...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{momentum}} {{distribution of the}} <b>electrons</b> in an extended periodic Anderson model, where the interaction, $U_{cf}$, between itinerant and localized <b>electrons</b> is taken into account. In the symmetric half-filled model, due to the increase of the interorbital interaction, the $f$ <b>electrons</b> {{become more and more}} delocalized, while the itinerancy of conduction <b>electrons</b> decreases. Above a certain value of $U_{cf}$ the $f$ <b>electrons</b> become again localized together with the conduction <b>electrons.</b> In the less than half-filled case, we observe that $U_{cf}$ causes strong correlations between the $f$ <b>electrons</b> in the mixed valence regime.

5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electrons, unbinilium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an <b>electron</b> from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 6.0eV, {{comparable to that}} of calcium. The <b>electron</b> of the hydrogen-like unbinilium atom—oxidized so it has only one <b>electron,</b> Ubn119+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 2.05 times that of a non-moving <b>electron,</b> a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like radium is 1.30 and the figure for hydrogen-like barium is 1.095. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 200pm, very close to that of strontium (215pm); the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is also correspondingly lowered to 160pm. The trend in <b>electron</b> affinity is also expected to reverse direction similarly at radium and unbinilium.|$|E
5|$|During {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from <b>electron</b> donors to <b>electron</b> acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy, {{which is used}} to form ATP. In eukaryotes, these redox reactions are carried out by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, whereas, in prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space. These linked sets of proteins are called <b>electron</b> transport chains. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of <b>electron</b> donors and acceptors.|$|E
5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the <b>electron.</b> The <b>electron</b> can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an <b>electron</b> in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
25|$|A {{trick is}} to count up valence <b>electrons,</b> then count up the number of <b>electrons</b> needed to {{complete}} the octet rule (or with hydrogen just 2 <b>electrons),</b> then take the difference of these two numbers {{and the answer is}} the number of <b>electrons</b> that make up the bonds. The rest of the <b>electrons</b> just go to fill all the other atoms' octets.|$|R
50|$|Conventional current depends {{not only}} on the {{direction}} the charge carriers move, but also the carriers' charge. The currents outside the device are usually carried by <b>electrons</b> in a metal conductor. The flow of <b>electrons</b> is opposite to conventional current because <b>electrons</b> have a negative charge. Consequently, <b>electrons</b> leave the device via the anode, and <b>electrons</b> enter the device through the cathode.|$|R
50|$|As they decay, primary photo-electrons and Auger <b>electrons</b> {{eventually}} become physically indistinguishable (as in Fermi-Dirac statistics) from secondary <b>electrons.</b> The range of low-energy secondary <b>electrons</b> is sometimes {{larger than the}} range of primary photo-electrons or of Auger <b>electrons.</b> What matters for X-ray lithography is the effective range of <b>electrons</b> that have sufficient energy to make or break chemical bonds in negative or positive resists.|$|R
5|$|<b>Electron</b> {{affinity}} generally increases {{across a}} period. This {{is caused by}} the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an <b>electron</b> because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electron</b> beam {{processing}} is used {{to irradiate}} materials in order to change their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products. <b>Electron</b> beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive <b>electron</b> radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy.|$|E

In an <b>electron</b> microscope, {{a beam of}} focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than {{a beam of light}} as in traditional microscopy.

50|$|When <b>electrons</b> are accelerated, as {{occurs when}} an AC {{electrical}} field is impressed on an antenna, they will radiate electromagnetic waves.

5000|$|Not all atoms attract <b>electrons</b> {{with the}} same force. The amount of [...] "pull" [...] an atom exerts on its <b>electrons</b> is called its electronegativity. Atoms with high electronegativitiessuch as fluorine, oxygen and nitrogenexert a greater pull on <b>electrons</b> than atoms with lower electronegativities. In a bond, this leads to unequal sharing of <b>electrons</b> between the atoms, as <b>electrons</b> will be drawn closer to the atom with the higher electronegativity.|$|R

5|$|Electrons play an {{essential}} role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Since an <b>electron</b> has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that <b>electron</b> is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an <b>electron</b> according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as <b>electron</b> plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special telescopes can detect <b>electron</b> plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, <b>electron</b> microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, {{ionization}} energy, <b>electron</b> affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and <b>electron,</b> which causes the <b>electron</b> to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an <b>electron.</b> Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. <b>Electron</b> affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower <b>electron</b> affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E
