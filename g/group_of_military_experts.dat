50|$|In April 1999, {{immediately}} after NATO began its air attacks against Serbia, Russia resumed talks with Ukraine about the strategic bombers, proposing to purchase eight Tu-160s and three Tu-95MS models manufactured in 1991 (those {{in the best}} technical condition), as well as 575 Kh-55MS missiles. An agreement was reached and a $285 million contract was signed, the value of which was deducted from Ukraine's debt for natural gas.

50|$|Immediately {{after the}} 1989 Velvet Revolution, the Czech {{president}} Václav Havel declared a demobilisation of the Czech defence industry. Nevertheless, after {{the dissolution of}} the Soviet Union in 1991, the Czech company Aero Vodochody continued developing the basic L-39 Albatros design with a view toward greater export. The resulting L-39MS, later designed as L-59 Super Albatros, featured a more powerful turbofan engine, advanced avionics, and has been bought in quantity by Egypt and Tunisia. In 1993 a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Czech <b>military</b> <b>experts</b> launched a project of production of a modern domestic fighter to substitute the obsolete Soviet aircraft. Since the proposed Aero L-X supersonic fighter development proved to be financially demanding (up to 2 billion USD), the less costly L-159 subsonic attack aircraft was approved for procurement instead.|$|R

2500|$|According to Harriet Sherwood, {{writer for}} the Guardian, even if Hamas were violating the law on this matter, it would not legally justify Israel's bombing of areas where {{civilian}}s are known to be. Amnesty International stated that [...] "Indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks (where the likely number of civilian casualties or damage to civilian property outweighs the anticipated military advantage to be gained) are … prohibited." [...] It said that [...] "Israel's relentless air assault on Gaza has seen its forces flagrantly disregard civilian life and property". Human Rights Watch has said {{that in many cases}} [...] "the Israeli military has presented no information to show that it was attacking lawful military objectives or acted to minimize civilian casualties." [...] An investigation by Human Rights Watch found that [...] "in most of the sites we investigated so far (in this conflict) we found no valid military targets".

[...] The High Level <b>Military</b> <b>Group,</b> composed <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>experts</b> from Australia, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Britain, the United States, and Spain, released an assessment on Operation Protective Edge acknowledging Israel made [...] "unprecedented efforts" [...] to avoid civilian casualties exceeding international standards.|$|R

Discussions with Russia concerning their return bogged down. The main bone of contention was the price. While Russian experts, who examined the aircraft at Pryluky in 1993 and 1996, assessed their technical condition as good, {{the price of}} $3 billion demanded by Ukraine was unacceptable. The negotiations led to nowhere and in April 1998, Ukraine decided to commence scrapping the aircraft under the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Agreement. In November, the first Tu-160 was ostentatiously chopped up at Pryluky. In April 1999, immediately after NATO began air attacks against Serbia, Russia resumed talks with Ukraine about the strategic bombers. This time they proposed buying back eight Tu-160s and three Tu-95MS models manufactured in 1991 (those in the best technical condition), as well as 575 Kh-55MS missiles. An agreement was finally reached and a contract valued at $285 million was signed. That figure was to be deducted from Ukraine's debt for natural gas. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Russian <b>military</b> <b>experts</b> went to Ukraine on 20 October 1999 to prepare the aircraft {{for the trip to}} Engels-2 air base.

5000|$|Around 457, the Kidarites {{were again}} in {{conflict}} against the Sasanians under Yazdegerd II. A [...] "Kidarite dynasty", {{south of the}} Oxus, was {{at war with the}} Sassanids in the fifth century. The Sasanian Emperor Peroz I (ruled 459-484) fought Kidara and then his son Kungas, forcing Kungas to leave Bactria. The Kidarites, who had established themselves in parts of Transoxiana during the reign of the Sasanian king Shapur II, and had a long history of conflicts with the Sasanians. The latter stopped paying tributes to Kidarites in the early 460s, thus starting a new war between these two states. During the start of the war, however, Peroz did not have enough manpower to fight them, and therefore asked for financial aid by the Byzantine Empire, who declined his request. Peroz then offered peace to the leader of the Kidarites, Kunkhas, and offered him his sister in marriage. However, Peroz tried to trick Kunkhas, and sent a woman of low status instead. After some time Kunkhas found about Peroz's false promise, and then in turn tried to trick him, by requesting him to send <b>military</b> <b>experts</b> to strengthen his army. However, when a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> 300 <b>military</b> <b>experts</b> arrived to the court of Kunkhas at Balaam (either the same city as Balkh or a city in Sogdia), they were either killed or disfigured and sent back to Iran, with the information that Kunkhas did this due to Peroz's false promise.|$|R

The China Lobby was a set of individuals who supported the strongest possible U. S. support [...] political, economic, and military [...] for the Kuomintang and opposed admission of the PRC to the United Nations. Earlier studies correctly argued that the Lobby caused grave harm to the American political system during the post-war era. This study revises earlier contentions that the Lobby was highly organized. Examination of the papers of twenty-two Lobbyists suggests that they were not a close-knit <b>group</b> <b>of</b> fanatics who took their marching orders from Taipei. Also, this study argues that the China Lobby was not closely tied to the KMT corruption. Part I asserts that the Lobby meets the definition of a lobby only if the term is utilized in the broadest possible manner. Because they had no single common background or common purpose, Lobbyists would tolerate only vague membership rules. Those rules entailed common assumptions about the world situation in the post-war world [...] Communism, China, and the fate of civilization. Rather than opening up the group to new members, the rules placed a barrier between the Lobby and other conservatives. These rules prevented the Lobby from expanding and the Lobby ossified. Part II contends that the scandals and corruption were limited to Kuomintang officials and the KMT's paid foreign agents, and not directly involved with the unpaid members of the Lobby. This section also includes the previously ignored case of retired Admiral Charles Cooke, who organized a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> former American <b>military</b> <b>experts</b> to obtain arms, military equipment, and munitions for Taiwan in the spring of 1950 when the Truman administration had placed a ban on arms sales to Taiwan. Part III contends that the China Lobby lacked the capacity on its own to have great influence on the American political system. It rode the wave of McCarthyism and the Korean War to gain a wider audience. Once the wave dissipated, the Lobbyists were no longer able to conceal their irreconcilable differences. Their manichaean attitudes alienated them from mainstream Republicanism and left them without access to financial support, causing the decline of the China Lobby...|$|R
