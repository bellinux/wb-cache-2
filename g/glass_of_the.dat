5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a pair}} {{of windows}} in the west wall {{decorated}} with tracery (stonework within the window frame forming a pattern). Scenes from the Bible and geometric patterns are shown in the stained glass, and birds (phoenix and peacock) are depicted {{at the top of the}} windows. The glass is dedicated to Rice Robert Hughes, a clergyman who died in 1801. There are three arched windows in the south wall of the nave; the stained <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> easternmost (dedicated to William Bulkeley Hughes) shows biblical scenes. The easternmost window of the three in the north wall of the nave is dedicated to Thomas Bulkeley Hughes (who died in 1836), his wife and children. The chancel has one window in the east wall, which has three lights (sections of window separated by stone mullions).|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Open Studios Cyprus, {{there are a}} number of privately owned galleries and exhibition spaces. Details and dates for the regular events can always be found in the local English newspapers, such as Cyprus Weekly and Cyprus Monthly. Maintained by the Paphos Municipality, is the popular exhibition and conference space, Palia Ilektriki. In the centre of the town, this converted electricity building plays host to both conferences and exhibitions throughout the year. In 2009, 2010 and 2011 Open Studios Cyprus, used this location to launch the event with an Opening Art Exhibition.

25|$|In the 13th century, {{the choir}} {{of the cathedral}} was rebuilt in the Gothic style, wider than the {{original}} and on a different axis. However, the new work was severely damaged in a fire in 1292, and the work was recommenced. By 1322 the arcades and the easternmost bay were complete, with the elaborate tracery and <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east window being in place by about 1350. The upper stages of the walls were finished, probably by the architect John Lewen who died in about 1398. The Gothic arcade has richly moulded arches with dog's tooth decoration, and the twelve capitals are carved with vegetation along with small lively figures representing the labours of the months.|$|E

25|$|The {{club has}} always been noted for its wealthy members, grand banquets and boisterous rituals, such as vandalising ('trashing') of {{restaurants}} and college rooms, complemented by a tradition of on-the-spot payment for damage. Its ostentatious display of wealth attracts controversy, since many ex-members have moved up to high political posts, most notably former British Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. A number of episodes over many decades have provided anecdotal evidence of the Club's behaviour. Infamously on 12 May 1894, after dinner, Bullingdon members smashed almost all the <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lights and 468 windows in Peckwater Quad of Christ Church, along with the blinds and doors of the building, and again on 20 February 1927. As a result, the Club was banned from meeting within 15 miles of Oxford.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{brightness}} of Australian sunlight, it was decided {{at the time of}} construction to glaze the clerestorey with yellow glass. This glazing has darkened over the years, permitting little light to enter. The yellow glazing contrasts with the predominantly blue stained <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower windows. To counteract the darkness, the cathedral installed extensive lighting in the 1970s, designed to give more-or-less equal illumination to all parts of the buildings. The interior is lit with a diffuse yellow glow, which, like the upper windows, is in contrast to the effects of the natural light which penetrates through the white areas of the stained glass. The installed lighting counteracts the pattern of light and shade that would normally exists in a cathedral of the Gothic style by illuminating most brightly those parts of the structure which would normally be subdued.|$|E
25|$|Master {{craftsman}} Elias Concepcion {{has been}} credited with {{the execution of the}} interior finishes. His handling of the ornamental elements ranges from the curvilinear and stylized floral motifs present in the stained <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> double doors, to the rectilinear wood screen—reminiscent of the arts and craft movement– dividing the foyer from the living room. As with the exterior, the interior is a mixture of distinct stylistic elements. The vestibule's repousse sheet metal ornamentation reflects the roccoco treatment of the exterior, at once maintaining an image of opulence and refinement for the visitor while creating a transitional device for the predominantly planar interior surfaces. Many highstyle interiors of the beginning of the 20th century in the Ponce and Yauco region have been attributed to Elias Concepcion due to his sophisticated integration and subtle resolution of an eclectic vocabulary.|$|E

25|$|The gradual {{abandonment}} of naturalism and {{the depiction of}} realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils, to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. Leon Golub's Interrogation III (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) is {{a photograph of a}} crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.|$|E
25|$|On 19 May 1898, Aguinaldo {{decided to}} resume the {{revolution}} {{and returned to the}} Philippines through American aid. Among those who returned with him was Estrella. When the Philippine–American War broke out on 4 February 1899, Estrella {{was one of the first}} generals to see action outside Manila. On 5 February, the Americans positioned themselves in the outskirts of San Roque (now part of Cavite City), which Filipino troops are being commanded by Estrella. Three days later, on 8 February, Second Lieutenant John <b>Glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Battalion of the California Heavy Artillery (California National Guard) was sent with an escort to demand Estrella the surrender and the evacuation of the town. Otherwise, artillery and gunboat bombardment would be done against them. By this time, the gunboats Manila and Callao have been positioned just outside the town to assist the offensive. On 9 February, the town mayor approached Commodore George Dewey to ask for more time to decide the matter. When Dewey refused, the Filipinos raised the white flag of surrender. However, this was only a deception to lure the Americans into attacking the town. When the Americans managed to occupy San Roque, the retreating Filipinos set the town on fire. In order to gain access to the area, the Americans had to flank it from the sea. Meanwhile, skirmishes were undertaken whenever the Americans caught up with the Filipinos. Estrella would continue leading Filipino troops for the rest of the year, even fighting alongside Brigadier General Pío del Pilar in Guadalupe, Makati (then part of Rizal). However, on 8 June 1900, Estrella was caught with Pío del Pilar by the American secret police (which utilized a native contingent headed by Captain Lara) at Guadalupe.|$|E
