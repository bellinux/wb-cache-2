25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of {{ascorbic acid}} {{starts with the}} formation of UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucuronic acid is formed when UDP-glucose undergoes two oxidations catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD+ as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a UMP and glucuronokinase, with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to D-glucuronic acid. The aldehyde group of this is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme <b>glucuronate</b> reductase and the cofactor NADPH, yielding L-gulonic acid. This is followed by lactone formation with the hydrolase gluconolactonase between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. L-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other Haplorrhini primates) and the cofactor FAD+. This reaction produces 2-oxogulonolactone, which spontaneously undergoes enolization to form ascorbic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Acetaminophen (or paracetamol) is an {{analgesic}} {{medication that}} can affect the liver when administered in high doses. [...] Acetaminophen is predominantly conjugated into <b>glucuronate</b> and sulfate moieties by Phase II metabolism.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the fate of the conjugated forms of the three most common natural estrogens in the municipal aqueous environment. Levels of conjugated and free estrogens in (1) female urine; (2) a septic tank collecting domestic wastewater; (3) influents and effluents of six activated sludge sewage treatment plants (STPs) were measured. The analytical method was based on solid-phase extraction by using a Carbograph 4 cartridge and Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry. On average, a group of 73 women selected to represent a typical cross section of the female inhabitants of a Roman condominium, excreted 106, 14 and 32 mug/day of conjugated estriol (E- 3) estradiol (E- 2) and estrone (E- 1), respectively. Apart from some E- 3 in pregnancy urine, free estrogens were never detected in urine samples. Estrogen sulfates represented 21 % of the total conjugated estrogens. This situation changed markedly in the condominium collecting tank. Here, significant amounts of free estrogens were observed and the estrogen sulfate to estrogen <b>glucuronated</b> ratio rose to 55 / 45. A laboratory biodegradation test confirmed that <b>glucuronated</b> estrogens are readily deconjugated in unmodified domestic wastewater, presumably due to the large amounts of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme produced by fecal bacteria (Escherichia coli). Deconjugation continued in sewer transit. At the STP entrance, free estrogens and sulfated estrogens were the dominant species. The sewage treatment completely removed residues of estrogen <b>glucuronates</b> and with good efficiency (84 - 97 %) the other analytes, but not E- 1 (61 %) and estrone- 3 -sulfate (E- 1 - 3 S) (64 %). Considering that (1) E- 1 has half the estrogenic potency of E- 2, (2) the amount of the former species discharged from STPs into the receiving water was more than ten times larger than the latter one and (3) a certain fraction of E- 1 - 3 S could be converted to E- 1 in the aquatic environment, E- 1 appears to be the most important natural endocrine disrupter.

50|$|Glycosides {{resulting}} from glucuronidation are named β-D-glucuronides, its salts and esters are named <b>glucuronates.</b> The human body uses glucuronidation to make alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, mercaptans, {{primary and secondary}} aliphatic amines, and carbamates more water-soluble, and, in this way, allows for their subsequent elimination from the body through urine or faeces (via bile from the liver) at a significantly increased rate.

Three main groups, "no or low urolithin excreters," "predominantly UA derivatives excreters" and "predominantly UB derivatives excreters," were observed. These categories were also unambiguously observed from 9 individuals following the total excretion of ETs' main metabolites over a 4 -day period after ingesting one shot of blackberry juice. Although relatively high inter- and intra-individual variabilities were observed, individuals preserved their status during different intervention periods with different amounts of ETs ingested. Accurate UPLC-DAD/ESI-Q-TOF/MS 2 allowed the tentative assignment of an identity to 15 other ET metabolites in urine, but profiling did not allow the discrimination of any other compounds aside from UA or UB derivatives.

40|$|Background: Sanguisorba minor, as well {{as several}} other edible herbs and vegetables, has been used {{extensively}} in traditional medicine. The observed beneficial effects can be attributed at least in part to the direct modulation of several enzymatic activities by its polyphenolic constituents. Methods: The ethanol extract of Sanguisorba minor was characterized by reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and most relevant analytes were identified by multiple stage mass spectrometry. The whole extract and the most relevant isolated constituents were tested for their ability to modulate the activity of human plasmin both toward a synthetic substrate and in human breast cancer cell culture models. Kinetic and equilibrium parameters were obtained by a concerted spectrophotometric and biosensor-based approach. Results: Quercetin- 3 -glucuronide was recognized as the compound mainly responsible for the in vitro plasmin inhibition by S. minor extract, with an inhibition constant in the high nanomolar range; in detail, our approach based on bioinformatic, enzymatic and binding analyses classified the inhibition as competitive. Most interestingly, cell-based assays showed that this flavonoid was effective in suppressing plasmin-induced loss of cancer cell adhesion. General significance: Our results show that the extract from Sanguisorba minor limits plasmin-mediated tumor cell motility in vitro, mostly due to quercetin- 3 -glucuronide.

Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is <b>glucuronated</b> by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine.

Urinary concentrations of the final metabolic products of the glucocorticoid biosynthetic pathways (11 b-hydroxy-androsterone and 11 b-hydroxy-etiocholanolone, the formerly used as an endogenous reference compound for the gas chromatography–combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry confirmation analysis) were also monitored. Two healthy Caucasian volunteers exhibiting physiologically high testosterone/epitestosterone ratios and elevated concentrations of the main target steroids were selected for the study. Miconazole was administered orally (500 mg/day) for 1 week. Multiple urine samples were collected for 1 week before and during the treatment, and analyzed according to a validated analytical procedure based on gas chromatography–electron ionization-mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring mode. Our results indicated that oral administration of miconazole decreased the urinary concentrations of androsterone, and to a lesser extent, of etiocholanolone (both detected as the sum of free and <b>glucuronated</b> steroids), and consequently the androsterone/testosterone and androsterone/etiocholanolone ratios.

However, at any site of inflammation, so also in wound areas, heparan sulfates are degraded, mainly by heparanases giving free access to protease to degrade the ECM and a subsequent loss of GFs and cytokines that disrupts the normal tissue homeostasis. Heparan sulfate analogues obtain many of the characteristics of heparan sulfates including the ability to sequester GFs and bind and protect matrix proteins. However, heparan sulfate analogues are resistant to enzymatic degradation. This way they strengthen the healing potential of the wound bed by repositioning GFs and cytokines back into the ECM.|$|R
