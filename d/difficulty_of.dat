The whigs were disaffected about it, the radicals doubted it, the tories thought that property as a principle was ruined by it, the Irishmen, when the humour seized them, bade him send the bill to line trunks. Mr. Gladstone, as one observer truly says, “faced difficulties such as no other bill of this country has ever encountered, <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> politics and <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> law, <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> principle and <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> detail, <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> party and <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> personnel, <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> race and <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> class, and he has never once failed, or even seemed to fail, in his clear command of the question, in his dignity and authority of demeanour, in his impartiality in accepting amending suggestions, in his firmness in resisting destructive suggestions, in his clear perception of his aim, and his strong grasp of the fitting means. And yet it is hardly possible to appreciate adequately the embarrassments of the situation.” ...|$|R

5|$|The team {{aimed to}} {{replicate}} the playing experience and <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the extant Syndicate. Starbreeze considered the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the first game {{to be part of}} the franchise's legacy and was worth preserving; they hoped the new game would be challenging enough for players without being frustrating. They introduced a rarely scripted artificial intelligence (AI) into the game. The AI reacts to players' actions and was programmed to relocate itself after being attacked. The new game has less gore than the older one; players still can kill innocent civilians but the team minimized these scenarios, which they thought were part of the game's environment rather than gameplay elements.|$|E

5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E
