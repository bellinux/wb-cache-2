40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{an apparatus}} and {{a process for}} separation and resolution of particles suspended in, or molecules dissolved in, a sample mixture or solution using electrical field flow fractionation (EFFF). Fractionation of individual components in the mixture/solution is obtained by the interaction of particles/molecules with an electric field applied perpendicular to the flow direction, and externally to the fractionation channel. The plate electrodes are electrically isolated from the sample and carrier within a thin, non-permeable, insulating coating on the inside surfaces electrodes. This coating forms a barrier between the solution phase and the electric circuit used to generate the working electric field. The flow channel is formed by sandwiching a shaped <b>insulating</b> <b>gasket</b> between the two parallel plate electrodes. The side walls of the channel are defined then by the inside walls of the shaped, <b>insulating</b> <b>gasket...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the design, {{construction}} and experimental evaluation of a thermoacoustic electricity generator prototype with a push-pull linear alternator. The push-pull coupling offers a solution to run the looped-tube thermoacoustic engine at high acoustic impedance using one alternator. The novel configuration of the engine consists of two identical half-wavelength stages with an alternator connected between them. A simulation was carried out using the DeltaEC programme. The modelling started by investigating the required acoustic field for the alternator. The engine modelling has been done as half of the engine which is one-stage, because the DeltaEC shooting method showed that it was unable to run two identical stages. The engine is 16. 02 m long and run at 55. 1 Hz. The simulation showed {{that it is possible}} to produce more than 133 W of electricity at a thermal-to-electric efficiency of 23 % while using helium pressurized at 28 bar. In practice, the engine failed to self-start. After exciting it to run by an external pulse, an electric power of 48. 6 W was generated with a thermal-to-electric efficiency of 2. 7 %. The high heat leak detected was reduced by installing an <b>insulating</b> <b>gasket</b> between the ambient heat exchanger and regenerator holder, which encouraged the electricity generation to increase. The engine became self-starting when the regenerator thickness was reduced from 73 mm to 71. 8 mm. The maximum generated electric power was 73. 3 W at 3. 33 % thermal-to-electric efficiency at a heating power of 2200 W, and a maximum efficiency of 3. 6 % was achieved at 71. 9 W electric power at a heating power of 2000 W. The success of the two-stage engine with a push-pull linear alternator encouraged modelling and design of a four-stage engine with two push-pull linear alternators able to generate up to 269 W of electricity, theoretically...|$|E
5000|$|The fuel {{stored in}} the chamber (bowl) {{can be a problem}} in hot climates. If the engine is shut off while hot, the {{temperature}} of the fuel will increase, sometimes boiling ("percolation"). This can result in flooding and difficult or impossible restarts while the engine is still warm, a phenomenon known as [...] "heat soak". Heat deflectors and <b>insulating</b> <b>gaskets</b> attempt to minimize this effect. The Carter Thermo-Quad carburetor has float chambers manufactured of insulating plastic (phenolic), said to keep the fuel 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) cooler.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Specific design {{criteria}} are proposed to mitigate radiated emissions from a resonant enclosure excited by {{a heat sink}} acting as a microstrip patch antenna source. In this par-ticular application, the EMI mechanism {{is assumed to be}} due to coupling from the dominant TM 010 mode to one or more resonant modes associated with the enclosure dimensions. The enclosure is then presumed to radiate, at the enclosure resonance frequencies, through one or more apertures, slots, or seams. The EMI-reduction strategy consists of shifting the resonant frequency of the dominant-patch antenna mode by dielectrically loading the patch antenna with thermal-gasket material having a specified electric permittivity. Specific formulas and graphs will be presented showing how to select the electric permittivity of the thermal-gasket material in order to obtain a given frequency shift. A comparison of experimental measurements with the predictions of the {{design criteria}} indicates that frequency shifts of up to approximately three times the bandwidth of the patch resonance can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. In at least two different commercial products that we are aware of, changing the electrically <b>insulating</b> heat sink <b>gasket</b> materials has solved specific radiated EMI problems.
