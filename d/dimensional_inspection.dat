40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the fast}} {{advancement}} of manufacturing technologies for micro- and nanostructured components [1] {{the need for}} sophisticated inspection methods increases. The paper on hand discusses the prerequisites for automatic execution of inspection plans. Main goal is to enable auto-mated dimensional measurements of micro- and nanostruc-tured components instead of executing functional tests. Besides reducing manufacturing cost this approach enables the setup of a closed quality loop which allows {{a higher level of}} efficiency. It provides a constant feedback to the manufacturing processes and to the design process. Based on the latest state-of-the-art the setup and operating principle of a closed quality loop for <b>dimensional</b> <b>inspections</b> is de-scribed. Vital part of the closed quality loop is a multisensor system consisting of adaptive, intelligent sensors with cas-caded measuring ranges. The paper provides a novel and consistent overall view of <b>dimensional</b> <b>inspections</b> of micro-and nanostructured components and how they will be exe-cuted in the future.

40|$|Abstract. The CMM (coordinate {{measuring}} machines) {{are able}} to perform <b>dimensional</b> <b>inspections</b> in workpieces with complex geometries, {{in a short time}} compared to conventional methods, however, errors on volume of CMM harm the performance of measurement. Faced with this, the purpose this investigation is to identify regions in the machine with large and small values of volumetric errors. The mapping of volumetric error is performed by optimization of objective function with SQP method. The objective function is defined by modeling errors of the CMM using a method of the homogeneous transformation, and, by calibration curves of individual errors. The optimization allowed to obtain the smallest value of volumetric error, 1. 1796 Âµm, located near the linear encoder of the y axis. The mapping the volumetric error by optimization allows to know regions with minor harm the performance of measurement, therefore, it's possible to select regions of measurement to obtain reliable results...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD / CAM) {{systems are}} widely used in industries, such as mould-making and {{mechanical}} components manufacturing on Computer Numerical Con-trolled (CNC) machine. VVorkpiece localization, with novel applications such as workpiece setup, refixturing and <b>dimensional</b> <b>inspections,</b> {{is a problem of}} permanet importance in manufacturing of high precision parts. Besides, a general class of industrial motion control systems has the struc-ture of dynamical systems, preceded by some non-linearities in the actuator, such as deadzone, backlash, saturation, etc. The problems are particularly exacerbated when the required accuracy is high, as in micropositioning de-vices. In this thesis, we investigate two kinds of intelligent motion compensa-tion. In {{the first part of this}} work, deadzone and backlash compensators are designed for industrial positioning systems using fuzzy logic (FL) controllers. The classification property of FL systems makes them a natural candidate for the rejection of errors induced by the deadzone and backlash. Tuning algorithms are applied to estimate the deadzone and backlash parameters on-line. The adaptive FL deadzone and backlash compensators are imple-mented on the actual industrial CNC machines to show its efficiency. The second part of this thesis focuses on workpiece localization. A charged coupling device (CCD) camera is used to capture the images of the workpiece. Using edge detection algorithm, we obtain some information about it. Afterwards, we solve the localization problem using several geo-metric algorithms which have been developed over the last few years. And we will also compare these algorithms in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy...|$|R

The high resonant frequencies appear to shift more than low resonant frequencies with linear and radial dimensional deviations of cylindrical parts. However, the dimensional deviations of a flat plate part only influence certain numbers of resonant frequencies. The amount of the frequency changes of all tested parts is proportional to the dimensional deviations.

40|$|<b>Dimensional</b> quality <b>inspections</b> of high {{precision}} parts are often performed by Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) equipped with touch-trigger probes. Features of these parts are then {{measured with a}} limited set of points, due to time constraints. This limited sampling has an important influence on the measurement uncertainty because the form deviation of the feature can not be completely assessed. It will not only affect the measurement uncertainty of the form deviation, but also the measurement uncertainties of other feature parameters like size, position and orientation. The quantification of this influence is difficult since the true form deviation is unknown. This paper describes a method, based on Monte Carlo simulations, that allows to determine these measurement uncertainties based on {{an estimate of the}} form deviation using a limited set of points. The method is illustrated for circles with theoretical shapes of form deviations, as well as measured shapes. status: publishe...|$|R

A real-time hierarchical control system is presented in which a vision system extracts positions of features on a part to be inspected, and then guides a touch probe to efficiently measure these features. The probe is tracked by the vision system as it scans surfaces so that it's motion can be visually servoed. Minimalist sensorderived representations, involving only task-specific information, are used in this process. Although the camera itself remains uncalibrated, a real-time calibration of very limited scope is performed each processing cycle to transform the task-specific image information into 3 -D information used as feedback to guide the probe. 1.

40|$|A nozzle {{consisting}} of a circular inlet orice and a short chamber with an exit lip can produce a naturally oscillating jet ow if the expansion ratio from inlet to chamber (D/d 1) is larger than ve. As an industrial natural-gas burner, the device offers advantages over simple nozzles of equivalent capacity. However, its usefulness as a pulverised solid-fuel burner is constrained because it requires a high supply pressure. This {{is due to the}} high energy-loss coefcient of the inlet expansion ratio, D/d 1. If an equilateral-triangular inlet replaces the circular inlet, oscillating ow occurs at equivalent expansion ratios as low as D/d 1 Â¼ 2, and the supply pressure is much lower. An engineering model of the loss coefcient is obtained from measurements of supply pressure over a wide range of nozzle geometries. To begin, we split the overall loss coefcient K into three components, one for each of the inlet orice, chamber and exit lip. A formula representing each component of K is then determined from <b>dimensional</b> analysis, <b>inspection</b> of the data, and least-squares curve tting. Combining these component formulae gives K as a function of four geometric parameters and seven numerical coefcients.

The development of machine vision devices at decreased costs, {{as well as their}} miniaturization and integration in industrial processes, have accelerated the use of 3 D imaging systems in industry. In this paper we describe how to improve the performance of a 3 D imaging system for inline <b>dimensional</b> quality <b>inspection</b> of long, flat-rolled metal products manufactured in rolling mills we designed and developed in previous works. Two dimensional characteristics of rolled products are measured by the system: width and flatness.

Taking the system calibration into account the range images are transformed into a calibrated point cloud representing the 3 D surface reconstruction of the product. Two approaches to improve the line detection and extraction method used in the original system are discussed, one intended for high-speed processing with lower accuracy, and the other providing high accuracy while incurring higher computational time expenses.
