5|$|Mallards {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{varieties}} of ducks hunted as a sport. The ideal location for hunting mallards is considered to be where the water level is somewhat shallow. Hunting mallards might cause the population to decline in some places, at some times, and with some populations. In certain countries, the mallard may be legally shot but <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> national acts and policies. For example, in the United Kingdom, the mallard <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> <b>under</b> the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which restricts certain hunting methods or taking or killing mallards.|$|E
