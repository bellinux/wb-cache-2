40|$|An {{extensive}} {{program to}} improve {{the operation of the}} Ames 16 Inch Shock Tunnel was carried out. This included reduction of driver slosh wave amplitudes and detonation risk by the use of premixed He/O 2 gas, longer wait times between the last <b>gas</b> <b>load</b> and driver <b>gas</b> ignition, an improved <b>gas</b> <b>loading</b> sequence, the use of four instead of one ignition wire, and the use of lower ignition wire voltages. Successful operation of the tunnel at pressures of 2000 - 6000 psi and enthalpies up to 12, 000 J/gm was achieved. A new diaphragm breaking technique, self break on the driver combustion pressure rise, was tested and found to produce clean breaks over the full pressure range of the tunnel. Improvements were made to the driver <b>gas</b> <b>loading</b> manifold and a preliminary design was made of a gas mixing system which mixes all three gases on the fly just before injection into the driver.

40|$|Equilibrium {{concentrations}} of species and <b>gas</b> <b>loading</b> in aqueous solutions of alkanolamine loaded with CO 2 are being compared with predicted profiles {{obtained from the}} Deshmukh-Mather Model. A new technique is being proposed based on titration using a base, NaOH, to determine the {{concentrations of}} the different species at equilibrium. The technique is reliable and easy to perform to give reproducible results. Experimental and predicted concentrations of species are in good agreement over a range of <b>gas</b> <b>loading</b> between 0. 4 and 1. 0 for aqueous AMP solutions. For DEA, the predicted and measured values complement each other at high loading typically above 0. 6. At low loading, {{there is a significant}} difference between the sets of values for carbamate and bicarbonate. These differences are likely due to the value of the equilibrium constant for the carbamate formation, which is taken as an adjustable parameter in the model, to give the best fit to the experimental data of either CO 2 partial pressure or <b>gas</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} {{forecasting}} accuracy, {{a model for}} forecasting daily <b>gas</b> <b>load</b> with OIHF-Elman network involving factors such as weather, temperature and data type is proposed. Compared with the conventional Elman network, OIHF-Elman network considers not only the hidden level feedback but also the output level feedbacks. Therefore more information from limited sampling spots is collected and utilized. The simulation results show that OIHF-Elman network performs better than Elman network in terms of accuracy given limited sampling points.

30|$|In this paper, {{the power}} system is {{designed}} to operate under the base case with unit commitment and generation dispatch decisions corresponding to forecasted values of electrical loads and wind generations in the day-ahead market, while generation dispatches can be adaptively and securely adjusted when possible realizations of uncertainties happen in real time. Only wind and electrical load uncertainties in power systems are considered in this paper. The reasons are twofold: 1) Electrical load uncertainty {{is a very important}} factor that will impact day-ahead power system operation schedules [21, 22, 24]. Thus, following the convention of traditional robust optimization based power system operation models, this paper considers electrical load uncertainty. 2) Natural gas system is regarded as highly reliable with sufficient line-pack capacities for handling <b>gas</b> <b>load</b> uncertainties [13], and in turn natural <b>gas</b> <b>load</b> uncertainty is usually not included. In addition, due to the nonlinearity of natural gas Weymouth flow equation, <b>gas</b> <b>load</b> uncertainty is very hard to be incorporated into the second-stage max–min robust framework. This mathematical challenge will be investigated in authors’ future work.|$|R
30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the average {{production}} of the electric <b>gas</b> <b>loads</b> is reduced for many dispatch periods for both cases. The sharpest decline takes place during the evening peak hours and is even more evident for Case II.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{diffusion}} freezeout {{rates in}} a <b>gas</b> <b>loaded</b> heat pipe are presented and compared with predictions of an analysis and computer program published earlier. The experimental approach was to pivot a heat pipe on knife edges and use an analytical mass balance {{to measure the}} rate of mass migration within the pipe. Diffusion freezeout rates in a water heat pipe were measured {{as a function of}} the condenser sink temperature and the condenser-to-sink thermal conductance. Measured rates varied between 19 and 270 mg/hr and yielded 64 to 99 percent agreement with predicted values.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{functional}} gut disorders manifest poor {{tolerance to}} intestinal <b>gas</b> <b>loads</b> but {{the mechanism of}} this dysfunction is unknown. Aim: Our aims were firstly, to explore {{the relative importance of}} the amount of intestinal gas versus its distribution on symptom production, and secondly, to correlate gut motility and perception of <b>gas</b> <b>loads.</b> Subjects: Fourteen healthy subjects with no gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods: In each subject a gas mixture was infused (12 ml/min) either into the jejunum or rectum for one hour during blocked rectal gas outflow, and subsequently gas clearance was measured over one hour of free rectal evacuation. We measured abdominal perception, distension, and gut tone by duodenal and rectal barostats. Results: Similar magnitude of gas retention (720 ml) produced significantly more abdominal symptoms with jejunal compared with rectal infusion (perception score 4. 4 (0. 4) v 1. 5 (0. 5), respectively; p, 0. 01) whereas abdominal distension was similar (15 (2) mm and 14 (1) mm girth increment, respectively). Jejunal <b>gas</b> <b>loads</b> were associated with proximal contraction (by 57 (5) %) and colonic loads with distal relaxation (by 99 (20) %).

30|$|Likewise, when <b>gas</b> <b>loads</b> rise (e.g., in the 7 th hour) {{the system}} uses gas {{provided}} by P 2 G facilities, though {{the price of}} P 2 G-generated gas is 0.34 $/m 3, higher than the price of conventional gas sources. This is because gas losses incurred by long-distance gas transmission mean P 2 G facilities are still more competitive in the market. By contrast, when <b>gas</b> <b>loads</b> are low and the nearby supply from conventional gas sources is sufficient, {{the price of gas}} provided by P 2 G facilities should be lower than marginal price 0.30 $/m 3, so that the natural gas company purchases P 2 G gas and the electric power company acquires some revenue.
