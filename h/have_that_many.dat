5|$|After {{finishing}} the 2010 season strong, the Dodgers named Kershaw as the Opening Day Starter for the 2011 season. On May 29, he pitched the second complete-game shutout of his career, striking out 10 while winning a two-hitter against the Florida Marlins, 8–0; {{he also had}} two singles and an RBI, scoring twice in the game. He produced his third career shutout on June 20, a two-hit, 11-strikeout effort against the Detroit Tigers. Kershaw became the first Dodgers starter to strike out the side in the 9th inning since Sandy Koufax's perfect game. In his next start, on June 26, Kershaw pitched another complete game (against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim). He became the first Dodger starter to have back-to-back complete game victories since Jeff Weaver in the 2005 season and the first Dodger to have double-digit strikeouts in consecutive starts since Chan-Ho Park in the 2000 season. He was awarded the National League Player of the Week award for the week of June 20–26 {{as a result of}} those two starts. Midway through June, Kershaw had amassed 32 career victories, a 3.15 ERA and 593 career strikeouts in 568.2 innings. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Kershaw was the first 23-year-old pitcher to <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> victories, an ERA that low and an average of more than one strikeout per inning since ERA became an official statistic in 1910.|$|E
5|$|Following the All-Star game, Wade {{recorded}} 50 {{points on}} 56.6% shooting and added 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a blow-out loss against the Orlando Magic. Wade became the fourth player in NBA history to score at least 50 points while his team lost {{by at least}} 20 in a game. The following game, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and 7 rebounds in a 103–91 win against the Detroit Pistons. Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring at least 50 points since Wilt Chamberlain did so in 1968. Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record with 24 points in the fourth quarter, as he led the Heat back from a 15-point deficit in the final nine minutes of the quarter to secure a 120–115 win over the New York Knicks. For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks. Wade followed the performance with a second consecutive 40-point game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Playing against his Eastern Conference rival and good friend, LeBron James, Wade registered 41 points on 53% shooting, 9 assists, 7 steals, 7 rebounds and one block as the Heat lost 107–100. The following game, in former teammate Shaquille O'Neal's return to Miami since being traded, Wade tied a career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, a steal and a block, as the Heat defeated the Phoenix Suns 135–129. Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with at least 30 points and 15 assists. Less than a week later, Wade tied his franchise record with his 78th consecutive game of scoring in double figures in a double overtime thriller against the Chicago Bulls, in which he scored the game-winning three-point basket to secure a 130–127 win. Wade finished with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wade joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only other player in NBA history to score that many points and <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> assists in a game, while having as high of a field goal percentage. Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning and became the Heat's all-time leading scorer in a triple overtime classic against the Utah Jazz. Wade finished with 50 points, 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals, and 2 blocks in a 140–129 win.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the F-82 pilots would exceed all expectations in aerial combat. On 28 June, orders came down for all F-82s {{to be used}} in heavy ground support against any North Korean activity found between the front lines and the 38th Parallel. Every F-82 which could be made ready for flight was pressed into combat service. Although Fifth Air Force needed every available aircraft to slow down the North Korean invasion force, it was hard to justify the release of all F-82s from their defensive responsibilities for the many key bases in Japan. It was decided to release all F-82s for combat except for a flight which was deployed from the 4th F(AW)S in Okinawa to Japan and a full squadron of F-80s for air defense. On 30 June, FEAF requested HQ USAF for an additional 21 F-82 aircraft, which was denied. In addition, the projected level of support which could be provided at the level of combat usage FEAF was experiencing was no more than 60 days due to a shortage of parts. The fact was that, when F-82 production ended in April 1948, no provision had been made for an adequate supply of spare parts, as the aircraft was not expected to remain in operational service once jet-powered aircraft were available. Further, the Air Force simply did not <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> F-82s in the first place (182 total operational aircraft), {{and did not want to}} weaken the F-82 units committed to the Pacific Northwest or Atlantic coast, or to draw from the fourteen F-82Hs in Alaska.|$|E

500|$|Ross began 2008 {{platooning}} with Amézaga {{again in}} center field, though Amézaga was eventually replaced by Jacque Jones as Ross's centerfield partner. Ross played against left-handed pitchers as Amézaga and Jones faced right-handers. Ross struggled in April, batting [...]159 with no {{home runs and}} two RBI. After receiving a text message from his father {{at the beginning of}} May saying he would improve, Ross declared that he was restarting his season and had 10 home runs and 18 RBI in the month. During the month, Ross had a stretch where nine out of 10 hits were home runs, becoming the first player to have a streak of that sort since Mark McGwire in 2001. On May 14, he hit a game-tying three-run ninth inning home run against Francisco Cordero in a 10-inning, 7–6 loss to the Reds. Then, on June 7 he hit a game-winning three-run home run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning against Cordero to give the Marlins an 8–7 victory over the Reds. Jones was designated for assignment on June 11, putting Ross in sole control of centerfield. In a four-game series with the Colorado Rockies from July 3 through 6, Ross had 15 RBI, becoming the first player to <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> in a four-game series since Carlton Fisk in 1977.

Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to {{at different points in}} our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> options with their voice. He could do {{a lot of different things}} with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that I got to be in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reduction}} in the other direction, from triangle detection to median graph testing, is more involved and depends on the previous median graph recognition algorithm of , which tests several necessary conditions for median graphs in near-linear time. [...] The key new step involves using a breadth first search to partition the graph's vertices into levels according to their distances from some arbitrarily chosen root vertex, forming a graph from each level in which two vertices are adjacent if they share a common neighbor in the previous level, and searching for triangles in these graphs. [...] The median of any such triangle must be a common neighbor of the three triangle vertices; if this common neighbor does not exist, the graph is not a median graph. [...] If all triangles found in this way have medians, and the previous algorithm finds that the graph satisfies all the other conditions for being a median graph, then it must actually be a median graph. [...] This algorithm requires, not just the ability to test whether a triangle exists, but {{a list of all}} triangles in the level graph. [...] In arbitrary graphs, listing all triangles sometimes requires Ω(m3/2) time, as some graphs <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> triangles, however Hagauer et al. show that the number of triangles arising in the level graphs of their reduction is near-linear, allowing the Alon et al. fast matrix multiplication based technique for finding triangles to be used.|$|E

2500|$|As in World War I {{and the war}} of 1870-1871, the Germans {{argued that}} those {{engaging}} in resistance were [...] "bandits" [...] and [...] "terrorists", maintaining that all Francs-tireurs were engaging in an illegal form of warfare, and, as such, had no legal rights. On 5 August 1942, three Romanians belonging to the FTP-MOI tossed some grenades into a group of Luftwaffe men watching a football game at the Jean-Bouin Stadium in Paris, killing eight and wounding 13, though the Germans claimed three killed and 42 wounded. The Germans wanted to minimize the number of dead suffered, but exaggerated the number of wounded so they could {{increase the number of}} hostages to execute as Field Marshal Hugo Sperrle demanded the three hostages be shot for every dead German and two hostages for every wounded German, thus making for a total of 93 if one accepted the false report of the German losses at the stadium. As it was, the Germans did not <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> hostages in custody and settled for executing 88 people on 11 August 1942. The majority of those shot that day were communists or relatives of communists, with the father and father-in-law of Pierre Georges and the brother of the communist leader Maurice Thorez among the victims. A number of those shot were Belgian, Dutch, and Hungarian immigrants to France, but all shot had gone before the firing squads singing La Marseillaise and/or shouting Vive la France!, which was a testament to how even the communists by 1942 saw themselves as fighting for France just as much as for world revolution. Torture of captured résistants was routine. The only way to avoid torture was to be [...] "turned", with the Germans having a particular interest in [...] "turning" [...] radio operators who could compromise an entire Resistance network. Captured résistants were held in filthy, overcrowded prisons full of lice and fleas and fed substandard food or were held in solitary confinement. Methods of torture included beatings, shackling, being suspended from the ceiling, being burned with a blowtorch, allowing dogs to attack the prisoner, being lashed with ox-hide whips, being hit with a hammer, or having heads placed in a vice. A particular favorite was to threaten family members of captured résistants with arrest and the baignoire, where the victim was forced into a bathtub full of freezing water and held nearly to the point of drowning before pulled out at the last moment, only for the process to be repeated. A common threat to a captured résistant was to have the wife, girlfriend, daughter, or sister of the résistant sent to the Wehrmacht field brothels. Only those with the strongest wills could hold out in the face of torture and the vast majority subjected to torture talked. [...] At least 40,000 French died in such prisons.|$|E
