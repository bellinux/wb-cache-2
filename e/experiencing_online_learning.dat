Our methodology focused on interviewing and discussing aspects of planning, delivering and <b>experiencing</b> <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> with managers, educational developers, teachers and students, in order to investigate some of the organisational aims and understandings, and contrast and compare them to the actual lived experience of learners and teachers. The research team wanted to test out the “anywhere, anytime… ” promises that accompany online learning; the promotion of “learning in a time and place that suits you… ” and also the organisational motivations behind providing online learning options. The target organisations provided a wide geographical VET program spread. However, their systems did not allow for separate identification and tracking of “online ” students, so it was more difficult to find learner and teacher participants than originally anticipated. Decisions by teachers to engage in online delivery appeared to be related to their motivation, preference and previous experience. The practice we identified and tracked predominantly included online within “mixed-mode”, often classroom-based activity. Managers ’ perspectives identified a number of online strategy and implementation issues including; infrastructure difficulties inherent to effective implementation; problems with accessing and maintaining skilled staff; and the lack of co-ordination in the development of policy and platforms between state and national authorities...|$|E

40|$|Learning {{scientists}} and the CSCL community have argued that knowledge construction {{is a process of}} collective thinking; a process that is simultaneously personal and social that requires group cognition. However, while CSCL researchers have investigated situated knowledge in the process of collective thinking, little work has been done to fully understand how different identification categories play a role in sense-making and knowledge construction. This research, therefore, explores in detail how individuals operationalize identification categories when they engage in group discussions in <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> environments. Results demonstrate that individuals do not <b>experience</b> <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> through only one aspect of their identity.

In a 3 -day experiment, older adults (cognitively normal or impaired) and young adults (YAs) {{were randomly assigned to}} practice or no-practice conditions. Changes in the dependent measures of movement time and timing error were analysed within and between conditions across days.

While the term “distance education ” was coined from {{the earliest days of}} correspondence offerings, it is the evolution in technologies that seems to be changing the nature of DE significantly (Demiray & Isman, 1999).

In the 1900 ’s, distance education attempted to mimic the traditional classroom lecture via the transmission of live or “canned ” broadcasts, regardless of the technologies used: satellite, television, film, or radio. These kinds of media predisposed DE to closely adhere to the lecture (sit and absorb) model, where content was disseminated in about the same time constraints as a traditional class: taught at scheduled times throughout the week – almost anywhere but not always anytime.

40|$|The {{growth in}} using ICT to plan more {{effective}} learning {{in higher education}} necessitates a critical appropriation {{of the impact of}} ‘transactional immediacy’ on students’ <b>experiences</b> of <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> and teaching. As institutions attempt to counter the effect of ‘transactional distance’ by exploring opportunities offered by asynchronous and synchronous <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> environments, the ‘immediacy’ of online education is often valorised. ‘Transactional immediacy’ in <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> can result in experiences of disorientation and dissonance. These experiences, though, are not necessarily negative. This paper shares findings from a study of students’ online journals in the Professional Certificate in Management, offered by the OU Business School. The study found ample evidence of a variety of dislocations which students experience, but also a variety of locating strategies employed by students to deal with the multifaceted disequilibrium some <b>experience</b> in <b>learning</b> <b>online.</b> This dislocation can be technological, epistemological and ontological. In their learning journals, students reflect on such experiences, but also document a variety of strategies to self-author. This paper aims to provide a theoretical foundation for the notion of (dis) location in online learning; presents qualitative research findings regarding the (dis) locating experiences of students, and shares ideas for the design of <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> within a hermeneutical framework of (dis) location.

40|$|This non-experimental {{quantitative}} {{descriptive study}} was designed to determine which types of learner-learner and learner-instructor interaction are most predictive of student sense of community in online graduate courses at a regional comprehensive university. Surveys were used to measure sense of community and to collect perceptions of frequency and importance of nine learner-learner interactions and seven learner instructor interactions from participating students (N = 381) within online courses in which they were enrolled. Student demographic information included age, gender, <b>experience</b> with <b>online</b> <b>learning,</b> number of face-to-face class meetings, and employment status. Results indicated that learner–learner interactions that were most predictive of sense of community were introductions, collaborative group projects, contributingpersonal <b>experiences,</b> entire class <b>online</b> discussions, and exchanging resources. Learner-instructor interactions that were most predictive of sense of community were instructor modeling, support and encouragement, facilitating discussions, multiple modes of communication, and required participation. <b>Experience</b> with <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> was contributive to sense of community. Additional analyses identified which interaction types offer the highest yield to the instructor who seeks to efficiently facilitate sense of community. Results were presented using a matrix that placed interaction types into low frequency/low importance, low frequency/high importance, high frequency/low importance, or high frequency/high importance quadrants. The interaction items offering the highest yield were exchanging resources and instructor modeling.

40|$|Background The {{impact of}} social media and <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> in health professions {{education}} has previously shown generally positive results in medical, nursing and pharmacy students. To date {{there has not}} been any extensive research into social media and <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> use by prehospital health care professionals such as paramedics. Aim & Methods We sought to identify the extent to which Irish pre-hospital practitioners make use of <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> and social media for continuous professional competency (CPC), and the means by which they do so. A cross-sectional online survey of practitioners was conducted to obtain both quantitative and qualitative data. The release of the survey was in a controlled manner to PHECC registrants via various channels. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. Results A total of 248 respondents completed the survey in full by closing date of 31 March 2015, representing 5. 4 % of all registrants (n= 4, 555). 77 % of respondents were male, and the majority were registered as Emergency Medical Technicians (49 %), followed by Advanced Paramedics (26 %). Over 78 % of respondents used a mobile device {{in the course of their}} clinical duties; the majority used an iOS device. Social media and <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> were considered learning tools by over 75 % of respondents, and over 74 % agreed they should be further incorporated into prehospital education. The most popular platforms for CPC activities were YouTube and Facebook. The majority of respondents (88 %) viewed self-directed activities to constitute continuous professional development activity, but 64 % felt that an activity that resulted in the awarding of a certificate was better value. Over 90 % of respondents had previous <b>experience</b> with <b>online</b> <b>learning,</b> but only 42 % indicated they had previously purchased or paid for <b>online</b> <b>learning.</b> Conclusion Prehospital practitioners in Ireland in the population studied consider <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> and social media acceptable for CPC purposes. The main social media outlets used by PHECC registrants are YouTube and Facebook. Practitioners consider <b>online</b> <b>learning</b> that awards a certificate to be better value than self-directed activities. The majority have previous <b>experience</b> of <b>online</b> <b>learning.</b> The results of this study can be used to ensure educational interventions are targeted at practitioners through the correct channels...|$|R
