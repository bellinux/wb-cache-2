40|$|Cryogenic space engines {{require a}} cooling process to {{condition}} engine hardware to operating temperature before start. This {{can be accomplished}} most efficiently by burning propellants {{that would otherwise be}} dumped overboard after cooling the engine. The resultant low thrust operating modes are called Tank Head <b>Idle</b> and <b>Pumped</b> <b>Idle.</b> During February 1984, Pratt & Whitney conducted a series of tests demonstrating operation of the RL 10 rocket engines at low thrust levels using a previously untried hydrogen/oxygen heat exchanger. The initial testing of the RL 10 - 11 B Breadboard Low Thrust Engine is described. The testing demonstrated operation at both tank head <b>idle</b> and <b>pumped</b> <b>idle</b> modes...|$|R
50|$|During {{his tenure}} as governor, Bangerter dealt with the {{flooding}} of the Great Salt Lake and its tributaries by approving the construction of large, US$60 million pumps to channel excess water from the Great Salt Lake onto the Bonneville Salt Flats. This was initially successful, yet caused some controversy when the lake's water level fell in later years, and some regarded the <b>idle</b> <b>pumps</b> as wasteful.|$|R
40|$|Cryogenic rocket engines {{requiring}} a cooling process to thermally condition {{the engine to}} operating temperature can be made more efficient if cooling propellants can be burned. Tank head <b>idle</b> and <b>pumped</b> <b>idle</b> modes {{can be used to}} burn propellants employed for cooling, thereby providing useful thrust. Such idle modes required the use of a heat exchanger to vaporize oxygen prior to injection into the combustion chamber. During December 1988, Pratt and Whitney conducted a series of engine hot firing demonstrating the operation of two new, previously untested oxidizer heat exchanger designs. The program was a second iteration of previous low thrust testing conducted in 1984, during which a first-generation heat exchanger design was used. Although operation was demonstrated at tank head <b>idle</b> and <b>pumped</b> <b>idle,</b> the engine experienced instability when propellants could not be supplied to the heat exchanger at design conditions...|$|R

Hunters Hill, which is just above Haxey Gate bridge, and <b>Idle</b> Stop <b>pumping</b> stations are situated on the banks of the <b>Idle,</b> while Austerfield <b>pumping</b> station is set further back on the Austerfield Drain. The fourth pumping station is at Langholme, on the northern edge of the IDB area, and feeds into the Warping Drain, which joins the River Trent at Owston Ferry.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} RL 10 Rocket Engine Product Improvement Program, Oxidizer Heat Exchanger (OHE) stages 1, 2, and 3 were {{designed}} and fabricated during late 1983 and early 1984. The purpose of the OHE is to provide gaseous oxygen to the propellant injector for stable engine operation at tank head <b>idle</b> and <b>pumped</b> <b>idle</b> operating modes. This report summarizes the OHE stages 1 and 3 rig testing, and includes {{the separation of the}} stage 1 -and- 2 assembly and the remanifolding of stage 1. The OHE performance analysis and analytical model modifications for both stages are also presented. The flow tests were accomplished during the time period from 9 October 1984 to 12 November 1984...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Expander Test Bed (AETB) is the {{key element}} for {{development}} of technology for future space engines. The AETB {{will be used to}} validate the high pressure expander cycle concept, investigate system interactions and conduct investigations of advanced mission focused components and new health monitoring techniques. The AETB will use oxygen/hydrogen propellants and a split expander cycle with nominal operation at a combustion chamber pressure of 1200 psia, a mixture ratio of 6. 0, and an equivalent vacuum thrust of 20, 000 lbf. It will function over a wide range of conditions including throttling to 5 percent thrust, operation at a mixture ratio of 12. 0, and operation in tank head <b>idle</b> and <b>pumped</b> <b>idle</b> modes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an S-Band parametric amplifier {{which was designed}} and subsequently built to study this type of amplifier at microwave frequencies. The signal, <b>idling</b> and <b>pump</b> were at the frequencies 2975, 7000, and 9975 megacycles respectively. The amplifier worked satisfactorily giving stable gains as high as 20 db. The bandwidth was, however, very low. Some theoretical investigations were performed on such topics as the stability and optimum load of the amplifier, and the negative conductance of parametric diodes. Some technical details about the construction, operation and measurements are also included...|$|R

The engine performance, weight, and envelope parametrics data were expanded to include mixture ratios of 7. 5 and 8. 0...|$|R
40|$|The {{breadboard}} low thrust RL 10 - 2 B {{engine is}} described. A {{summary of the}} analysis and design effort to define the multimode thrust concept applicable to the requirements for the upper stage vehicles is provided. Baseline requirements were established for operation of the RL 10 - 2 B engine under the following conditions: (1) tank head idle at low propellant tank pressures without vehicle propellant conditioning or settling thrust; (2) <b>pumped</b> <b>idle</b> at a ten percent thrust level for low G deployment and/or vehicle tank pressurization; and (3) full thrust (15, 000 lb.). Several variations of the engine configuration were investigated and results of the analyses are included...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{transients}} {{that may occur}} with moderate frequency cause 'either increased core flow or introduction of cooler or de-borated water into the core. These transients result {{in an increase in}} core reactivity due to decreased mod-erator temperature, moderator boron concentration, or core void fraction. This SRP section is intended to be applicable to all such transients. * Each of these transients should be discussed in individual sections of the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR), as required by the Standard Format (Reference 1). The specific transients (Table 15 - 1 of Reference 1) evaluated are: 1. Boiling water reactor (BWR) : startup of an <b>idle</b> recirculation <b>pump.</b> 2. BWR: flow controller malfunction causing increased recirculation flow. 3. Pressurized water reactor (PWR) with loop isolation valves; startup of a pump in an initially isolated inactive reactor coolant loop where the rate of flow increase is limited by {{the rate at which the}} isolation valves open. 4. PWR without loop isolation valves: startup of a pump in an inactive loop. The review of the core flow increase transients considers the sequence of events, the analytical model, the values of parameters used in the analytical model, and the predicted consequences of the transients. The RSB reviewer concentrates on *Continuous boron dilution is considered in another section of the SRP...|$|R
40|$|The RL 10 -IIB engine, a {{derivative}} of the RLIO, {{is capable of}} multi-mode thrust operation. This engine operates at two low thrust levels: tank head idle (THI), which is approximately 1 to 2 percent of full thrust, and <b>pumped</b> <b>idle</b> (PI), which is 10 percent of full thrust. Operation at THI provides vehicle propellant settling thrust and efficient engine thermal conditioning; PI operation provides vehicle tank pre-pressurization and maneuver thrust for log-g deployment. Stable combustion of the RL 10 -IIB engine at THI and PI thrust levels {{can be accomplished by}} providing gaseous oxygen at the propellant injector. Using gaseous hydrogen from the thrust chamber jacket as an energy source, a heat exchanger can be used to vaporize liquid oxygen without creating flow instability. This report summarizes the design and analysis of a United Aircraft Products (UAP) low-rate heat transfer heat exchanger concept for the RL 10 -IIB rocket engine. The design represents a second iteration of the RL 10 -IIB heat exchanger investigation program. The design and analysis of the first heat exchanger effort is presented in more detail in NASA CR- 174857. Testing of the previous design is detailed in NASA CR- 179487...|$|R

The oxidized heat exchanger (OHE) vaporizes the liquid oxygen using hydrogen as the energy source. This report summarizes the test activity and post-test data analysis for two possible heat exchangers, each of which employs a completely different design philosophy. One design makes use of a low-heat transfer (PHT) approach in combination with a volume to attenuate pressure and flow oscillations. The test data showed that the LHT unit satisfied the oxygen exit quality of 0. 95 or greater in both the THI and PI modes while maintaining stability. The HHT unit fulfilled all PI requirements; data for THI satisfactory operation is implied from experimental data that straddle the exact THI operating point...|$|R
25|$|The {{banks of}} the river below Bawtry have been raised so that the river acts as a high level carrier for the {{drainage}} of the surrounding land. The area between {{the river and the}} Chesterfield Canal to the south and the Warping Drain to the north is drained by a network of drainage ditches, which are connected to the river by a number of sluices and pumping stations. Water is pumped from the ditches to avoid flooding of the agricultural land, although the pumping station at Gringley can operate in reverse, supplying water to the ditches for irrigation when required. The outflow into the River Trent is controlled by a pumping station and two sluices. A vertical sluice gate protects the entrance to the <b>Idle,</b> and the <b>pumping</b> station and another sluice are situated further back. When the water level in the Trent is low, the sluice gates allow water to leave the Idle by gravity, but at high tide, four electric pumps are used to pump the outflow into the space between the sluice gates until it can again discharge by gravity. The pumping station was commissioned in 1981, and was the largest all-electric pumping station in Britain at the time. When all four pumps are operating, it can discharge 2,124 tons per minute (3,059 Mld).|$|R
40|$|Heart valve {{disease is}} the 3 rd {{leading cause of}} {{cardiovascular}} mortality and morbidity in the US and with current aging trends, {{will continue to increase}} in prevalence in the coming years. The historical approach to valve disease treatment is open-chest, surgical replacement. While this tried-and-true approach is very good at treating {{a large portion of the}} population, it is not ideal for very young or very old patients. Heart valves are in many ways like the simple check valves that are in your household plumbing system and automobile engines – they are controlled by inertial fluid forces and assure that flow is unidirectional. Unlike toilets or cars however, our hearts are never <b>idle</b> or stop <b>pumping</b> blood, meaning the valves must work to near perfection for ~ 3. 5 million cycles per year or ~ 3 billion cycles over a 75 year lifetime. Heart valve biomechanics has been an active research field for over 50 years (Sacks, Merryman et al. 2009) and more recently, heart valve mechanobiology has become a topic of great interest (Merryman 2010). The distinction between biomechanics and mechanobiology is subtle (Merryman and Engler 2010), but essentially, biomechanics is the application of the principles of mechanics to study living organisms and their components, while mechanobiology is the application or analysis of the role of mechanical forces in eliciting a molecular response, leading to a change i...|$|R

40|$|The Nepal Ambient Monitoring and Source Testing Experiment (NAMaSTE) {{characterized}} {{widespread and}} under-sampled combustion sources common to South Asia, including brick kilns, garbage burning, diesel and gasoline generators, diesel groundwater <b>pumps,</b> <b>idling</b> motorcycles, traditional and modern cooking stoves and fires, crop residue burning, and a heating fire. Fuel-based emission factors (EF; with units of pollutant mass emitted per kg of fuel combusted) were determined for fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), inorganic ions, trace metals, and organic species. For the forced draught zig-zag brick kiln, EF PM 2. 5 ranged 1 – 19  g kg − 1 with major contributions from OC (7  %), sulfate {{expected to be}} in the form of sulfuric acid (31. 9  %), and other chemicals not measured (e. g., particle bound water). For the clamp kiln, EF PM 2. 5 ranged 8 – 13  g kg − 1, with major contributions from OC (63. 2  %), sulfate (20. 8  %), and ammonium (14. 2  %). Our brick kiln EF PM 2. 5 values may exceed those previously reported, partly because we sampled emissions at ambient temperature after emission from the stack or kiln allowing some particle-phase OC and sulfate to form from gaseous precursors. The combustion of mixed household garbage under dry conditions had an EF PM 2. 5 of 7. 4  ±  1. 2  g kg − 1, whereas damp conditions generated the highest EF PM 2. 5 of all combustion sources in this study, reaching up to 125  ±  23  g kg − 1. Garbage burning emissions contained relatively high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs), triphenylbenzene, and heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Sb), making these useful markers of this source. A variety of cooking stoves and fires fueled with dung, hardwood, twigs, and/or other biofuels were studied. The use of dung for cooking and heating produced higher EF PM 2. 5 than other biofuel sources and consistently emitted more PM 2. 5 and OC than burning hardwood and/or twigs; this trend was consistent across traditional mud stoves, chimney stoves, and 3 -stone cooking fires. The comparisons of different cooking stoves and cooking fires revealed the highest PM emissions from 3 -stone cooking fires (7. 6 – 73  g kg − 1), followed by traditional mud stoves (5. 3 – 19. 7  g kg − 1), mud stoves with a chimney for exhaust (3. 0 – 6. 8  g kg − 1), rocket stoves (1. 5 – 7. 2  g kg − 1), induced-draught stoves (1. 2 – 5. 7  g kg − 1), and the bhuse chulo stove (3. 2  g kg − 1), while biogas had no detectable PM emissions. Idling motorcycle emissions were evaluated before and after routine servicing at a local shop, which decreased EF PM 2. 5 from 8. 8  ±  1. 3  g kg − 1 to 0. 71  ±  0. 4  g kg − 1 when averaged across five motorcycles. Organic species analysis indicated that this reduction in PM 2. 5 was largely due to a decrease in emission of motor oil, probably from the crankcase. The EF and chemical emissions profiles developed in this study may be used for source apportionment and to update regional emission inventories...|$|R
