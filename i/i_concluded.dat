5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April 1915, Haruna was {{formally}} commissioned at Kobe. On 13 December 1915, after {{eight months of}} trials, she {{was assigned to the}} Third Battleship Division of the Second Fleet. On 9 April 1916, she departed Sasebo Naval Base for operations in the East China Sea, returning to Japan 10 days later. On 1 December 1916, Captain Saburo Hyakutake assumed command of Haruna until 15 September 1917, when Captain Naomi Taniguchi replaced him. On 1 December 1917, she was placed in reserve, as hostilities in the Pacific theatre of World War <b>I</b> <b>concluded.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between John of Brienne and Hugh I of Cyprus was tense. Hugh ordered the imprisonment of John's supporters in Cyprus, releasing them only at Pope Innocent's command. During the War of the Antiochene Succession John sided with Bohemond IV of Antioch and the Templars against Raymond-Roupen of Antioch and Leo I, King of Cilician Armenia, who {{were supported by}} Hugh and the Hospitallers. However, John sent only 50 knights to fight the Armenians in Antiochia in 1213. Leo <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> a peace treaty with the Knights Templar late that year, and he and John reconciled. John married Leo's oldest daughter, Stephanie (also known as Rita), in 1214 and Stephanie received a dowry of 30,000 bezants. Quarrels among John, Leo I, Hugh I and Bohemond IV are documented by Pope Innocent's letters urging them to reconcile their differences before the Fifth Crusade reached the Holy Land.|$|E

25|$|In 1284 George Terter <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> a new {{treaty with}} Andronikos II Palaiologos, and {{retrieved}} his first wife, while Theodore Svetoslav at first remained a hostage. The same treaty required the breaking {{off of the}} alliance with Thessaly and Theodore Svetoslav's intended bride was also sent to Byzantium. It was only in 1285 that the Patriarch of Bulgaria Joakim III arrived in Constantinople and arranged {{for the release of}} Theodore Svetoslav, who was now supposed to marry a daughter of the high court official John Synadenos. We have no information whether this marriage materialized.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 2009, the ICC {{issued a}} warrant of arrest for Omar Al Bashir, President of Sudan as the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> that his {{position}} as head of state does not grant him immunity against prosecution before the ICC. The warrant was for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It {{did not include the}} crime of genocide because the majority of the Chamber did not find that the prosecutors had provided enough evidence to include such a charge. Later the decision was changed by the Appeals Panel and after issuing the second decision, charges against Omar al-Bashir include three counts of genocide.|$|E

500|$|In his memoirs, Grant {{reacted to}} {{criticism}} of his lack of entrenchments: [...] "Besides this, the troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drill {{more than they did}} experience with the pick, shovel and axe. ... under all these circumstances <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> that drill and discipline were worth more to our men than fortifications." [...] Lew Wallace's division was [...] downstream (north) from Pittsburg Landing, at Crump's Landing, a position intended to prevent the placement of Confederate river batteries, to protect the road connecting Crump's Landing to Bethel Station, Tennessee, and to guard the Union army's right flank. In addition, Wallace's troops could strike the railroad line connecting Bethel Station to Corinth, about [...] to the south.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin was {{situated}} at {{the eastern end of}} the Santa Fe Trail, which had opened two years earlier. Many of the customers at the saddleshop were trappers and traders, from whom Carson heard stirring tales of the West. Carson found work in the saddlery not to his taste: he once stated [...] "the business did not suit me, and <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> to leave".|$|E
2500|$|After the Russian Emperor Alexander <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> the 1807 Treaty of Tilsit with Napoleon, Alexander, in {{his letter}} on 24 September 1807 to the Swedish King Gustav IV Adolf, {{informed}} the king that the peaceful relations between Russia and Sweden depended on Swedish agreement {{to abide by the}} limitations of the Treaty of Tilsit which in practice meant that Sweden would have been required to follow the Continental System. The king, who viewed Napoleon as the Antichrist and Britain as his ally against Napoleon's France, was apprehensive of the system's ruinous consequences for Sweden's maritime commerce. [...] He instead entered into negotiations with Britain in order to prepare a joint attack against Denmark, whose Norwegian possessions he coveted.|$|E

2500|$|Opposition to condoms did {{not only}} come from moralists: {{by the late}} 19th century many feminists {{expressed}} distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches. [...] Despite social and legal opposition, {{at the end of}} the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method. Two surveys conducted in New York in 1890 and 1900 found that 45% of the women surveyed were using condoms to prevent pregnancy. [...] A survey in Boston just prior to World War <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> that three million condoms were sold in that city every year.|$|E
2500|$|The onus of {{leadership}} fell on him, I said, {{and if he}} would seize the initiative, Washington and London would have to follow. That may have been somewhat naive, but I firmly believed, I wrote, that UNSCOM was fighting for its very existence as a meaningful disarmament body, and inspections aimed at uncovering concealment remained imperative. It was a fight worth fighting, I said, recommending that we {{go ahead with the}} planned inspections regardless of the naysayers, though not without continuing to seek support. [...] "In reengaging on concealment," [...] <b>I</b> <b>concluded,</b> [...] "the Special Commission will be waving a red flag in front of the Iraqi bull. It is essential that this red flag be backed by a sword, or else the commission {{will not be able to}} withstand the Iraqi charge. In short, the Special Commission's push on concealment must be 100 percent." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the long}} years of warfare under Tsar Simeon I the Great (893-927), the country was exhausted. The {{constant}} wars were unpopular enough so that 20,000 people sought refuge in Byzantium because of Simeon's [...] "warlike rush and relentless intentions". His successor Peter <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> a favourable peace treaty with the Byzantines, but the situation inside the country saw no improvement. There were many reasons for the decline— some historians dismiss Peter I as a weak ruler, incapable of handling his own family (two of his brothers rose up against him). Furthermore, in the mid-10th century the new Bogomil heresy spread itself widely over the country. The Bogomils preached that people must not follow secular authorities, pay taxes or enroll in the army. As a result, the Bulgarians were unable to stop the Magyars, who looted and plundered the countryside, further contributing to the grim situation of the state. When the Byzantines paid the Rus' knyaz Svyatoslav I to invade Bulgaria in 968, Peter I could send only 30,000 men against the 60,000 strong invading force. During the Rus' invasion between 968 and 971 the Bulgarians de facto {{lost control of the}} north-eastern parts of their country, including the capital Preslav, and in 970, Svyatoslav massacred 300 Bulgarian nobles, the elite of the Bulgarian nation and army, in Silistra.|$|E

2500|$|I mounted, therefore, unbidden, the Bed stead – & M. Dubois placed me {{upon the}} Mattress, & spread a cambric {{handkerchief}} upon my face. It was transparent, however, & I saw, through it, that the Bed stead was instantly {{surrounded by the}} 7 men & my nurse. I refused to be held; but when, Bright through the cambric, I saw the glitter of polished Steel – [...] I closed my Eyes. I would not trust to convulsive fear {{the sight of the}} terrible incision. Yet – when the dreadful steel was plunged into the breast – cutting through veins – arteries – flesh – nerves – I needed no injunctions not to restrain my cries. I began a scream that lasted unintermittingly during the whole time of the incision – & I almost marvel that it rings not in my Ears still? so excruciating was the agony. When the wound was made, & the instrument was withdrawn, the pain seemed undiminished, for the air that suddenly rushed into those delicate parts felt like a mass of minute but sharp & forked poniards, that were tearing the edges of the wound. <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> the operation was over – Oh no! presently the terrible cutting was renewed – & worse than ever, to separate the bottom, the foundation of this dreadful gland from the parts to which it adhered – Again all description would be baffled – yet again all was not over, – Dr. Larry rested but his own hand, & – Oh heaven! – I then felt the knife (rack)ling against the breast bone – scraping it! ...|$|E
60|$|I did so, and the man's {{face had}} changed, growing intent and keen before <b>I</b> <b>concluded.</b>|$|E
