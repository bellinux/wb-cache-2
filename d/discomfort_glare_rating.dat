40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> {{sensation}} in subjects aged 50 years and more in comparison with younger subjects (i. e. younger than 35 years of age). Material and Methods: The experiments were performed on a computer workstation placed in controlled lighting environment where 2 <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> conditions were modeled. Each participant performed for about 1 h specially designed visual tasks, including the tests with Landolt's rings presented on the screen by a computer program. The glare evaluation method consisted of subjective evaluation of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> on the semantic <b>glare</b> <b>rating</b> scale, tests of mesopic contrast and glare sensitivity, subjective assessment of lighting quality and asthenopic symptoms. The time needed to perform the task and the number of mistakes were also recorded. The subjective evaluation of glare was compared with the Unified <b>Glare</b> <b>Rating</b> (UGR) index calculated by the DIALux simulation program. Results: A higher percentage of the younger group subjects assessed glare after the experimental session as uncomfortable and intolerable than in the 50 + group, who more often assessed glare as acceptable. The assessment of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> in the younger group corresponded to higher UGR value compared to UGR value calculated by DIALux. In the 50 + group, such correlation was found only for lower <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> (UGR = 19). The results showed that younger participants more frequently suffered from visual fatigue and assessed lighting as less comfortable. However, the mesopic glare sensitivity increased significantly after the experiments only in the 50 + group under both glare conditions. Conclusions: The obtained results showed that <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> sensation changes with age. The younger population seems to be more sensitive and demanding than the older one in relation to <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> limiting, in spite of the lack of significant objective measures of fatigue. The exposure of the elderly to bigger <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> could adversely affect the objective measures of fatigue like mesopic glare sensitivity and visual performance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> from bright luminaires or windows is not {{a simple}} matter but {{consists}} of a complex relation-ship between a number of factors. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the background luminance on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> in relation to the size of the glare source. An experiment was conducted with observers. In the experiment, the change in the <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare,</b> depending on the change in the background luminance, was measured using different sizes of glare sources. Seven sizes of steradian of the glare source were selected and five levels of back-ground luminance were chosen for the experiment. The results showed that the higher the background lumi-nance, the smaller the observer’s degree of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> The exponent of background luminance changed clearly into different patterns in relation to the sizes of the glare source. A new mathematical formula has been developed by this study to determine the exponent of the background luminance for use in the range from 0. 0003 to 5 sr of the glare source. The use of this formula would extend the application limit of the current unified <b>glare</b> <b>rating</b> formula from the current limit of 0. 1 to 5 sr. Using the formula, the change in the background luminance would have no impact on the <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare,</b> in case when the glare source occupies the entire visual field...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of a bright light source in the visual field, particularly when viewed against a dark background, can generate a form of discomfort, which {{is often described as}} ‘discomfort glare’. The mechanisms for <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> remain poorly understood, even after 50 years of multidisciplinary research in this field. The aim of this investigation was to investigate a number of relevant parameters that can affect <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> in order to gain insights into the corresponding mechanisms. We measured retinal illuminance levels for <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> at threshold as a function of source size, eccentricity and surrounding background luminance. In addition, the pupil size was measured throughout and related to the measured thresholds for <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> A group of 50 subjects with normal visual acuity and no clinical signs of eye disease took part in the primary study that measured <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds as a function of source size. A light ‘homogenizer’ was used to integrate the concentrated light output from a quad LED light source. Pulse frequency modulation was used to control the intensity of the source and continuous pupil size measurements made it possible to calculate retinal illuminance. <b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds were estimated by measuring the retinal illuminance of the glare source at threshold using a staircase procedure. <b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds were measured as a function of glare source area, eccentricity and background luminance. The amplitude of pupil constriction was also measured both below and above the <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> threshold. A model of contrast vision with the filtering of a photoreceptor signal through centre-surround ganglion cells was developed to account for the small size dependence of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds that was observed experimentally. Another model for scattered light was applied to compute the corresponding pupil constriction amplitude caused by the integrated photoreceptor signals generated by the glare source both within and outside the stimulus area. The threshold for <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> decreased gradually with glare source size and increased with background luminance and showed little dependence on glare source eccentricity. The effect of forward light scatter in the eye was also investigated and a model was developed to account for the continued increase in pupil response amplitude well above the <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> threshold. The effect of glare source size on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds could be predicted by a model involving photoreceptor saturation and edge response. When the scattered light outside the stimulus area was also taken into account, the pupil constriction amplitude increased log-linearly with stimulus retinal illuminance both below and above <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds. These findings suggest that <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> depended largely on the localised retinal illuminance and could be accounted for by the saturation of photoreceptor signals in the retina. The results and the pupil modeling work also suggest that the pupil response to light flux increments continued well above the <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> threshold, {{largely as a result of}} light scattered outside the area of the glare source...|$|R

40|$|In {{the formal}} study of glare, a major {{distinction}} {{has been made}} between subjective and objective effects of glare (referred to as <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> and disability glare, respectively). Recently, both anecdotal reports and formal experiments have indicated that headlamp size and spectral power distribution affect <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare,</b> but no assessment {{has been made of}} whether these two factors also affect disability glare. Models of disability glare suggest that they should not. The present experiment was designed to provide empirical evidence about this issue. Subjects were presented with glare stimuli that varied in size (0. 3 or 0. 6 degrees of visual angle) and spectral power distribution (tungsten-halogen or high-intensity discharge). <b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> was measured by numerical ratings of subjective <b>discomfort.</b> Disability <b>glare</b> was measured by determining the luminance threshold for detecting a pedestrian silhouette presented near the glare source. Spectral power distribution affected <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare,</b> although, in contrast to previous studies, which had shown small but statistically significant effects, size did not affect <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> Neither variable affected disability glare. These results indicate that, for size and spectral power distribution, effects on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> do not necessarily imply effects on disability glare. The fact that small, high-intensity discharge lamps do not seem to cause any special problems with disability glare under the conditions of this experiment is encouraging, particularly because disability glare is likely to have greater effects on safety than <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> However, given the importance of the issue, further studies of disability glare would be valuable.

40|$|PURPOSE: Involuntary {{physiological}} responses {{offer an alternative}} means to psychophysical procedures for objectively evaluating <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> This study examined eye movement and pupil size responses to <b>glare</b> <b>discomfort</b> using new approaches to analysis: relative pupil size and speed of eye movement. METHODS: Participants evaluated <b>glare</b> <b>discomfort</b> using the standard de Boer rating scale under various conditions manipulated to influence <b>glare</b> <b>discomfort.</b> Eye movement was recorded using an electro-oculogram (EOG), and pupil size was recorded using Tobii glasses. Ten young (mean age: 24. 5 years old) and 10 senior (mean age: 61 years old) participants were recruited for this experiment. RESULTS: Subjective evaluation of <b>glare</b> <b>discomfort</b> was highly correlated with eye movement (multiple correlation coefficient [R(2) ] of > 0. 94, P < 0. 001) and pupil constriction (R(2) = 0. 38, P < 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractIt is well {{established}} {{that there are two}} main aspects to glare, the visual impairment and the discomfort, known as disability and <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare,</b> respectively. In contrast to the case of disability glare we understand very little about the underlying mechanisms or physiology of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> This study attempts to elucidate the neural mechanisms involved using fMRI and glare sources with controlled levels of retinal illuminance. Prior to carrying out the fMRI experiment, we determined each participant's <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> threshold. The participants were then divided into two groups of equal size based on their ranked sensitivity to <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare,</b> a low and high sensitivity group. In the fMRI experiment each participant was presented with three levels of glare intensity whilst simultaneously required to carry out a simple behavioral task. We compared BOLD responses between the two groups and found that the group more sensitive to glare had an increased response that was localized at three discrete, bilateral cortical locations: one in the cunei, one in the lingual gyri and one in the superior parietal lobules. This increased response was present for all light levels tested, {{whether or not they were}} intense enough to cause <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> Based on the results, we present the case that <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> may be a response to hyperexcitability or saturation of visual neurons...|$|R

40|$|This {{laboratory}} {{study investigated the}} effects of stimulus duration {{and the nature of}} visual correction on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> The experimental setup simulated a nighttime driving situation with an opposing glare source at 3. 5 ° of visual angle. There were 25 different glare stimuli, obtained by combining each of five levels of duration (ranging from 0. 125 to 2 seconds) with each of five levels of illuminance (ranging from 0. 5 to 8 lux). Two groups of subjects participated: those needing no visual correction, and those needing correction and having both contact lenses and spectacles. The latter group of subjects used their contact lenses in one half of the trials and their spectacles in {{the other half of the}} trials. <b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> was evaluated using the de Boer discomfort-glare scale. Neither presence of correction (either contact lenses or spectacles versus no correction) nor type of correction (contact lenses versus spectacles) had a statistically significant effect on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> When averaged across all subjects, both duration and illuminance had statistically significant effects on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare,</b> although subjects' <b>discomfort</b> judgments were less affected by duration than by illuminance. Both relationships were well described by log-linear functions. Using these two functions, we generated predictions about the likely changes in <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> as a consequence of selected changes in duration, and about the changes in duration and illuminance with equivalent effects on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> For example, a 25 % reduction in duration is predicted to reduce <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> by 0. 2 de Boer units, and be functionally equivalent to an 11 % reduction in illuminance. However, there were wide variations between subjects in the relationship between duration and <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> These findings imply that, for the effectiveness of headlamp automatic-leveling systems and variablereflectance mirrors, the control of duration is less important than the control of peak illuminance, at least for transient elevations in illuminance that are relatively brief...|$|R

Thirty participants were asked to use neutral density filters to match perception of brightness and <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> through colored filters and with no filters in low and high lighting conditions. Colored filters were selected to test the influence of S-cones versus M- and L-cone stimulation. Results show that, in a high-luminance outdoor setting, findings were consistent with decreased S-cone stimulation resulting in an increased perception of brightness.

40|$|<b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> is the annoyance, or {{temporary}} discomfort {{produced by}} luminance (brightness) within the visual field that is sufficiently {{greater than the}} luminance to which the eyes are adapted. Both small and large source glare formulae are often poor predictors of the subjective assessment of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> and, in particular, Hopkinson's daylight glare formula.

This thesis investigated a general hypothesis that an increase in interest in a glare source is associated with a decrease in <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> The investigations were performed in two main parts aiming to test the effect of interest in two cases of glare sources, a small projected screen image and a window. Indeed, a main focus of the thesis was to explore the effect of interest {{in the case of a}} window with a hypothesis that an increase in interest in a view is associated with a decrease in <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> from windows.

40|$|Glare indices {{have yet}} to be {{extensively}} tested in daylit open plan offices, as such there is no effective method to predict <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> within these spaces. This study into <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> in open plan green buildings targeted full-time employees, working under their everyday lighting conditions. Three green buildings in Brisbane were used for data collection, two were Green Star accredited and the other contained innovative daylighting strategies. Data were collected on full-time employees, mostly aged between 30 and 50 years, who broadly reflect the demographics of the wider working population in Australia. It was discovered 36 of the 64 respondents experienced discomfort from both electric and daylight sources at their workspace. The study used a specially tailored post-occupancy evaluation (POE) survey to help assess <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> Luminance maps extracted from High Dynamic Range (HDR) images were used to capture the luminous environment of the occupants. These were analysed using participant data and the program Evalglare. The physical results indicated no correlation with other developed glare metrics for daylight within these open plan green buildings, including the recently developed Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) Index. The strong influence of vertical illuminance, Ev in the DGP precludes the mostly contrast-based glare from windows observed in this investigation from forming a significant part of this index. Furthermore, critical assessment of the survey techniques used are considered. These will provide insight for further research into <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> in the endeavour to fully develop a suitable glare metric...|$|R
40|$|Nighttime is {{considered}} to be the most dangerous time for driving. The number of fatalities greatly increases at night, especially when considering the significant {{reduction in the number of}} miles traveled. Many researchers attribute the higher fatality rate to the reduction of visibility due to the reduction of ambient lighting. Factors such as <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> from oncoming drivers and inadequate road markings further reduce visibility. This research effort focused on ascertaining the headlamp technology (of the eleven specified) that minimized the amount of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> and maximized the visibility of three types of pavement marking materials used in the study. Two baseline conditions, halogen low beam (HLB) and high-intensity discharge (HID) were measured both individually and in combination with three levels of UV-A. In addition, three other headlamp configurations were evaluated. <b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> was measured subjectively for each headlamp configuration. Pavement marking visibility was directly measured via pavement marking detection distances. Thirty participants representing three age groups participated in this study: young (18 - 25 years old), middle (40 - 50 years old), and older (60 years and older). The headlam...|$|R
40|$|Conclusions {{from earlier}} {{investigations}} indicating an average luminance of 2 cd/m 2 as necessary for dense traffic were confirmed by appraisals of luminance level and visibility trials. The colour {{of the light}} influences the visibility {{as well as the}} appraisal of luminance level, pattern and <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> In all these respects sodium lamp lighting provides more favourable results than those obtained with colour corrected mercury lamps under otherwise identical conditions. At higher values of the road luminance a lower degree of uniformity in the luminance distribution is acceptable. A formulae, derived from results of earlier investigations, is found to be a suitable criterion for <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of prior headlighting experience on ratings of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> from headlamps in an actual driving situation. Specifically, dis-comfort glare ratings given by West Germans who had recently arrived in the United States and were, presumably, used to the relatively low levels of glare associated with head lamps in West Germany were compared with ratings given by U. S. -born subjects. The West German subjects reported significantly more dis-comfort than did the U. S. subjects. This finding is {{in agreement with the}} so-called range effect, in which subjective judgments are affected by the range of available stimuli. Consequently, the present findings support the hypothesis that <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> ratings are affected by prior visual experience...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate further a difference in <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> produced by tungsten-halogen (TH) and high-intensity discharge (HID) headlamps that we had found in a previous experiment. In a static field setup, 36 subjects, 24 in a younger group and 12 in an older group, made de Boer ratings of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> for TH and HID lamps. The lighting conditions were similar to those seen while driving on a dark, two-lane road when glare from an oncoming car is encountered. The results replicated the difference between TH and HID lamps that we observed in the earlier study, and indicated that the difference is not reduced by several manipulations of contex...|$|R
