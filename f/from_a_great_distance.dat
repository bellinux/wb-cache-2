5|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} AI, which some found inconsistent. Whitehead criticized his {{experience}} of enemies that can see Corvo <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>distance</b> yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies' peripheral vision. Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by enemies {{that lead to}} unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth-focused players into a combat situation, for which their character is not built. According to G4's Jake Gaskill, the AI worked well in combat, with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, enemies would ignore actions {{directly in front of}} them. Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence, but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep the enemies formidable.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the size}} of Olympus Mons and its shallow slopes, an {{observer}} standing on the Martian surface would be unable to view the entire profile of the volcano, even <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>distance.</b> The curvature of the planet and the volcano itself would obscure such a synoptic view. Similarly, an observer near the summit would be unaware of standing on a very high mountain, as the slope of the volcano would extend far beyond the horizon, a mere 3 kilometers away.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is noted}} for its {{historic}} architecture, which includes surviving examples of timber framed Tudor style houses and shops. The historic Solihull School dates from 1560 (although not on its present site). The red sandstone parish church of St. Alphege dates from a similar period and is a large and handsome example of English Gothic church architecture, with a traditional spire 168 feet (51 metres) high, making it visible <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>distance.</b> It {{is located at the}} head of High Street and is a Grade I listed building. It was founded in about 1220 by Hugh de Oddingsell. A chantry chapel was also founded there by Sir William de Oddingsell in 1277 and the upper chapel in St Alphege was built for a chantry.|$|E

25|$|In Venice, {{the second}} and current St. Mark's Basilica {{was built on the}} site of the first between 1063 and 1072, {{replacing}} the earlier church while replicating its Greek cross plan. Five domes vault the interior (one each over the four arms of the cross and one in the center). These domes were built in the Byzantine style, in imitation of the now lost Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Mounted over pendentives, each dome has a ring of windows at its base. These five windowed domes reflect the addition of windows (within tall drums) in the remodeled Byzantine original. However, the tall outer shells at St. Mark's were not added until after 1204. The later high wooden outer domes with lead roofing and cupolas were added to St. Mark's Basilica between 1210 and 1270, allowing the church to be seen <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>distance.</b> In addition to allowing for a more imposing exterior, building two distinct shells in a dome improved weather protection. It was a rare practice before the 11th century. The fluted and onion-shaped cupolas of the domes may have been added in the mid-fifteenth century to complement the ogee arches added to the facade in the late Gothic period. Their shape may have been influenced by the open and domed wooden pavilions of Persia or by other eastern models. Initially, only the center dome had one.|$|E
25|$|Size readily distinguishes {{this species}} from most other raptors {{when it is}} seen well. Most other raptors are {{considerably}} smaller. Buteo hawks, which are perhaps most similar to the golden eagle in structure among the species outside of the “booted eagle” group, are often amongst the larger very common raptors. However, a mid-sized Buteo is dwarfed by a golden eagle, as an adult female eagle has a wingspan of about twice the width and weighs around five times more. Buteos are also usually distinctly paler below, although some species occur in “dark morphs” which can be even darker than a golden eagle. Only some Old World vultures and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) (among the other raptorial birds this eagle co-exists with) are distinctly larger than the golden eagle, with longer, broader wings, typically held more evenly in a slower, less forceful flight and often have dramatically different color patterns. The turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) is a potential confusion species in North America <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>distance,</b> {{as it is a}} large species that (like the golden eagle) often flies with a pronounced dihedral but is easily separated by its less controlled, forceful flying style and its smaller, thinner body, much smaller head and, at closer range, its slaty black-brown color and silvery wing secondaries. Compared to Haliaeetus eagles, the golden eagle has wings that are only somewhat more slender but are more hawk-like and lack the flat, plank-like wing positioning seen in the other genus. Large northern Haliaeetus usually have a larger bill and larger head which more distinctly protrudes than that of a golden eagle’s in flight. The tail of the golden eagle is longer on average than those of Haliaeetus eagles, appearing to be two or three times the length of the head in soaring flight as opposed to the other eagles where the head is often more than twice the length of the tail. Confusion is most likely between juvenile Haliaeetus and golden eagles since the adult golden has a more solidly golden-brown coloration and all Haliaeetus eagles have obvious distinctive plumages as adults. Haliaeetus eagles are often heavily streaked in their juvenile phase. Juvenile golden eagles can show large patches of white to the wings and tail that are quite different than the random, sometimes large and splotchy-looking distribution of white typical of juvenile Haliaeetus.|$|E
500|$|In 1860, the Highland Railway {{decided to}} {{construct}} a railway line going from Inverness through Easter Ross. The line was completed by 1862, and the following year, on 23 May 1863, Evanton gained its own railway station. However, the station was called Novar, and was not renamed [...] "Evanton" [...] until 1937. Sadly for the local economy, the station was closed in June 1960.

[...] The {{daughter}} of another noted flag maker, Rebecca Young, Pickersgill learned her craft from her mother, and, in 1813, was commissioned by Major George Armistead to make a flag for Baltimore's Fort McHenry that was so large that the British would have no difficulty seeing it <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>distance.</b> [...] The flag was installed in August 1813, and, a year later, during the Battle of Baltimore, Francis Scott Key could see the flag while negotiating a prisoner exchange aboard a British vessel, and was inspired to pen the words that became the United States National Anthem.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{was created for}} the fourth season to introduce Christian mythology to the series. With series creator Eric Kripke wanting to keep the introduction of an angel a secret, the {{character was}} described as a demon during auditions. Once Collins got the part, the main direction Kripke gave him of the character was there is [...] "an otherworldly quality to the character, and that he hasn't been up close with human beings. [...] He's been watching human beings <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>distance</b> for the last two thousand years, so angels haven't been on Earth mingling with human beings for the last two thousand years. [...] So when [...] interacting with human beings, there's a naive curiosity about their behavior. [...] It's as if [...] inspecting some sort of alien beings." [...] As well, director Kim Manners wanted to see a [...] "piousness" [...] to Castiel. Kripke based Castiel's appearance on the comic book character John Constantine.|$|E
500|$|Another {{factor in}} the {{original}} development of set pieces was the design of vast and seamless environments. They were meant to enable scenarios such as the player character being shot at <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>distance,</b> or a battle which would change scenes between the outside and inside of a building. This corroborated Nomura's intended action-oriented system with more intuitive game controls. He instructed his team to study third-person shooters for reference, [...] "not in simplistic terms, like controls or mechanics, but {{in the way they}} create tension and mood and incorporate the action within that". This carried over into XV, with the stated aim being to distance the game structurally from XIII and its sequels, which featured divided zones rather than a large seamless world. The original inspiration behind this approach was the world design of , with later inspirations being modern Western triple-A open world titles. The environments are divided into three different segments, with separate teams working on each: the world map, locations in the game world, and dungeons. The dungeons were designed to be beautiful, frightening, and memorable. Specific pieces of concept art were created to represent different regions and aesthetic concepts: a single building design was used to capture the essence of Altissia's Venice-inspired atmosphere, while older car designs when compared to the party's vehicle Regalia reflected the lack of human advancement outside Lucis.|$|E

[...] The earliest phase used architectural features similar to PPNA cultures in Anatolia: a single chamber cella with a terazzo floor beneath which bucrania were found. In phase E, corresponding to the Uruk III period (ca. 3000BC), the White Temple was built. The White Temple could be seen <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>distance</b> across the plain of Sumer, as it was elevated 21m and covered in gypsum plaster which reflected sunlight like a mirror.
