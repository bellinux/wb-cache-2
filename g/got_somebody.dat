[...] David Sheehan, a lawyer working for Picard, indicated that the SIPC {{will be trying to}} recover “false profits” earned by some investors. [...] “It was all just made up. ...

2500|$|The {{friendship}} between Zoe and Kelly Taylor (Brooke Kinsella) was a recurring storyline for both characters. In the British press, Kelly and Zoe {{were compared to}} two former popular characters, who also shared a close screen friendship, Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). Kinsella has commented, [...] "It is nice to be compared because they were great [...] but, hopefully, [...] and I will bring our own characters to light and show what we can do. We have so much in common and we balance each other out – when she's crazy I'll calm her down and vice-versa. It's worked well, which is why Kelly has been kept on, which is great for me but also for Michelle because she's <b>got</b> <b>somebody</b> to have fun with. Kelly's {{been one of the}} slowest developing characters and that's been good for me. I wasn't thrown into it and having Michelle has been great for me." ...|$|E

50|$|Due to a {{continuity}} error certain lines {{had to be}} {{cut from}} the skiing holiday picture scene. The scene established that Lister had <b>got</b> <b>somebody's</b> skiing holiday pictures back by mistake. The skiers were scripted to discuss how they received Lister's rather scary birthday snaps in place of theirs. Craig Charles realised {{that this was a}} continuity flaw as at that time, the skiers would not have received them yet. The lines were cut, but as they were originally speaking parts, Louisa Ruthven and Mark Steel were still credited for their parts.|$|R
5000|$|Pat was forty-nine. He was {{a writer}} {{but he had never}} written much, nor even read all the 'originals' he worked from, because it made his head bang to read much. But the good old silent days you <b>got</b> <b>somebody's</b> plot and a smart {{secretary}} and gulped benzedrine 'structure' at her six or eight hours every week. The director took care of the gags. After talkies came he always teamed up with some man who wrote dialogue. Some young man who liked to work. (From [...] "A Man in the Way".) ...|$|R

5000|$|However, Henley {{said that}} Felder had {{continued}} to engage in legal actions, unspecified by Henley, against them. Henley saw History of the Eagles as being instructive on how bands need leaders and cannot work as a democracy. Henley reiterated a point made by Frey in the documentary: [...] "The thing about bands {{is you have to}} have leaders in a band. Everybody can’t be on equal footing. It’s like a football team. <b>Somebody's</b> <b>got</b> to be the quarterback. <b>Somebody’s</b> <b>got</b> to snap the ball, <b>somebody's</b> <b>got</b> to run with the ball, <b>somebody's</b> <b>got</b> to block. If people play their positions and play their strengths everything turns out well. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. We always understood that, some of the other people apparently didn't understand that." ...|$|R
