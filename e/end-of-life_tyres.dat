40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic thermogravimetric (TG) {{study on the}} kinetics of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyre</b> (ELT) pyrolysis. In the experimental part of this work, TG results are compared for tyre samples of different mass and size. This shows that the conduction resistance in the milligram scale (up to ~ 100 mg) tyre sample can be neglected. A comparison of experimental results demonstrates that the characteristic maxima on the DTG curve (the first derivative of TG signal) shift towards higher temperatures for higher heating rates. This phenomenon is explained to have kinetic origin {{and it is not}} caused by the internal heat transfer resistance. In the modelling part of this work, the kinetic parameters of the Three-Component Simulation Model (TCSM) are calculated and compared to the literature values. Testing of the kinetic model is carried out using experiments with a varying heating rate. This shows the limitation of the simplified kinetic approach and the appropriate selection method of the kinetic parameters...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Tyre {{waste from}} <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres</b> (ELTs), {{sometimes}} erroneously {{defined as a}} type of waste, in fact represents a renewable energy resource that is highly competitive as replacement fuel to coal in the form of tyre-derived fuel (TDF) or useable as rubber crumb in other products. In this research study, the main utilisation options considered were based on rubber crumbing through ambient and cryogenic processing. Pyrolysis, the so-called ‘holy grail’ of tyre technologies, rubberised asphalt products, TDF options and various other product options from tyre crumb as basis were considered. Although pyrolysis technology is highly commendable and environmentally friendly, it is still a process with too many variants and presents an unstable economic model that is not attractive to entrepreneurs. Rubberised asphalt depends on policy decisions from local and national authorities supporting initial higher spending and allowances on budgets to acquire future savings from the longevity in the product. The policy requirements and the instability that politically-inspired decisions carry with them are contributing to the unattractiveness of this solution to the entrepreneurial fraternity. Through government requiring a certain percentage of asphalt pavements to contain rubber (like in the United States of America (USA)), rubberised asphalt could be a very useful and viable option to produce. In the USA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently avoided the return to coal in industrial kilns currently using TDF based on its beneficial carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission and cost structures by defining TDF as Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) to existing coal-burning industrial kilns. In South Africa, the usage of TDF should be of interest to Eskom and the cement industry. TDF (produced from <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres),</b> defined as a renewable energy resource due to its proven biomass component and with its high calorific value, presents higher energy output values in comparison to coal and furthermore presents the industry with lower input costs per ton and reduces the CO 2 emission factor. Entrepreneurial intervention involving Eskom and/or the cement industry in South Africa with the utilisation of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres</b> as renewable energy resource is an overdue business opportunity. With more than ten million tyres per year available in South Africa and a stockpile of more than fifty million waste tyres, sustainability of TDF supplies is a reality. TDF is much cheaper per ton than coal and emits approximately 20 percent less CO 2 and/or CO 2 e than low-grade coal to produce the same electricity output. From all the information gathered, it is clear that in countries where coal energy is extensively used, TDF utilisation not only reduces the tyre waste issues, but it also serves as an environmentally-friendly renewable energy resource in electricity production and cement kilns; the industry with some of the highest CO 2 emission risks. The final chapter of this report presents a schedule representing the choice of tyre processing and disposal methods ranked by environmental preference and defining the priorities linked to process and product choice...|$|E
40|$|Cleaned and sorted fibres {{recycled}} from <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres</b> called “Recycled Tyre Steel Fibres” (RTSF) {{can be used}} as concrete reinforcement, but understanding {{their performance}} requires extensive testing work. This paper investigates the flexural performance of various SFRC mixes using RTSF and two types of Manufactured Steel Fibres (MSF). The post-cracking flexural strengths of these mixes are obtained using 3 -point notched prism tests. A simplified equation is proposed to determine the relationship between the post-cracking flexural tensile strength and required SFRC ground-supported slabs thicknesses. It is found that the required slab thicknesses largely depend on f, a single coefficient obtained from the post-cracking flexural strengths of SFRC. In all SFRC mixes, the lowest required slab thickness is obtained when using hybrid fibre reinforcement containing 10 kg/m 3 of RTSF. It is concluded that hybrid fibres using RTSF can be a competitive and environmentally-friendly alternative for industrial concrete flooring applications...|$|E

However, CRs deriving from different sources and processes yield effects on performance under traffic loading and on gaseous emissions produced during laying on site which may change considerably depending upon their physical and chemical properties. In order to quantitatively assess the possible variability of CR characteristics, a wide experimental program was set out in order to analyze samples taken from 14 Italian and 2 foreign ELT processing plants.

40|$|Different {{types of}} fibres {{are often used}} in {{concrete}} to prevent microcracking due to shrinkage, and polypropylene fibres {{are among the most}} often used ones. If not prevented, microcracks can lead to the development of larger cracks as drying shrinkage occurs, enabling penetration of aggressive substances from the environment and reducing durability of concrete structures. The hypothesis of the present research is that polypropylene fibres, used in concrete for controlling formation of microcracks due to shrinkage, can be replaced with recycled polymer fibres obtained from <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres.</b> To test the hypothesis, concrete mixtures containing polypropylene fibres and recycled tyre polymer fibres were prepared and tested. Experimental programme focused on autogenous, free, and restrained shrinkage. It was shown that PP fibres can be substituted with higher amount of recycled tyre polymer fibres obtaining concrete with similar shrinkage behaviour. The results indicate promising possibilities of using recycled tyre polymer fibres in concrete products.

The use of waste tyre shreds as fill material in geotechnical applications can help to mitigate the waste tyre disposal problems. Specifically, when tyre shreds are used as lightweight fill material in the construction of highway embankments, a considerable volume of waste tyres is consumed. With regard to this, an investigation into tyre shreds mixed with sandy soils of South Africa was undertaken to assess the shear strength behaviour of the sand-tyre shred composite and to propose an alternative use of the scrap tyres produced every year...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the heat sink properties of ELT (<b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres)</b> waste. A hazardous waste, ELT or massive scraped tyre waste created environmental load to the local environment. Today, when researchers think of the environmental impacts of tyres, they mostly focus on the management of tyres at the end of their useful lives. From Global perspective it is found that one billion tyres reach the end of their useful lives annually, out of which about four billion ELTs are currently in landfills and as stockpiles worldwide. Study revealed that most of the developing countries currently are not experienced with the disposal method of ELT. Besides, developed countries from Europe, USA, Japan and Singapore have framed specific law or regulation to the disposal of ELT. Recently it is obvious that should find out alternative ways as to reduce the load of massive ELT waste. Furthermore, this study has been designed to manage ELTs massive waste, experimentally.

40|$|Crumb rubber from <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres</b> can be {{employed}} {{in the production of}} asphalt rubber binders by means of the so-called "wet" mixing technology. However, since the physical and chemical interaction between rubber particles and neat binder causes a significant viscosity increase, corresponding bituminous mixtures require higher mixing and compaction temperatures than those of standard mixtures. Such a need leads to the overall increase of energy consumption and to the emission of a greater quantity of fumes during laying operations, thus partially reducing the eco-friendly character of asphalt rubber technology. The problems highlighted above can be in part balanced by making use of viscosity-reduction additives. In the research work described in this paper, the effects of a waxy additive on the flow properties of asphalt rubber were studied by means of viscosity measurements. Tests were carried out by considering both commercial and laboratory-prepared asphalt rubber products. Factors which were analyzed during the experimental investigation included mixing technique, time and temperature. Obtained results suggest that additive efficiency is strongly related with asphalt-rubber mixing time and temperature. When these two parameters are kept constant, a similar viscosity reduction is recorded for both the commercial and laboratory asphalt-rubbe...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{when people}} think of the {{environmental}} impacts of ELTs (<b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres),</b> they mostly focus on the management of tyres {{at the end of their}} useful lives. Globally, an estimated one billion tyres reach the end of their useful lives every year. It is observed from literature that about 4 billion ELTs are currently in landfills and stockpiles worldwide and are disposed to unknown and illegal routes. It is also revealed that most of the countries currently are not experienced with the disposal of ELT with the framing of specific law or regulation to the disposal of ELT management. Hence ELT created a massive waste in management system which intern modified our environment. Recently it is obvious that should find out alternative ways as to reduce the massive ELT waste.

The investigation included monitoring of emissions at the paver's driving seat and at the screed during the laying of gap-and dense-graded wearing course mixtures in three different sites. Laboratory tests were performed by following a fume-generation protocol and by measuring the contents of volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in produced emissions.

40|$|With a {{large amount}} of tyres being {{discarded}} every year, {{the question of how to}} manage the <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres</b> (ELTs) has become a serious issue. Thus this study identifies different driving forces for this management and the most possible scenarios for the future management of ELTs. The study also compares the business as usual model with a waste hierarchy model to explore the possibilities for optimizing management of ELTs through cascading. This study collects opinions about the driving forces of ELT management from 29 experts working in the area. Important driving forces identified were: price of substitute products, recycled materials’ market, environmental legislation, and technology. This study also surveys 23 experts in the tyre area about the most possible scenarios for ELTs in 2020. One of the more believed in futures was: “Due to increasingly limited fossil fuels and a rise of sustainability awareness, applications for ELTs are growing both in material and energy recycling. ” This suggests that a shift toward an equal recycling situation of ELTs among material and energy might be likely to happen by 2020. Based on the most possible scenario for ELTs in 2020, a comparison between waste hierarchy model and business as usual model has been performed. The result shows that the (cascading) waste hierarchy model would likely create more environmental benefits than business as usual model. This is done though the saving and cycling of more materials from energy recovery into material recycling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Waste tyres {{which are}} mainly {{generated}} from automotive industries {{have become a}} major environmental problem to the local authorities, the tyre industries and tyre dealer. When tyres are no longer usable due to worn-out, defect or service failure they are usually dumped in the landfill sites. Pyrolysis {{is a process of}} the thermal decomposition of waste tyres in the absence of air and the oxygen. Pyrolysis may be an environmentally friendly process to transforms used tyres into gas, oil, steel and carbon black waste. The rate of recovery is 45 wt % for fuel, 30 wt % for carbon black and 10 wt % for steel wires for each <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres.</b> In this paper, the potential use of pyrolised carbon black generated from pyrolysis process of waste tyres is investigated. From the physical analysis of this carbon black waste, it was observed that there is various refraction particles sizes from the sieve test and different morphologies gathered from SEM analysis. Moreover, X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and TGA/DTG analysis on the carbon black waste showed high content of inorganic additives such as Silica (Si), Calcium (Ca) and Iron (Fe) which contaminate the sample. The carbon black waste started to decompose at a lower temperature of 480 oC to 680 oC compared to standard black at 500 oC to 740 oC. The test results gathered in this paper will act as a base-line towards alternative material or to replace the commercial carbon black available in the market...|$|E
40|$|Steel fibres used to {{reinforce}} concrete are normally manufactured from new {{high tensile steel}} wire. However, steel of a much higher quality {{is used in the}} manufacture of car and truck tyres and a significant volume of this material is recovered each year when <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres</b> are recycled. Tyre wire is often heavily contaminated with rubber and is usually either landfilled or, if sufficiently clean, sent to the steel mills for re-melting. Processes have now been developed to further clean and screen the recovered steel to enable it to be used as reinforcement in steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC). Whilst tyre steel tends to be of smaller diameter and length than the steel fibres traditionally used in SFRC, research has identified the range of fibre geometries that are effective. Research has also demonstrated that there are benefits to be had from using hybrid blends of standard manufactured fibres and re-used tyre fibres, with the different fibre types and geometries each contributing in different ways to the overall performance of the composite material. In conducting this research problems have been encountered with the manufacture of specimens for the internationally recognised prism test which disadvantage fibres of this type and recommendations are made that address this issue. Tyre steel offers a sustainable option for reinforcing concrete and this paper will demonstrate some significant structural, environmental and economic benefits of using this newly available material...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{examining}} the uniaxial behaviour of concrete materials incorporating rubber particles, obtained from recycled <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres,</b> {{as a replacement}} for mineral aggregates. A detailed account of a set of material tests on rubberised concrete cylindrical samples, in which fine and coarse mineral aggregates are replaced in equal volumes by rubber particles with various sizes, is presented. The experimental results carried out in this investigation, combined with detailed examination of data available from previous tests on rubberised concrete materials, show that the rubber particles influence the mechanical properties {{as a function of the}} quantity and type of the mineral aggregates replaced. Experimental evaluation of the complete stress-strain response depicts reductions in compressive strength, elastic modulus, and crushing strain, with the change in rubber content. Enhancement is also observed in the energy released during crushing as well as in the lateral strain at crushing, primarily due to the intrinsic deformability of the interfacial clamping of rubber particles which leads to higher lateral dilation of the material. The test results and observations enable the definition of a series of expressions to estimate the mechanical properties of rubberised concrete materials. An analytical model is also proposed for the detailed assessment of the complete stress-strain response as a function of the volumetric rubber ratio. Validations performed against the material tests carried out in this study, as well as those from previous investigations on rubberised concrete materials, show that the proposed models offer reliable predictions of the mechanical properties including the full axial and lateral stress-strain response of concrete materials incorporating rubber particles...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} {{and disposal of}} tyres from vehicles has long been of considerable environmental importance. The main problem lies in the mixed composition of the tyres. Studies have been undertaken to modify {{the structure of the}} tyres, especially with reference to the percentage of granulated rubber incorporated, in order to improve their performance, and also to reduce their environmental impact during normal functioning (noise, particulates, etc.) and facilitate recycling and final disposal. The aim of the present study is to review and compare how used tyres are treated and disposed of in two different EU countries. The first is Italy, which {{has been part of the}} European Union since its inception, and has important industrial traditions. The second is Romania, an emerging country which recently became part of the EU, and whose economic and industrial development has had a major boost in recent years, with a strong growth in waste production, together with consumption in urban areas.

40|$|An asphalt {{concrete}} has been modified by adding four polymeric wastes: polyethylene (PE) from micronized containers, polypropylene (PP) from ground caps, polystyrene (PS) from hangers and rubber from <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres</b> (ELT). These polymeric wastes were selected {{according to their}} availability, homogeneity and economic criteria considering the big amount of material required to build a road. The dry method {{has been used to}} modify the bituminous mixture due to its simplicity and the possibility to be carried out in any asphalt plant without important modifications. This is very important in order to spread the process and recycle the polymeric waste in the same place where it is produced, hence improving the environmental impact. The reference asphalt mixture and the four modified {{asphalt concrete}}s have been analysed separately and their performance compared, evaluating their resistance against plastic deformation, stiffness, fatigue resistance and workability. The Master curve and the Black diagram of the mixtures were also calculated. The results showed that the use of polymeric wastes significantly increased the stiffness of the reference mixture in all cases, but especially when PE, PP and ELT were used. However, none of these materials significantly modifies the fatigue behaviour of the reference mixture. Regarding the resistance against plastic deformation, the use of both PE and ELT led to an increase of the resistance, whereas PP did not modify it and PS decreased it. As for workability, the energy of compaction of the modified mixtures did not suffer any important change. Therefore, according to the results obtained, PE, PP and ELT can be used to modify asphalt mixtures since they improve or do not change their properties. On the other hand, PS should be further studied because of the contradictory results obtained, and only when plastic deformation is not a problem this material could be used.

40|$|The worlds {{crude steel}} {{production}} has seen a progressive growth from about 595 million tons in 1970 to 1527 million tons in 2011. This progressive growth, often attributed to the recovery of South East Asia from the economic and financial recession in 1998, {{has been accompanied by}} an equally progressive shift from the BOF to EAF as the mode of production of crude steel. The shift from the BOF to EAF has often been attributed to the latters low capital and operating cost coupled with its flexibility in the use of scrap. Accordingly, the demand for high quality scrap has soared, {{almost to the point of}} being scarce in most steel producing countries, a situation that calls for the development of novel technologies to produce alternative iron materials (AI) to supplement scrap in EAF steelmaking. Such novel technologies must not only be affordable from the economic point of view, they must also be environmentally benign in order to be able to meet the stiff national and international legislations on the environment. Anthracite and metallurgical coke are the conventional materials used for reduction of iron oxides and slag foaming in EAF steelmaking. In order to address the issues of cost, availability and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, alternative carbon sources are required to replace, at least partially, these conventional materials. Postconsumer plastics like polyethylene and <b>end-of-life</b> <b>tyres</b> (ELTs) contain both carbon and hydrogen, which are known reductants for iron oxide reduction. In the present study, the reduction of EAF slags containing FeO by metallurgical coke (Met Coke), high density polyethylene (HDPE), rubber tyre (RT), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and different blends of coke with the three polymers was investigated. The potential feasibility of utilising these polymers as reducing agents along with the kinetics of the reaction forms the central theme. Composite pellets were formed from EAF slags (47. 1 % FeO) and different blends of coke-polymer carbonaceous materials and were heated rapidly under inert environment (1 l/min argon) in a horizontal resistance tube furnace at four different temperatures  1450, 1500, 1550 and 1600 °C. The off gas produced from the reaction was analysed continuously by an infrared gas analyser attached to the system to monitor CO, CO 2 and CH 4 gases produced by the reduction reaction and the results were recorded in a data-logging computer. The rate and extent of reaction were calculated based on a mass balance for oxygen removal from the iron oxide and the content of reduced iron metal was determined by the following chemical analysis methods: 	LECO C/S analysis for its C and S contents and 	LECO Oxygen analyser for its O content. The gas phase interactions showed a reactive coke-polymer carbonaceous blend characterised by an improved generation of gaseous reducing species (H 2, CO, CH 4) in the furnace environment. The CO emissions from metallurgical coke showed lower concentrations in comparison to those from the Coke-polymer blends; however, the CO 2 emissions were generally higher than those of HDPE, RT, Coke-HDPE and Coke-RT blends but lower than PET and Coke-PET blends. At all the temperatures considered under this investigation, an improved rate of chemical reaction is seen when the coke was blended with each of the polymers. Calculated values of activation energies showed a progressive increase from coke as it was blended with the polymers. The relatively low activation energy value observed for coke compared to the blends and the polymers is consistent with less gas evolution and thus less stirring in the slag. Accordingly, mass transfer in the liquid becomes an important rate limiting step. As the proportion of polymer in the blend increases, gas evolution increases leading to increased stirring and foaming and the process shifts towards mixed control in which chemical reaction control becomes important as seen in the trends in the activation energy values. Therefore blending of the coke with the polymers has the effect of decreasing mass transfer effects and promoting the influence of chemical control. The percent reduction, time for complete reduction, level of carburisation and desulphurisation were calculated for each carbonaceous blend and the results were compared with those obtained by reduction of the iron oxide using Met Coke as reductant under the same experimental conditions. It was revealed that the blends, generally, performed better than Met Coke. A significant decrease in direct CO 2 emissions from the reduction process was observed when Met Coke was blended with two of the three polymers utilised for this investigation (HDPE and RT). However, blending of Met Coke with PET resulted in increased levels of CO 2 emissions; this is attributed to the presence of a significant amount of oxygen (33. 3 wt %) in the carbon-hydrogen backbone of the polymer. Consequently, based on direct CO 2 emissions to the environment, HDPE, RT, coke-HDPE and coke-RT blends are better carbonaceous reductants than coke. However, PET and coke-PET blends are not suitable as reductants beyond 10 wt% of PET in the carbonaceous blend...|$|E
