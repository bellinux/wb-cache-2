5000|$|Fenway {{began as}} a {{management}} company and an independent record label, signing and releasing records by artists including Read Yellow, State Radio, Consonant (Mission of Burma bassist Clint Conley’s other band), The <b>Kickovers</b> (the first act to sign, with former Mighty Mighty Bosstones member Nate Albert and ex-Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh), The Love Scene, Longwave, and Unbusted.|$|R
5000|$|In late 2001/2002, Welsh {{returned}} to the Boston music scene by temporarily joining Nate Albert's (guitarist for The Mighty Mighty Bosstones) band, The <b>Kickovers.</b> In an interview, he expressed his distaste for the corporate music process, stating that, [...] "It's actually fun to just be playing in the studio without some major-label idiot standing over your shoulder." ...|$|R
50|$|After Nate {{left the}} Bosstones {{to go to}} Brown University, he started writing songs, which were not like his {{previous}} band. In 2001, he got a band together with Bosstones drummer Joe Sirois, short time Weezer bass player Mikey Welsh and another Boston, MA musician Johnny Rioux. They initially joined under the name The Brakes which they had to change because of a New Jersey band called The Break. That's when they took on the moniker The <b>Kickovers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The album {{includes}} one cover, [...] "Hanging on the Telephone", {{which was}} originally performed by The Nerves, although {{a cover of}} it by Blondie was more popular. [...] "The Good Life" [...] is also {{the name of a}} Weezer song, so some fans may have expected it to be a cover, especially since bassist Mikey Welsh was a member of Weezer prior to The <b>Kickovers.</b> Although not a member, Dave Aarnoff of The Shods performed bass on several tracks of the album.|$|R
50|$|Johnny Rioux is a musician, {{primarily}} {{known for}} playing in {{and working with}} many punk rock bands. He was initially based in Boston but is now based in Texas. He currently plays bass guitar with the Street Dogs, celtic rock band Murder the Stout (along with former Street Dogs guitarist Marcus Hollar) and Street Dogs' americana side project FM359. He has previously played with Roger Miret and the Disasters, The Bruisers and The <b>Kickovers.</b> He has also worked with bands in non-musician roles including as a guitar technician for The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and tour manager for Dropkick Murphys. He has recently started producing, and has so far produced for Flatfoot 56, the Street Dogs and Roger Miret and the Disasters.|$|R
2500|$|Capitalizing on the band's popularity, Mercury {{released}} the band's live album, Live From the Middle East in October 1998. The album was recorded live in Cambridge, Massachusetts at The Middle East Restaurant and Nightclub during the band's annual end-of-the-year Hometown Throwdown from 1997. In 1999, the band contributed their cover {{version of the}} song, [...] "Rudie Can't Fail," [...] to the Burning London Clash tribute compilation. Shortly after all of these releases, Kevin Lenear quit the band {{to work on his}} own material and was replaced by Roman Fleysher. Founding member Nate Albert also left in order to obtain a degree in political theory from Brown University. His next musical venture would be as a member of Evan Dando’s re-formed Lemonheads before forming The <b>Kickovers,</b> which focused more on a 1970's punk sound than ska. Albert eventually became involved in band management, handling bands such as Bayside and Lost City Angels. Albert's replacement on guitar was Lawrence Katz.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{music videos}} {{produced}} for the single. The first video {{was the original}} music video, which was directed by Liz Friedlander. The video starts with Morissette, on dreadlocks, handstanding on her apartment. She puts on her white jacket, escapes the room through the fire escape and carelessly crosses the street, causing a huge crash involving multiple cars, erupting a riot in the process. Morissette ignores the riot, even walks {{on top of the}} cars that get in her way. After passing by a fire truck, Morissette arrives at an indoor basketball arena on a horse where she, now in a red jacket, successfully throws a ball passed to her to the ring. Morissette then exits the arena to the street where she does backflips and backbend <b>kickovers</b> through it. By the time she finishes, she's worn a grey jacket now. She randomly kisses a man on the same street, and then runs to an unfinished bridge, this time wearing a green jacket. She jumps from the ledge and lands wearing a blue jacket, and soon engages in a pie fight with a group of people, including her touring drummer Taylor Hawkins. Suddenly Morissette emerges to a boxing ring, with a black jacket and boxing gloves, faces off a woman in complete boxing gear. The woman punches her in the face, making Morissette falls to the ground. Morissette exits the ring, still on her black jacket, to the exit in the distance as the video ends. The video was shot on February 11, 1996 in New York's meat packing district. Filming took 23 hours in 10° weather. The version was released worldwide, online and televised. It features the Original World Trade Center's Twin Towers in a scene where Morissette did tumbling.|$|R
