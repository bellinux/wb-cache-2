50|$|The actual {{product of}} a bottle of <b>fragrance</b> is its bottle, {{chemical}} ingredients {{and the color of}} the <b>fragrance.</b> However, customers do not get attracted by these actual products (except the bottle of the <b>fragrance).</b> Why they become attracted to <b>fragrance</b> is because they want to smell beautiful and refreshing, be more attractive and noticeable. And so these factors are the core product of <b>fragrance.</b> Each <b>fragrance</b> brands putting on advertisements would not be selling its chemical ingredients because customers would have no idea what those ingredients are, but in fact they focus on the core product of <b>fragrance</b> and advertises {{it in a way that}} customers become appealed to it, such as giving out free samples.|$|R

5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, <b>fragrances,</b> calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E
