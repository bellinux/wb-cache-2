500|$|Dylan {{made two}} {{important}} career moves in August 1962: he legally {{changed his name}} to Robert Dylan, and he signed a management contract with Albert Grossman. (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver $10,000 to become sole manager.) Grossman remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty. Dylan said, [...] "He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker <b>figure...</b> <b>you</b> could smell him coming." [...] Tensions between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond's being replaced as producer of Dylan's second album by the young African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they <b>figure</b> <b>you</b> know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{professional}} literary critics, {{most prominent}} Russian {{writers of the}} time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoyevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaring War and Peace the masterpiece of the Russian literature. Ivan Goncharov in a July 17, 1878 letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating into Danish War and Peace, adding: [...] "This is positively {{what might be called}} a Russian Iliad. Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever. In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosen Anna Karenina to start with, Goncharov insisted: [...] "War and Peace is the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history's glorious epoch when whatever <b>figure</b> <b>you</b> take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [...] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life." [...] In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy's works have now been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance of War and Peace. [...] "Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here [...] ", he remarked.|$|E
