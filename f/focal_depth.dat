5|$|The {{magnitude}} 6.3 ML earthquake occurred inland on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST, (02:20 UTC) at {{a shallow}} depth of 6.0km (4mi), about 10km (6mi) to the east-southeast of Christchurch, New Zealand. Owing to {{the interaction of}} the major Pacific and Australia Plates, much of the regional plate boundary along central South Island is characterised by land deformation. The earthquake was a direct result of strike-slip faulting at the eastern end of the rupture zone of another strong magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake, which occurred on 22 February 2011 along the Port Hills Fault. The June earthquake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor with a similar focal mechanism that struck 1 hour and 20 minutes earlier. Experts believe the quakes were triggered by a previously undiscovered fault in the region, located several kilometres south of the Port Hills Fault. The United States Geological Survey reported a magnitude of 6.0 Mw and a <b>focal</b> <b>depth</b> of 9km (5.6mi) for the earthquake, while the precursor tremor was assigned a magnitude of 5.2 Mw at a similar depth.|$|E

25|$|The October 2010 {{earthquake}} {{is thought}} to have been a result of thrust faulting along or near the plate interface from the calculated focal mechanism and the <b>focal</b> <b>depth.</b> According to seismic hazard potentials and deformation features, the Sunda Trench can be divided into several segments. The southern segment lies to the south of Siberut Island. The rupture area of this earthquake is situated within the southern segment, where historical earthquakes include the earthquake of 1797 and the Mw ~ 9.0 1833 Sumatra earthquake.|$|E
30|$|We also {{examined}} the absolute accuracy of relocated hypocenters by comparing our results with JMA hypocen-ters. We calculated {{the differences between}} the epicenters estimated using MJHD-GS (in which we used only JMA data, as in Section 3.1) and those using JMA (i.e., MJHD-GS minus JMA) for the 30 earthquakes shown in Fig. 3 (a). The average differences and their standard deviations are − 0.004 °± 0.040 ° for latitudes, 0.018 °± 0.032 ° for longitudes, and − 1.80 km ± 13.35 km for <b>focal</b> <b>depths,</b> and there is no significant bias. Furthermore, we examined the absolute accuracy of <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> by comparing our result with that of Kayano (1968), who made temporary observations of aftershocks. According to Kayano (1968), earthquakes during June 23 and 30 were concentrated between 5 and 20 km depth. Although hypocenters from the JMA and Ku-sano and Hamada (1991) were scattered from 0 to 40 km <b>depth,</b> <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> of almost all earthquakes were relocated to depths shallower than 25 km using the MJHD-GS method in this study, and are similar to the <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> determined by Kayano (1968).|$|R

Initially estimated at a magnitude of 7.4, the tremor was felt in several areas near the east coast of Honshu as an aftershock of the 11 March magnitude9.0 megathrust Tōhoku earthquake. The aftershock sequence of this event is ongoing since 11March, and includes over 58 earthquakes of magnitude6.0 or greater up until 7April 2011, with only two others of magnitude7.0 or greater.|$|E

To {{the east}} of the epicentre, the oceanic Pacific Plate is subducted beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate, on which much of Honshu's Tōhoku region is situated.

This intraplate earthquake occurred in the vicinity of the Idosawa Fault [...] a shallow crustal fault in the Hamadōri region near Tabito town, Iwaki city, that had previously been inactive.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{we could}} easily {{identify}} 3 seismic activities at different <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> {{according to the}} PUM model. Although by using Solutions 2, 4, 8, and 10, some earthquakes {{have been found to}} occur during the low-seismicity periods, we suppose that this inconsistency was caused by errors in their <b>focal</b> <b>depths.</b> In the PUM model, the number of inconsistent events is greater for 7.0 ≤ M < 7.3 earthquakes than for M ≥ 7.3 earthquakes. This inconsistency can be attributed to lack of availability of sufficient intensity data on small earthquakes resulting in the introduction of errors in the estimated focal depths; further, the estimated errors in <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> are large in the case of small earthquakes than those in the case of large earthquakes. However, since stress is accumulated and released in a constant manner in seismic regions, it can be considered that almost all M 7 earthquakes occur as predicted by the PUM model. This is consistent with the fact that all M 7 earthquakes predicted by the model have occurred as shown in Fig. 9, with in a maximum depth error of 50 km.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{research}} on optimal flange focal distance settings, {{it is currently}} considered better for flange focal distance to be set to somewhere within the film's emulsion layer, {{rather than on the}} surface of it. Therefore, the nominal flange <b>focal</b> <b>depth</b> will be equivalent to the distance to the groundglass, whereas the actual flange <b>focal</b> <b>depth</b> to the aperture plate will in fact be ~0.02 mm less.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> of locally recorded earthquakes are more di±cult to determine with con¯dence than epicentral coordinates. Thus, in general, {{the large majority}} of routinely determined <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> are not reliable, and tectonically relevant interpretations should be based only on data sets that meet suitable quality criteria.

40|$|Detailed seismic {{monitoring}} of the Hebgen Lake-western Yellowstone Park region of Wyoming and Montana has delineated a zone of earthquakes extending 80 km in a direction N 80 øW from the northwest edge of the Yellowstone calderas to the Madison Valley.

40|$|A {{worldwide}} {{compilation of}} well-constrained fault ruptures and <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> of earthquakes {{reveals that the}} Earth’s crust in many stable continental regions (SCRs) {{is characterized by a}} bimodal depth distribution with a very shallow upper crustal compo-nent. The distributions can vary in a) depth of the modes and b) strength of bimodality, probably due to intracrustal boundaries, differences in frictional and rheological properties, heat-flow den-sities, strain-rates, and tectonic forces or forces stemming from the surface. Overall, SCR ruptures and SCR earthquakes are con-fined within the upper third (0 – 10 km) and/or the lower third of the crust (20 – 35 km), while the midcrust (10 – 20 km) tends to be aseismic. Historical data indicate that some SCRs show very well-developed bimodal distributions of <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> (e. g., North Alpine foreland basin in Europe, Kachchh basin in India), while others show weak to no developed bimodal distributions (e. g., Charlevoix seismic zone, New Madrid seismic zone in the cen-tral United States). Moreover, many large SCR earthquakes (Mw 4. 5 – 8. 0) nucleate on reverse faults and close to the surface (< 5 km). Almost 80 % of the seismic moment density of shallow SCR ruptures is released in the uppermost 7 km of the crust. However, <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> of instrumentally recorded major SCR earthquakes (3. 5 < mb < 6. 2) and their aftershocks in the northeastern United States and adjacent Canada, for example, suggest systematic over-estimates of hypocentral depths of 88 ± 30 % (standard mean ± standard mean error), probably due to sparse instrumental cover-age. If error estimates for shallow SCR earthquakes, in particu-lar, are of systematic and not of statistical origin, preconceived assumptions of <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> within the midcrust might have region-specific implications for understanding SCR seismogen-esis and for earthquake hazard estimations (e. g., ground motion) ...|$|R

50|$|In seismology, {{the depth}} of focus or <b>focal</b> <b>depth</b> refers to the depth at which an {{earthquake}} occurs.

The earthquake mechanisms fall into four groups: (a) normal faults with a N-S strike in the over-riding material above the subduction zone; (b) low-angle thrusts with an E-W strike at a depth of about 40 km; (c) high-angle reverse faults with the same strike but shallower <b>focal</b> <b>depths</b> than (b); (d) events within the suducting lithosphere with approximately E-W P axes.
