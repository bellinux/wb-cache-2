5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
500|$|After {{the start}} of his {{management}} career, Epstein started taking stimulants, usually Preludin, which did not require a prescription at the time. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr had also taken it since their days in Hamburg. Epstein explained his use of the drug as the only means of staying awake at night during numerous concert tours. In 1964, Peter Brown suspected that Epstein was taking too many pills, as he would often cough at parties, which Brown realised was Epstein's way of secretly putting pills into his mouth without anyone noticing. McCartney often met Epstein at late night clubs in London, and remembered that Epstein would often grind <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> (possibly due to bruxism), once saying to him, [...] "Ugghhh, the pills". Epstein also developed dependencies on the drug carbromal, a barbiturate-like sedative/hypnotic drug.|$|E
500|$|The völva {{says that}} the god Hœnir chooses wooden slips for divination, and that the sons of two {{brothers}} will widely inhabit the windy world. She sees a hall thatched with gold in Gimlé, where nobility will live and spend their lives pleasurably. Stanzas 65, found in the Hauksbók version of the poem, refers to a [...] "powerful, mighty one" [...] that [...] "rules over everything" [...] and who will arrive from above at the court of the gods (Old Norse regindómr), which has been interpreted as a Christian addition to the poem. In stanza 66, the völva ends her account {{with a description of}} the dragon Níðhöggr, corpses in <b>his</b> <b>jaws,</b> flying through the air. The völva then [...] "sinks down." [...] It is unclear if stanza 66 indicates that the völva is referring to the present time or if this is an element of the post-Ragnarök world.|$|E

500|$|Pliny the Elder {{discusses}} beetles in his Natural History, {{describing the}} stag beetle: [...] "Some insects, {{for the preservation}} of their wings, are covered with a erust (elytra) – the beetle, for instance, the wing of which is peculiarly fine and frail. To these insects a sting has been denied by Nature; but in one large kind we find horns of a remarkable length, two-pronged at the extremities, and forming pincers, which the animal closes when it is its intention to bite." [...] The stag beetle is recorded in a Greek myth by Nicander and recalled by Antoninus Liberalis in which Cerambus is turned into a beetle: [...] "He can be seen on trunks and has hook-teeth, ever moving <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> together. He is black, long and has hard wings like a great dung beetle". The story concludes with the comment that the beetles were used as toys by young boys, and that the head was removed and worn as a pendant.|$|E
500|$|With this statement, {{all of the}} Æsir look to one another, finding {{themselves}} in a dilemma. Everyone refused to place their hand in Fenrir's mouth until Týr put out {{his right hand and}} placed it into the wolf's jaws. When Fenrir kicked, Gleipnir caught tightly, and the more Fenrir struggled, the stronger the band grew. At this, everyone laughed, except Týr, who there lost his right hand. When the gods knew that Fenrir was fully bound, they took a cord called Gelgja (Old Norse [...] "fetter") hanging from Gleipnir, inserted the cord through a large stone slab called Gjöll (Old Norse [...] "scream"), and the gods fastened the stone slab deep into the ground. After, the gods took a great rock called Thviti (Old Norse [...] "hitter, batterer"), and thrust it even further into the ground as an anchoring peg. Fenrir reacted violently; he opened <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> very wide, and tried to bite the gods.|$|E
500|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males splash their urine on their tails and nether regions. To attract females they extrude their soft palate – a trait {{unique to the}} dromedary. As the male gurgles, copious quantities of saliva turns to foam and covers the mouth. Males threaten each other for dominance over the female by trying to stand taller than the other, making low noises {{and a series of}} head movements including lowering, lifting and bending their necks backwards. Males tries to defeat other males by biting the opponent's [...] legs and taking the head between <b>his</b> <b>jaws.</b> Copulation begins with foreplay; the male smells the female's genitalia and often bites her there or around her hump. The male forces the female to sit, then grasps her with his forelegs. Camelmen often aid the male insert his penis into the female's vulva. The male dromedary's [...] ability to penetrate the female on his own is disputed, though feral populations in Australia reproduce naturally. Copulation takes from 7 to 35 minutes, averaging 11 to 15 minutes. Normally, three to four ejaculations occur. The semen of a Bikaneri dromedary is white and viscous, with a pH of around 7.8.|$|E

500|$|Despite his unusual diet, Tarrare was {{slim and}} of average height. At {{the age of}} 17, he weighed only [...] (...) [...] He was {{described}} as having unusually soft fair hair and an abnormally wide mouth, in which his teeth were heavily stained and on which the lips were almost invisible. When he had not eaten, his skin would hang so loosely that he could wrap the fold of skin from his abdomen around his waist. When full, his abdomen would distend [...] "like a huge balloon". The skin of his cheeks was wrinkled and hung loosely, and when stretched out, he could hold twelve eggs or apples in his mouth. His body was hot to the touch and he sweated heavily, constantly suffering from foul body odour; he was described as stinking [...] "to {{such a degree that}} he could not be endured within the distance of twenty paces". This smell would get noticeably worse after he had eaten; his eyes and cheeks would become bloodshot, a visible vapour would rise from his body, and he would become lethargic, during which time he would belch noisily and <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> would make swallowing motions. He suffered from chronic diarrhoea, which was said to be [...] "fetid beyond all conception". Despite his large intake of food, he did not appear either to vomit excessively or to gain weight. Aside from his eating habits, his contemporaries saw no apparent signs of mental illness or unusual behaviour in him, other than an apparently apathetic temperament with [...] "a complete lack of force and ideas".|$|E
2500|$|Another legend {{from the}} Fioretti tells {{that in the}} city of Gubbio, where Francis lived for some time, was a wolf [...] "terrifying and ferocious, who devoured men as well as animals". Francis had {{compassion}} upon the townsfolk, and so he went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon, fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, though the saint pressed on. When he found the wolf, he made {{the sign of the cross}} and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> and lay down at Francis' feet.|$|E
2500|$|Norse mythology {{prominently}} {{includes three}} malevolent wolves, in particular: the giant Fenrisulfr or Fenrir, eldest child of Loki and Angrboda who was feared and hated by the Æsir, and Fenrisulfr's children, Sköll and Hati. Fenrir is {{bound by the}} gods, but is ultimately destined to grow too large for his bonds and devour Odin {{during the course of}} Ragnarök. At that time, he will have grown so large that his upper jaw touches the sky while his lower touches the earth when he gapes. He will be slain by Odin's son, Viðarr, who will either stab him in the heart or rip <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> asunder according to different accounts. Fenrir's two offspring will according to legend, devour the sun and moon at Ragnarök. On the other hand, however, the wolves Geri and Freki were the Norse god Odin's faithful pets who were reputed to be [...] "of good omen." ...|$|E

2500|$|The actual {{circumstances}} of Korolev's death remain somewhat uncertain. In December 1965, he was supposedly {{diagnosed with a}} bleeding polyp in his large intestine. He entered the hospital on 5 January 1966 for somewhat routine surgery, but died nine days later. It was stated by the government that he had {{what turned out to}} be a large, cancerous tumor in his abdomen, but Glushko later reported that he actually died due to a poorly performed operation for hemorrhoids. Another version states that the operation was going well and no one was predicting any complications. Suddenly, during the operation, Korolev started to bleed. Doctors tried to provide intubation to allow him to breathe freely, but <b>his</b> <b>jaws,</b> injured during his time in a gulag, had not healed properly and impeded the installation of the breathing tube. Korolev died without regaining consciousness. According to Harford, Korolev's family confirmed the cancer story. [...] His weak heart contributed to his death during surgery.|$|E
2500|$|At 2 AM on March 3, 1896, Moore is {{awakened by}} one of Kreizler's {{servants}} banging incessantly on his door. Stevie, a young boy whom Kreizler had saved from being institutionalized and who is dedicated to Kreizler, brings Moore {{to the scene of}} a crime that Kreizler wants Moore to see. Roosevelt, the police commissioner, is already at the scene. When Moore sees the nature of the brutal murder, he is appalled. The victim, Georgio [...] "Gloria" [...] Santorelli, is a 13-year-old boy who prostituted himself by dressing up as a girl; the boy's wrists are tied behind his back, and he is kneeling with his face pressed on the steel walkway where he was found. Though makeup paint and powder on his face are still intact, his eyes are gouged out, his right hand is chopped off, his genitals are cut off and stuffed between <b>his</b> <b>jaws,</b> he has huge gashes across his entire body, his throat has been slashed, and his buttocks are [...] "shorn off". The policeman at the scene, Detective Sergeant Connor, makes it clear that murders of such victims are usually ignored.|$|E
2500|$|However, legends {{surrounding}} Saint Francis of Assisi {{show him}} befriending a wolf. According to the Fioretti, {{the city of}} Gubbio was besieged by the Wolf of Gubbio, which devoured both livestock and men. Francis of Assisi, who was living in Gubbio at the time took pity on the townsfolk, and went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, but the saint pressed on and when he found the wolf he {{made the sign of}} the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed <b>his</b> <b>jaws</b> and lay down at the feet of St. Francis. [...] "Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil ..." [...] said Francis. [...] "All these people accuse you and curse you… But brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people." [...] Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens he made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had [...] "done evil out of hunger" [...] the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly, and in return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner Gubbio was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis, ever the lover of animals, even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} how {{foreseeability}} {{does not apply to}} the extent of an injury is the eggshell skull rule. [...] If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is foreseeable that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will {{need to go to the}} hospital for. [...] However, if <b>his</b> <b>jaw</b> is very weak, and <b>his</b> <b>jaw</b> comes completely off from my punch, then the doctor bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring <b>his</b> <b>jaw</b> shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment. [...] Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable.|$|R
