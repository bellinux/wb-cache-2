The ultimate design is for a freeway or expressway-standard road, but with staged construction initially providing a dual carriageway.|$|E

Based on Scott McPherson's {{screenplay}} adaptation {{of his own}} 1991 stage play of the same name, the film revolves around two sisters, played by Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton, who are reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement. DiCaprio portrayed Hank, Streep's character's troubled son, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> to a mental asylum for setting fire to his mother's house.|$|E
5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed.</b> If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E

5|$|Once {{construction}} on Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway, which runs from 105th Street to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, is completed, {{it is expected}} that construction will then take place on Phase 3. Phase 3 would extend the Second Avenue Subway south from the provisions for the line to continue further south on Second Avenue. The tracks would diverge from the tracks that continue to the BMT 63rd Street Line running south on Second Avenue. There is currently a large provisional cavern, or bellmouth, for this line. The line would continue down Second Avenue to Houston Street, where the third phase would end. However, no funding <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> to this phase. After Phase 3, a new T service will operate from 125th Street to Houston Street.|$|E

25|$|Police {{firmly believe}} the Wests were {{responsible}} for further unsolved murders and disappearances. Ten murders <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> between 1971 and 1979—at least seven of which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> for sexual purposes. Following the rash of murders between 1973 and 1975, Fred and Rose are not known to have committed any murders until 1978. One further murder <b>was</b> <b>committed</b> in 1979, followed by an eight-year lull until the murder of their own daughter in 1987. No further murders <b>are</b> known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> before their 1994 arrest. Throughout his formal questioning, Fred confessed to murdering up to 30 people, thus indicating up to 18 additional, undiscovered victims.|$|R
25|$|According to Farea Al-Muslim, direct {{war crimes}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> during the conflict; for example, an IDP camp {{was hit by}} a Saudi airstrike, while Houthis have {{sometimes}} prevented aid workers from giving aid. The UN and several major human rights groups discussed the possibility that war crimes may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> by Saudi Arabia during the air campaign.|$|R

25|$|After a crime <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed,</b> tactics such as {{cocooning}} {{have been}} shown to dramatically reduce the incidence of repeat offences. Cocooning involves notifying neighbours in the street that a break and enter has occurred, thereby encouraging a form of natural surveillance. Studies show this may decrease the rate of property crime by up to 50% in the local area.|$|E
25|$|In 1959 Hahn co-founded in Berlin the Federation of German Scientists (VDW), a {{non-governmental}} organization, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> to {{the ideal}} of responsible science. The members of the Federation feel committed to taking into consideration the possible military, political, and economical implications and possibilities of atomic misuse when carrying out their scientific research and teaching. With the results of its interdisciplinary work the 'VDW' not only addresses the general public, but also the decision-makers {{at all levels of}} politics and society.|$|E
25|$|The Moplah {{rebellion}} witnessed many cruel {{attacks on}} Hindus, and the British officers. The Madras High Court, which adjudicated {{in this matter}} had passed judgements {{on each of the}} cases against the various Moplah rioters who were captured. The nature of crimes committed, need scrutiny from people, and so <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> to this article for the world to see and reflect. The nature of crimes was so macabre, that even the writer of the book is confounded that even fanaticism cannot answer such brutality.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there is}} still no {{certainty}} as to how judges will apply their powers of judicial review when an error of material fact <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed.</b> Fong Thin Choo was decided in 1991, prior to the UK case E v. Home Secretary. Hence, it still {{remains to be seen if}} the courts in Singapore will adopt the four requirements that were laid down in E v. Home Secretary. One view is that there is little reason for the courts to reject these requirements, given that Fong Thin Choo cited Tameside with approval, and E v. Home Secretary was based upon this case.|$|E
25|$|After Confederation, and amid much controversy, a {{full-fledged}} Canadian military was created. Canada, however, remained a British dominion, and Canadian forces joined their British {{counterparts in the}} Second Boer War and the First World War. While independence followed the Statute of Westminster, Canada's links to Britain remained strong, and the British once again {{had the support of}} Canadians during the Second World War. Since then, Canada <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> to multilateralism and has gone to war within large multinational coalitions such as in the Korean War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, and the Afghan war. Canada has also {{played an important role in}} United Nations peacekeeping operations worldwide and has cumulatively committed more troops than any other country.|$|E
25|$|After the Ottoman conquest, it {{was turned}} into a mosque in the early 1460s. On 26 September 1687, an Ottoman {{ammunition}} dump inside the building was ignited by Venetian bombardment. The resulting explosion severely damaged the Parthenon and its sculptures. From 1800 to 1803, Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin removed some of the surviving sculptures with the alleged permission of the Ottoman Empire. These sculptures, now known as the Elgin Marbles or the Parthenon Marbles, were sold in 1816 to the British Museum in London, where they are now displayed. Since 1983 (on the initiative of Culture Minister Melina Mercouri), the Greek government <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> to the return of the sculptures to Greece.|$|E

25|$|If {{the victim}} is a minor, consent must come from a parent or {{guardian}}. However, if the legal parent or guardian is absent, unconscious, delusional or intoxicated, consent is implied. A responder {{is not required to}} withhold life-saving treatment (e.g., CPR or the Heimlich maneuver) from a minor if the parent or guardian will not consent. The parent or guardian is then considered neglecting, and consent for treatment is implied by default because neglect <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed.</b> Special circumstances may exist if child abuse is suspected (the courts will usually give immunity to those first responders who report what they reasonably consider to be evidence of child abuse or neglect, similar to that given to those who have an actual duty to report such abuse, such as teachers or counsellors).|$|E
25|$|Justifications for harsher punishments for {{hate crimes}} {{focus on the}} notion that hate crimes cause greater {{individual}} and societal harm. It is said that, when the core of a person’s identity is attacked, the degradation and dehumanization is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the disempowerment of a group of people. Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed.</b> The riots in Los Angeles, California that followed the beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist, by a group of White police officers are cited as support for this argument. The beating of white truck driver Reginald Denny by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.|$|E
25|$|Pippa {{has been}} put to bed with a {{sleeping}} draught. Clarissa {{has set up a}} card table for bridge when her three guests arrive back, summoned by a phone call from her. She asks them to move the body to Costello's car which she knows is parked some distance from the house to a local wood. Their alibi will be the bridge game for which she has set up the cards with false scores to indicate the progress of some time having elapsed. She tells them that her motive is Henry's diplomatic visit. The three somewhat incredulous men fall in uneasily with her plan but only after Sir Rowland has been told by Clarissa of Pippa's supposed involvement. Wearing gloves supplied by Clarissa, they manage to move the body back into the recess, with the intention of moving him later, but are interrupted when the police unexpectedly arrive. Inspector Lord is there following a mysterious phone call to the station telling them that a murder <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> at the house.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} hours after Fiona enacted her curse {{on the entire}} town that engulfed {{everyone}} after the wedding. However, Henry, who is spared, thanks to being the Author and having the Heart of the Truest Believer, wakes up with the Storybook in his hands, and starts searching for his family. After running into Archie, he tells Henry that Emma is at the hospital, where she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>committed</b> to a psychiatric ward {{for the past two}} years. While visiting Emma, he learns that with Fiona's Curse, Regina's original curse was never broken, and Emma had stopped believing him. He asks her where Snow, Hook and David are, but the new Curse now has Emma believing that these events never happened, citing that she has made so much progress and can’t go back, then tells Henry to stop telling her about these stories. Suddenly Fiona (who is now the Mayor and Henry's mother) arrives and takes the book from Henry, but before he leaves he whispers in Emma's ear to tell her to resist, as the Final Battle is coming.|$|E
