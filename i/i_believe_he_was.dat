500|$|Roger Ebert gave {{a largely}} {{positive}} review, stating that, [...] "Kevin Spacey believes {{he was born}} to play Bobby Darin. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born to play more interesting characters... In his own best work, Spacey has achieved genius; he is better as an actor than Darin ever was as a singer." [...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt that [...] "with Beyond the Sea, Spacey crawls back from his doomed quest to be a Tom Hanks-like everyman to his niche on the underbelly of Hollywood's pantheon. The movie's a mess, and at 45, Spacey is far too old to play Darin. Yet the star captures his desperation, his braggadocio, and yes, his magnetism." [...] Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, believed Spacey could not prevent [...] "the movie from groaning {{under the weight of}} biopic clichés. But the actor forges a bond with his subject that rights all wrongs. Doing his own singing (an uncanny imitation), Spacey is a marvel." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming began {{during the}} second week of August 1967. Three {{temporary}} sets and a portion of corridor were constructed for specific use in this episode, which included the large trading post set. The chairs in that set were a problem, as the set designers wanted 24 matching chairs and decided that folding ones would not do. John M. Dwyer sourced them from a local company, but the numbers required meant that they had to be pulled out of showrooms from all over the county. When it came to the fight scene in the episode, Dwyer warned director Joseph Pevney not to damage the chairs. That scene was filmed twice after a cameraman with a handheld camera wandered onto the set. The scene where Kirk is covered with tribbles in the grain container needed to be filmed eight times, using all five hundred sewn tribbles. Gerrold had expected that scene to be cut at some point during production, as he thought that William Shatner would not agree to it. He said that Shatner was the [...] "consummate professional and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> eager to show off his comic abilities".|$|E
2500|$|As {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of the lawsuit, the Move fired Secunda and hired Don Arden, who had himself recently been fired as manager of the Small Faces. In a 2000 interview, Wayne noted that there had always been a major split within the group about Secunda's tactics: [...] " [...] had the animals who would do {{what he wanted to do}} in Trevor, Ace, and me — the fiery part of the stage act. I think Roy would obviously qualify this himself, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> slightly embarrassed by the image and the stunts — but the rest of us weren't ... We were always willing to be Secunda puppets".|$|E

He was a great person, {{one of the few}} that I find was really true to himself. He {{was one of the few}} riders who I really admired for his honesty and his frankness. We talked about a lot of {{different}} things outside of cycling and I was fortunate to really get to know him when my career stopped. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> also one of the generation that was cut short in the early nineties because he was not able to fulfill the rest of his career. But he was a great rider." ...|$|E
2500|$|On fight night, {{in front}} of a 6,513 crowd, Hopkins lost to Smith via TKO when he was knocked out of the ring in the 8th round and failed to make it back into the ring as referee Jack Reiss made a 20 count. Smith Jr. seemed to {{struggle}} through the first seven rounds with the boxing skills of Hopkins, although he was ahead on two judges' scorecards at the time of stoppage. In the 8th round, Smith caught Hopkins in the corner and landed five shots to the head that knocked him out of the ring. Hopkins said he was hurt and couldn't get back in the ring. He insisted that he had been pushed out of the ring, but replays showed it was not a push. Hopkins said to HBO in the post fight interview, [...] "He shoved me out of the ring. My ankle got twist when I fell out of the ring. I couldn't stand on my feet. If I wouldn't have been pushed out of the ring, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> starting to fade... I can't believe they gave him a TKO. They can call it a no contest but not a loss. The momentum from his body pushed me. I went out like a soldier. I'm not in a denial." [...] Hopkins sat down with HBO's Max Kellerman in the locker room after the fight and confirmed this would be his final fight. Smith Jr. retained his WBC International light heavyweight title. Hopkins' reported purse was $800,000, compared to Smith's $140,000. According to RingTV, the fight averaged 934,000 viewers, peaking at 1.035m on HBO.|$|E
