40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} model {{of international trade}} pricing in which individual exporters and importers bargain over the transaction price and exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. We find that the choice of price and <b>invoicing</b> <b>currency</b> reflects the full market structure, including the extent of fragmentation {{and the degree of}} heterogeneity across importers and across exporters. Our study shows that a party has a higher effective bargaining weight when it is large or more risk tolerant. A higher effective bargaining weight of importers relative to exporters in turn translates into lower import prices and greater exchange rate pass-through into import prices. We show the range of price and invoicing outcomes that arise under alternative market structures.

The choice of the <b>invoice</b> <b>currency</b> originates in a situation in which each trader takes into account the other party's bargaining power.

40|$|Growing {{concern that}} a dollar peg exposes East Asian economies to {{fluctuations}} in the dollar-yen exchange rate has stimulated research on currency basket regimes as alternatives for these economies. However, existing studies have mostly ignored an important characteristic of East Asia, i. e., most of its international trade is invoiced in the U. S. dollars. This paper investigates how the preponderance of dollar <b>invoicing</b> affects optimal <b>currency</b> basket regimes for East Asian economies. I develop a three-country center-periphery sticky-price dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for the analysis. The model is solved numerically by taking second-order approximations to the policy functions with the expected lifetime utility of households chosen as the welfare criterion. Contrary to the conjecture of existing literature, I show that predominance of dollar invoicing implies that the dollar should receive a smaller weight than suggested by bilateral trade shares between emerging markets in East Asia and the United States.

40|$|Although <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> in {{international}} trade transactions {{is central to the}} transmission of monetary policy, the forces motivating the choice of currency have long been debated. We introduce a model wherein agents involved {{in international}} trade can invoice in the exporter's currency, the importer's currency, or a third-country vehicle currency. The model is designed to contrast the contribution of macroeconomic variability with that of industry-specific features in the selection of an <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> We show that producers in industries with high demand elasticities are more likely than producers in other industries to display herding in their choice of currency. This industry-related force is more influential than local macroeconomic performance in determining producers' choices. Drawing on data on <b>invoice</b> <b>currency</b> use in exports and imports for twenty-four countries, we document that the dollar is the currency of choice for most transactions involving the United States. The dollar is also extensively used as a vehicle currency {{in international trade}} flows that do not directly involve the United States. Consistent with the results of our model, this last finding is largely attributable to international trade in reference-priced and organized-exchange traded goods. Although the magnitude of business-cycle volatility matters for invoicing of more differentiated products, it is less central for invoicing nondifferentiated goods. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the firm-level pricing behavior of Japanese exports to present new evidence and determinants of an <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> We interviewed twenty-three major Japanese exporting firms {{to collect information}} on their <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> behavior and also on their explicit policy/strategy for choosing an <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> New findings in the destination breakdown of the share of <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> are presented in four major exporting industries: automobile, electric machinery, general machinery and electronic component industries. We also propose six possible determinants of <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> in Japanese exports: (i) intra- or inter-firm trade; (ii) cost of exchange rate hedging; (iii) the degree of market competition and differentiation of exporting products; (iv) the share of exporting products customarily traded in U. S. dollars; (v) exports from an Asian production base to the U. S. market; (vi) explicit policy of choosing a specific <b>currency</b> for <b>invoicing.</b> By constructing a firm-level dataset obtained from annual securities and financial reports of each sample firm, we conduct both cross-section OLS and probit estimation to empirically examine the determinants of <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> at a firm-level export. Our novel findings are three-fold. First, importers' <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> is prevalent in Japanese exports to developed countries. Since most exports of sample firms are destined for local subsidiaries that face severe competition in the local markets, Japanese parent firms have a strong tendency to take on exchange rate risk by invoicing in the importer's currency, {{which is consistent with}} the pricing-to-market (PTM) behavior discussed in the literature. Second, a large share of exports of electronics products that are customarily invoiced in U. S. dollars promotes U. S. -dollar invoicing even in exports to non-U. S. markets. Third, although Japanese firms have shifted their production bases to Asian countries, exports from these Asian bases tend to be invoiced in U. S. dollars as long as the final destination market is the United States. Given that U. S. -dollar invoicing is prevalent in Asia, both Japanese and Asian firms take exchange rate risks against the U. S. dollar. Establishing a common currency basket in Asia is worth considering to mitigate the exchange rate risk for both Japanese and Asian firms. ...|$|R

Dynamic error correction models are formulated to capture the long-run relationship between exchange rate pass-through elasticities and the different currency invoicing strategies. Exchange rate pass-through coefficients vary from 0. 07 to 0. 98 across products. Moreover, for a given product, pass-through coefficients vary significantly both across and within destination markets, depending upon the <b>invoicing</b> <b>currency</b> chosen.

40|$|The recent sharp {{appreciation}} of the Canadian dollar vs. the US dollar poses difficulties for the Canadian economy and reignites the debate as to whether Canada should fix the Canadian dollar to the US dollar by implementing a unilateral peg or forming a monetary union.

This comparison generates two insights about the exchange rate regime of Canada. First, the vertical trade makes it more difficult for a flexible exchange rate to balance the Canadian economy by adjusting relative prices. The higher degree of economic integration resulting from the vertical production and trade favors a fixed exchange rate regime or a single currency. Second, because Canadian firms often use the US dollar as the <b>invoicing</b> <b>currency</b> for both imports and exports, they undertake most of the currency risk. Relative to other countries with a flexible exchange rate regime, in particular the US, Canada is more exposed to currency fluctuations, which leads to a higher cost of a flexible exchange rate regime in Canada...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{article for}} the first time uses Brazilian trade data to draw {{conclusions}} about the <b>invoice</b> <b>currency</b> choice — both in general and as it pertains to the Brazilian real (BRL).

Moreover, the evidence does not confirm some previous international results. We identify that in Brazil there is no coincidence regarding the use of BRL for invoicing and its use for making payments. Yet we find that the main exports denominated in BRL are homogenous goods — sugar and tobacco — suggesting that some bargaining power might remain even if goods are traded in international markets. From the BRL-specific perspective, we categorically move away from the idea that the BRL is not used in Brazilian international trade. Although it is used at a limited absolute volume, an exceptional ninefold growth between 2007 and 2011 is observed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} why the choice of <b>invoice</b> <b>currency</b> under exchange rate uncertainty depends not only on expectations but also on history. The analysis is motivated by the fact that the U. S. dollar has historically been the dominant vehicle currency in developing countries. The theoretical analysis is based on an open economy model of monopolistic competition. When the market is competitive enough, the exporting firms tend to set their prices not to deviate from those of the competitors. As a result, a coordination failure can lead the third currency to be a less efficient equilibrium <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> The role of expectations is important in selecting the equilibrium in the static framework. However, in the dynamic model with staggered price-setting, the role of history becomes another key determinant of the equilibrium currency pricing. The role of history may dominate the role of expectations when the firms are myopic, particularly in the competitive local market. It also becomes dominant in the staggered price setting when a small fraction of the new price setters are backward-looking. The result suggests the importance of history in explaining why the firm tends to choose the US dollar as vehicle currency. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{conditions}} whereby an exporter can gain {{a competitive advantage}} by offering a buyer a contract {{with a choice of}} <b>invoice</b> <b>currencies</b> rather than a single currency, and determines the value of such a choice. The model incorporates accounts-payable management with exchangerisk management, taking into account the forward exchange rate and the seller’s assumptions about the buyer’s initial foreign exchange position, its expectations about the future spot rate, and its risk premium. It demonstrates how the value of a choice depends on these variables, {{as well as on the}} market interest rates in the two currencies, and on the implicit conversion factor that the seller uses in pricing in different currencies. Two numerical examples demonstrate that a currency choice can be equivalent to a substantial price cut with commonly observed parameter values. Since an exporter can often offer a choice at a low cost to itself, it can increase profits by raising its product price in return for a choice without hurting its competitiveness. This is particularly relevant when offering the choice to the buyer in a less common currency or when exchange rates are volatile. The results are driven by the fact that the forward exchange rate often deviates substantially from the expected future spot rate, and by transactions costs, which can be considerable for less common <b>currencies.</b> Keywords: <b>invoice</b> <b>currency</b> choice, payment terms in foreign trade I...|$|R

The export prices are set before exchange rates are known. When the market is competitive enough, the exporting firms tend to set their prices not to deviate from those of the competitors. As a result, when the other exporters set their prices in the third currency, the exporting firm tends to choose the third currency as an equilibrium <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> The tendency becomes conspicuous in the market where the shares of local firms are small. The latter part of the paper empirically investigates the relevancy of the theoretical results by using the export price data in Korea.

We also find that export prices in Korea are more stable against the US dollar in the commodities for which the shares of local firms are small in Japan. The empirical results are consistent with our theoretical model. The result may explain why the firm tends to set prices in the US dollar even if the United States is not a trade partner. ...|$|R

This suggests that the current measures for improving Japanese financial markets are, by themselves, likely to have only a limited impact on expanding the use of the yen as a denomination for trade transactions, given the current international competitiveness and market share of Japan’s manufacturing industry and the current exchange rate regimes.

New rules for the dollar standard game are proposed for regulating capital flows so as to reduce the likelihood of foreign exchange crises in peripheral countries, to restrain mercantilist tendencies on the part of the United States, and to reduce American trade deficits with their deflationary threat to creditor countries...|$|R

It is shown that when export prices are negotiated in the exporter’s currency, menu costs cause threshold effects in the sense that there are bounds within (outside of) which price adjustments are not (are) observed. Conversely, the pass-through is not interrupted by menu costs when export prices are denominated in the importer’s currency. The empirical model focuses on pork meat exports from two Canadian provinces to the U. S. and Japan. Hansen’s (2000) threshold estimation procedure is used to jointly test for <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> and incomplete pass-through {{in the presence of}} menu costs. Inference is conducted using the bootstrap with pre-pivoting methods to deal with nuisance parameters. The existence of menu cost is supported by the data in three of the four cases. It also appears that Quebec pork exporters price discriminate and invoice in Japanese yen their exports to Japan. Manitoba exporters also seem to follow the same invoicing strategy, but their ability to increase their profit margin in response to large enough own-currency devaluations is questionable. Our <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> results for sales to the U. S. are consisten...|$|R
