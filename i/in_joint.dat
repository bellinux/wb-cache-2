5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint attention are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. Deaf infants are able to engage <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the best coupling form of water and nitrogen in arid areas of northwest China. Field experiment was conducted in the oasis region of Shiyang River Basin, and the interactive impact of water and nitrogen nutrition on use of water and nitrogen of spring wheat was investigated. The results showed that nitrogen rate and irrigation <b>in</b> <b>jointing</b> and heading stages impacted on spring wheat yield remarkably. With nitrogen rate (168 kg/hm 2), irrigation (90 mm) <b>in</b> <b>jointing</b> stage, and irrigation (70 mm) in heading stage, grain yield was higher. Water use efficiency would be high, when the irrigation in tillering and filling stages both were 30 mm. Soil mineral nitrogen accumulation was mainly nitrate nitrogen, which was positively correlated with nitrogen rate in earlier stage. Nitrogen rate and irrigation <b>in</b> <b>jointing</b> and filling stage impacted on plant nitrogen accumulation remarkably, plant nitrogen accumulation came to maximum when nitrogen rate (168 kg/hm 2), irrigation (90 mm) <b>in</b> <b>jointing</b> stage and irrigation (70 mm) in filling stage were applied. And nitrogen use efficiency came to maximum under nitrogen rate (56 kg/hm 2), irrigation (90 mm) <b>in</b> <b>jointing</b> stage. Considering high grain yield and use of water and nitrogen, the primary suggestion on mode of irrigation and nitrogen rate of spring wheat in Shiyang River Basin were nitrogen rate (168 kg/hm 2), irrigation (90 mm) <b>in</b> <b>jointing</b> stage and irrigation (70 mm) in tillering, heading and filling stages...|$|R

5|$|Gaze {{becomes more}} complex {{with age and}} practice. As gaze {{increases}} in complexity, individuals {{are better able to}} discriminate what others are referring to.

Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> fluid or tophus.
