40|$|This work {{describes}} a coupling between the 1 D {{method of characteristics}} (MOC) and the 3 D finite volume method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The coupling method is applied to compressible flow in hydraulic systems. The MOC code is implemented {{as a set of}} boundary conditions in the OpenFOAM open source CFD software. The coupling is realized by two linear equations originating from the characteristics equation and the Riemann constant equation, respectively. The coupling method is validated using three simple water hammer cases and several coupling configurations. The accuracy and robustness are investigated with respect to the mesh size ratio across the interface and to 3 D flow features close to the interface. The method is finally applied to the transient flow caused by the closing and opening of a <b>knife</b> <b>valve</b> (gate) in a pipe, where the flow is driven by the difference in free surface elevation between two tanks. A small region surrounding the moving gate is resolved by CFD, using a dynamic mesh library, {{while the rest of the}} system is modeled by MOC. Minor losses are included in the 1 D region, corresponding to the contraction of the flow from the upstream tank into the pipe, a separate stationary flow regulation valve, and a pipe bend. The results are validated with experimental data. A 1 D solution is provided for comparison, using the static gate characteristics obtained from steady-state CFD simulations...|$|E
40|$|Cross-flow {{pressure}} regulating valve structures are attractive for high-flow pressure control applications due to the decreased actuation force required and the reduced device footprint area. A <b>knife</b> gate <b>valve</b> was fabricated, controlling a flow of 1. 3 Nl/min at a supply pressure of 1. 5 bar. The valve was microfabricated using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and silicon fusion bonding. The use of micromachined <b>knife</b> gate <b>valves</b> in pressure control systems enhances performance and cost savings can be realized. QC 20101001 </p...|$|R

5000|$|A gate valve, {{also known}} as a sluice valve, is a valve which opens by lifting a round or {{rectangular}} gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a gate valve is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so gate valves are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. The gate faces can be parallel, but are most commonly wedge-shaped. Gate valves are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical gate valves shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, gate valves are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a <b>knife</b> gate <b>valve</b> is used to cut through the liquid. [...] On opening the gate valve, the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening. This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the flow change occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing gate and seat wear and eventual leakage if used to regulate flow. Typical gate valves are designed to be fully opened or closed. [...] When fully open, the typical gate valve has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.|$|R

The initial brain computed tomography (CT) reveals a scanty subdural hematoma at the right frontal skull base and left falx, with intracerebral hematomas at both frontal lobes (Fig. 2). Fa-cial CT with 3 D reconstruction images showed a small, bony defect at the greater wing of the right sphenoid bone and a small bone fragment at the left frontal lobe, crossing the falx (Fig. 3). To evaluate the vascular injury along the bone frag-ment’s trajectory, we performed a CT angiography and found no vascular injuries (Fig. 3). Patient was managed conservative-ly with anticonvulsant prophylaxis. A follow-up brain CT showed {{the resolution of the}} intracerebral hemorrhages and perihem-orrhagic edema. The patient was discharged without any neu-rologic deficit on day 15 of admission. DISCUSSION Penetrating cranial injuries are common in warfare; however, they are rare in civilian head injuries. In clinical practice, most such injuries are due to industrial accidents, criminal activi-ties 5, 7, 8, 11, 14, 18, 22), and suicide attempts or other self-inflicted inju-ries 4, 9, 15, 19, 22). Several reports in the literature have addressed in-tracranial penetrating injuries, caused by foreign bodies such as sewing needles, <b>knives,</b> metal bars, <b>valve</b> flange, nails, power drills, chopsticks, or pencils 4, 5, 7, 15, 18 - 20, 22).
