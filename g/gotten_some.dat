Connolly said yes, but {{that he would not be}} able to sell him any as he had <b>gotten</b> <b>some</b> bottles of P2P elsewhere and was busy making another batch. Three days later, Shapiro returned with a search warrant. Among other items, he seized two bottles of P2P, one an empty 500-g container, the other a partially full 100-g one (not the one he had originally given them). All three were arrested and charged with five separate violations of federal drug laws.|$|E
25|$|In the finals, the Knicks {{would play}} seven low-scoring, {{defensive}} {{games against the}} Houston Rockets. After splitting {{the first two games}} in Houston, the Knicks would win two out of three games at Madison Square Garden, which also hosted the New York Rangers first Stanley Cup celebration in 54 years following their win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of their finals during the series. (A Knicks win would have made the Garden the first building to host a Cup winner and an NBA champ in the same season.) In Game 6, however, a last-second attempt at a game-winning shot by Starks was tipped by Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon, giving the Rockets an 86–84 victory and forcing a Game 7. The Knicks lost Game 7 90–84, credited in large part to Starks's dismal 2-for-18 shooting performance and Riley's stubborn refusal to bench Starks, despite having bench players who were renowned for their shooting prowess, such as Rolando Blackman and Hubert Davis available. The loss denied New York the distinction of having both NBA and NHL championships in the same year. Nevertheless, the Knicks had <b>gotten</b> <b>some</b> inspiration from Mark Messier and the Rangers during the finals.|$|E

25|$|In 1587, Ferdinando de' Medici succeeded {{his brother}} as Grand Duke of Tuscany, and in 1588 he brought Cavalieri to Florence as an {{overseer}} of artists, craftsmen and musicians. Cavalieri was {{master of ceremonies}} for the extremely opulent intermedi that the Medici family required for events such as weddings. Count Giovanni de' Bardi, the founder and patron of the Florentine Camerata, also collaborated on these productions. In May 1589, the festivities for the marriage of Grand Duke Ferdinando to Christina of Lorraine included a performance of Girolamo Bargagli's La pellegrina, with six especially elaborate intermedi. The 1st number of the final intermedio (6) was initially a piece by Bardi but was replaced in the actual intermedio by Cavalieri's virtuosic number based on the Aria del Gran Duca which became popular all over Europe and occurs in many arrangements and variations such as that made by Peter Philips in Antwerp. Cavalieri may have <b>gotten</b> <b>some</b> of his ideas for monody directly from Bardi, since Cavalieri was {{not a member of}} the Camerata during its period of activity a few years earlier. He may have developed his rivalry with Giulio Caccini, another extremely important and influential early monodist during this period.|$|E

They felt they should have <b>gotten</b> <b>some</b> help from them.... didn't say why, but they certainly didn't feel they'd been handled fairly." [...] The Piccards struggled to gain financial support until the Grigsby-Grunow Radio Company advanced them several thousand dollars.

500|$|Although {{critical}} {{reception of}} Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle {{have been mixed}} among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: [...] "We have, over the years, on those occasions when I have worked with the character, <b>gotten</b> <b>some</b> letters {{from those who have}} disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle." [...] Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon {{is not limited to the}} Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe.

500|$|In the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes {{to the point of}} brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions. [...] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a [...] "hot bench", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions. Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns. The 2009 Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor. Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, [...] "She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, how do you say, temperamental." [...] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, [...] "She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand." [...] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been [...] "totally antithetical to this perception that has <b>gotten</b> <b>some</b> traction that she is somehow confrontational." [...] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, [...] "Some lawyers just don’t like to be questioned by a woman.
