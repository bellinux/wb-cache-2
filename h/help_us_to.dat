25|$|Religious persons acquire {{religious}} {{ideas and}} practices through social exposure. The {{child of a}} Zen Buddhist will not become an evangelical Christian or a Zulu warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a Roman Catholic but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says cognitive science can <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations {{and in so doing}} enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.|$|E

25|$|Dreyfus also {{identified}} a subtler assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often {{assume that there}} is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that exists can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those things that can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{techniques}} used to examine how infants perceive speech, besides the head-turn procedure mentioned above, is measuring their sucking rate. In such an experiment, a baby is sucking a special nipple while presented with sounds. First, the baby's normal sucking rate is established. Then a stimulus is played repeatedly. When the baby hears the stimulus {{for the first time}} the sucking rate increases but as the baby becomes habituated to the stimulation the sucking rate decreases and levels off. Then, a new stimulus is played to the baby. If the baby perceives the newly introduced stimulus as different from the background stimulus the sucking rate will show an increase. The sucking-rate and the head-turn method are some of the more traditional, behavioral methods for studying speech perception. Among the new methods (see Research methods below) that <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> study speech perception, near-infrared spectroscopy is widely used in infants.|$|E

A documentary film about Goldstein titled As I AM: The Life and Times of DJ AM, was announced at the EDMbiz Conference on June 20, 2013. The film was directed by Kevin Kerslake and released in April 2015. Dennis Harvey of Variety called it an entertaining documentary, but thought, [...] "there are some notable gaps left in the pic's posthumous understanding of DJ AM ... as its flashy surface doesn't always <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> understand the pure artistic soul he's depicted as here." ...|$|E
500|$|Basque {{president}} José Antonio Ardanza Garro {{condemned the}} attack: [...] "attacks like this do not <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> consolidate democracy or overcome {{the problems of}} violence in our society. This attack could provoke a response and a further spiral of violence." [...] The Basque Nationalist Party voiced suspicion that the attacks {{were part of a}} dirty war being carried out by the Spanish state. Herri Batasuna, the political wing of ETA, also accused the Spanish secret services of complicity in such attacks and delivered a letter of protest to the French consulate in Bilbao, criticising the French for perceived inaction against the killers. The PSOE, at that time the governing party of Spain, condemned the incident as an attack on [...] "the freedom of the Basque people". Their chairman in the Basque Country, Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, stated that he did not believe that the solution to ETA violence was to have similar terrorists trying to even the score.|$|E
500|$|The first {{war ended}} in 1851, but would resume in 1864. During this interlude, Ernest fervently opposed the {{marriage}} of his nephew Albert Edward, Prince of Wales ('Bertie') to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, a daughter of the future Christian IX of Denmark (and therefore {{an enemy of the}} German states). He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests. Albert replied angrily [...] "What has {{that got to do with}} you?... Vicky has racked her brains to <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> find someone, but in vain...We have no [...] choice". Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match, but as he could find no alternative bride, he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter (and outside the realm of government) was [...] "the only way to prevent a break with Prussia and the only way to keep the game in our own hands, impose the conditions that we think necessary, and as far as we can, take off its political edge". Albert also warned his son of Ernest's endeavors to interfere with the match, commenting, [...] "Your uncle...will try his hand at this work. Your best defence will be not to enter on the subject, should he broach it".|$|E

40|$|Jeannette Wing’s {{call for}} {{teaching}} Computational Thinking (CT) as a formative skill {{on par with}} reading, writing, and arithmetic places computer science {{in the category of}} basic knowledge.

But while teaching everyone to think computationally is a noble goal, there are pedagogical challenges. Perhaps the most confounding issue is the role of programming, and whether we can separate it from teaching basic computer science. How much programming, if any, should be required for CT proficiency? We believe that to successfully broaden participation i...|$|R

500|$|Obama's {{selections}} of Warren and Lowery to deliver prayers for the inaugural ceremony were controversial. Warren {{had a history}} of vocal opposition to same-sex marriage, and Lowery had a background as a civil rights activist. Neither Obama nor Warren made references during the inaugural program to issues of direct concern to the gay community. In the invocation, Warren asked for [...] "forgiveness for Americans 'when we fight each other' and 'civility in our attitudes even when we differ.'" [...] Warren mentioned Dr.MartinLuther King and Jesus in the invocation, and he concluded the invocation with the Lord's Prayer. Lowery used humor as he delivered the benediction. One of his messages was the statement that [...] "as we leave this mountaintop, <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> hold on to the spirit of fellowship and the oneness of our family." [...] Lowery concluded the benediction with a humorous message of anticipation for the day [...] "when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead man and when white would embrace what is right". Conservatives, including Rush Limbaugh decried Lowery's benediction, which quoted from [...] "Lift Every Voice and Sing" [...] (the [...] "Black National Anthem"), as racist, while Democrats disagreed. Another of Lowery's rhymes, [...] "When black will not be asked to get in back", borrowing (along with other lines in his conclusion) from the Big Bill Broonzy song [...] "Black, Brown and White", particularly offended the likes of Limbaugh who felt that Obama's ascension on that day symbolized the fact that America had come to that point already.|$|E
500|$|Before the launch, Blair {{announced}} that he would give the £4.6m advance and all royalties from his memoirs to a sports centre for injured soldiers. In an interview with Jonathon Gatehouse, he conceded, [...] "You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel both a sense of responsibility and a deep sadness for those who have lost their lives. That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay with {{me for the rest of}} my life. You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E
