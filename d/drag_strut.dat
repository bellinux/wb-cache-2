25|$|On 9 November 2012, BFL509, a Curtiss C-46A (C-GTXW), {{landed at}} Yellowknife Airport {{and when it}} rolled to the runway 16/34 intersection, the left main landing gear collapsed. The {{aircraft}} then {{came to rest on}} the left wing and suffered substantial damage. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service. The cause of the accident was that a hammer, lodged between the inboard <b>drag</b> <b>strut</b> and sliding member, caused the landing gear to collapse.|$|E
2500|$|The {{centre section}} of the wing has a {{constant}} chord, with a plywood-covered D-box forward of the main spar. [...] The ply covering extends to the trailing edge at the wing roots over the triangular area defined by the internal <b>drag</b> <b>strut.</b> [...] The outer panels continue the leading edge ply-covered D-box but incorporate curved ailerons, giving the wing an approximately elliptical planform. Where not ply-surfaced, the wing is fabric-covered. [...] Most production aircraft have mid-chord spoilers on the inner section upper surface. [...] Lift and landing forces are borne by faired struts from the lower fuselage to the main spar {{close to the end}} of the wing centre sections.|$|E
2500|$|It was an all-wood framed aircraft, skinned with {{a mixture}} of plywood and fabric. [...] High mounted wings were built around single spar with a ply covered D-box leading edge. Behind the spar the wings were largely fabric covered apart from an inboard section {{containing}} the CVV-type airbrakes which extended above and below the wing, where the ply skin reached aft to the trailing edge. There was also extra ply skinning inboard of the airbrakes, forward of the oblique, internal <b>drag</b> <b>strut.</b> Outboard of the airbrakes Frise ailerons formed the trailing edge out to rounded tips. In plan the wings were straight tapered, mostly on the trailing edge; they had 8.2° of washout and each could be detached separately for transport.|$|E
50|$|It was an {{amphibian}} with retractable {{wheels on}} cranked axles with rearward <b>drag</b> <b>struts</b> hinged from the fuselage sides and with near-vertical shock absorber legs. Other struts facilitated {{the raising of}} the wheels above the waterline but no details are known.|$|R
50|$|The Holland H.1 had a {{conventional}} fixed tailskid undercarriage with its mainwheels {{on a single}} axle and a track of 1.4 m. The axle was mounted via bungee shock absorbers to short vertical legs with and rearward <b>drag</b> <b>struts,</b> both attached to the lower fuselage longerons.|$|R
50|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} was conventional {{with a pair}} of mainwheels on an axle {{mounted on}} pairs of V-struts, the forward, vertical members were fixed to the wings and the rearward <b>drag</b> <b>struts</b> to the wing roots. A tailskid shock absorber was attached to an extension of the rudder post.|$|R
2500|$|The Nemere's {{progression}} from the Karakán was {{most evident in}} the wing and its mounting. The modified pedestal mounting to the fuselage had gone and instead the Nemere had a shoulder wing mounted on a [...] span centre section built {{as part of the}} fuselage. The wing was a cantilever structure, without the earlier lift struts, continuously tapered in plan from root to tip with no externally distinct centre section and with 2° of dihedral. There was continuous taper in wing section also; Rotter returned to Göttingen airfoils using Gö 646 with a thickness to chord of 19% at the root, varying through Gö 535 to a thinner, less cambered, tip. [...] Like the Karakán, the Nemere had a plywood covered D-box ahead of the main spar but, with the external struts absent, plywood covered more of the inner wing back to a diagonal internal <b>drag</b> <b>strut.</b> The wings were fabric covered aft. Broad chord ailerons occupied the outer 60% of the wings, which ended in elliptical tips.|$|E

50|$|The Type 20 had {{retractable}} landing gear. Each mainwheel was on {{a vertical}} oleo strut under the engine and hinged on a bent axle and a <b>drag</b> <b>strut,</b> both tubular. They were retracted by lever-operated cables into the engine cowlings, with the axle and <b>drag</b> <b>strut</b> lying on the wing underside. In the cockpit there were pointers indicating the undercarriage position and a quick release to lower it. The mainwheels had brakes and the tailwheel castered.|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in the Variable Density Wind Tunnel of the NACA to determine {{the importance of the}} interference effects and <b>drag</b> of <b>struts</b> on a monoplane. Inclined struts were placed upon a Gottingen 387 airfoil in the lower surface positions and in two upper surface positions. Tests were made at values of Reynolds Number comparable with those obtained in flight. It was found that the interference <b>drag</b> of <b>struts</b> may be as great as the <b>drag</b> of the <b>struts</b> alone...|$|R
25|$|Light-frame {{structures}} usually gain {{seismic resistance}} from rigid plywood shear walls and wood structural panel diaphragms. Special provisions for seismic load-resisting systems for all engineered wood structures requires consideration of diaphragm ratios, {{horizontal and vertical}} diaphragm shears, and connector/fastener values.
