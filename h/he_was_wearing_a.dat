25|$|On {{the morning}} he was arrested, Siminovsky {{was taken to the}} Fort Hamilton army base in Bay Ridge for questioning. He confessed within half an hour, and {{subsequently}} confessed to bribery.

25|$|The {{youth of}} some of the victims is often {{characterized}} as a particularly reprehensible aspect of the raid. Bobbie Martin is generally cited as being the youngest victim; some histories of the raid state he was twelve years old, while others state he was fourteen. Most accounts state <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> Union soldier uniform or clothing made from his father’s uniform; some state he was carrying a musket and cartridges. (For perspective on the age of participants in the conflict, {{it has been estimated that}} about 800,000 Union soldiers were seventeen years of age or younger, with about 100,000 of those being fifteen or younger.) Most of Quantrill’s guerrilla fighters were teenagers. One of the youngest was Riley Crawford, who was 13 when brought by his mother to Quantrill after her husband was shot and her home burned by Union soldiers.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} how, but several Gulf Cartel members traced {{one of their}} stolen loads to a stash house of {{suspected}} dealers in Elsa, Texas on 1 November 2011. The cartel then called on an American-based prison gang to go and buy the loads to learn {{the location of the}} stash house. The gang dealers then went and bought the drugs from the dealers, but realized that it was not at the stash house were the goods were allegedly hidden. In an attempt to disclose the information to the dealers, the gang members kidnapped them, and that was when two country sheriffs received an emergency call a possible kidnapping. The policemen then spotted the gang member's Ford F-150 pickup truck and ordered the drivers to stop. While one of the policemen was speaking to the driver, the other approached the passenger window and was shot with a 9 mm gun. The policeman managed to survive because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> bullet vest. One of the gang members, however, was killed; the other {{was shot in the head}} and remained in critical condition.|$|E

25|$|Rodriguez and Del Rio were {{traded to}} the SmackDown brand on the April 20 episode of SmackDown. On the May 21 episode of Raw, Santino Marella criticised Rodriguez's announcing and then {{attacked}} Rodriguez. Rodriguez unsuccessfully challenged Marella to a match on the May 25 SmackDown. On the June 8 SmackDown, to tie in with Del Rio's feud with World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus, Rodriguez dressed up as Sheamus and mocked Sheamus' mannerisms. Rodriguez's portrayal of Sheamus was praised as very funny from critics and fans alike. On the June 11 episode of Raw, Rodriguez resumed his feud with Marella, teaming with Beth Phoenix to beat Marella and Layla. After the match, Marella embarrassed Rodriguez by ripping off Rodriguez's shirt to reveal <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> Justin Bieber T-shirt underneath. Their feud ended at No Way Out, when Rodriguez lost to Marella in a non-title tuxedo match, Rodriguez's first pay-per-view singles match. In September 2012, during Del Rio's feud with Sheamus, Rodriguez suffered a Brogue Kick from Sheamus and thus enlisted David Otunga's help as his lawyer to try and ban the Brogue Kick. Rodriguez was later pinned in a six-man tag match later that month with Del Rio and Otunga against Sheamus, Rey Mysterio and Sin Cara.|$|E
25|$|In August, Sin Cara rekindled a {{feud with}} Cody Rhodes, {{who claimed that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> mask to cover his ugly face. Sin Cara scored pinfall wins over Rhodes in {{consecutive}} matches on SmackDown and Raw, both times taking advantage of Rhodes trying to remove his mask. He then also saved fellow masked wrestler Rey Mysterio from being unmasked by Rhodes and afterward teamed up with Mysterio to put one of his masks on Rhodes. After defeating WWE Intercontinental Champion The Miz in a non-title match, Sin Cara was granted an opportunity to win the title at Night of Champions in a four-way match, which also included Rhodes and Mysterio and saw The Miz retain the title. The following day on Raw, Sin Cara and Mysterio teamed up to defeat Epico and Primo in a tag team match. Sin Cara and Mysterio entered a tournament {{to determine the number}} one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship, defeating Primo & Epico and The Prime Time Players (Titus O'Neil and Darren Young) to advance to the final. Sin Cara and Mysterio lost the final of the tournament to the Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow) on the October 22 episode of Raw. At Survivor Series on November 19, Sin Cara and Mysterio were victorious in a 10-man elimination tag team match alongside Brodus Clay, Justin Gabriel, and Tyson Kidd against the Prime Time Players, Epico, Primo, and Tensai. On December 16 at , Sin Cara and Mysterio were defeated by Team Rhodes Scholars in a number one contenders tables match for the WWE Tag Team Championship.
