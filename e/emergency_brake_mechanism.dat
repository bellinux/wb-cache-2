30|$|The page of type Cell {{forwards}} the received moving {{authority to}} the corresponding train’s OBDCA. The train’s OBDCA updates its information and follows the moving authority. At the time of sending the train’s location and other essential information to the Zone Controller page, OBDCA sets a time out of receiving the corresponding moving authority. If the response is not received within the set timeout, a communication failure is assumed and train’s OBDCA activates the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Train retards according to its <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> characteristics. The last saved location information is considered as a train’s current location by page MAPA. Moving authority to trailing trains is provided based on this information for them to allow adjust their speed. Normal operations are resumed upon regaining the communication link.|$|R
40|$|Masked Priming Experiments have {{revealed}} a precise set of facilitatory and inhibitory visual-motor control processes. Most notably, inhibitory effects {{have been identified}} in which prime-target compatibility induces performance costs and prime-target incompatibility induces performance benefits. We argue that this profile of data is commensurate with an ?<b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> <b>mechanism?,</b> whereby responses can be retracted as a result of changing sensory evidence. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} provide a neural network based explanation of this phenomenon. This is obtained through the use of feedforward inhibition to implement backward masking, lateral inhibition to implement response competition and opponent processing mechanisms to implement response retraction. Although the model remains simple, it does a very good job of reproducing the available masked priming data. For example, it reproduces a large spectrum of reaction time data across a number of different experimental conditions. Perhaps most notably however, it also reproduces Lateralized Readiness Potentials that have been recorded while subjects perform different conditions. In addition, it provides a concrete set of testable predictions...|$|R
50|$|In normal driving conditions, braking {{is entirely}} {{achieved}} {{by means of}} a traditional air brake system. Because of their long life-span, La Brugeoise trains use custom-made brake shoes made of hard wood embedded with creosote for additional resistance. Friction between the steel wheels and the brake shoes releases a peculiar fragrance Line A is known for among porteños (as Buenos Aires inhabitants call themselves) and tourists. The <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> operation is entirely mechanical: the motorman applies them by spinning a wheel located on the right-hand side of the driving cab, tensing up a chain connected to the <b>brake</b> <b>mechanism.</b> If <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> are engaged for more than 10 seconds, current flow to traction motors and auxiliary equipment is interrupted by the main fuse.|$|R

5000|$|In the cabs of light-rail cars the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> {{is often}} a large red button, which the train crew {{refers to as the}} [...] "mushroom"; this also {{activates}} the magnetic track <b>brakes.</b> The <b>mechanism</b> of an <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> may differ, depending on railcar design. Emergency-braking a train (without track brakes) will give about 1.5 m/s2 (0.15 g) deceleration. The braking distance will be approximately 250 m at 100 km/h and 600 m at 160 km/h. High-speed trains are usually equipped with a magnetic track brake, which can give about 0.3 m/s2 extra, and give braking distances like 850 m at 200 km/h and 1900 m at 300 km/h.|$|R

Hence, the third car will receive multiple <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning messages. We will show the first car and second car <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning individually in the user interface (Figure  8), because our system uses the vehicle list to identify the car information.|$|R
50|$|B6 S4 brakes {{consisted}} of radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear. The front discs are sized at 345 mm in diameter by 30 mm thick, and are clamped by Continental Teves-ATE FNRG-60 single-piston sliding brake calipers.

50|$|On July 30, 2007, after 24 {{years without}} a single accident, a {{collision}} took place that took the life of 1 person and injured 11 others. It was on Line 1 at Plaza Sucre station at 9:09 a.m. when a train headed in the Propatria direction stopped on the platform. It was hit from behind by another travelling in the same direction. Although {{there has been much}} speculation about the cause of the accident, it is clear that there was a defect in the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> system; the operational control centre from the La Hoyada station never activated the automatic <b>braking</b> <b>mechanism</b> when a train approaches a second train.|$|R

30|$|The main {{contribution}} of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning system delivers drivers a braking warning signal earlier by DSRC communication. Via vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning signal will be broadcast and the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time. Therefore, drivers behind can receive an immediate <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning while the front vehicle <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes.</b> Since the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time, the driver in car C can {{be aware of the}} <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> of car A before the driver in car B brakes and its braking light comes on, as shown in Figure  4. Consequently, the early warning mechanism is the concept of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning system. Now that active safety applications have become mature, cooperative communication technology to achieve improved safety will be the future trend.|$|R

5000|$|In March 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety {{announced}} {{the manufacturers of}} 99% of U.S. automobiles had agreed to include automatic <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> systems as a standard feature on virtually all new cars sold in the U.S. by 2022. [...] In Europe there was a related agreement about advanced <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> system (AEBS) or autonomous <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> (AEB) in 2012. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has announced {{that this kind of}} system will become mandatory for new heavy vehicles starting in 2015. NHTSA projected that the ensuing acceleration of the rollout of automatic <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> would prevent an estimated 28,000 collisions and 12,000 injuries.|$|R
50|$|In cars, {{the parking}} brake, also called hand <b>brake,</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>brake,</b> or e-brake, is a {{latching}} brake usually {{used to keep}} the vehicle stationary.Automobile hand brakes usually consist of a cable directly connected to the <b>brake</b> <b>mechanism</b> on one end and to a lever or pedal at the driver's position. The mechanism is often a hand-operated lever (hence the hand brake name), on the floor {{on either side of}} the driver, or a pull handle located below and near the steering wheel column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located far apart from the other pedals.In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking.Some cars have the parking brake operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> do {{not stop}} very well, as the {{stopping}} force provided by the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> {{is less than half}} the force of normal braking and takes much longer to stop a vehicle. For vehicles with manual transmissions, the mechanical <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> is routinely used to assist in hill starts as this frees both feet for use on the accelerator and clutch pedals. Even an unskilled motorist can get started without rolling backwards. It is inadvisable to use rear wheel <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> when the standard brakes are available, unless {{there is a problem with}} the front wheels such as a tire blowout or slippery conditions risking a loss of control. Using the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> while driving changes the traction balance between the front and rear of the vehicle, if over applied may lock the back wheels and skid the car into a handbrake turn. Handbrake turns are often used in street racing to initiate rear wheel drift. In conditions near freezing where it is both wet and icy, the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> mechanics may freeze and be impossible to release until thawed. If only using the [...] "park" [...] function on a transmission to hold the car parked, there is no freezing problem.|$|R
