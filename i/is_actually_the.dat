5|$|The {{so-called}} Fourth Military Gate {{stands between}} towers 59 and 60, {{and is currently}} walled up. Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that this gate <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> Gate of St. Romanus, but the evidence is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|After {{being told}} {{by a panel of}} Senators that Fringe Division is not worth the human or fiscal cost, Broyles is given the {{transformation}} device by Peter so Broyles can justify Fringe Division remaining active. In a separate scene, Agent Jessup is shown working at a computer, annotating an image of the creature from The Transformation with biblical verses, notably from the Book of Revelation. The final scene reveals that Charlie <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> shapeshifter, who disposes of the real agent's body in a furnace beneath the hospital.|$|E
5|$|After the Morris {{family and}} Clay {{discover}} that the gates have been locked to prevent their escape, the monsters surround them. In anger, Lizzy tries to remove a mask {{from one of the}} monsters, which she discovers <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> Horror's face. The Horrors explain that they are monsters, but that the visitors' experiences were part of a television show. As an apology, the monsters say that they will lead them towards a new car, but they are led to carnivorous animals.|$|E

5|$|Alain Magnan {{returns from}} the Lake and orders Morgan to execute his native allies and Sahin as heathens, but Sahin and Lizzie {{convince}} Morgan that Alain <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> leader of the Circle of Ossus. Therefore, the knight, the Turk, and the pirate decide {{to work together to}} destroy the Fountain of Youth and stop the Circle's plans for domination of the New World permanently.|$|E
5|$|The motions as {{described}} above are simplifications. Due to the movement of Earth around the Earth–Moon center of mass, the apparent path of the Sun wobbles slightly, with {{a period of about}} one month. Due to further perturbations by the other planets of the Solar System, the Earth–Moon barycenter wobbles slightly around a mean position in a complex fashion. The ecliptic <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> apparent path of the Sun throughout the course of a year.|$|E
5|$|There {{are very}} few Arabians {{registered}} as roan, and according to researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg, roaning in purebred Arabians <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> action of rabicano genetics. Unlike a genetic roan, rabicano is a partial roan-like pattern; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the entire body, only on the midsection and flanks, the head and legs are solid-colored. Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both. However, a roan does not consistently lighten with age, while a gray does.|$|E

5|$|After having sex, Sidney and Billy are {{attacked}} by the killer, who seemingly murders Billy. Sidney narrowly escapes the house and seeks help from Kenny, but the killer slits his throat; Sidney then flees again. Gale and Dewey, having discovered that the car belongs to Neil Prescott, return to the house. They believe Neil is the killer and {{has come to the}} party to continue his spree. Gale tries to escape in her van, but drives off the road and crashes to avoid hitting Sidney. Meanwhile, Dewey is stabbed in the back while investigating in the house, and Sidney takes his gun. Stu and Randy appear and accuse each other of being the killer. Sidney retreats into the house, where she finds Billy wounded but still alive. She gives Billy the gun; he lets Randy into the house and shoots him. Billy reveals that he feigned his injuries and <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> killer; Stu is his accomplice.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers a and b is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> same as the set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by a and b is the ideal generated byg alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of a and b also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E
5|$|Far Rockaway is {{notably the}} oldest station {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} New York City Subway, having originally opened over 145 years ago, on July 29, 1869, as a Long Island Rail Road station. However, Gates Avenue on the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn is the oldest station in the subway system to have been built as a rapid transit station, {{and has been in}} continuous operation for over 130 years. The Far Rockaway station was converted from Long Island Rail Road trackage to subway loading gauge and has only operated for 57 years in this capacity. Therefore, Far Rockaway <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> fifteenth newest station in the subway system (behind Grand Street; Harlem–148th Street; 57th Street; the three Archer Avenue Line stations; the three IND 63rd Street Line stations; the new South Ferry station; 34th Street–Hudson Yards; and the three Second Avenue Subway stations).|$|E
5|$|Frustrated by Parker's {{perseverance}} {{despite everything}} that's been inflicted, Osborn publicly reveals that he's alive on Halloween. During the battle that ensues between them, Osborn attempts to kill Parker by impaling his nemesis with his goblin glider. When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker (and immediately deteriorates on death as all clones do), Parker realises he <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> original. During this same period, Osborn {{may or may}} not have been responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently prematurely induces Mary Jane's pregnancy and the stillbirth of the baby.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the {{character}} underwent {{a dramatic change}} in storyline when the role of Nick and Sharon's fourteen-year-old daughter Cassie was killed off after a car accident. This led Nick to seek comfort in the arms of another woman, Phyllis Summers, which resulted in an affair. Phyllis became pregnant with Nick's child, Summer Newman. Nick divorced Sharon and married Phyllis the following year. For years, however, Nick battled between his ongoing feelings with Sharon and Phyllis. His other storylines have included trying to seek independence away from his powerful father as well as multiple other relationships. In 2013, a storyline regarding Summer's paternity was visited, centered on speculation that she <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> daughter of Jack Abbott, Phyllis' ex-husband.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Holman Hardt <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> one controlling the weather. All of the bizarre weather was the side-effect of his long-silent love for Sheila. He felt guilty that his weather-related problem caused Mootz to crash his car, {{so he would}} cause it to rain for Mootz. Once he realized Mootz had been drunk {{the night of the}} accident, however, he stopped. Unfortunately, Mulder begins to unintentionally attract Sheila, resulting in a massive thunderstorm that materializes due to the meteorologist's emotions. At the town's high school reunion, however, Hardt admits his love for Sheila, who accepts him. The storm stops, and Hardt and Sheila live happily ever after.|$|E
5|$|Most significantly, however, he {{utilizes}} {{his fortune}} {{to build a}} vast network of criminals, spies, dupes and co-conspirators to help engineer what would be an almost impossibly complex and meticulously planned plot to destroy Spider-Man's life. To achieve this, he becomes {{the leader of the}} Scrier cabal, taking as his pawns Seward Trainer, Judas Traveller, the Jackal and Gaunt (Mendel Stromm, returned from the dead as a cyborg), all of whom he utilizes to carry out revenge against Peter Parker. It is this group of individuals who become crucial in duping Parker into believing that he is actually a clone of himself created by the Jackal, while claiming that the clone – who comes to be known as Ben Reilly – <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> original.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{locations}} on Oahu {{were used as}} filming locations for the episode. The rooftop on Dole Cannery was filmed as the Los Angeles Police Department rooftop. The kitchen of Hawaii Convention Center was altered so that the Lost cast and crew could {{use it as a}} morgue, the Convention Center was also used for the airport scenes. The bar that Christian Shephard went to in the flashbacks <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> Fisherman's Wharf restaurant at Kewalo Basin Harbor. The scene at Ana Lucia's hotel room was filmed at the Renaissance Ilikai Waikiki Hotel. The scenes on the beach were shot at Oahu's Papa'iloa Beach as usual.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Homer only {{bought the}} ball {{so that he}} could use it himself, she is {{determined}} to learn how to bowl to spite him and heads to Barney's Bowl-a-Rama. Marge has difficulty until she meets a French bowling instructor named Jacques, who offers to give her lessons. Jacques proves to be a patient and charming instructor - the opposite of Homer in every way. When he asks about the name inscribed on her ball, she tells him that Homer <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> ball's name, neglecting to mention that she is married. Homer is faintly aware that something is wrong, but is unsure what is happening. After passing several bowling lessons, Jacques and Marge agree to meet each other for brunch.|$|E
5|$|The Kootenay rises on the {{northeast}} slopes of the Beaverfoot Range of southeastern British Columbia, and flows initially southeast through the valleys of Kootenay National Park. Its first few kilometers (miles) are quiet, threading slowly {{through a series of}} marshes and small lakes. The river becomes significantly enlarged as it reaches the confluence with the Vermilion River, which <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> larger of the two where they meet near the settlement of Kootenay Crossing. It continues southeast, receiving the Palliser River from the left, and swings southwards into a gorge at the confluence with the White River.|$|E
