5|$|Her first {{position}} as a professor was at Rutgers School of Law–Newark in 1963. The appointment was not without its drawbacks; Ginsburg was informed she would be paid less than her male colleagues {{because she had a}} <b>husband</b> <b>with</b> a well-paid job. At the time Ginsburg entered academia, she was one of fewer than twenty female law professors in the United States. She was a professor of law, mainly civil procedure, at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, receiving tenure from the school in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the <b>husband</b> <b>with</b> their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E
5|$|George's {{marriage}} to Sophia Dorothea was dissolved, {{not on the}} grounds that either of them had committed adultery, but {{on the grounds that}} Sophia Dorothea had abandoned her <b>husband.</b> <b>With</b> the agreement of her father, George had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in Ahlden House in her native Celle, where she stayed until she died more than thirty years later. She was denied access to her children and father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the mansion courtyard. She was, however, endowed with an income, establishment, and servants, and was allowed to ride in a carriage outside her castle, albeit under supervision. Melusine von der Schulenburg acted as George's hostess openly from 1698 until his death, and they had three daughters together, born in 1692, 1693 and 1701, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Gonne's {{marriage}} to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began {{to visit him}} in London. After {{the birth of her}} son, Seán MacBride, in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her <b>husband</b> <b>with</b> Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.|$|E

Reddington calls in a clandestine bomb tech to disable the bomb, who then escapes with it. Reddington tells Elizabeth that her <b>husband,</b> <b>with</b> whom she is trying to adopt a baby, is not what he appears to be.|$|E
5|$|Lad: A Dog was {{published}} by Dutton in April 1919, {{a year after the}} real-life Lad's death. Terhune continued receiving royalties for the novel up through his own death. His wife, Anice Terhune, ceased receiving the royalties after she surrendered the rights to them, along with those of Bruce and His Dog in exchange for E.P. Dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work Across the Line, a supposed set of conversations she had with her late <b>husband.</b> <b>With</b> this agreement, Dutton became sole owners of the copyright to Lad: A Dog. Macrae later decided that the agreement was not completely fair to Anice and modified it to provide her a payment of $100 a month {{for the rest of her}} life, likely exceeding the profits they earned on the novels as the years passed.|$|E

40|$|This is a sociolinguistic {{study on}} the chastisement {{strategies}} used by <b>husbands</b> and wives <b>with</b> higher and lower education levels to their spouses. This research aims to discover the influence of education levels and gender of husbands and wives {{on the use of}} chastisement strategies. This is a descriptive quantitative study and the source is taken from 40 married couples divided into 4 groups: 20 <b>husbands</b> <b>with</b> higher education levels, 20 wives with lower education levels, 20 <b>husbands</b> <b>with</b> lower education levels, and 20 wives with higher education levels. The instrument used is a role-play situation, in which husbands and wives are put in a situation where they must chastise their spouses. In order to get good results, the interviewers must catch the chastisement responses and evoke the respondents? emotion. By recording, transcribing, classifying, tabulating, calculating, and then analyzing each of the chastisement utterances, the tendency of each person in expressing chastisements is discovered. This research finds the fact that husbands/wives with higher education levels chastise more direct than their lower education levels counterparts may imply education levels though not significant, but an important factor in affecting the use of chastisement strategies. This research also finds the fact that although husbands have higher or lower education levels than their wives, they chastise more direct than their counterparts may mean gender is an important factor. Furthermore, there is fact that wives with higher and lower education levels have similarity that they both tend to use indirect chastisement strategies than their husbands may imply that gender still an important factor in affecting the use of chastisement. In the findings, criticism (direct) is the mostly used chastisement strategy especially for <b>husbands</b> and wives <b>with</b> higher education levels and <b>husbands</b> <b>with</b> lower education levels while wives with lower education levels tend to use giving reason/ explanation (indirect) ...|$|R
