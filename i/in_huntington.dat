5|$|Still {{photographs}} of Oheka Castle <b>in</b> <b>Huntington,</b> New York, {{were used in}} the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate.

5|$|A project {{board was}} {{established}} in January 2009, {{with the objective of}} ensuring the stadium be built by 2012. City councillors approved the outline business case for the stadium in June 2009, meaning officials could start searching for sites. Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross <b>in</b> <b>Huntington,</b> to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of The Press noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and fitness facilities and commercial interest, and the disadvantages, including a scheduled ancient monument being located on adjacent land and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option.|$|E

5|$|Per {{the terms}} of the FSIF loan, the club was {{required}} to have identified a site for a new stadium by 2007, and have detailed planning permission by 2009, to avoid financial penalties.

In May 2008, City of York Council announced its commitment to building a community stadium, for use by York and the city's rugby league club, York City Knights. In July 2010, the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross <b>in</b> <b>Huntington,</b> on the site of Huntington Stadium, was chosen by the council.

5|$|Buczynski's {{continuing}} {{disagreements with}} {{senior members of}} the CES led him to resign from the priesthood on August 1, 1975. The New York Temple that he had led subsequently folded. Returning his interest to Wicca, he befriended a Gardnerian high priestess named Sheila Saperton, who had been initiated into the Craft years before by Raymond Buckland. Saperton had become increasingly interested in Buckland's newly developed tradition of Seax-Wica, and founded a Seax coven from her home <b>in</b> <b>Huntington</b> Station on Long Island. Although never initiated into Seax-Wica, Buczynksi associated with the group, and attended many of their rites. Eventually however, the group tired of the practices of Seax-Wica, and instead transformed into a Gardnerian coven, with Buczynski becoming high priest. Claiming that a mysterious witch known only as Jana, who had been involved in the New Forest coven back in Hampshire, England, had been communicating with him and providing him with a legitimate lineage, he began making further changes to the coven structure. Both Buczynski biographer Michael Lloyd and researcher Philip Heselton have expressed doubt that Jana was ever a real figure operating in England, instead suggesting that she was perhaps an invention of Buczynski's to legitimize his practice of Gardnerian Wica.|$|E
