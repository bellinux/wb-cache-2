5|$|During {{the last}} two games of the regular season, however, the Hokies managed two victories: a 14–3 win against last-place ACC team Duke, and a 17–14 triumph over {{traditional}} rival Virginia. Miami, meanwhile, lost its final two games of the season: against Georgia Tech and North Carolina State. These losses dropped Miami to a 4–4 record <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC,</b> one game behind the Hokies, who were tied with Georgia Tech at 5–3 following the end of the regular season. By virtue of the Hokies' head-to-head win against the Yellow Jackets, Virginia Tech won the Coastal Division and a spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> Championship Game. When Tech won the championship game against Atlantic Division champion Boston College, 30–12, it was awarded the ACC's automatic bid to the Orange Bowl.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} chronic {{treatment}} with verapamil(VP) on monoamine release and metabolism in rat brain in vivo {{were compared with}} the effects of methamphetamine(MAP) and reserpine(RES). These drugs were administered to rats in drinking water for two weeks. The contents of monoamines (DA and 5 HT) and their major metabolites(DOPAC, HVA and 5 HIAA) in eight discrete brain regions were measured by HPLC-ECD. After treatment with VP, DA levels decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nucleus accumbens(N. <b>ACC)</b> and <b>the</b> suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN), but no significant changes were demonstrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metabolites(DOPAC, HVA). 5 HT levels decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N. <b>ACC,</b> SCN and amygdara(AMY), and 5 HIAA levels decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> raphe dorsalis(RD). GABA contents were increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N. <b>ACC.</b> After treatment with MAP, DA levels decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N. <b>ACC,</b> striatum(STR) and ventro-medial hypothalamic regions(VMH). No significant change was shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metabolites. 5 HT contents decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N. <b>ACC,</b> STR, AMY, VMH and RD. 5 HIAA contents decreased significantly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RD. After treatment with RES, DA levels decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N. <b>ACC,</b> STR and SCN. HVA contents decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N. <b>ACC</b> and SCN, though they increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LH and SN. 5 HT levels decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N. <b>ACC,</b> SCN, AMY and RD. High 5 HIAA concentrations were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N. <b>ACC,</b> STR, LH and VMH. DA, DOPAC and HVA levels were reduced more in several regions by co-administration of VP and MAP than by MAP treatment alone. DA was lowered more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RD and HVA was lowered more in several regions by co-administration of VP and RES than by RES treatment alone. The well known locomotor hyperactivity induced by MAP was enhanced by VP. The present study suggests that {{there are at least two}} classes of voltage-gated calcium channels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central nervous system related to the release of monioamines, one sensitive to VP and other not. In addition, chronic VP treatment may have an inhibitory effect on the release and synthesis of monoamines...|$|R
25|$|Returning to {{the senior}} side, Khadka went {{on a tour of}} Pakistan before playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2006 <b>ACC</b> Trophy <b>in</b> Kuala Lumpur.

5|$|The Wake Forest {{defense was}} led by All-America honorable mention linebacker Jon Abbate. Abbate, who was a first-team All-ACC selection, was the team's leading tackler and earned the second-most tackles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> during the season. Safety Josh Gattis was another star on the Wake defense. A first-team All-ACC selection, Gattis was the only player <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> to earn 70 tackles and five interceptions. On the {{defensive}} line, defensive end Patrick Ghee stood out. An honorable mention All-ACC selection, Ghee ranked fifth on the team in tackles and had three interceptions.|$|E
5|$|After poor {{attendance}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> Championship Game at Jacksonville for {{the second}} straight year, ACC officials and representatives of the conference's member schools elected not to extend the Gator Bowl Association's contract to host the game.

5|$|In {{choosing}} the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee {{had the right}} to select the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series, Cotton Bowl Classic, Capital One Bowl, and Outback Bowl made their selections. Just as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC,</b> the selection committee could not select an SEC team with two more losses than the highest available team. The bowl earned the right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar payout system, which guarantees {{a certain amount of money}} to the participating conferences. Prior to 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC.</b> After the bowl increased its payout to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} streaks ended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2001–02 season, when the Tar Heels {{finished}} 8–20 {{on the season}} under coach Matt Doherty.

Against North Carolina State, Choice recorded 164 rushing yards on 34 carries, earning {{what was then a}} single-game career high in rushing yards. In the days before the ACC championship, Choice was named to the second-team All-ACC team, and was considered to be a threat on offense against Wake Forest.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{spent much}} of the season as the leading rusher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC,</b> but he was {{eventually}} surpassed by Jonathan Dwyer of Georgia Tech and finished second in the conference. In early October, Scott was added to the Maxwell Award watch list. The Atlantic Coast Conference named Scott to the All-ACC first team alongside Dwyer.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} a rematch {{of an early}} regular-season contest, but even though Georgia Tech won that game, there were {{questions}} about whether the victory would be repeated. Twice before, the two teams matched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> Championship Game had played earlier that season. Both times, the loser of the first matchup won the second. There also were questions about each team's quality because of their losses in rivalry games against Southeastern Conference foes.|$|E

5|$|The two {{victories}} {{were the}} start of a winning streak that saw the Hokies complete the regular season without another loss. Following Boston College, they defeated No. 23 NC State in its home stadium, 41–30. They defeated nonconference opponent Central Michigan, then beat conference opponent Wake Forest and re-entered the polls at No. 25. Their position in the polls climbed with each opponent they defeated. They beat Duke as the No. 25 team, Georgia Tech as the No. 23 team, North Carolina as the No. 20 team and No. 23 Miami as the No. 16 team. The Miami victory clinched Tech the division championship and a slot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> championship game, but the Hokies still won their final previously scheduled game, the annual Commonwealth Cup rivalry against Virginia. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> Championship Game, Virginia Tech defeated Florida State 44–33, clinching the ACC's automatic bid to the Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|With Virginia Tech earning an {{automatic}} bid to the Orange Bowl, the Chick-fil-A Bowl {{had the first}} pick of the remaining ACC teams. Boston College, {{by virtue of its}} loss <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> Championship Game, was the highest remaining team, but Chick-fil-A Bowl representatives instead chose to invite Clemson, which had finished behind Boston College in the Atlantic Division standings. In making their decision, Chick-fil-A Bowl representatives cited Boston College's poor attendance at the ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville. The Gator Bowl, which is also held in Jacksonville, was reluctant to choose a team that had participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> Championship Game out of feat that the team's fans would be unwilling to return to Jacksonville so quickly. The Gator Bowl Association requested and received a waiver from the league's strict bowl selection rules and selected Virginia over Boston College.|$|E
5|$|Auguste {{was elected}} captain by his {{teammates}} for his senior season. He was also voted to the Preseason All-ACC second team. Seven games into the 2015-16 season, Auguste tallied his fifth double-double of the season, tying {{the total of}} his first three seasons. He was named as one of ten finalists for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award, also earning third team all-ACC honors for the season. In the quarter final of the 2016 ACC Tournament Auguste led his team to a 84–79 win versus Duke, posting a double-double with 19 points and 22 rebounds, setting the Notre Dame's record for most rebounds in a game and tying Tim Duncan's second best performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> Tournament.|$|E
50|$|As co-members of the Atlantic Coast Conference, Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech {{regularly}} meet in all varsity {{sports in}} which both schools field a team. The rivalry is most pronounced on the football field, however, where the schools play annually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC's</b> Coastal Division, oftentimes with significant divisional implications. Prior to the Hokies joining <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> <b>in</b> 2004, <b>the</b> two teams had only met once previously (an additional scheduled meeting in 2000 was canceled due to extreme weather). Since <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> adopted divisional format for football, {{one of these two}} teams had represented <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> Coastal Division <b>in</b> every ACC Championship Game except the 2013 season when Duke won the Coastal and 2015 when UNC won it.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} <b>the</b> 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> partnered with <b>the</b> American Heart Association (AHA) {{to develop the}} first {{clinical}} practice guidelines for cardiovascular practice. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> used <b>the</b> guidelines {{to lay the groundwork}} for studies documenting discrepancies best and actual cardiovascular practices. <b>The</b> <b>ACC</b> works with national organizations such as the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to continually develop and update these guidelines.|$|R

5|$|On the ground, Taylor's {{offensive}} scrambling, while effective, was not Virginia Tech's primary rushing weapon. Running back Brandon Ore, Virginia Tech's starter at the position, {{would need}} to have a good game, analysts predicted, if the Hokies wanted to win the game. Ore, who suffered several injuries during the 2006 season, failed to produce meaningful offensive yardage until late in the season, disappointing many fans who hoped he would repeat his excellent 2006performance on the field. With a 146-yard performance against Virginia in the final game of the regular season, Ore seemed to have regained his 2006form and promised success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ACC</b> Championship Game.|$|E
