5000|$|<b>Golden-ringed</b> <b>dragonfly</b> (Cordulegaster boltonii) - October 1996 on Tresco.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally the <b>golden-ringed</b> <b>dragonfly</b> (Cordulegaster boltoni) and Beautiful Demoiselle (Calopteryx virgo), {{a type of}} damselfly, {{can be seen by}} {{streams in}} the Harz.|$|E
50|$|This {{dragonfly}} {{is common}} in central and southern Europe. It is locally common in western Britain and Ireland. Its typical habitat is acidic heath land, where it is often seen alongside <b>golden-ringed</b> <b>dragonflies.</b> Its flight is quite skittish, with frequent hovering, and it lands often. It can fly quite a distance from water, despite its seemingly weak flight. When it perches, the wings are held forward.|$|R
50|$|The <b>golden-ringed</b> <b>dragonfly</b> (Cordulegaster boltonii) is a large, {{striking}} dragonfly and {{the longest}} British species, {{the only one}} of its genus {{to be found in the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|One field {{consists}} of unimproved rush pasture with {{species such as}} common spotted orchid, marsh marigold and ragged robin. The River Yarty {{is also an important}} habitat, used by otter, kingfisher, dipper and <b>golden-ringed</b> <b>dragonfly.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anotogaster sieboldii, as {{known as}} <b>golden-ringed</b> <b>{{dragonfly}},</b> jumbo dragonfly, Siebold's dragonfly or oniyanma (オニヤンマ、鬼蜻蜓、馬大頭) in Japanese, 無霸勾蜓 in Chinese language and 장수잠자리("jang-su-jamjari", means 'General Dragonfly') in Korean language {{is the largest}} species of dragonfly native to Eastern Asia, especially Japan, China, Korean Peninsula. It can grow between 95 and 100 mm in length.|$|E
50|$|The {{river and}} ponds of the Tuckingmill Valley Park provide {{valuable}} habitat within an urban area, for two nationally scarce insects; scarce blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura pumilio) and {{small red damselfly}} (Ceriagrion tenellum). The larvae of the <b>golden-ringed</b> <b>dragonfly</b> (Ceriagrion tenellum) have been found and the adults can be seen through the summer and autumn. Other dragonflies include the common darter (Sympetrum striolatum) and the once rare migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) which usually fly in August and September.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to {{the sparse}} {{population}} of the forest and the filter action of bunter sandstone, many springs and streams in the hills have retained their natural water quality, so that they remain healthy habitats for many species of fish. These include brown trout and brook lamprey and, in calmer waters, minnow, spined loach and stone loach. In larger meadow streams grayling, perch, pike, burbot und various other minnow-like species may be found. Dragonflies, such as the <b>golden-ringed</b> <b>dragonfly</b> and the otherwise rare northern damselfly, may often be seen by streams and ponds.|$|E
50|$|The forest {{supports}} a rich invertebrate fauna, with many heathland specialities. Half of Britain's 46 breeding species of damselflies and dragonflies (the Odonata) have been recorded, the scarcer among them being the black darter, brilliant emerald and small red damselfly. It {{is also an}} important home for the <b>golden-ringed</b> <b>dragonfly,</b> which flies from mid-June to early September. Of the forest's 34 species of butterfly, the most spectacular, the purple emperor, can be hard to see. Another speciality, the silver-studded blue, is by contrast plentiful, with the main food plants of its caterpillars being gorses and heathers.|$|E
40|$|Communication among animals often {{relies on}} visible signals {{and the ability}} to compatibly {{perceive}} them. Correct signal perception is especially important for animals with male sexual selection. In my master's thesis, I am addressing the issue of how does a male <b>golden-ringed</b> <b>dragonfly</b> (Cordulegaster boltonii) recognize a female of the same kind and therefore, what is the main trigger of copulation behavior. Dragonflies display a wide variety of colors and possess very big eyes. These characteristics already suggest that they are very liable on color vision (Futahashi, 2015). Their sight is perfectly developed within the insect class and plays the most important role in the imagines in comparison to other senses. The ability to orient themselves using sight is not just important for orientation in space, nonetheless it is important for reproduction. Since golden-ringed dragonflies do not demonstrate visible color dimorphism, previous as well as my research suggests that the key role for female reconnaissance is primarily their typical movement above water surface during oviposition. In my research, I presented variable types of lure - females to male golden-ringed dragonflies and I observed what is the foremost trigger of reproduction behavior in the males. Besides the above mentioned female [...] ...|$|E
