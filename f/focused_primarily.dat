5|$|By the 19th century, Victorian {{scholars}} such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt {{sought to}} understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.|$|E
5|$|During his term, Marshall <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on {{advancing}} the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated {{the passage of}} a child labor law and anti-corruption legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.|$|E
5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on gross weight limits (which had no {{prescribed}} limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|Gotcha was {{designed}} by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, and a prototype was constructed by Cyan Engineering, Atari's semi-independent research and development subsidiary. Development began in July 1973 as part of Atari's strategy to develop multiple types of games to separate themselves from their competitors, who they saw as <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on creating Pong clones. The cabinet {{was designed}} by George Faraco, initially with the joysticks encased in pink domes meant to represent breasts.

5|$|In 1939, the Department of Justice {{created the}} Civil Rights Section, which <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on First Amendment and labor rights. The {{increasing}} scrutiny of totalitarianism in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention {{to issues of}} slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home. The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system.

5|$|The pre-game buildup <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> {{on the two}} high-powered offenses, both {{of which}} were led by strong rushing attacks. The rushing attacks differed; Northern Illinois' was led by junior quarterback Jordan Lynch, who {{finished}} fourth in the nation in rushing, while Kent State's was led by a running back tandem consisting of Dri Archer and Trayion Durham. The opening line favored Northern Illinois by seven points. After being tied at the end of regulation, the game went into two overtime periods and eventually concluded with Northern Illinois winning 44–37. The Huskies were subsequently invited to the 2013 Orange Bowl.|$|E

5|$|The school {{typically}} puts on {{two shows}} each year: a spring performance featuring less advanced students studying circus arts at beginning and intermediate levels, and a late summer show {{to display the}} talents of more advanced students. While the earliest shows were <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on technique and the individual acts, by 1997 or 1998 the school began to emphasize the artistic side of performances, including integrating those acts into Cirque du Soleil-style narratives. The school also hosts an annual gala in late autumn that includes portions of the year's earlier summer performance. Circus Juventas does not utilize animal acts in its shows.|$|E
5|$|US Marines {{conducted}} an amphibious landing at Cape Torokina, {{on the western}} coast of Bougainville, north of Empress Augusta Bay, in November 1943. After an initial counter-attack that was repulsed, the Marines {{had been replaced by}} a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina, establishing a strong perimeter. In March 1944, the Japanese launched a heavy counter-attack, which was turned back with many casualties. After this, the situation on Bougainville became largely static, as the Japanese <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on subsistence, and the US forces chose to adopt a mostly defensive posture aimed at maintaining the perimeter around Torokina.|$|E
5|$|Both the Perfect Works and Ultimania {{books have}} <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on Square and Square Enix's {{role-playing}} video game franchises, {{such as the}} Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series; over 45 of the 75 books are for games related to the Final Fantasy series. Sometimes, multiple books have been written per game or revised editions have been published years afterwards. One of the books, Final Fantasy IX Ultimania Online, was solely published online {{as part of an}} experiment by Square Enix with online content delivery; another for Final Fantasy XI was planned, but the idea was abandoned as unsuccessful and all subsequent books have been published traditionally. The Ultimania series had sold over 10 million books by July 2007. All of the books have been released solely in Japanese, but in October 2017 Dark Horse Books announced that they would be publishing English translations of the three-volume 2012 Final Fantasy 25th Memorial Ultimania as Final Fantasy Ultimania Archive, for release starting in June 2018.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{hoped to}} remain out of {{politics}} {{in order to pay}} off the debts he had incurred during the Panic, but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted. The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on Protestant fears of the possibility of state aid to Catholic schools. Hayes was against such funding and, while he was not known to be personally anti-Catholic, he allowed anti-Catholic fervor to contribute to the enthusiasm for his candidacy. The campaign was a success, and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5,544-vote majority. The first person to earn a third term as Governor of Ohio, Hayes reduced the state debt, re-established the Board of Charities, and repealed the Geghan Bill, which had allowed for the appointment of Catholic priests to schools and penitentiaries.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{began to}} achieve limited success after {{a trip to}} the Etaples art colony in {{northern}} France in 1914. Here, inspired by French art and the local landscape, he began to develop the style and ability that would later identify him as a colourist. However, the onset of the First World War forced him to return to Scotland, where his work became noticed by Alexander Reid of Reid & Lefevre. In 1915, Hunter held his first one-man exhibition with Reid in Glasgow. Hunter's work at this stage of his career <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on still lifes, inspired by Chardin, Kalf and Manet. During the 1920s, Hunter began to be associated with a group of three other artists: John Duncan Fergusson, F. C. B. Cadell, and Samuel Peploe. The four of them became known as the Scottish Colourists, although the term was not used until 1948, by which time only Fergusson was still alive.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Thurman {{founded the}} Aframerican Women’s Journal, the first {{publishing}} vehicle of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), which she edited from 1940 until 1944. In 1941, an archive committee {{was formed to}} design a plan for collecting works about the achievements of African-American women. Though their plans <b>focused</b> <b>primarily</b> on written records and professional accomplishment and would thus reflect middle-class life, the committee initiated work on collecting historical records of black women. In 1944, Thurman became the committee's chair and her mother donated $1,000 toward creating the National Council of Negro Women's National Library, Archives, and Museum. On June 30, 1946, they held an archive drive, printing notices in newsletters and asking ministers, organizations, librarians and others to help them acquire photographs, books and mementos. They opened the first facility of the library at {{what is now the}} Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site.|$|E
