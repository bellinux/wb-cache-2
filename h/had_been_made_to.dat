5|$|By {{the end of}} 1968, the {{prospective}} purchases from the six countries amounted to 1,500 aircraft. Canada and Belgium had departed before any long-term commitments <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the programme; Canada had found the project politically unpalatable; there was a perception in political circles {{that much of the}} manufacturing and specifications were focused on Western Europe. France had made a favourable offer to Belgium on the Dassault Mirage 5, which created doubt as to whether the MRCA would be worthwhile from Belgium's operational perspective.|$|E
5|$|Nothhelm {{oversaw the}} {{reorganisation}} of the Mercian dioceses {{which took place}} in 737. The archbishop consecrated Witta as Bishop of Lichfield and Totta as Bishop of Leicester. The diocese of Leicester was firmly established by this action, although earlier attempts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> establish a bishopric there. In 738, Nothhelm was a witness on the charter of Eadberht I, the King of Kent.|$|E

García Pitarch confessed that there was a verbal agreement that Costa would definitely return at the end of the campaign, and that the deal <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> look permanent in order to give Costa more commitment to his new club.|$|E
5|$|Pioneer {{was ordered}} on 7 August 1942 {{under the name}} Ethalion, but was renamed Mars later in 1942.

5|$|While Argentina's {{finances}} {{were extremely}} strained {{at this juncture}} following the economic crisis in 1953, the most serious setback to the project came in January 1955 when Tank's contract expired. He reputedly requested almost twice as much money to continue but President Perón instead canceled his contract outright. Despite four years of development and trials, the IAe 33 project was still encountering teething problems and its status remained unclear although no final decision <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> abandon a project that had reached iconic stature in the Perónist era.|$|E
5|$|After Stuart Urban {{left the}} {{production}} and the decision <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery {{took the opportunity to}} completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to a greater degree for television.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Augustine consecrated Laurence of Canterbury as his {{successor}} to the archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office. Although {{at the time of}} Augustine's death, 26 May 604, the mission barely extended beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles. Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles. Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Æthelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself. Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.|$|E

5|$|Due to a ban of {{nunchaku}} {{weapons in}} the United Kingdom, his weapon was changed to a three-section staff for European releases of Soul Blade, with a section of staff replacing the chain in terms of appearance. Li Long was initially considered for inclusion for Soulcalibur, however the developers instead decided to focus on creating a new character using the same weapon for the title, resulting in Maxi. Later, due to the character's popularity, Li Long was selected {{to be included in}} home and arcade versions of Soulcalibur III. In an interview, Soulcalibur IV director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated many fans had requested for the character to reappear in the series, though added no plans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> release the character as downloadable content for the title.|$|E
5|$|Early in development, it {{was decided}} that the Jaguar should be offered for export. In 1969, while still in the {{prototype}} stage of development, formal approaches <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Switzerland, India, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, promoting the aircraft for sale. Japan began negotiations towards licensed production of the Jaguar, but these plans failed {{in part because of the}} high royalty payments sought by SEPECAT. A proposal for Turkey to construct Jaguars under licence for their own air force also did not come to fruition. Attempts to export to Kuwait and Pakistan did not transfer into orders. Kuwait initially ordered 50 Jaguars and 16 Mirage 5s, but instead firmed up for F1s. Pakistan approached SEPECAT after the US refused to sell their aircraft of choice, the LTV A-7 Corsair II, due to an arms embargo; Pakistan eventually opted for Mirage 5s.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer {{reported}} that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut {{down one of the}} trunks, causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also {{reported that}} around 1895, cuts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> tap the tree for resin, and a fire lit at its base to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E

5|$|In 1990 the March {{team was}} sold, and {{became known as}} Leyton House. Gugelmin was once again partnered by Capelli, but the team's CG901 chassis proved {{troublesome}} and between them they failed to qualify six times, including at the Mexican Grand Prix. However, at the next race, the French Grand Prix, modifications <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the car which improved the performance. Running the whole race without changing their tyres, Capelli and Gugelmin ran first and second during the race. Gugelmin retired mid-race with engine problems and Capelli was passed by Alain Prost for the lead late in the race. Gugelmin also scored a point for finishing sixth in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Warner Bros. {{announced}} that negotiations <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> produce another installment, {{with the intention}} of having Will Smith reprise his role. In April 2014, the studio attained a script entitled A Garden at the End of the World, described as a post-apocalyptic variation of The Searchers. Studio executives found so many similarities to I Am Legend in the screenplay, they had the writer Gary Graham rewrite it so it could serve as the next film. Serving as a reboot of the story, the studio hopes to create a franchise of films. Will Smith, who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels, has not commented on whether he will appear or not.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1948, the Indian Army {{was sent}} into Hyderabad under Operation Polo {{on the grounds}} that the law and order {{situation}} there threatened the peace of South India. The troops met little resistance by the Razakars and between 13 and 18 September took complete control of the state. The operation led to massive communal violence with estimates of deaths ranging from the official one of 27,000-40,000 to scholarly ones of 200,000 or more. The Nizam was retained as the head of state in the same manner as the other princes who acceded to India. He thereupon disavowed the complaints that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the UN and, despite vehement protests from Pakistan and strong criticism from other countries, the Security Council did not deal further with the question, and Hyderabad was absorbed into India.|$|E
