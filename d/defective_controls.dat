In the work described below, the previous findings are extended and the relationship of the 5 -hydroxy-indole deficiency to the mental defect is examined further. Methods In all, 49 patients with phenylketonuria and 32 mental <b>defective</b> <b>controls</b> were seen. All the con-trols and 26 of the phenylketonurics came from one hospital and these groups were comparable for weight, age and intelligence.

Our study describes {{for the first time}} a critical role in CLL for the KRAB-zinc finger protein ZNF 224. High ZNF 224 transcript levels were detected in CLL patients with respect to control cells. Moreover, ZNF 224 expression was significantly lowered after conventional chemotherapy treatment in a subset of CLL patients. By in vitro experiments we confirmed that ZNF 224 expression is suppressed by fludarabine and demonstrated that ZNF 224 is involved in apoptosis resistance in CLL cells. Moreover, we showed that ZNF 224 positively modulates cyclin D 3 gene expression. Consistently, we observed that alteration of ZNF 224 expression leads to defects in cell cycle control. All together, our results strongly suggest that in CLL cells high expression level of ZNF 224 can lead to inappropriate cell growth and apoptosis resistance, thus contributing to CLL progression. Targeting ZNF 224 could thus improve CLL response to therapy...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate that perilipin (PLIN) 5 is required to couple intramyocellular triacylglycerol lipolysis with the metabolic demand for fatty acids. PLIN 5 ablation depleted triacylglycerol stores but increased sphingolipids including ceramide, hydroxylceramides and sphingomyelin. We generated perilipin 5 (Plin 5) -/- mice to determine the functional significance of PLIN 5 in metabolic control and insulin action. Loss of PLIN 5 {{had no effect on}} body weight, feeding or adiposity but increased whole-body carbohydrate oxidation. Plin 5 -/- mice developed skeletal muscle insulin resistance, which was associated with ceramide accumulation. Liver insulin sensitivity was improved in Plin 5 -/- mice, indicating tissue-specific effects of PLIN 5 on insulin action. We conclude that PLIN 5 plays a critical role in coordinating skeletal muscle triacylglycerol metabolism, which impacts sphingo{{lipid metabolism}}, and is requisite for the maintenance of skeletal muscle insulin action. © 2014 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|During {{oligodendrocyte}} {{precursor cell}} (OPC) differentiation, <b>defective</b> <b>control</b> of the membrane receptor GPR 17 {{has been suggested}} to block cell maturation and impair remyelination under demyelinating conditions. After the immature oligodendrocyte stage, to enable cells to complete maturation, GPR 17 is physiologically down-regulated via phosphorylation/desensitization by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs); conversely, GRKs are regulated by the "mammalian target of rapamycin" mTOR. However, how GRKs and mTOR are connected {{to each other in}} modulating GPR 17 function and oligodendrogenesis has remained elusive. Here we show, for the first time, a role for Murine double minute 2 (Mdm 2), a ligase previously involved in ubiquitination/degradation of the onco-suppressor p 53 protein. In maturing OPCs, both rapamycin and Nutlin- 3, a small molecule inhibitor of Mdm 2 -p 53 interactions, increased GRK 2 sequestration by Mdm 2, leading to impaired GPR 17 down-regulation and OPC maturation block. Thus, Mdm 2 intertwines mTOR with GRK 2 in regulating GPR 17 and oligodendrogenesis and represents a novel actor in myelination...|$|R

PTX 3 -deficient mice showed <b>defective</b> <b>control</b> of UTIs and exacerbated inflammation. Expression of PTX 3 was induced in uroepithelial cells by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) in a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) - and MyD 88 -dependent manner. PTX 3 enhanced UPEC phagocytosis and phagosome maturation by neutrophils. PTX 3 was detected in urine of UTI patients and amounts correlated with disease severity. In cohorts of UTI-prone patients, PTX 3 gene polymorphisms correlated with susceptibility to acute pyelonephritis and cystitis. These results suggest that PTX 3 is an essential component of innate resistance against UTIs. Thus, the cellular and humoral arms of innate immunity exert complementary functions in mediating resistance against UTIs...|$|R

40|$|We used {{high-resolution}} SNP genotyping {{to identify}} regions of genomic gain and {{loss in the}} genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors. We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20 known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that of histone 3, lysine 9 (H 3 K 9). Post-translational modification of histone proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling H 3 K 9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro. Copy number aberrations of genes with critical roles in writing, reading, removing and blocking the state of histone lysine methylation, particularly at H 3 K 9, suggest that <b>defective</b> <b>control</b> of the histone code contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.

However, its role in intestinal metabolism has been largely ignored. To investigate this potential aspect of PPARγ function, we submitted intestinal epithelium-specific PPARγ knockout mice (iePPARγKO) to a twoweek period of 25 % caloric restriction (CR), following which iePPARγKO mice retained more fat than their wild type littermates. In attempting to explain this discrepancy, we analysed the liver, skeletal muscle, intestinal lipid trafficking, and the microbiome, none of which appeared {{to contribute to the}} adiposity phenotype. Interestingly, under conditions of CR, iePPARγKO mice failed to activate their sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and increase CR-specific locomotor activity. These KO mice also manifested a <b>defective</b> <b>control</b> of their body temperature, which was overly reduced. Furthermore, the white adipose tissue of iePPARγKO CR mice showed lower levels of both hormone-sensitive lipase, and its phosphorylated form. This would result from impaired SNS signalling and possibly cause reduced lipolysis. We conclude that intestinal epithelium PPARγ plays an essential role in increasing SNS activity under CR conditions, thereby contributing to energy mobilization during metabolically stressful episodes...|$|R

Autoantibodies inactivate C 1 -INH protein and may dramatically reduce efficacy of replacement therapy with plasma derived C 1 inhibitor. Autoantibodies to C 1 -INH have also been described in absence of angioedema symptoms. They have been found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with lupus-like syndrome and anticardiolipin antibodies and in a patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome: their effect on C 1 -INH function in these conditions is only partially defined. © 2014 Elsevier B.

During the past decade, progressively more evidence has appeared indicating a strong and potentially causal relationship between disturbances of the circadian system and defects of metabolic regulation, including glucose metabolism. The detrimental effects of disturbed circadian rhythms may have their origin in disturbances of the molecular clock mechanisms in peripheral organs, such as the pancreas and liver, or in the central brain clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). To assess the role of SCN output per se on glucose metabolism, we investigated (i) the effect of several SCN neurotransmitters on endogenous glucose production and (ii) the effect of SCN neuronal activity on hepatic and systemic insulin sensitivity. We show that silencing of SCN neuronal activity results in decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity and increased peripheral insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, both oxytocin neurones in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and orexin neurones in the lateral hypothalamus may be important targets for the SCN control of glucose metabolism. These data further highlight the role of the central clock in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance...|$|R

40|$|The {{etiology}} of SLE {{is not fully}} established. SLE is a disease with periods of waning disease activity and intermittent flares. This fits well in theory to a latent virus infection, which occasionally switches to lytic cycle, and EBV infection has for long been suspected to be involved. This paper reviews EBV immunobiology and how this is related to SLE pathogenesis by illustrating uncontrolled reactivation of EBV as a disease mechanism for SLE. Studies on EBV in SLE patients show enlarged viral load, abnormal expression of viral lytic genes, impaired EBV-specific T-cell response, and increased levels of EBV-directed antibodies. These results suggest a role for reactivation of EBV infection in SLE. The increased level of EBV antibodies especially comprises an elevated titre of IgA antibodies, and {{the total number of}} EBV-reacting antibody isotypes is also enlarged. As EBV is known to be controlled by cell-mediated immunity, the reduced EBV-specific T-cell response in SLE patients may result in <b>defective</b> <b>control</b> of EBV causing frequent reactivation and expression of lytic cycle antigens. This gives rise to enhanced apoptosis and amplified cellular waste load resulting in activation of an immune response and development of EBV-directed antibodies and autoantibodies to cellular antigens...|$|R

However, the further neutralization of IFN-γ diminishes {{the effectiveness of the}} CD 4 + T cell response and causes substantially increased mortality. Experiments with bone marrow radiation chimeras indicate that the immune CD 4 + effectors operate optimally when there is the potential for direct interaction with virus-infected targets expressing MHC class II glycoproteins, suggesting that the IFN-γ produced by these lymphocytes is functioning at short range. The numbers of latently infected cells in the spleens of carrier mice are also significantly increased by the concurrent depletion of both the CD 4 + population and IFN-γ. These experiments raise the possibility that the <b>defective</b> <b>control</b> of intercurrent γ-herpesvirus infections in patients with AIDS not only is due solely to the absence of helper T cells but also reflects the loss of an important set of CD 4 + effectors...|$|R

FH-deficient mice have uncontrolled plasma C 3 activation and spontaneously develop MPGN 2 but not aHUS. We show that these mice, transgenically expressing a mouse FH protein functionally equivalent to aHUS-associated human FH mutants, regulate C 3 activation in plasma and spontaneously develop aHUS but not MPGN 2. These animals represent the first model of aHUS and provide in vivo evidence that effective plasma C 3 regulation and the <b>defective</b> <b>control</b> of complement activation on renal endothelium are the critical events in the molecular pathogenesis of FH-associated aHUS...|$|R

In addition, long-range histone acetylation patterns {{can be established}} over many kilobases of the chromatin of linked families of genes that are under common transcriptional control. It is not known whether establishment of long-range histone acetylation patterns is limited to gene families or is a common feature of many genes. The Ifng gene is not {{known to be a}} member of a gene family but exhibits complex strain-, cell lineage-, and stimulus-dependent regulation. For example, stimulation of naive T cells through their antigen receptor does not initiate Ifng gene transcription. However, stimulation of naive T cells through their antigen and IL- 12 receptors initiates differentiation programs that yield effector cells with 100 -fold greater rates of transcription of the Ifng gene after stimulation through the antigen receptor. Here, we demonstrate that these differentiation programs establish long-range histone hyperacetylation patterns that extend at least 50 kb in both upstream and downstream directions of the Ifng gene. Establishment of these histone acetylation patterns and Ifng gene expression is relatively IL- 12 -independent in T cells from autoimmuneprone nonobese diabetic mice.

The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), a widely used animal model of essential hypertension, has a global defect in insulin action on glucose metabolism and shows reduced catecholamine action on lipolysis in fat cells. In our study we used cellular defects in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism to dissect the genetics of defective insulin and catecholamine action in the SHR strain.

As the SHR strain manifests many of the defining features of human metabolic Syndrome X, in which hypertension associates with insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and abdominal obesity, the identification of genes for defective insulin and catecholamine action in SHR may facilitate gene identification in this syndrome and in related human conditions, such as type- 2 diabetes and familial combined hyperlipidaemia...|$|R

Arabidopsis thaliana RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH 1 (RCD 1) has been proposed to regulate plant stress responses by protein-protein interactions with transcription factors. Furthermore, the rcd 1 mutant has <b>defective</b> <b>control</b> of cell death in response to apoplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Combining transcriptomic and functional genomics approaches we first used microarray analysis in a time series to study changes in gene expression after apoplastic ROS treatment in rcd 1. To identify a core set of cell death regulated genes, RCD 1 -regulated genes were clustered together with other array experiments from plants undergoing cell death or treated with various pathogens, plant hormones or other chemicals. Subsequently, selected rcd 1 double mutants were constructed to further define the genetic requirements for the execution of apoplastic ROS induced cell death. Through the genetic analysis we identified WRKY 70 and SGT 1 b as cell death regulators functioning downstream of RCD 1 and show that quantitative rather than qualitative differences in gene expression related to cell death appeared to better explain the outcome.

It {{is believed that}} low expression of duodenal ferritin in GH is caused by tissue or cell specific defect of ferritin synthesis. Our {{study was designed to}} ascertain whether the control of duodenal ferritin synthesis in GH was defective. Methods: Expression at the single cell level of H and L ferritin messenger RNAs and protein and activity of the iron regulatory factor, which controls the translation of ferritin messenger RNA, were assessed in 43 duodenal biopsy specimens from individuals with GH, secondary hemochromatosis (SH), anemia, or normal iron balance. Results: Signal for ferritin H and L subunit messenger RNAs was detected in both absorptive and nonabsorptive cells by in situ hybridization, but in 10 of 14 patients with untreated GH, the signal was lower than in patients with SH or normal subjects. However, immunostaining for ferritin protein documented a diffuse/cytoplasmic pattern, whereas a supranuclear/granular staining was found in normal subjects or patients with SH. The spontaneous activity of duodenal iron regulatory factor was consistently higher in patients with GH than in normal subjects or subjects with anemia or SH. Conclusions: In patients with GH, ferritin gene transcription is preserved in both absorptive and nonabsorptive intestinal cells. Low accumulation of ferritin is not caused by a <b>defective</b> <b>control</b> of ferritin synthesis but by low expression of ferritin messenger RNA and sustained activity of iron regulatory factor...|$|R
