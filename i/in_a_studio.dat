5|$|After an {{audition}} process, Rob Wiethoff {{was selected to}} portray John Marston. The cast's performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology, with additional dialogue and sound effects recorded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio.</b> Red Dead Redemption also features an original score, which was composed by Bill Elm and Woody Jackson, collaborating with each other over fifteen months. Rockstar also consulted musicians who played traditional Western instruments, such as harmonica player Tommy Morgan.|$|E
5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested on small wooden models viewed through a periscope <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio.</b> Most {{of the model}} designs were painted by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Several {{major feature}} films have been filmed in the city, {{including}} Kick the Moon, On the Occasion of Remembering the Turning Gate, Taegukgi, Chwihwaseon and others. In 2009, {{the filming of}} the Queen Seondeok, a popular MBC TV series took place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio</b> at Silla Millennium Park located in Bomun Lake Resort.|$|E
5|$|The filming {{was done}} at two hospitals, the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke. This {{presented}} a problem because the show had to work around the real-life hospitals, with their actual doctors, patients and emergency situations. In one scene in the final episode in series one, Guy (Mangan) was hitting squash balls behind him, and nearly hit a patient. However, some scenes, {{such as those in}} Sue's and Alan's offices, were filmed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio.</b>|$|E

The Puerto Rico scenes were shot a day after Stefani's concert in the city, as part of The Sweet Escape Tour, on July 19, 2007. Many parts of the video were shot <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio,</b> including scenes of Stefani riding a motorcycle {{in front of a}} green screen.

5|$|Women {{did not win}} non-gender {{specific}} awards until 1896 when Hazelton won the National Academy of Design Hallgarten Prize for her {{oil painting}} <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Studio.</b> It {{was determined to be}} the best oil painted made by a person under the age of 35 in the United States that year. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston awarded her the first Paige Traveling Scholarship in 1899. Hazelton won an Honorable Mention at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, {{film and}} stage {{productions}} appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It {{has long been}} said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written {{in collaboration with the}} English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio</b> and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.|$|E

5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia stands in a pose which Etty had sketched many times, that {{of a woman with}} her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a woman in this pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish {{than the rest of the}} canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio</b> kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E
5|$|Shooting for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari {{began at}} the end of December 1919 and {{concluded}} {{at the end of}} January 1920. It was shot entirely <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio</b> without any exterior shots, which was unusual for films of the time, but dictated by the decision to give the film an Expressionist visual style. The extent to which Mayer and Janowitz participated during filming is disputed: Janowitz claims the duo repeatedly refused to allow any script changes during production, and Pommer claimed Mayer was on the set for every day of filming. But Hermann Warm claimed they were never present for any of the shooting or involved in any discussions during production.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor Who campfire trailer is a forty-second {{television}} trailer {{which promoted}} the fourth {{series of the}} British science fiction television series Doctor Who.

The trailer was produced alongside three thematically similar but separate teaser trailers. The teaser trailers premiered in cinemas and on BBC One on 22 March 2008, and the full trailer premiered on BBC Online on 29 March 2008.|$|E
5|$|The set of CTU was {{initially}} filmed in a Fox Sports office, with the set recreated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio</b> in Woodland Hills after {{the series was}} picked up. The same set {{was used for the}} first three seasons, but production moved to an old pencil factory in Chatsworth {{before the start of the}} fourth season and the CTU set was redesigned. It was redesigned again before the start of the eighth season. Other sets were also constructed here, such as Charles Logan's presidential retreat shown in seasons five and six, and the White House bunker shown in seasons four and six.|$|E
5|$|Tobin began {{performing}} live {{shows in}} clubs with other Ninja Tune artists after releasing his second album, Bricolage. His shows generally contained music {{that he had}} produced during his career, mixed with modified songs from drum and bass, hip-hop, or other genres. Because his music was entirely produced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio</b> with electronics, Tobin {{was not interested in}} adapting his music to suit a Live PA incorporating musicians. He instead used turntables which he felt had more in common with his approach to music production. He is known for building Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound speaker systems for his performances.|$|E

And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
5|$|Wirkola got {{the idea}} to create a film based on the adult lives of Hansel and Gretel in 2007 while at film school in Australia. After being {{discovered}} by Gary Sanchez Productions, Wirkola pitched the idea at a meeting with Paramount Pictures and won a contract. Production began in March 2011 at the Babelsberg Studios in Germany and included extensive use of traditional special effects. In addition, Renner and Arterton had a month of training beforehand {{to prepare for the}} physical demands of their roles. In terms of the weapons and wardrobe, Wirkola wanted an old-world look with a modern touch, and he was adamant about filming outdoors in European nature rather than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio.</b> The project was filmed in Germany and featured an international cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|In March 2004 Kelly {{performed}} across North America, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles. This {{was followed}} by a more extensive series of shows between July and September throughout North America and Europe. In December, in Melbourne, Kelly performed 100 of his songs in alphabetical order over two nights. A similar set of shows were performed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studio</b> at Sydney Opera House in December 2006, these and similar sets became known as his A to Z shows. Foggy Highway was a second bluegrass-oriented album for Kelly, credited to Paul Kelly and the Stormwater Boys and issued in 2005. It peaked at No.23 on the ARIA albums charts. The line-up {{for the majority of the}} tracks was Kelly, Mick Albeck (fiddle), James Gillard (bass guitar), Rod McCormack (guitar), Ian Simpson (banjo), and Trev Warner (mandolin). As with Smoke (his previous bluegrass release), Foggy Highway consisted of a mix of new compositions and rearranged Kelly classics. The Canadian edition of the release included a four-song bonus EP of out-takes.|$|E
