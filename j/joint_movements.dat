For the present work, 30 clinically diagnosed patients were selected and randomly divided into three groups. Group A treated with Laksha Guggulu orally, Group B treated with snehana & swedana traction, Group C treated with Laksha Guggulu, Snehana, Swedana & Knee Joint Traction.

40|$|Background: A {{fracture}} or frequently, {{called as}} a broken bone is a discontinuity of bone tissue and/or cartilage. Causes of it are, among the other, bone fragility because of osteoporosis disease and it is, usually, experienced in adulthood and also, it {{is caused by}} an unsuspected incident. Femur fracture is more likely occurred in male than female under 45 years old and frequently, it has correlation with sport, occupation or incident. Purpose: To know physiotherapeutic administration in attempts of relieving pain, improving range of <b>joint</b> <b>movement,</b> and enhancing muscle strength in case of 1 / 3 distal femur dextra fracture by using modalities of Infrared and exercising therapy (static contraction, passive and active movements). Result: After six times of the therapies, relieving of stationary pain, pressure pain, and movement pain, and enhancement of muscle strength and improvement of range of <b>joint</b> <b>movement</b> were found. Conclusion: Infrared and static contraction can relieve pain and exercise therapy (hold relax, active and passive movement) can enhance muscle strength, improve range of <b>joint</b> <b>movement</b> in case of 1 / 3 distal femur dextra fracture. ...|$|R

Exercises are prescribed by both PTs and OTs to increase the range a child can move a joint and strengthen the joint to decrease pain and stiffness and prevent further limitations in their <b>joint</b> <b>movements.</b> OTs can provide children with age-appropriate games and activities to allow the children to practice their exercises while playing and socializing with friends.

50|$|The ulnar {{collateral}} ligament has its apex on {{the medial}} epicondyle. Its anterior band stretches from the anterior {{side of the}} medial epicondyle to the medial edge of the coronoid process, while the posterior band stretches from posterior side of the medial epicondyle to the medial side of the olecranon. These two bands are separated by a thinner intermediate part and their distal attachments are united by a transverse band below which the synovial membrane protrudes during <b>joint</b> <b>movements.</b> The anterior band is {{closely associated with the}} tendon of the superficial flexor muscles of the forearm, even being the origin of flexor digitorum superficialis.

Eccentric exercises improve the tensile strength of the tendon and lengthen the muscle-tendon junction, decreasing the amount of strain experienced with ankle <b>joint</b> <b>movements.</b> These involve repetitions of slowly raising and lowering the body while standing on the affected leg, using the opposite arm to assist balance and support if necessary, and starting with the heel in a hyperextended position.

50|$|ITB TherapyIntrathecal {{baclofen}} (ITB) {{therapy is}} used to treat a variety of movement disorders such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. It {{can also be a}} possibility to help treat hemiballismus. In one case, before ITB the patient had an average of 10-12 ballism episodes of the right lower limb per hour. During episodes, the right hip would flex up to about 90 degrees, with a fully extended knee. After an ITB pump was implanted and the correct dosage was found, the frequency of ballistic right leg movements decreased to about three per day, and the right hip flexed to only 30 degrees. The patient was also able to better isolate individual distal <b>joint</b> <b>movements</b> in the right lower limb. The patient currently receives 202.4 microg/day of ITB and continues to benefit almost 6 years after the ITB pump was implanted.|$|E
5000|$|Current methodologic {{projects}} {{focus on}} the use of iterative image reconstruction techniques for non-cartesian MRI (e.g., undersampled radial MRI) and parallel MRI that define the reconstruction process as a nonlinear inverse problem. Other developments address the possibility of real-time MRI in order to overcome the motion sensitivity of conventional MRI acquisitions and to monitor organ movements in real time. Most recent achievements in real-time MRI are based on FLASH techniques with highly undersampled radial data encodings. When combined with image reconstruction by regularized nonlinear inversion, they allow for movies of the human heart with image acquisition times as short as 20 milliseconds, which correspond to MRI movies with 50 frames per second. Such real-time movies may continuously be recorded during free breathing, without ECG synchronization, and without motion artifacts. Apart from cardiac applications and quantitative measurements of blood flow in real time, multiple examples ranging from studies of <b>joint</b> <b>movements</b> and swallowing to brass playing and interactive real-time MRI can be found here: Biomedizinische NMR Forschungs GmbH.

50|$|After {{the history}} of massage, he has a section {{discussing}} {{different parts of the}} body and how they should be manipulated. After this, there is space devoted to laying out what the pupil should study and examine so as to become better at the art. The effects of massage on the participant's body are explored, and special attention is paid to particular benefits, such as fighting or holding off certain illnesses. This is an idea Kellogg advocated for in many different contexts besides just this book. The actual practice of massage is broken down into the specific movements that a masseur could use to achieve different effects, such as kneading or stroking. <b>Joint</b> <b>movements</b> are considered, and then the piece delves into how to massage separate parts of the body. There are special massages for each distinct body part he focuses on. Kellogg believes that the techniques are important for every part of the body, whether it is necessary to perform the practice on that area or by massaging {{other parts of the body}} that are connected to it. The list includes the arm, chest, leg, abdomen, hip, and back, and each associated massage is very specific and has many intricate instructions.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} mainly on contralesional somatosensory and motor function after hemispherectomy. So far, ipsilesional impairments have received little attention even though these {{have been reported in}} patients with less extensive lesions. In the current study we assessed ipsilesional and contralesional sensorimotor function in a group of 12 patients with hemispherectomy. In addition, we focused on differences between distal and proximal function and investigated several factors that may have contributed to individual differences between patients. The tests included tapping, force production, tactile double simultaneous stimulation, pressure sensitivity, passive <b>joint</b> <b>movement</b> sense and sensitivity to hot and cold. Ipsilesional impairments were found on all tests, except passive <b>joint</b> <b>movement</b> sense. Unexpectedly, no significant ipsilateral distal-proximal gradient was found for any of the measures. Both the removal of the diseased cerebral hemisphere and possible changes to the remaining brain structures may have affected ipsilesional sensorimotor function. Contralesional performance was impaired on all tests except for passive <b>joint</b> <b>movement</b> in the shoulder. The contralesional impairments were characterized by a distal-proximal gradient measured on all tests, except that of sensitivity to hot and cold. Distal function was always most impaired. The difference between distal and proximal motor function is in agreement with the established concepts of the motor pathways, with the motoneurons innervating proximal muscles receiving bilateral cortical and subcortical input. Age at onset of original brain damage correlated significantly with passive <b>joint</b> <b>movement</b> sense. Patients with known abnormalities to the remaining brain structures performed inferior on the tapping test only. No effect was found of the hemispheric side of removal...|$|R
