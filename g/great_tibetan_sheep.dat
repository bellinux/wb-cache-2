A {{comparison}} of nitrogen utilization and urea metabolism between <b>Tibetan</b> and fine-wool <b>sheep.</b> Journal of Animal Science, 93 (6), 3006 - 3017. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2014 - 8865 To study metabolic adaptation to harsh foraging conditions, an experiment {{was conducted to}} characterize and quantify N utilization efficiency and urea metabolism in <b>Tibetan</b> and fine-wool <b>sheep</b> fed 4 levels of dietary N (11. 0, 16. 7, 23. 1, and 29. 2 g N/kg DM) in 2 concurrent 4 x 4 Latin square designs. Urea kinetics were determined using continuous intrajugular infusions of (NN) -N- 15 -N- 15 -urea. Urinary excretions of total N and urea N increased linearly (P = 0. 37). Fecal N excretion increased with dietary N for <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> but not for fine-wool sheep (linear dietary N x breed; P < 0. 05). Nitrogen retention (both amount per day and percentage of N intake) increased with increasing dietary N concentration (P < 0. 001), and the rates of increase were greater in fine-wool than in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> (linear dietary N x breed and cubic dietary N x breed; P < 0. 05). In <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep,</b> N retention {{as a percentage of}} intake was greatest for diets containing 16. 7 g N/kg DM, whereas it was maximal for fine-wool sheep when the diet contained 23. 1 g N/kg DM. Urea N entry rate, urea N recycled to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and urea N returned to the ornithine cycle all increased with dietary N (P < 0. 05), and all were <b>greater</b> in <b>Tibetan</b> than fine-wool <b>sheep</b> for the 11. 0 g N/kg DM diet but were greater in fine-wool than <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> for the diet with 29. 2 g N/kg DM (linear dietary N x breed; P < 0. 05). Urea N excreted in feces, both amount and fraction of GIT entry rate, was less in <b>Tibetan</b> than finewool <b>sheep</b> for the 11. 0 and 16. 7 g N/kg DM diets but similar for diets with 23. 1 or 29. 2 g N/kg DM (linear dietary N x breed; P < 0. 01). For the lowest-protein diet, the fraction of urea N production recycled to the GIT was <b>greater</b> in the <b>Tibetan</b> than fine-wool <b>sheep</b> (88 % vs. 82 %), but for the diet with 29. 2 g N/kg DM it was greater for fine-wool than <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> (46 % vs. 39 %; linear dietary N x breed; P < 0. 05). Plasma urea N increased more rapidly in response to increasing dietary N concentration for fine-wool <b>sheep</b> than for <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> (linear dietary N x breed; P < 0. 05). Urea tubular load and the amount and percentage of urea reabsorbed by the kidney were <b>greater</b> in <b>Tibetan</b> than fine-wool <b>sheep</b> (P < 0. 05). These results suggest that <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> have mechanisms that allow them to utilize N more efficiently than the fine-wool sheep when dietary N is inadequate...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{and population}} genetic {{evidence of the}} phylogenetic status of the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> (Ovis aries) is not well understood, and {{little is known about}} this species' genetic diversity. This knowledge gap is partly due to the difficulty of sample collection. This is the first work to address this question. Here, the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship of 636 individual <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> from fifteen populations were assessed using 642 complete sequences of the mitochondrial DNA D-loop. Samples were collected from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau area in China, and reference data were obtained from the six reference breed sequences available in GenBank. The length of the sequences varied considerably, between 1031 and 1259 bp. The haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were 0. 992 ± 0. 010 and 0. 019 ± 0. 001, respectively. The average number of nucleotide differences was 19. 635. The mean nucleotide composition of the 350 haplotypes was 32. 961 % A, 29. 708 % T, 22. 892 % C, 14. 439 % G, 62. 669 % A+T, and 37. 331 % G+C. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all four previously defined haplogroups (A, B, C, and D) were found in the 636 individuals of the fifteen <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> populations but that only the D haplogroup was found in Linzhou sheep. Further, the clustering analysis divided the fifteen <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> populations into at least two clusters. The estimation of the demographic parameters from the mismatch analyses showed that haplogroups A, B, and C had at least one demographic expansion in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep.</b> These results contribute to the knowledge of <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> populations and will help inform future conservation programs about the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> native to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau...|$|R
40|$|Bluetongue (BT), {{caused by}} {{bluetongue}} virus (BTV), is an arthropod-borne viral disease in ruminants. However, information about BTV infection in yaks in China is limited. Moreover, no such data concerning BTV in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> is available. Therefore, 3771 serum {{samples were collected}} from 2187 <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> and 1584 yaks between April 2013 and March 2014 from Tibetan Plateau, western China, and tested for BTV antibodies using a commercially available ELISA kit. The overall seroprevalence of BTV was 17. 34 % (654 / 3771), with 20. 3 % (443 / 2187) in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> and 13. 3 % (211 / 1584) in yaks. In the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> group, the seroprevalence of BTV in Luqu, Maqu, Tianzhu, and Nyingchi Prefecture was 20. 3 %, 20. 8 %, 20. 5 %, and 19. 1 %, respectively. The seroprevalence of BTV in different season groups varied from 16. 5 % to 23. 4 %. In the yak group, BTV seroprevalence was 12. 6 %, 15. 5 %, and 11. 0 % in Tianzhu, Maqu, and Luqu counties, respectively. The seroprevalence in different seasons was 12. 6 %, 15. 5 %, 15. 4 %, and 9. 0 % in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. The season was the major risk factor concerning BTV infection in yaks (P< 0. 05). The date of the BTV seroprevalence in <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> and yaks provides baseline information for controlling BT in ruminants in western China...|$|R

This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} effect of dietary types (crude protein levels) on feed intakes, growth performance and economic returns of local <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> and yaks during cold season. Twenty-four yearling <b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep</b> (25. 29 ± 3. 95 kg LW) and twenty two-year-old yaks (100. 62 ± 4. 55 kg LW) with familiar body conditions {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups, fed oats hay (OH), oats silage (OS), total mixed ration (TMR) and traditionally grazed on the local cool-season pasture (TG), respectively, over a 135 -day experiment. Daily dry matter intake was determined; all animals were weighed at the beginning and every 15 days of the 135 -day experiment. Then, the total live-weight gain, average daily live-weight gain, gain rate, feed efficiency and net economic benefit were calculated. Results indicated that feed and nutrient intakes (DMI, DMI/kg LW, DMI/kg LW 0. 75 and CPI) of TMR, OH and OS were higher than TG (P 0. 05). Results indicated that TMR was a reasonable diet in promoting feed intakes, animal performance, feed efficiency and economic returns in domestic livestock, which should be considered by local herdsmen to increase their breeding profit during cold season...|$|R

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, noncoding RNAs that {{regulate}} various biological processes including adipogenesis and fat metabolism. Here, we adopted a deep sequencing approach {{to determine the}} identity and abundance of miRNAs involved in fat deposition in adipose tissues from fat-tailed (Kazakhstan sheep, KS) and thin-tailed (<b>Tibetan</b> <b>sheep,</b> TS) sheep breeds. By comparing HiSeq data of these two breeds, 539 miRNAs were shared in both breeds, whereas 179 and 97 miRNAs were uniquely expressed in KS and TS, respectively. We also identified 35 miRNAs that {{are considered to be}} putative novel miRNAs. The integration of miRNA-mRNA analysis revealed that miRNA-associated targets were mainly involved in the gene ontology (GO) biological processes concerning cellular process and metabolic process, and miRNAs play critical roles in fat deposition through their ability to regulate fundamental pathways. These pathways included the MAPK signaling pathway, FoxO and Wnt signaling pathway, and focal adhesion. Taken together, our results define miRNA expression signatures that may contribute to fat deposition and lipid metabolism in sheep...|$|R
