50|$|A <b>double</b> <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> (double slip) is a narrow-angled {{diagonal}} flat {{crossing of}} two lines combined with four pairs of points {{in such a}} way as to allow vehicles to change from one straight track to the other, as well as going straight across. A train approaching the arrangement may leave by either of the two tracks on the opposite side of the crossing. To reach the third possible exit, the train must change tracks on the slip and then reverse.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{disadvantages}} over both the <b>double</b> inside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> and the scissors crossover, <b>double</b> outside <b>slip</b> <b>switches</b> are only used in rare, specific cases.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was capable}} of using either an over-running or under-running third rail by means of retractable shoes operated by pneumatic cylinders. The shoes were retracted to the vertical position outside of third rail territory: if extended, electrically live shoes would have projected towards the low-level station platforms that were the norm until the 1970s. A few early examples were fitted with a small DC pantograph for use within New York City's Grand Central Terminal, where long gaps exist in the third rail because of the complex trackage that includes numerous single and <b>double</b> <b>slip</b> <b>switches</b> and <b>double</b> track ladders. These pantographs were soon removed. The complex trackage remains, but the overhead power rails are long gone.|$|R
50|$|An outside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> {{is similar}} to the <b>double</b> or single <b>slip</b> <b>switches</b> {{described}} above, except that the switch blades are outside of the diamond instead of inside. An advantage over an inside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> is that trains can pass the slips with higher speeds. A disadvantage over an inside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> is that they are longer and need more space.|$|R
50|$|A single <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as a <b>double</b> <b>slip,</b> but provides for only one switching possibility. Trains approaching {{on one of the}} two crossing tracks can either continue over the crossing, or switch tracks to the other line. However, trains from the other track can only continue over the crossing, and cannot switch tracks. This is normally used to allow access to sidings and improve safety by avoiding having switch blades facing the usual direction of traffic. To reach the sidings from what would be a facing direction, trains must continue over the crossing, then reverse along the curved route (usually onto the other line of a double track) and can then move forward over the crossing into the siding.|$|R

5000|$|The name {{square knot}} {{is often used}} for the unslipped version of reef knot. Reef knot itself then is {{understood}} as the single slipped version, while the name shoelace knot is to indicate <b>double</b> <b>slipped</b> version. Sometimes the name bowtie also {{may be used to}} indicate a <b>double</b> <b>slipped</b> version, but tying a bowtie is usually performed on flat material, and involves a slip knot of one end holding a bight of the other end i.e. not really a <b>double</b> <b>slipped</b> reef knot. The name [...] "Square knot" [...] is also used for completely different other knots such as the mathematical concept of square knot, or friendship knot; this last one earns the name by being flat and drawing a square on one face (and a cross on the other face).|$|R

The e®ect of {{size and}} slip system con¯guration on the tensile {{stress-strain}} response of micron-sized planar crystals as obtained from discrete dislocation plasticity simulations is presented. The crystals are oriented for either single or symmetric <b>double</b> <b>slip.</b> With {{the rotation of}} the tensile axis unconstrained, there is a strong size dependence, with the °ow strength increasing with decreasing specimen size. Below a certain specimen size, the °ow strength of the crystals is set by the nucleation strength of the initially present Frank-Read sources.

In the mid-1920s, the track system had grown to include three mainline and eight sidings with 19 single <b>slip</b> and three <b>double</b> <b>slip</b> sets of points.

Both single <b>slip</b> and symmetric <b>double</b> <b>slip</b> are considered.

In the discrete dislocation formulation the dislocations are all of edge character and are modeled as line singularities in an elastic material. Dislocation nucleation, the lattice resistance to dislocation motion and dislocation annihilation are incorporated into the formulation {{through a set of}} constitutive rules. A complementary solution that enforces the boundary conditions is obtained via the finite element method.

40|$|Many of {{the most}} {{important}} and commonly occurring, emergent geological structures such as shear bands, fault zones and folds may be understood as a consequence of changes in the type of the governing model equations. Such changes, or bifurcations, depend strongly on the details of the constitutive relationships including the presence of strain softening, thermal or chemical effects, and whether the flow rule is associated or non-associated, coaxial or non-coaxial. Here we focus on the influence of noncoaxiality of the flow rule on the development and evolution of shear bands. The term non-coaxial refers to the noncoincidence of the principal axes of the stress and of the plastic strain rate tensor. Non coaxial plasticity models were originally proposed by Josselin de Jong and A. J. M. Spencer. The geometric structure of most non-coaxial models is defined by the assumption that the plastic deformation is carried by one (single <b>slip)</b> or two (<b>double</b> <b>slip)</b> slip systems that are inclined ±(π/ 4 +v/ 2), 0 ≤ v ≤ φ to the less compressive principal stress axis; φ is the internal angle of friction of the material. Both cases-Csingle and double slip-C are considered here. A particular feature of the <b>double</b> <b>slip</b> model is the appearance of an additional variable requiring an additional constitutive relationship. Geometrically, the additional variablemay be interpreted as a spin. Spencer assumed that, in 2 D, the additional spin is equal to the rate of rotation of the principal axes of the stress tensor. Here we show that Spencer 2 ̆ 7 s assumption is very similar (up to a factor of proportionality) to the assumption that the internal slip systems arematerial. We also propose an alternative closure, based on experimental observations, indicating that the ratio between the average particle spin and the spin of a spatial element of the granular assembly is constant, in simple shear. Finally, we propose a closure for the <b>double</b> <b>slip</b> model within the framework of a Cosserat Continuum theory. In a Cosserat continuum, a material point possesses the degrees of freedom of an infinitesimal rigid body: three translations and three rotations. In this case the indeterminacy of the <b>double</b> <b>slip</b> model is removed by the angular momentum balance equation associated with the rotational degrees of freedom. We propose constitutive relationships for the Cosserat model and illustrate the behavior of the model by means of an analytical solution of the simple shear problem...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{recently}} proposed a nonlocal continuum crystal plasticity theory for single slip, {{which is based}} on a statistical-mechanics description of the collective behavior of dislocations in two dimensions. In the present paper we address the extension of the theory from single slip to multiple slip. Continuum dislocation dynamics in multiple slip is defined and coupled to the small-strain framework of conventional continuum crystal plasticity. Dislocation nucleation, the material resistance to dislocation glide and dislocation annihilation are included in the formulation. Various nonlocal interaction laws between different slip systems are considered on phenomenological grounds. To validate the theory we compare with the results of dislocation simulations of two boundary value problems. One problem is simple shearing of a crystalline strip constrained between two rigid and impenetrable walls. Key features are the formation of boundary layers and the size dependence of the response in the case of symmetric <b>double</b> <b>slip.</b> The other problem is bending of a single crystal strip under <b>double</b> <b>slip.</b> The bending moment versus rotation angle and the evolution of the dislocation structure are analyzed for different slip orientations and specimen sizes...|$|R
