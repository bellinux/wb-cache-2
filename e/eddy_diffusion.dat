This crystalline solid (wax) may block the pores in the formation and significantly affect the oil productivity. Several studies have been conducted on the mechanism of wax deposition in and around the wellbore. Experimental measurements have shown that most of these previous analytical models under-estimate elemental Wax build up rate at different radial distance around the wellbore while the minimum blockage time was over-estimated. This paper presented an improved analytical model for predicting the rate of deposition of wax inside a wellbore or pipeline from a crude oil at different operating temperatures, which also allows the selection of the temperature with minimum deposition rate as system or operating temperature, by assuming an equimolecular counter-diffusion condition at the interface between the solute (solid phase) and the solvent (liquid phase), this is known as Penetration theory. Using a Penetration theory to predict wax deposition rate will be a new dimension in wax deposition modelling, since most of the researchers depend solely on using steady state Fick’s first law of molecular diffusion, chain’s rule and thermodynamic models for their predictions whereas Penetration theory is based on using circulating or eddy currents present in a turbulent fluid (<b>eddies</b> <b>diffusion),</b> combining with unsteady state Fick’s second law, without the inclusion of chain rule...|$|R

40|$|Problems {{exist in}} {{estimating}} the eddy heat transport coefficient, K eh, from experimental data. These problems {{are due to}} uncertainty in determining the turbulent energy dissipation rate and to the uncertainty of K eh dependence on the energy dissipation rate. In this paper, a new criterion for estimating the eddy heat transport coefficient is suggested. This criterion {{is based on the}} effect of eddy turbulence on the energy budget of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The calculations show high cooling around and above the K eh peak for K eh values inferred from experimental data. The cooling rates are much higher than cooling rates corresponding to the temperature given by the MSIS-E- 90 model or to temperatures measured during the experiments. The main contribution to high cooling rates is due to the term with eddy heat conduction, which strongly depends on the K eh gradient. According to our results, the heating/cooling values below the K eh peak altitude correspond to the temperature given by the MSIS-E- 90 model, but at the peak and above, the cooling rates are larger by a factor of 2 – 3 than the rates corresponding to the temperatures. This means that the K eh values in the peak and above may be overestimated.

When the solid is denser than the liquid (and therefore collects at the bottom of the tank), the impeller is rotated so that the fluid is pushed downwards; when the solid is less dense than the liquid (and therefore floats on top), the impeller is rotated so that the fluid is pushed upwards (though this is relatively rare). The equipment preferred for solid suspension produces large volumetric flows but not necessarily high shear; high flow-number turbine impellers, such as hydrofoils, are typically used.

50|$|Mesoscale {{cellular}} convection (MCC) {{is a form}} of buoyantly driven convection {{that can}} provide the planetary boundary layer with cumulus clouds {{at the top of the}} boundary layer. MCC generally occurs over ocean regions and is primarily found off the coasts of major continents particularly in North and South America.MCC {{is a form of}} the Bénard cell where the fluid will rise or fall in hexagonal cells creating hexagonal cloud structure. The capping inversion of the planetary boundary layer acts as a lid for the convection creating a horizontal plane for the hexagonal cloud structures. Satellite observations have been imperative for understanding the horizontal scale and the vertical scale of these cloud formations. MCC is generally too small for synoptic scale measurements, but too large for single point measurements. However, satellite observations are able to monitor the development of the cloud patterns because of their large field of view. Satellites images from TIROS helped to highlight one of the main differences between laboratory convection cells and those that occur in the atmosphere. The ratio of the diameter of the hexagon compared to the depth of the cloud was much larger in the atmosphere compared to the same ratio calculated in controlled experiments. This difference showed that viscosity and heat conduction were important for the laboratory measurements, but <b>eddy</b> <b>diffusion</b> of heat and momentum dominated the atmospheric cells.

We address the question how the <b>eddy</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficients {{are related to the}} properties of the circulation. For the atmosphere of a slowly rotating planet such as Venus, we show that a form of the non-linear closure is suggested by the mixing length hypothesis, which constrains the magnitude of the <b>eddy</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficients. Combining this constraint with the concept of the Rossby radius of deformation yields zonal velocities on the order of 100 m sec - 1. A steady state, non-linear, one-layer spectral model is used for a parametric study to find a relationship between heat source, meridional circulation and <b>eddy</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficients, which yields the large zonal velocities observed. This analysis leads to the following conclusions: (1) Proportional changes in the heat source and <b>eddy</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficients do not significantly change the zonal velocities. (2) The meridional velocity is virtually constant for large <b>eddy</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficients. (3) Below a threshold in the diffusion rate, the meridional velocity decreases, commensurate with the mixing length hypothesis. Eddy heat conduction becomes important and shares with the Hadley cell advection in balancing the solar heating. The zonal velocities then reach large values near 100 m sec - 1. (4) For large <b>eddy</b> <b>diffusion</b> and small heating rates, the zonal velocities decrease with decreasing planetary rotation rates. However, under condition (3), the zonal velocities are independent of the planetary rotation rate.
