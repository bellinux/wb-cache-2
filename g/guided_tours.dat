5|$|The Castle {{is open to}} {{tourists}} only via <b>guided</b> <b>tours.</b> These occur daily outside of term time, but are more restricted during the term due to potential conflicts with {{the running of the}} college. Furthermore, events in the university timetable may result in their cancellation. Tourists are not otherwise permitted entry to the college or any common areas. There is relatively little conflict between students and tourists, with many of the <b>guided</b> <b>tours</b> done by students themselves.|$|E
5|$|Allen's final home, on the Onion River (now {{called the}} Winooski River), {{is a part}} of the Ethan Allen Homestead and Museum. Situated in Burlington, Allen's {{homestead}} is open for viewing via <b>guided</b> <b>tours.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{protocol}} {{steps of}} the <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> puzzle protocol {{is similar to that}} of client puzzle protocol. All clients are required to complete a <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> puzzle prior to receiving service from the server, if the server suspects it is currently under denial of service attack or its load exceeds a pre-defined threshold. Simply put, a <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> puzzle is a tour that needs to be completed by taking multiple round-trips to a set of special nodes, called <b>tour</b> <b>guides,</b> in a sequential order. It is called a <b>guided</b> <b>tour,</b> because the order in which the <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> are visited is unknown to the client, and each <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> has to direct the client towards the next <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> for the client to complete the tour in correct order. A single <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> may appear multiple times in a tour, so the term stop is used to denote a single appearance of a <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> in a <b>tour.</b> A client knows which <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> is at the next stop, only after completing its visit to the current stop.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, in <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> puzzle protocol, the {{computation}} {{required for}} the client is trivial. Since {{the length of a}} <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> is usually a small number in the order of tens or lower, the bandwidth overhead for completing a <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> is also trivial. As a result, clients are not burdened with heavy computations that is usually required by CPU-bound or memory bound puzzle protocols.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{gives you}} a step-by-step instruction as how a vehicle-based <b>guided</b> <b>tour</b> may be created using a software system called <b>Guided</b> <b>Tour</b> System. This system is created and distributed by the <b>Guided</b> <b>Tour</b> Company. Interested readers are encouraged to visit their Second Life (SL) location below for a test ride and more information. At the time of purchase, (late October 2007), a GTS system with a 6 -person balloon ride was priced at L$ 4, 600. <b>Guided</b> <b>Tour</b> Company: secondlife://Mocha/ 238 / 74 / 32 Before we talk about {{how to create a}} <b>guided</b> <b>tour,</b> one needs to know a few key concepts within the system. There are two main concepts: the concept of a tour “vehicle ” and the concept of a tour “base”. A tour vehicle gives a tour to its passengers. A tour base generates tour vehicles periodically, therefore repeating the tour automatically. The way it works is that the base will store all of the necessary information to generate a new working tour vehicle. Once a tour vehicle is generated, {{it can be used to}} carry Avatars to visit places and give appropriate commentaries along the way...|$|R

5|$|The rooms {{above the}} {{clockwork}} mechanism {{were used by}} the city administration for various purposes up until the late 20th century, including as archives, storerooms, as a firehose magazine and even as an air raid shelter. The interior was frequently remodelled in a careless, even vandalistic fashion; for instance, all but three of the original wooden beams supporting the intermediate floors were destroyed. Since 1979, the tower's interior is empty again. It is only accessed for maintenance {{and in the course}} of regular <b>guided</b> <b>tours.</b>|$|E

Robert Mitchum plays an American oil tycoon who falls in love with Kerr and Jean Simmons plays an eccentric American heiress who is Grant's former girlfriend. The film was a financial disappointment in the US, but successful in England where the original stage version had been a West End hit.|$|E
