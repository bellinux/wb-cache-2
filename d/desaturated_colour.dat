40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Introduction: The {{effects of}} {{workplace}} exposure to neurotoxins {{on the central}} nervous system are well documented, however the effects on senses is an emerging area. This thesis has examined the senses: hearing, balance, touch and colour vision in a group of aircraft maintainers from the Royal Australian Air Force who undertook deseal/reseal fuel tank maintenance on F- 111 aircraft compared to two different control groups. This exposed group used formulations containing neurotoxins in the fuel tank deseal/reseal process. Methods: Study population: The study population consisted of three groups: F- 111 deseal/reseal exposed personnel, technical-trade comparisons to assess different base, same job and non-technical comparisons to assess same base, different job. The study utilised a mailed postal questionnaire and a series of clinical assessments. As military personnel, this study population met minimum physical fitness requirements on enlistment. Clinical assessment: Hearing was assessed by measuring hearing thresholds of each ear at eight frequencies from 500 to 8000 Hz using pure-tone audiometry. The percentage loss of hearing was calculated. Balance was assessed by measuring functional reach. Touch was assessed by measuring vibration perception thresholds at distal extremities using biothesiometry. Colour vision was assessed using the Ishihara test plates and the Lanthony D- 15 <b>Desaturated</b> <b>colour</b> disc arrangement test. Those who failed the Ishihara test were excluded from the analysis. From the Lanthony colour disc arrangement test results the type of colour deficient vision was diagnosed, and Bowman’s colour confusion index was calculated. Other risk factors: In the postal questionnaire and during the clinical examination a number of other risk factors were assessed: anxiety and depression were assessed using the composite International Diagnosis Interview, Kessler Psychological distress scale, height, weight, and visual acuity (using Snellen chart). From the postal questionnaire information on general health and well-being, alcohol intake, smoking history, existence of tinnitus, doctor diagnosed diabetes, medications regularly used and a civilian job history were obtained. Other risk factors included in all statistical modeling included age, posting category, rank and location of clinical assessment. Statistical methods: Regression models were used to examine whether there was an association between F- 111 fuel tank maintenance and sensory impairments, adjusting for possible confounders. In addition multiple linear regressions were also used to determine whether any association exists between the functional reach and the auditory thresholds at the eight measured frequencies in both ears. Graphical comparison was made of the hearing thresholds at all eight frequencies with the published ISO- 7029 medians. Results: The study population consisted of 614 exposed personnel, 513 technical-trade comparisons and 403 non-technical comparisons (numbers in each analysis differ slightly). The percentage loss of hearing ranged from nil to 96 (median 1. 5, quartiles 0. 3, 5. 5). A logistic regression model showed no statistically significant difference in percentage loss of hearing among the three exposure groups (exposed verses non-technical controls OR 1. 1 : 95 %CI 0. 7, 2. 0 and exposed verses technical OR 0. 9 : 95 % CI 0. 6, 1. 3). However, at all eight frequencies measured, all populations had lower than expected hearing thresholds based on published ISO- 7029 medians. The linear regression model showed that functional reach was slightly better for the comparison groups than the deseal/reseal group with only one group being statistically significant; however the difference was not clinically significant. The model did show that functional reach decreases significantly with age, anxiety and depression, whereas it improves with height. A significant association was found between vestibular function, measured by functional reach, and auditory thresholds at 500 and 1000 Hz, which were influenced by anxiety. Over 26 % of all study participants had chronic persistent decreased vibration perception threshold in the great toe. Statistically significant higher vibration perception threshold of the great toe was observed in the comparison groups; this remained significant when vibration perception threshold was dichotomized into normal and abnormal categories; however the effect was small and about ¼ the magnitude of diabetes. Age, height and diabetes were all significant and stronger predictors in most models. Colour confusion index results ranged from 1 to 2. 8 (median 1. 2, quartiles 1. 1, 1. 4) in the 2600 eyes tested. Forty five percent of all study participants had blue-yellow colour deficient vision in at least one eye which is consistent with environmental exposures. Logistic regression demonstrated statistically significant differences in colour confusion index category in the exposed group versus technical group (OR 1. 7 : 95 % CI 1. 3 - 2. 0) and a blue-yellow confusion in the exposed group versus technical group (OR 1. 4 : 95 % CI 1. 1 - 1. 7). Discussion: This study has examined the effects of the deseal/reseal exposures and aircraft maintenance on four senses: hearing, balance, touch and colour vision. The hearing analysis showed that while the study participants had high levels of hearing loss in comparison to the published ISO 7029 medians we did not observe any difference between the three exposure groups. The analysis for balance did show a difference with one of the exposure groups; however the difference was too small to be clinically significant. The analysis for touch did show that one quarter of all study participants had chronic persistent increased vibration perception threshold in the great toe and the analysis for colour vision indicated reduced colour discrimination among the exposed subjects compared to the Richmond controls. These findings are relatively weak in determining the effect of the deseal/reseal exposures on these senses. However, the comparison with normative data that were available (hearing and vibration perception) did show that the study population as a whole have higher hearing thresholds and higher vibration perception thresholds. In the absence of normative data for colour vision we observed almost one third of all participants had an abnormal colour confusion index or a blue-yellow deficit. These finding would suggest that whilst the deseal/reseal exposures to ototoxins and neurotoxins were high, a Royal Australian Air Force effect is also being observed. This statement can be made with some confidence as all military personnel are required to be physically fit and pass a stringent medical before enlistment. Study strengths and weaknesses: a strength is the number of study participants; 1538 participants were examined for the general health and medical assessment making the SHOAMP study {{one of the largest in}} the examination of sensory neuropathy. Another is that all outcomes reported were directly measured in the health examination; no self-reported data has been used. One caveat is the study was carried out retrospectively without exposure data for the substances used in the deseal/reseal programs. Conclusion: This thesis has compared a series of sensory outcomes in personnel involved in F- 111 DSRS activities with two contemporaneous comparisons groups. It shows non-specific decrease in hearing due to Air Force wide exposures, likely noise, but it does show a specific decrease in colour vision probably due to deseal/reseal exposures...|$|E

He was head-hunted for the series by its creator Chris Carter, who had seen his work on the series Strange Luck. McLachlan was initially offered a position shooting Carter's other active series, The X-Files, then in its third season, but was unable to start work in time. He developed a distinctive style for the series, shooting it with <b>desaturated</b> <b>colours</b> and lighting scenes as though they were to be filmed in black and white; he also made use of high-intensity strobe lighting usually employed for advertising and macro cinematography. McLachlan has noted that this style briefly became popular after the series' broadcast but that other cinematographers had difficulty adjusting to it.|$|R
40|$|Subjective {{preference}} of text colours {{used in a}} cathode-ray tube (CRT) visual display was examined experimentally by comparing 26 text colours presented against a nearly black background. Sixteen of these colours were different in hue and saturation (excitation purity), and the remaining were presented in white with different levels of character luminance. The background luminance was fixed at 1 cd/㎡. By means of the pair comparison method, {{subjects were asked to}} rate which colour of the two text colours presented simultaneously on the screen was preferable. The replies from 32 subjects about 325 combinations indicated that among the ten white presentations, the best preferred was one with about 40 cd/㎡ incharacter luminance. It was further found that <b>desaturated</b> <b>colours</b> of yellow, yellowish green, cyan and magenta with less than O. 4 of excitation purity were preferred to white with the same character luminance. Saturated colours of red, blue, yellow and green with more than 0. 5 of excitation purity were disliked.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} an achromatopsic patient to detect and discriminate colour and form concealed in a static or dynamic checkerboard display where the luminance differences among adjacent squares were randomly assigned. There were no conditions under which he could discriminate two very different saturated colours from each other. Nevertheless, he could discriminate chromatic from luminance boundaries in static displays when the colour defining the boundary was saturated and the achromatic boundaries all had similar luminance contrast, i. e. varied over a narrow range. However, he could not readily detect chromatic boundaries from among many achromatic boundaries that differed widely in luminance contrast. In addition, {{he was able to}} detect chromatic boundaries even when they were concealed by dynamic random luminance masking. His ability to pick out chromatic borders was abolished when <b>desaturated</b> <b>colours</b> were used. However, he was singularly proficient at detecting coloured forms in static or dynamic displays even when the saturation of the colours of which the form was composed were such that they were rendered invisible when concealed as a single square in a checkerboard. This implies that signals about chroma are still available in extracting shape. The patient performed flawlessly when asked to indicate the direction of motion of a horizontal red/green isoluminant grating which was phase shifted by 90 degrees in either direction, demonstrating unequivocally that he has access to the sign of colours that he nevertheless does not perceive...|$|R

40|$|Four studies {{including}} ten experiments adresses {{interrelations between}} some major and classical issues in visual perception: 3 -D perception, colour constancy, colour perception and colour vision deficiencies. The main experimental paradigm {{to investigate the}} issues is within that of simulated shape from shading. 3 -D impressions are induced by projecting space-modulated illuminations onto flat surfaces (displays), varying the colours and layout of the displays and the colour and modulation of the illumination. Study I includes four experiments investigating three types of space- modulated illumination. All experiments confirmed earlier findings that chromatic colour and complex display layout with reflectance edges crossed by illumination edges enhances shape from shading. In Study II the impressions of shape from shading and real 3 -D objects were compared between persons with deutan colour vision deficiencies and normals. As predicted, the deutans show fewer and less distinct 3 -D impressions in situations with their specific "problem colours" red and green. They also show a generally lower tendency for 3 -D impressions, interpreted as a generally weaker colour constancy. Study III presents the AMBEGUJAS phenomenon; a novel twofold ambiguous shape from shading situation, continuously alternating between two different 3 -D impressions coupled with different colour attributions. One solution is of an object with two clear surface colours, the other one of an object with greyish (<b>desaturated)</b> <b>colours</b> in coloured illumination which means classical colour constancy. The phenomenon illustrates the visual processes of separating reflectance and illumination characteristics and may provide a useful experimental setting to study colour constancy. In Study IV the AMBEGUJAS phenomenon {{is found to be}} robust as to chromaticness and different luminance contrasts for both normals and deutans. However, the deutans show slower shifts between percepts and a less pronounced desaturation of colour, which indicates a weaker colour constancy. The studies add evidence to the contribution of colour to 3 -D shape perception, validated in a novel way by the results on "colour-blinds". The AMBEGUJAS phenomenon provides further support that the factors affecting shape from shading and the deutans different impressions are to be understood with reference to colour constancy. The deutans different impressions compared to normals are remarkable per se, but probably with very limited implications to everyday life. Diss.

40|$|The Desaturated D- 15 vision {{test was}} used to {{investigate}} the colour discrimination of aged normal subjects, subjects with age-related maculopathy (ARM) and subjects designated as pre-age related maculopathy (pre-ARM). Subjects classified as pre-ARM had normal visual acuity but showed ophthalmoscopically visible pigmentary disturbance at the macula. There were significant losses of colour vision in the pre-ARM subjects and the ARM subjects compared to the aged normals on the <b>Desaturated</b> D- 15 <b>colour</b> vision test. This decrement in colour discrimination was predominantly a blue-yellow (tritan) hue confusion. The results indicate that functional changes are occurring in subjects with pigmentary disturbance at the macula before ARM can be diagnosed by conventional clinical criteria...|$|R
40|$|Developmental grapheme-colour {{synaesthesia}} {{is a rare}} {{condition in}} which colours become automatically paired with letters or digits {{in the minds of}} certain individuals during childhood, and remain paired into adulthood. Although synaesthesia is well understood in younger adults almost nothing is known about synaesthesia in aging. We present the first evidence that aging <b>desaturates</b> synaesthetic <b>colours</b> in the minds of older synaesthetes, and we show {{for the first time that}} aging affects the key diagnostic measure of synaesthesia (consistency of colours over time). We screened ~ 4000 members of the general population to identify grapheme-colour synaesthetes, targeting both younger and older adults. We found proportionally fewer older than younger synaesthetes, not only because fewer older people self-reported the condition, but because fewer also passed the objective diagnostic test. We examined the roots of this apparent decline in grapheme-colour synaesthesia, finding that the internal mental colours of synaesthetes become less saturated in older subjects, and importantly, that low-saturated colours are linked with test-failure. We discuss what these findings mean for a novel field of aging and synaesthesia research, in terms of the lifespan development of synaesthesia and how best to diagnose synaesthesia in later life...|$|R
40|$|A {{defect in}} the blue {{sensitive}} mechanism {{has been reported in}} certain ocular and systemic diseases. For example, tritanopic colour vision defects and changes to the S-cone electroretinogram (ERG) have been demonstrated in glaucoma and diabetes mellitus. Electrophysiological methods of eliciting the S-cone ERG, however, often result in considerable L- and M-cone intrusion. We report the findings of a study employing the silent substitution S-cone ERG technique, which is thought to represent an almost pure S-cone signal, and the L'Anthony <b>desaturated</b> D 15 <b>colour</b> vision test in subjects with Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with no or minimal background retinopathy. The results of this study show a significantly increased S-cone ERG b-wave implicit time and significantly worse colour vision in those with background retinopathy compared with those with no diabetic retinopathy. This suggests that S-cone pathway dysfunction may be responsible for the deterioration in colour vision found in diabetes mellitus...|$|R

5000|$|Originally, Cedric Messina had cast Robert Shaw to play Lear, with an aim to do {{the show}} during the second season, but Shaw died {{suddenly}} in 1978 before production could begin, and the play was pushed back. Jonathan Miller had previously directed a Nottingham Playhouse production of King Lear in 1969, starring Michael Hordern as Lear and Frank Middlemass as the Fool. In 1975, he remounted that same production for the BBC Play of the Month, a heavily truncated version, which {{happened to be the}} BBC's last Shakespeare production prior {{to the beginning of the}} Television Shakespeare. During his producership, Miller tried to persuade the BBC to use the Play of the Month production as their Lear, but they refused, saying a new production had to be done. At the end of the fourth season, Miller's last as producer, his contract stipulated that he still had one production to direct. In-coming producer Shaun Sutton offered him Love's Labour's Lost, but Miller wanted to do one of the three remaining tragedies; Lear, Macbeth or Coriolanus. He had never directed Macbeth or Coriolanus before, but he felt so comfortable with Lear that he went with it. However, the production was basically the same as his 1969/1975 version, with the same two leading actors, the same costumes design, the same lighting, and the same design concept. The only significant difference is that more of the text is used in the latter production. Miller utilised a [...] "board and drapes" [...] approach to the play; all interiors were shot on or near a plain wooden platform whilst all exteriors were shot against a cycloramic curtain with dark tarpaulins. As such, although exteriors and interiors were clearly distinguished from one another, both were nonrepresentational. To enhance the starkness of the look of the production, Miller had lighting technician John Treays <b>desaturate</b> the <b>colour</b> by 30 per cent. Miller also used colour to connect characters; the Fool wears white makeup which washes off during the storm, Edgar wears a white mask when he challenges Edmund to fight, and Cordelia wears white make-up after her death. Similarly, the Fool has red feathers in his hat, Edgar has a red tunic, and Cordelia's red welts on her neck stand out starkly against the white of her skin after her death.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} effect of mercury vapor {{exposure}} on visual function. Methods: Retired workers from a fluorescent lamp industry (n= 24) were tested and compared to age-matched controls. Inclusion criteria were medical diagnosis of mercury contamination, with 20 / 20 Snellen VA and absence of known ophthalmological pathologies. Color vision was assessed with the following tests: FM- 100 hue, Lanthony <b>desaturated</b> and Cambridge <b>Colour</b> Vision Test (Cambridge Research Systems Ltd). The sweep visual evoked potential system – sVEP (NuDiva 2) using bipolar electrode placement was used to estimate contrast sensitivity. Full-field electroretinograms (ERG) were measured following the ISCEV protocol. All tests were performed monocularly in a darkened room. Results: Color vision loss was detected in 21 / 24 patients. Scores of patients ranged from 48 to 452 in the FM- 100 test and from 152 to 302 in the Lanthony desaturated test and were statistically {{different from those of}} controls (p< 0. 001). CCT ellipses of patients were significantly larger than those of controls in field 1 (p= 0. 02) and field 3 (p= 0. 01), but not in field 2 (p= 0. 07). Contrast sensitivity measured by the sVEP was reduced in all patients (n= 14) relative to controls at the mid-frequency range - 0. 8 (p< 0. 001), 2 (p= 0. 008) and 4 (p= 0. 01) cpd. No difference was found in contrast sensitivity at the lowest and highest spatial frequencies tested - 0. 2, 15 and 30 cpd. Full-field ERG responses did not differ from controls in any of the ISCEV protocol test parameters. Conclusions: Visual function, assessed electrophysiologically by the VEP and also psychophysically, was clearly affected, in contrast to the ERG retinal function, suggesting central participation in the damage caused by mercury vapor exposure. More refined measurement of retinal function such as multifocal and pattern-ERG will be performed to investigate retinal damage...|$|R
