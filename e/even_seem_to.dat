25|$|The Greeks in India <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{have played}} {{an active role}} in the {{propagation}} of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as Dharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek ("Yona") Buddhist monks, active in Buddhist proselytism (the Mahavamsa, XII).|$|E
25|$|When Haridasa Thakura {{was a young}} {{devotee of}} the Lord, he was allured by the {{incarnation}} of Maya-devi, but Haridasa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord Krsna. He also believed to have stayed and chanted in a cave with a notorious snake, however, seemed unaffected by all of this. He did not <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{be aware of the}} snake's presence.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks in India <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{have played}} {{an active role}} in the {{propagation}} of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka such as Dharmaraksita, or the teacher Mahadharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek ("Yona", i.e., Ionian) Buddhist monks, active in Buddhist proselytism (the Mahavamsa, XII). It is also thought that Greeks contributed to the sculptural work of the Pillars of Ashoka, and more generally to the blossoming of Mauryan art. Some Greeks (Yavanas) may have played an administrative role in the territories ruled by Ashoka: the Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman records that during the rule of Ashoka, a Yavana King/ Governor named Tushaspha was in charge in the area of Girnar, Gujarat, mentioning his role in the construction of a water reservoir.|$|E

500|$|Some {{opposition}} from neighborhood residents originated from concerns with increased congestion. Donald Trump immediately voiced {{opposition to the}} building, stating that the tall structure would be a target for terrorists and did not <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be a viable project. [...] The opposing comment by Trump was made while he himself was developing a supertall tower in Chicago, the Trump International Hotel and Tower. Trump's tower completed construction in January 2009, {{just a few blocks}} west of the Chicago Spire site. If the Chicago Spire had been built as planned, it would have replaced the Trump International Hotel and Tower as the tallest residential structure in the United States, and the two towers would have been in direct competition in selling residential units.|$|E
500|$|Cooper was a {{conservative}} Republican like his father, and voted for Calvin Coolidge in 1924, Herbert Hoover in 1928 and 1932, and campaigned for Wendell Willkie in 1940. When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented fourth presidential term in 1944, Cooper campaigned for Thomas E. Dewey and criticized Roosevelt for being dishonest and adopting [...] "foreign" [...] ideas. In a radio address that {{he paid for}} himself {{just prior to the}} election, Cooper said, [...] "I disagree with the New Deal belief that the America all of us love is old and worn-out and finished—and has to borrow foreign notions that don't <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> work any too well where they come from ... Our country is a young country that just has to make up its mind to be itself again." [...] He also attended a Republican rally at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum that drew 93,000 Dewey supporters.|$|E
500|$|... "Oh {{it was so}} fun, it was amazing. For me it {{was like}} being on a Martin Scorsese set. I've been so low budget for so long, and to have this {{incredibly}} amazing video was really very humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{be a bit of a}} diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E

500|$|Desson Howe of The Washington Post wrote a mixed review, {{writing that}} the film is [...] "beautifully filmed and flashily edited", but that it [...] "has nothing to offer." [...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times, gave the film a {{negative}} review, writing, [...] "There are times when the director doesn't <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> know where to put the camera. Scenes unravel without dramatic point. No amount of breathless editing and fancy graphics can disguise the amateur nature of the enterprise." [...] In The Philadelphia Inquirer, Roger E. Hernandez criticized the film for its portrayal of Cubans. Hernandez wrote, [...] "The main problem here was the accents. The characters {{were supposed to be}} Cuban, but, with the exception of salsa star Celia Cruz, none sounded it." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized Glimcher's direction, writing in his review, [...] "...when it comes to directing dramatic sequences, he is on his own and lacking in resources to make what drama there is come to a coherent or meaningful point." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Sundberg, a {{veterinarian}} {{and vice president}} of the U.S. National Pork Board, a leading proponent of gestation crates, told The Washington Post: [...] "Farmers treat their animals well because that's just good business. The key to sow welfare isn't whether they are kept in individual crates or group housing, but whether the system used is well managed." [...] Sundberg said: [...] "cience tells us that she [...] doesn't <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> know that she can't turn ... She wants to eat and feel safe, and she can do that very well in individual stalls".|$|E
2500|$|Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan {{said the}} {{security}} arrangement {{was the worst}} he had ever seen, and vastly inferior to that provided in Sri Lanka. [...] He said 'The security people we had didn't <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> fight back. Were they professionals with enough training? They didn't {{seem to know what}} to do. I was surprised the terrorists were able to just reload the magazines and keep firing, and they never got caught. It was shameful. If this had happened in Colombo they would never have got away.' ...|$|E

6000|$|How {{difficult}} it is to add anything more to literature--and how unsatisfactory for any earnest spirit to serve merely the amusement of the multitude! (It <b>even</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me, said H. Heine, more invigorating to accomplish something bad than something empty.) ...|$|R
2500|$|This {{book would}} be Triplanetary, [...] "in which {{scientific}} detail {{would not be}} bothered about, and in which his imagination would run riot." [...] Indeed, characters within the story point out its psychological and scientific implausibilities, and sometimes <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> suggest self-parody. At other times, they are conspicuously silent about obvious implausibilities. The January 1933 issue of Astounding announced that Triplanetary would appear in the March issue, and that issue's cover illustrated {{a scene from the}} story, but Astoundings financial difficulties prevented the story from appearing. Smith then submitted the manuscript to Wonder Stories, whose new editor, 17-year-old Charles D. Hornig, rejected it, later boasting about the rejection in a fanzine. He finally submitted it to Amazing, which published it beginning in January 1934, but for only half a cent a word. Shortly after it was accepted, F. Orlin Tremaine, the new editor of the revived Astounding, offered one cent a word for Triplanetary; when he learned that he was too late, he suggested a third Skylark novel instead.|$|E
2500|$|Miletski {{believes}} that [...] "Animals {{are capable of}} sexual consent – and even initiation – in their own way." [...] It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with ("hump") the legs of people of both genders. Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes {{that as far as}} cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively. Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> enjoy the sexual attention or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans. Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and [...] "seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human." [...] Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not like. Most people can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away. An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it. To those defending bestiality this is seen as a way in which animals give consent, or the fact that a dog might wag its tail.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{reviews of}} the book ranged from very {{positive}} to very negative. There were positive reviews from The Nation, ("the best novel {{to come out in}} years"), the New York Herald Tribune ("A wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller-coaster of a book") and The New York Times ("A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights"). On the other hand, The New Yorker, ("doesn't <b>even</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper", [...] "what remains is a debris of sour jokes") and a second review from the New York Times ("repetitive and monotonous. Or one can say that it is too short because none of its many interesting characters and actions is given enough play to become a controlling interest") disliked it. One commentator of Catch-22 recognized that [...] "many early audiences liked the book for just the same reasons that caused others to hate it" [...] The book had a cult following though, especially among teenagers and college students. Heller remarks that in 1962, after appearing on the Today show he went out drinking with the host at the time, John Chancellor, who handed him stickers that Chancellor got privately printed reading [...] "YOSSARIAN LIVES". Heller also said that Chancellor had been secretly putting them {{on the walls of the}} corridors and executive bathrooms in the NBC building.|$|E

60|$|It <b>even</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> him, as {{the boats}} neared each other, that he heard, {{from the other}} wherry, {{something}} like a stifled scream or groan; and when the momentary bustle was over, he asked the warder who sat next him, what boat that was.|$|R
50|$|Not much is {{revealed}} about Diana {{in the first}} season, but it is hinted that {{her relationship with her}} father is very poor. In the Pilot, when the staff of NTAC contact their relatives, Diana <b>even</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> believe her father will not immediately recognize her name.|$|R
50|$|Raut, an artist, {{is visiting}} Horrocks, {{manager of the}} Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, in order to study the {{industrial}} sights.

50|$|Another {{important}} environment {{issue is}} transborder illegal logging.

The concern was arroused because Malaysian authorities <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be doing nothing to prevent the crime and <b>even</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be encouraging this practice to increase Malaysian timber yield.|$|R
