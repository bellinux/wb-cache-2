5|$|Bosanquet {{was born}} in Bulls Cross, Enfield, Middlesex, on 13 October 1877. He was one of five {{children}} of Bernard Tindal Bosanquet and his wife Eva Maude Cotton; Bosanquet had a younger brother and three sisters. Many of his relations were well known in their fields, including his uncle and namesake Bernard Bosanquet the philosopher. His grandfather, James Whatman Bosanquet, was a banker and achieved distinction as a biblical historian. His father worked for the banking firm Bosanquet & Co., and became a partner <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> of hide, leather, and fur brokers in London; he was also High Sheriff of Middlesex from 1897 to 1898 and captained Enfield cricket club.|$|E

25|$|Agha Mohammad Khan {{took with}} him a group of loyal {{followers}} and left for Tehran. Meanwhile, in Shiraz, people were fighting among themselves. In Tehran, Agha Mohammad Khan met the main chieftains of the Develu clan, whom he made peace with. He visited the shrine of Shah Abd al-Azim, where his father's skull was kept. He then travelled to the Mazandaran Province, where his first task was to set up his suzerainty among his Qoyunlu brothers. This resulted in a clash with his brothers Reza Qoli and Morteza Qoli, whom he defeated on 2 April, conquering Mazandaran. Meanwhile, Morteza Qoli fled to Astarabad, where he fortified himself. Agha Mohammad Khan could not simply storm the city, since starting a war with Morteza Qoli would mean that his frail alliance with the Develu could fall apart—Morteza Qoli's mother was a Develu. At the same time, the Zand prince Ali-Morad Khan Zand sent an army of Zand and Afghan troops under Azad Khan Afghan's son Mahmud Khan to Mazandaran, which Agha Mohammad Khan's brother Jafar Qoli Khan managed to repel. Agha Mohammad Khan, together with Hossein Qoli Khan's sons Fath-Ali Qoli and Hosayn Qoli, was now <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> position in Babol, the capital of Mazandaran.|$|E
25|$|In France, avocats, or attorneys, were, {{until the}} 20th century, the {{equivalent}} of barristers. The profession included several grades ranked by seniority: avocat-stagiaire (trainee, who was already qualified but needed to complete two years (or more, depending on the period) of training alongside seasoned lawyers), avocat, and avocat honoraire (senior barrister). Since the 14th century and {{during the course of}} the 19th and 20th in particular, French barristers competed in territorial battles over respective areas of legal practice against the conseil juridique (legal advisor, transactional solicitor) and avoué (procedural solicitor), and expanded to become the generalist legal practitioner, with the notable exception of notaires (notaries), who are ministry appointed lawyers (with a separate qualification) and who retain exclusivity over conveyancing and probate. After the 1971 and 1990 legal reforms, the avocat was fused with the avoué and the conseil juridique, making the avocat (or, if female, avocate) an all-purpose lawyer for matters of contentious jurisdiction, analogous to an American attorney. French attorneys usually do not (although it they are entitled to) act both as litigators (trial lawyers) and legal consultants (advising lawyers), known respectively as avocat plaidant and avocat-conseil. This distinction is however purely informal and does not correspond to any difference in qualification or admission to the roll. All intending attorneys must pass an examination to be able to enrol in one of the Centre régional de formation à la profession d'avocat (CRFPA) (Regional centre for the training of lawyers). The CRFPA course has a duration of two years and is a mix between classroom teachings and internships. Its culmination is the stage final (final training), where the intending attorney spends 6 months in a law firm (generally in his/her favoured field of practice and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> in which he/she hopes to be recruited afterwards). The intending attorney then needs to pass the Certificat d'Aptitude à la Profession d'Avocat (CAPA), which is the last professional examination allowing him/her to join a court's bar (barreau). It is generally recognised that the first examination is much more difficult than the CAPA and is dreaded by most law students. Each bar is regulated by a Bar Council (Ordre du barreau).|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> debt financing decision on the informativeness of the income statement. This study specifically examines the association between <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> bank dependence and the value relevance of the income statement by investigating the income-statement conservatism of firms with bank loans. Focusing on relatively small businesses, this study finds that income-statement conservatism, measured as timely loss recognition, is increasing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> bank dependence. This study also finds that the value relevance of the income statement is increasing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> bank dependence. The findings of this paper suggest that {{the usefulness of the}} income statement varies with <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> bank dependence, indicating that the value relevance of the income statement is a function of <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> debt financing decision. The findings further suggest that bank relationships affect the value relevance of the income statement through their influence on income-statement conservatism.

40|$|This paper explores how {{accruals}} capture managerial operating {{decisions that}} evolve over <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> life cycle. I argue that growing firms face different operating environments and have fundamentally different accruals properties {{than those of}} mature and declining firms. I provide evidence that accruals vary with changes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> operating environment over its life cycle. I show in one example that by ignoring life cycle fundamentals, previous empirical methods would likely misclassify this variation in accruals as reflecting systematic differences <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> "accounting quality". I suggest empirical techniques to mitigate incorrect inferences about accounting quality and to better understand how operating decisions affect accruals. by Michelle M. Liu. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Mani Ratnam grew up in Madras (now Chennai), along with his siblings and cousins in a joint-family. Despite being a film family, the children were not allowed to watch films as the elders considered it a [...] "taboo". [...] "As a youngster, films seemed like a waste of time", he claimed in a 1994 interview; however, he started watching films more actively when he was studying in the Besant Theosophical School, Adyar, Madras. During this time, he developed an admiration towards actors like Sivaji Ganesan and Nagesh, and watched all their films. By the time he was 15, he got to know about director K. Balachander, and became a fan of him. Upon completing his schooling, he graduated with a degree in commerce from the Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College, affiliated to the Madras University. Later, he did his Master of Business Administration (MBA) in finance from Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai.
