60|$|The main {{question}} was whether the schooner and the sloop could pass through the opening which communicated between the reach and the bay. If not, they must inevitably {{fall into the hands}} of the pirates, should they enter the <b>false</b> <b>channel,</b> and be followed in. Then, even admitting that the Anne and Martha got through the narrow passage, should the pirates follow them in their boats, there would be very little probability of their escaping; though they might elude their pursuers for a time among the islands. Captain Betts was of opinion that the two vessels could get through, and was strongly in favour of endeavouring to lead the enemy off the true course to the Reef, by entangling them in this cul-de-sac. If nothing but delay was gained, delay would be something. It was always an advantage to the assailed to have time to recover from their first alarm, and to complete their arrangements. The governor listened to his friend's arguments with favour, but he sent the Neshamony on direct to the Reef, with a letter to Pennock, acquainting that functionary with the state of things, the intended plan, and a request that a twelve-pounder, that was mounted on a travelling carriage, might be put on board the boat, and sent to a landing, whence it might easily be dragged by hand to the narrow passage so often mentioned. This done, he took the way into the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> himself.|$|E

[...] "The canoes I {{saw were}} in the <b>false</b> <b>channel,</b> and cannot possibly reach us without returning to the western margin of the rocks and entering one of the true passages. I rather think this cannot be done before morning. Daylight, indeed, may be absolutely necessary to them; and as the night promises to be dark, {{it is not easy}} to see how strangers can find their way to us, among the maze of passages they must meet. By land, they cannot get here from any of the islands on the western side of the group; and even if landed on the central island, there is only one route, and that a crooked one, which will bring them here without the assistance of their canoes. We are reasonably well fortified, Betts, through natural agencies, on that side; and I do not apprehend seeing anything more of the fellows until morning." ...|$|E
60|$|The governor, as {{a matter}} of course, kept at a safe {{distance}} ahead of the pirates in the Anne and the Martha. This he was enabled to do quite easily, since fore-and-aft vessels make much quicker tacks than those that are square-rigged. As respects water, there was enough of that almost everywhere; it being rather a peculiarity of the group, that nearly every one of its passages had good channels and bold shores. There was one shoal, however, and that of some extent, in the long reach of the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> named; and when the governor resolved to venture in there, it was not without the hope of leading the pirate ship on it. The water on this shoal was about sixteen feet deep, and there was scarce a hope of either of the brigs fetching up on it; but, could the ship be enticed there, and did she only strike with good way on her, and on a falling tide, her berth might be made very uncomfortable. Although this hope appeared faintly in the background of the governor's project, his principal expectation was that of being able to decoy the strangers into a cul-de-sac, and to embarrass them with delays and losses. As soon as the Neshamony was out of sight, the Anne and Martha, therefore, accompanied by the other boats, stood into the <b>false</b> <b>channel,</b> and went off to the northward merrily, with a leading wind. When the enemy reached the point, they did not hesitate to follow, actually setting studding sails in their eagerness not to be left too far behind. It is probable, that Waally was of but little service to his allies just then, for, after all, the knowledge of that chief was limited to a very imperfect acquaintance with such channels as would admit of the passage of even canoes. The distances were by no means trifling in these crooked passages. By the true channel, it was rather more than seven and twenty miles from the western roads to the Reef; but, it was fully ten more by this <b>false</b> <b>channel,</b> even deducting the half league where there was no passage at all, or the bottom of the bag. Now, it required time to beat up such a distance, and the sun was setting when the governor reached the shoal already mentioned, about which he kept working for some time, in the hope of enticing the ship on it in the dark. But the pirates were too wary to be misled, in this fashion. The light no sooner left them than they took in all their canvas and anchored. It is probable, that they believed themselves on their certain way to the Reef, and felt indisposed to risk anything by adventuring in the obscurity. Both parties, consequently, prepared to pass the night at their anchors. The Anne and Martha were now within less than a mile of the all-important passage, through which they were to make their escape, if they escaped at all. The opportunity of ascertaining the fact was not to be neglected, and it was no sooner so dark as to veil his movements than the governor went on board the Martha, which was a vessel of more beam than the Anne, and beat her up to the rocks, {{in order to make a}} trial of its capacity. It was just possible to take the sloop through in several places; but, in one spot, the rocks came too near together to admit of her being hauled between them. The circumstances would not allow of delay, and to work everybody went, with such implements as offered, to pick away the rock and to open a passage. By midnight, this was done; and the Martha was carried through into the bay beyond. Here she stood off a short distance and anchored. The governor went back to his own craft and moved her about a mile, being apprehensive of a boat attack in the darkness, should he remain where he was. This precaution was timely, for, in the morning, after day had dawned, no less than seven boats were seen pulling down to the pirates, which had, no doubt, been looking for the schooner and the sloop in vain. The governor got great credit for this piece of management; more even than might have been expected, the vulgar usually bestowing their applause on acts of a glittering character, rather than on those which denote calculation and forethought.|$|E

60|$|Honest Bill, who {{anticipated}} no {{more from}} his discoveries than {{the acquisition of}} certain portions of wood, iron, and copper, with, perhaps, {{the addition of a}} little rigging, certain sails and an anchor or two, acted, at first, for the best interests of his master. He led the fleet along the margin of the group until a convenient harbour was found. Into this all the canoes entered, and a sandy beach supplying fresh water in abundance having been found, an encampment was made for the night. Several hours of daylight remaining, however, when these great preliminary steps had been taken, Brown proposed to Waally an exploring expedition in a couple of the handiest of the canoes. The people thus employed were those who had given the alarm to the governor. On that occasion, not only was the boat seen, but the explorers were near enough to the reef, to discover not only the crater, but the spars of the ship. Here, then, was a discovery scarcely less important than that of the group itself! After reasoning on the facts, Waally {{came to the conclusion that}} these, after all, were the territories that Heaton and his party had come to seek; and that here he should find those cows which he had once seen, and which he coveted more than any other riches on earth. Ooroony had been weak enough to allow strangers in possession of things so valuable, to pass through his islands; but he, Waally, was not the man to imitate this folly. Brown, too, began to think that the white men sought were to be found here. That whites were in the group was plain enough by the ship, and he supposed they might be fishing for the pearl-oyster, or gathering bÃªche-le-mar for the Canton market. It was just possible that a colony had established itself in this unfrequented place, and that the party of which he had heard so much, had come hither with their stores and herds. Not the smallest suspicion at first crossed his mind that he there beheld the spars of the Rancocus; but, it was enough for him and Wattles that Christian men were there, and that, in all probability, they were men of the Anglo-Saxon race. No sooner was it ascertained that the explorers were in a <b>false</b> <b>channel,</b> and that it would not be in their power to penetrate farther in their canoes, than our two seamen determined to run, and attach themselves to the strangers. They naturally thought that they should find a vessel armed and manned, and ready to stand out to sea as soon as her officers were apprized of the danger that threatened them, and did not hesitate about joining their fortune with hers, in preference to remaining with Waally any longer. Freedom possesses a charm for which no other advantage can compensate, and those two old sea-dogs, who had worked like horses all their lives, in their original calling, preferred returning to the ancient drudgery rather than live with Waally, in the rude abundance of savage chiefs. The escape was easily enough made, as soon, as it was dark, Brown and Wattles being on shore most of the time, under the pretence that it was necessary, in order that they might ascertain the character of there unknown colonists by signs understood best by themselves.|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{patients}} with dissection of the thoracic aorta were studied by CT-scanning. In 9 patients {{the diagnosis was}} previously documented by aortography, while in the other 11 patients the diagnosis of aortic dissection was first established by CT-scanning.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceCognitive radio (CR) {{technology}} {{has emerged as}} a promising solution to alleviate the spectrum scarcity problem. With the capability of sensing the frequency bands in a time and location-varying spectrum environment, CR technology allows an unlicensed user to exploit those frequency bands unused by licensed users in an opportunistic manner. Since different unlicensed users may acquire different channel availability information, they often need to exchange their channel information with each other for the realization of many networking protocols. However, if malicious unlicensed users exchange <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> information among other nodes, the networking protocols may fail, which leads to significant performance degradation. We name this type of attack as the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> information exchange attack. In this thesis, a distributed algorithm is proposed to identify the malicious nodes and fight against the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> information exchange attack in CR ad hoc networks. The spatial correlation of the channel information is used to analyze the authenticity of the received channel information. In addition, the temporal correlation of the channel availability is investigated to further enhance the performance. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves very high detection rate to find out the malicious nodes, while the false alarm rate is relatively low. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first that investigates the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> information exchange attacks in CR ad hoc networks...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives: Recently, the {{immediate}} {{results of a}} surgical repair for an acute aortic arch dissection have dramatically improved. However, a total aortic arch replacement is recommended in {{a limited number of}} patients with an intimal tear located in the aortic arch. We have performed a total aortic arch replacement for all such patients with an acute aortic arch dissection since September 1995. Methods: During the past 4 years, 27 consecutive patients who had an aortic arch dissection underwent a total aortic arch replacement. Twenty-five patients underwent an emergency operation. In 5 patients the intimal tear was located in the aortic arch, but {{in the rest of the}} patients, it was located in the ascending aorta or the proximal descending aorta. To obliterate any <b>false</b> <b>channels,</b> gelatin-resorcin-formol glue was used. Results: The hospital mortality was 11 %, and no cerebral complications were observed. Postoperative aortography and computed tomography showed no evidence of any persisting <b>false</b> <b>channels</b> in 15 patients (65 %). During the follow-up period (ranging from 5 months to 4 years), two patients underwent a reoperation because of the recurrence of a dissection at the sinus of Valsalva. All patients, except for one who died after a reoperation, are still alive and free from any serious events at this writing. Conclusions: Resecting both the ascending and transverse aorta, irrespective of whether the intimal tear is located in the aortic arch, may be an acceptable alternative at experienced centers because of its low mortality and good midterm results.

40|$|Clinical and {{necropsy}} findings {{are described in}} 40 patients who had aortic dissection with the entrance tear in the descending thoracic aorta. Their ages at death ranged from 39 to 91 years (mean, 66 years); 24 (60 %) were men and 16 (40 %) were women. Systemic hypertension was present by history in 33 patients (83 %) and the hearts were of increased weight in 78 %. Of the 40 patients, 31 (78 %) had no operative intervention, while 9 (22 %) underwent operation for aortic dissection. Of the 31 patients without operative therapy, the diagnosis of aortic dissection was established in life in 9 patients (29 %) and at necropsy in 22 (71 %). The interval from aortic dissection to death was 30 days or less in 13 patients (42 %); rupture of the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> {{was the cause of}} death in 9 patients (69 %), renal failure in 2 (15 %), and the cause was unclear in 2 (15 %). The interval from aortic dissection to death was more than 30 days in 18 (58 %) of the 31 patients without operative therapy. The cause of death in these 18 patients was related to the dissection in 11 (61 %) (rupture of the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> in 5; renal failure from dissection in 3, and rupture of the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> of a second acute dissection in 3), but in the other 7 patients (39 %) death was unrelated to the dissection but a nonfatal complication, specifically stenosis of the true channel from compression by a thrombus-filled <b>false</b> <b>channel,</b> occurred in 4 of these 7 patients. Thus only 3 (10 %) of the 31 patients without operative therapy had no complications of aortic dissection. All nine patients who underwent operation had had an aortic dissection within 30 days, and the operation was performed because of a major complication of the dissection. Four patients survived 8 to 84 months after the operation. Thus early operative intervention (before the appearance of complications) appears justified in patients with aortic dissection with the entrance tear in the descending thoracic aorta to prevent rupture of the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> acutely or after initial healing; to prevent renal failure from compression of renal arteries by an aneurysmal false channel; to prevent true channel stenosis from compression by a thrombus-filled false channel; and possibly to prevent the recurrence of acute dissection...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To assess {{efficacy}} of uterine cervical dilation performed with fluoroscopic guidance to treat patients with infertility who have cervical stenosis, <b>false</b> <b>channels</b> within the endocervical canal, or both. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients in whom infertility was diagnosed were referred because the uterine lumen {{could not be}} accessed. Three of the patients had endometriosis. With fluoroscopic guidance, the cervix was cannulated and the endocervical canal was dilated with an angioplasty balloon or with dilators. Five patients underwent simultaneous fallopian tube recanalization. Five of 15 patients who underwent dilation subsequently underwent in vitro fertilization for embryo transfer (IVF-ET) or intrauterine insemination. RESULTS: Four patients became pregnant. Of those four, one underwent IVF-ET and one underwent intrauterine insemination. Two patients became pregnant spontaneously. In the five patients who underwent IVF-ET or intrauterine insemination and in the remaining eight patients, the cervix could be easily cannulated up to 7 months after dilation. CONCLUSION: Dilation of the uterine cervix may provide options for treatment in selected patients with infertility. The effect of dilation on patients with other sequelae of cervical obstruction such as endometriosis remains uncertain. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{report a}} new human exÂ vivo model of type B aortic {{dissection}} (TBAD) {{and to assess}} if {{the locations of the}} primary entry tear determine the patterns of dissection propagation. MethodsTwenty fresh human aortas were harvested. TBADs were surgically initiated 2 cm below the left subclavian artery at four different locations (lateral, nÂ = 5; medial, nÂ = 5; anterior, nÂ = 5; posterior, nÂ = 5). Aortas were thereafter connected to a bench-top pulsatile flow model to induce antegrade propagation of the dissection. ResultsAntegrade propagation of the dissection was achieved and reached at least the celiac trunk (CT) in all the cases. Dissection was propagated to the renal aorta in 16 (80 %) and infrarenal aorta in seven cases (35 %). Left renal artery with or without the CT originated more often from the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> when primary entry tear was lateral. Right renal artery and the CT most often originated from the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> when primary entry tear was medial. When the CT was the only one originating from the <b>false</b> <b>channel,</b> primary entry tear was more often anterior, whereas when it originated from the true channel, it was more often posterior. ConclusionsThis human exÂ vivo model of TBAD is reproducible, since, in all the aortas, extended dissection was achieved and provides the first model of human aortic dissection with infrarenal aorta extension allowing future assessment ofÂ endovascular devices developed for human use. Furthermore, it allows clarification of the patterns of aortic dissectionÂ propagation and visceral and renal artery involvement according {{to the site of the}} primary entry tear. Clinical RelevanceThe complexities of type B aortic dissection (TBAD) management remain a challenge. To develop strategies more suitable for this specific disease, several animal models have been reported. However, due to their small aortic diameter, they are not suitable to experiment stent grafts designed for human aortas. Furthermore, in these models, the dissection exceptionally reaches the infraceliac aorta, and does not allow the study of the visceral branch vessel compromise, whereas it is a prominent feature of human TBAD. We report the first human exÂ vivo model of TBAD, the impact of the primary entry tear location on antegrade dissection propagation, and the patterns of visceral and renal artery involvement...|$|E

PATIENTS AND METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from 112 children who had a CCC (appendicovesicostomy [APV], tubularized bladder flap [TBF] or Monti) created between December 1995 and December 2013. Primary outcome was revision-free survival. Secondary outcomes were channel stenosis, incontinence, and <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> requiring revision. Time-to-event survival was analyzed using a KaplanMeier survival curve. RESULTS A total of 117 CCCs were identified with median follow-up of 85 months. Surgical revision was required in 52 %, with {{no significant difference between}} the different techniques. Major revision was required in 27 % of the cases and significantly more often in Monti channels. Complete revision was required in 7 %. Stenosis requiring revision was seen in 33 %. A <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> was formed in 9 % of the cases. Incontinence with a low leak point pressure was seen in 12 %. A time-toevent analysis with a Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant differences between the 3 techniques. CONCLUSION Although CCC is an effective solution for children who cannot perform urethral catheterization, 52 % requires surgical revision. Because no differences were found in outcome between APV, TBF, and Monti, we conclude that a TBF CCC is a good alternative for the APV. If the appendix is not available and bladder volume is sufficient, a TBF channel is preferred to a Monti channel. (C) 2017 Elsevier In...|$|E

40|$|Aortic {{dissection}} is {{a dangerous}} pathological condi-tion where blood intrudes into the layers of the arte-rial walls, creating an artificial <b>channel</b> (<b>false</b> lumen). In the absence of thrombosis or surgical intervention, blood will enter the false lumen through the proximal tear, and join the true lumen again through a distal tear. Rupture of the weakened outer wall will result in extremely high mortality rates. Type B thoracic aortic dissection (TAD), occurring along the de-scending aorta, can be repaired surgically by the de-ployment of an endovascular stent graft, concealing the proximal entry tear. Blood might still flow into the false lumen (FL) through the distal tear.

40|$|Aortic {{dissection}} (dissecting aneurysm) is characteri-zed by {{the separation}} of the aortic wall into 2 sheets at the medial layer, along the longitudinal axis of the artery, thus forming a <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> for the blood flow 1 (fig. 1). It is a life-threatening but relatively rare disease, whose incidence has been evaluated in 5 - 29 cases/million persons/year 2, 3. Seve-ral conditions are associated with it: systemic arterial hy-pertension, the most common (70 - 90 % of the cases); Marfanâs syndrome; Hurlerâs syndrome; and traumatism, in-cluding surgical management of the aorta 1. A small percen-tage of patients have no associated conditions. The patho-genesis of this disease remains unclear. Although most pa-tients with aortic dissection have systemic arterial hyper-tension, they correspond only to {{a very small percentage of}} people with this last condition. Weakness of the wall is pre...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{understand}} why the <b>false</b> <b>channel</b> (FC) remains patent after surgery of type A acute aortic dissection (TAAAD). Materials and Methods: Postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans of 129 patients operated for TAAAD were analyzed, and a color-Doppler ultrasound examination (CDUS) of the supra-aortic vessels (SAVs) was performed in 12 patients. Results: The FC remained patent in 107 (82. 9 %) patients. The entry site was situated near the distal anastomosis in 43 (40. 2 %) patients and far from it in 44 (41. 1 %) patients. In 10 (9. 35 %) patients, an entry site was observed only in the SAVs. In 10 (9. 35 %) patients, no entry site was seen. Of the 12 patients explored with CDUS, a retrograde filling of the FC was observed in 11 patients. Conclusion: The frequent postoperative circulating aortic FC {{can be explained by}} the persistence of the primary entry tear, the presence of iatrogenic tears, and/or a retrograde filling in the SAVs...|$|E
40|$|Two fully {{processed}} test {{tapes were}} enhanced and evaluated at scales up to 1 : 10, 000, using both hardcopy output and interactive screen display. A large scale, the Detroit, Michigan scene shows {{evidence of an}} along line data slip every sixteenth line in TM channel 2. Very large scale products generated in <b>false</b> color using <b>channels</b> 1, 3, and 4 should be very acceptable for interpretation at scales up to 1 : 50, 000 and useful for change mapping probably up to scale 1 : 24, 000. Striping visible in water bodies for both natural and color products indicates that the detector calibration is probably performing below preflight specification. For a set of 512 x 512 windows within the NE Arkansas scene, the variance-covariance matrices were computed and principal component analyses performed. Initial analysis suggests that the shortwave infrared TM 5 and 6 channels are a highly significant data source. The thermal channel (TM 7) shows negative correlation with TM 1 and 4...|$|R
50|$|The border {{begins at}} the northwesternmost point of Minnesota's Northwest Angle 49Â°23â²N, 95Â°09â²W, and {{proceeds}} in an easterly direction through the Angle Inlet into the Lake of the Woods. At 41Â°19â²N, 94Â°48â²W in the Lake of the Woods, the border turns to a southerly direction, and continues into the Rainy River. The border then follows the Rainy River to Rainy Lake, then subsequently through numerous small lakes, including Lake Namakan, Lac la Croix, and Sea Gull Lake, until reaching the Pigeon River, which leads it out into Lake Superior. The border continues through Lake Superior to Whitefish Bay. The border then proceeds through Whitefish Bay into the St. Mary's River, then into the North Channel, then, at 45Â°59â²N 83Â°26â²N, turns to a southerly direction into the <b>False</b> Detour <b>Channel,</b> and reaches Lake Huron. The border then heads in a southerly direction through Lake Huron until reaching the St. Clair River, which subsequently leads it to Lake St. Clair. The border then proceeds through Lake St. Clair, reaching the Detroit River, which leads it to Lake Erie. The border then proceeds through Lake Erie into the Niagara River, which leads into Lake Ontario. The border then proceeds in a northwesterly direction in Lake Ontario, then at 43Â°27â²N, 79Â°12â²W, the border makes a sharp turn to a north easterly direction. The border then reaches and proceeds through the St. Lawrence River. Finally, at 45Â°00â²N, 74Â°40â²E, the border splits from the St. Lawrence River and continues into Quebec. This border, going from west to east, is shared with the U.S. states of Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.|$|R
