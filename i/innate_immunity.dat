5|$|The role of RNA {{interference}} in mammalian <b>innate</b> <b>immunity</b> is poorly understood, and relatively little data is available. However, {{the existence of}} viruses that encode genes able to suppress the RNAi response in mammalian cells may be evidence in favour of an RNAi-dependent mammalian immune response, although this hypothesis has been challenged as poorly substantiated.|$|E
5|$|Although animals {{generally}} express fewer {{variants of}} the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult Drosophila, RNA interference {{is important in}} antiviral <b>innate</b> <b>immunity</b> and is active against pathogens such as Drosophila X virus. A similar role in immunity may operate in C. elegans, as argonaute proteins are upregulated in response to viruses and worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{organism}} and experimental system, the exogenous RNA {{may be a}} long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates. In most mammalian cells, shorter RNAs are used because long double-stranded RNA molecules induce the mammalian interferon response, a form of <b>innate</b> <b>immunity</b> that reacts nonspecifically to foreign genetic material. Mouse oocytes and cells from early mouse embryos lack this reaction to exogenous dsRNA {{and are therefore a}} common model system for studying mammalian gene-knockdown effects. Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in mammalian systems by avoiding the direct introduction of siRNA, for example, by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding the appropriate sequence from which siRNAs can be transcribed, or by more elaborate lentiviral vector systems allowing the inducible activation or deactivation of transcription, known as conditional RNAi.|$|E

Here, we show that in addition to normal PMN (PMN-N), {{there are at least two}} distinct subsets of PMNs (PMN-I and PMN-II) distinguished as follows: (1) cytokine and chemokine production (PMN-I, IL- 12 /CCL 3; PMN-II, IL- 10 /CCL 2; PMN-N, no cytokine/chemokine production), (2) macrophage activation (PMN-I, classically activated macrophages; PMN-II, alternatively activated macrophages; PMN-N, no effect on macrophage activation), (3) Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression (PMN-I, TLR 2 /TLR 4 /TLR 5 /TLR 8; PMN-II, TLR 2 /TLR 4 /TLR 7 /TLR 9; PMN-N, TLR 2 /TLR 4 /TLR 9), and (4) surface antigen expression (PMN-I, CD 49 d+CD 11 b−; PMN-II, CD 49 d−CD 11 b+; PMN-N, CD 49 d−CD 11 b−). PMN-I was obtained from MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) -resistant hosts, while MRSA-sensitive hosts were a source of PMN-II. PMN-N was obtained from naive mice. Anti-MRSA <b>innate</b> <b>immunities</b> might be influenced differently by these biochemically and physically distinguished PMNs.

5|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} feature of cellular <b>innate</b> <b>immunity</b> performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E

40|$|Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is {{a common}} {{by-product}} of viral infections and a potent inducer of innate antiviral immune responses in vertebrates. In the marine shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, <b>innate</b> antiviral <b>immunity</b> is also induced by dsRNA in a sequence-independent manner. In this study, the hypothesis that dsRNA can evoke not only <b>innate</b> antiviral <b>immunity</b> but also a sequence-specific antiviral response in shrimp was tested. It was found that viral sequence-specific dsRNA affords potent antiviral immunity in vivo, implying the involvement of RNA interference (RNAi) -like mechanisms in the antiviral response of the shrimp. Consistent with the activation of RNAi by virus-specific dsRNA, endogenous shrimp genes could be silenced in a systemic fashion by the administration of cognate long dsRNA. While <b>innate</b> antiviral <b>immunity,</b> sequence-dependent antiviral protection, and gene silencing could all be induced by injection of long dsRNA molecules, injection of short interfering RNAs failed to induce similar responses, suggesting a size requirement for extracellular dsRNA to engage antiviral mechanisms and gene silencing. We propose a model of antiviral immunity in shrimp by which viral dsRNA engages not only innate immune pathways but also an RNAi-like mechanism to induce potent antiviral responses in vivo...|$|R

Perturbations in adaptive {{immune reconstitution}} have been well characterized, yet defects in reconstituted <b>innate</b> cellular-mediated <b>immunity</b> remain largely unstudied. Recovery in innate effector cells was defined by using an established murine model of autologous bone marrow transplantation. Cytokine induction after cell culture and systemic stimulation with pathogen-associated molecular patterns was also measured for control, transplant-recipient, and irradiated-only animals. Early reconstitution (7 to 14 days) of donor-derived macrophages, dendritic cells, and polymorphonuclear cells was associated with recovery in interleukin (IL) - 12 p 70 and IL- 6 production. Later reconstitution (21 days) of natural killer cells was associated with interferon (IFN) -γ recovery. Hence, splenocyte <b>innate</b> cellular-mediated <b>immunity</b> recovered to normal levels in cellularity and IL- 12 p 70, IFN-γ, and IFN-α production by 21 days after transplantation. In contrast, levels of systemic cytokine production from transplant-recipient and irradiated-only animals were preserved despite incomplete or absent hematopoietic reconstitution. These results suggest that innate immune responses to systemic inflammatory challenges are largely intact after autologous bone marrow transplantation, whereas local <b>innate</b> cellular-mediated <b>immunity</b> within reconstituting lymphoid organs may be impaired. The disparate effects of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on host immune function may translate to differences in susceptibility to local versus systemic infectious challenges...|$|R

25|$|Malaria {{has placed}} the strongest known {{selective}} {{pressure on the}} human genome since the origination of agriculture within the past 10,000 years. Plasmodium falciparum was probably not able to gain a foothold among African populations until larger sedentary communities emerged {{in association with the}} evolution of domestic agriculture in Africa (the agricultural revolution). Several inherited variants in red blood cells have become common in parts of the world where malaria is frequent as a result of selection exerted by this parasite. This selection was historically important as the first documented example of disease as an agent of natural selection in humans. It was also the first example of genetically controlled <b>innate</b> <b>immunity</b> that operates early in the course of infections, preceding adaptive immunity which exerts effects after several days. In malaria, as in other diseases, <b>innate</b> <b>immunity</b> leads into, and stimulates, adaptive immunity.|$|E

30|$|Four {{antimicrobial}} genes (F 08 G 5.6, T 24 B 8.5, lys- 2, clec- 67) {{under the}} control of the p 38 MAPK pathway, were up-regulated when fed on P. luminescens for 6, 12 and 24  hours (Figure  4). Up-regulation of these genes was also observed when infected by other pathogenic bacteria e.g. Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Troemel et al. 2006; Evans et al. 2008; Shivers et al. 2010). In addition, when pmk- 1 was knocked down by RNAi, C. elegans became more susceptible to P. luminescens (Figure  1 A, Table  1), which suggests that this pathway contributed resistance against P. luminescens but didn’t affect enough for survival. This pathway is reported to act in a cell-autonomous manner in intestine to regulate <b>innate</b> <b>immunities</b> against bacterial infections (Kim et al. 2002; Troemel et al. 2006; Shivers et al. 2009, 2010; Engelmann et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|<b>Innate</b> {{antiviral}} <b>immunity</b> is {{the first}} line of the host defense system that rapidly detects invading viruses. Mitochondria function as platforms for innate antiviral signal transduction in mammals through the adaptor protein, MAVS. Excessive activation of MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling leads to dysfunction of mitochondria and cell apoptosis that likely causes the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. However, the mechanism of how MAVS is regulated at mitochondria remains unknown. Here we show that the Cytochrome c Oxidase (CcO) complex subunit COX 5 B physically interacts with MAVS and negatively regulates the MAVS-mediated antiviral pathway. Mechanistically, we find that while activation of MAVS leads to increased ROS production and COX 5 B expression, COX 5 B down-regulated MAVS signaling by repressing ROS production. Importantly, our study reveals that COX 5 B coordinates with the autophagy pathway to control MAVS aggregation, thereby balancing the antiviral signaling activity. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the link between mitochondrial electron transport system and the autophagy pathway in regulating <b>innate</b> antiviral <b>immunity...</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Innate</b> <b>immunity</b> to gluten {{refers to}} an immune {{response}} that works independently of T-cell receptor or antibody recognition of the 'innate' peptide. This peptide acts directly on cells, such as monocytes, stimulating their growth and differentiation. <b>Innate</b> <b>immunity</b> to gluten is complicated by an apparent role gluten has in bypassing normal host defense and peptide exclusion mechanisms in the gut. While not truly innate, these activities allow gliadin to enter into areas where many lymphocytes patron. In bypassing these filters gliadin alters the normal behavior of both digestive cells, called enterocytes or epithelial cells, and lymphocytes. This increases the potential of causing sensitivity (see Underlying Conditions). One potential explanation of why certain people become sensitive is that these individuals may not produce adequate peptidases {{in some areas of}} the gut, allowing these peptides to survive. Other explanation for some may be that food chemicals or drugs are weakening the defenses. This can be the case with ω5-gliadin allergy with salicylate sensitivity. There is no clear reasoning, either from genetics or from long term studies of susceptible individuals why these gut peptide restrictions would change.|$|E

Nevertheless, they may worsen IBS symptoms and the patient quality of life. Antibiotic use also appears to increase the risk {{of developing}} IBS.

MDSCs are characterized by the ability to suppress both adaptive and <b>innate</b> <b>immunities</b> mainly through direct inhibition of the cytotoxic functions of T cells and NK cells. In clinical settings, the number of circulating MDSCs is associated with clinical stages and response to treatment in several cancers. Moreover, MDSCs are reported to contribute to chemoresistant phenotype. Collectively, targeting MDSCs could potentially provide a rationale for novel treatment strategies in cancer.

The response is also dependent on the genetic makeup of the human leukocyte antigen genes. In gluten sensitive enteropathy, there are 4 types of recognition, <b>innate</b> <b>immunity</b> (a form of cellular immunity priming), HLA-DQ, and antibody recognition of gliadin and transglutaminase.
