5|$|After {{reaching}} a virtual stalemate {{with these two}} wars against the Afghans, the British imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and British India (now the North-West Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and {{the representatives of the}} British Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its <b>intended</b> <b>purpose</b> was to serve as a buffer zone to inhibit the spread of Russian influence down into British India.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary <b>intended</b> <b>purpose</b> of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E

5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes {{was embarrassed}} {{to admit that}} neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its <b>intended</b> <b>purpose,</b> since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} records of {{construction}} or the <b>intended</b> <b>purpose</b> of Borobudur. The duration of construction {{has been estimated}} by comparison of carved reliefs on the temple's hidden foot and the inscriptions commonly used in royal charters during the 8th and 9th centuries. Borobudur was likely founded around 800 CE. This corresponds to the period between 760 and 830CE, {{the peak of the}} Sailendra dynasty rule of Mataram kingdom in central Java, when it was {{under the influence of the}} Srivijayan Empire. The construction has been estimated to have taken 75 years with completion during the reign of Samaratungga in 825.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, the use {{of horse}} and buggy {{had fallen out of}} fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its <b>intended</b> <b>purpose.</b> By 1939 {{citizens}} of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common and turned to face Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed back on top of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and reattached within days.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a role-involved purpose-based access control (RPAC) model, where a conditional purpose {{is defined as}} the intention of data accesses or usages under certain conditions. RPAC allows users using some data for a certain purpose with Conditions (For instance, Tony agrees that his income information can be used for marketing purposes by removing his name). The structure of RPAC model is investigated after defining access <b>purposes,</b> <b>intended</b> <b>purposes</b> and conditional purposes. An algorithm is developed with role-based access control (RBAC) to achieve the compliance computation between access purposes (related to data access) and <b>intended</b> <b>purposes</b> (related to data objects). Access purpose authorization and authentication in the RPAC model are studied with the hierarchical purpose structure. According to the model, more information from data providers can be extracted {{while at the same time}} assuring privacy that maximizes the usability of consumers' data. It extends role-based access control models to a further coverage of privacy preservation in database management systems by adopting <b>purposes</b> and conditional <b>intended</b> <b>purposes</b> and to achieve a fine-grained access control. The work in this paper helps enterprises to circulate a clear privacy promise, and to collect and manage user preferences and consent. ...|$|R
