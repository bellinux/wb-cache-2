The Klamath River then enters California, where it passes through three more <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>plants</b> and turns south {{near the town of}} Hornbrook towards Mount Shasta.

5|$|Hydroelectricity is {{the term}} {{referring}} to electricity generated by hydropower; the production of electrical power {{through the use of}} the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. <b>Hydroelectric</b> <b>plants</b> have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{collectivization}} {{efforts in}} the 1930s led to the concentration of the reindeer herds in kolkhozes (collective farms), which, in turn, were further consolidated into a few large-scale state farms in the late 1950s–early 1970s. By the mid-1970s, the state farms were further consolidated into just two, based in Lovozero and Krasnoshchelye. The consolidations were rationalized by the necessity to isolate the herders from the military installations, {{as well as by}} the need to flood some territories to construct <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite {{protests from}} TVA {{that it was}} unnecessary, the Manhattan District built a {{coal-fired}} power plant at K-25 with eight 25,000 KW generators. Steam generated from the K-25 power plant was subsequently used by S-50. Additional power lines were laid from the TVA <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>plants</b> at Norris Dam and Watts Bar Dam, and the Clinton Engineer Works was given its own electrical substations at K-25 and K-27. By 1945, power sources were capable of supplying Oak Ridge with up to 310,000 KW, of which 200,000 KW was earmarked for Y-12, 80,000 KW for K-25, 23,000 KW for the township, 6,000 KW for S-50 and 1,000 KW for X-10. Peak demand occurred in August 1945, when all the facilities were running. The peak load was 298,800 KW on 1 September.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hydropower}} plant {{was built in}} 1904 by a local entrepreneur. It was located {{in a small town}} outside of Reykjavík and produced 9 kW of power. The first municipal hydroelectric plant was built in 1921, and it could produce 1 MW of power. This plant single-handedly quadrupled the amount of electricity in the country. The 1950s marked the next evolution in <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>plants.</b> Two plants were built on the Sog River, one in 1953 which produced 31 MW, and the other in 1959 which produced 26.4 MW. These two plants were the first built for industrial purposes and they were co-owned by the Icelandic government. This process continued in 1965 when the national power company, Landsvirkjun, was founded. It was owned by both the Icelandic government and the municipality of Reykjavík. In 1969, they built a 210 MW plant on the Þjórsá River that would supply the southeastern area of Iceland with electricity and run an aluminum smelting plant that could produce 33,000tons of aluminum a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} {{populated}} in the Stone Age by Inari Sami people {{shortly after the}} last glacial period ended about 8000BC. The first documents from the area are tax records from the 16th century. The Inari Sami originally subsisted on hunting, gathering and especially fishing; later they began to complement this by reindeer husbandry, and later still by farming and herding cattle and sheep. The area belonged to the Inari Siida beginning in the Middle Ages. Until the border was closed in 1852, the Sami from Norway came during winter to herd their reindeer. The closing of the border caused some Norwegian Sami to settle {{in the area and}} continue with reindeer husbandry. This caught on among the Inari Sami, and the amount of husbandry increased during the 20th century. People in the area traveled up Lake Inari and onwards to the coast of Finnmark, Norway, to fish during summer. Records of markets in Finnmark date back to the 16th century, and in the 1880s about 150 people traveled to the coast each year. Logging in the southern part boomed during the 1920s, when logs were driven down the Pasvik River to Elvenes and Jakobsnes in Norway. Previously there were birch forests in the fells, but in the 1960s their leaves were eaten by the caterpillar of the autumnal moth, leaving the fells barren. The construction of the Paatsjoki River <b>Hydroelectric</b> <b>Plants</b> starting in the 1940s had a strong negative effect on the fish population; in 1976 the authorities therefore enforced the obligatory introduction of fish in Lake Inari.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} sources point to the misuse of {{hydroelectric}} dams {{as a cause of}} the floods. <b>Hydroelectric</b> <b>plants</b> in the dams of Tabasco share the production of electricity with newer, private, more expensive gas plants.
