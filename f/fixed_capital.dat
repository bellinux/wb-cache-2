Official <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> aggregates exclude the value of land, and no very reliable official estimates exist for the value of land, because of problems with credibly valuing land in a standard way for measurement purposes. If the world market prices for farm products rise, profit rates on land sales and commercial land values will increase; even if the number of land sales stays constant, the profit on land sales will increase.|$|E

The chapter discusses the way in which a large overhead of social <b>fix</b> <b>capital</b> could enter into the game of territorial transformation after the crisis. Infrastructure minors in the Alpine valleys, the services of social housing estates, soils and buildings used for productive activities and underused or abandoned territorial areas are examples of social overhead capital "suspended" that has exhausted their original potential and now are object of attention or different forms of recycling.

25|$|Through productivity-enhancing {{investments}} in <b>fixed</b> <b>capital,</b> {{the use of}} a large amount of energy (heat energy from peat as an industrial fuel, wind power) per worker, and a substantial investment in human capital (as witnessed by the high literacy rate), the Dutch managed to raise labor productivity above the levels prevailing in other European countries. This is illustrated by {{the fact that in the}} mid-17th century the agricultural sector, employing less than 40 percent of the labor force, could already almost be a net food exporter (which it became by 1800), and the fact that nominal wages between 1600 and 1800 were the highest in Europe. In the open economy of the Republic such a wage gap could only be sustained by enduring productivity differences.|$|E

In radical politics, Robertson and Hodgskin actually differed in their analysis. When Labour Defended, Hodgskin's landmark pamphlet, was reviewed in the Newspaper in 1825, there was a note of dissent from Robertson on <b>fixed</b> <b>capital.</b> This attitude diminished the ground on which Hodgskin was innovative.

25|$|Under the Solomonic dynasty, {{the chief}} provinces became Tigray (northern), {{what is now}} Amhara (central) and Shewa (southern). The seat of government, or rather of overlordship, had usually been in Amhara or Shewa, the ruler of which, calling himself nəgusä nägäst, exacted tribute, when he could, from the other provinces. The title of nəgusä nägäst was to a {{considerable}} extent based on their alleged direct descent from Solomon and the queen of Sheba; but it is needless {{to say that in}} many, if not in most, cases their success was due more to the force of their arms than to the purity of their lineage. Under the early Solomonic dynasty Ethiopia engaged in military reforms and imperial expansion which left it dominating the Horn of Africa, especially under the rule of Amda Seyon I. There was also great artistic and literary advancement at this time, but also a decline in urbanisation as the Solomonic emperors didn't have any <b>fixed</b> <b>capital,</b> but rather moved around the empire in mobile camps.|$|E
500|$|A key {{mechanism}} of government was the Royal Council (or witan). Anglo-Saxon kings {{did not have}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> city. Their courts were peripatetic, and their councils were held at varying locations around their realms. Æthelstan stayed mainly in Wessex, however, and controlled outlying areas by summoning leading figures to his councils. The small and intimate meetings that had been adequate until the enlargement of the kingdom under Edward the Elder gave way to large bodies attended by bishops, ealdormen, thegns, magnates from distant areas, and independent rulers who had submitted to his authority. Frank Stenton sees Æthelstan's councils as [...] "national assemblies", which did much to break down the provincialism that was a barrier to the unification of England. John Maddicott goes further, seeing them as the start of centralised assemblies that had a defined role in English government, and Æthelstan as [...] "the true if unwitting founder of the English parliament".|$|E

2500|$|Brazil’s {{economic}} boom between 2004 and 2012 translated into higher {{government and business}} spending {{on research and development}} (R). Gross domestic expenditure on R (GERD) almost doubled to PPP$35.5 billion (in 2011 dollars). Most of this growth occurred between 2004 and 2010, when GERD climbed from 0.97% to 1.16% of GDP. In 2012, GERD stood at 1.15% of GDP. Since 2010, the government sector alone has been driving up R intensity, since the non-government contribution has actually declined from 0.57% to 0.52% of GDP (2012). Preliminary figures for 2013 indicate slight growth in government spending and a constant contribution from the business sector (relative to GDP). Business research expenditure is likely to contract from 2015 onwards until the economy shows signs of recovery.

2500|$|Now {{that more}} {{is known about}} the trends in {{empirical}} measures of profitability, the debate focuses more on the underlying concepts. Simon Mohun states that the rate of profit is [...] "most easily measured as the proportion of net output not returned as wages to the aggregate <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> stock" [...] and that it is this rate of profit that is [...] "generally used in empirical work". If the growth of the gross profit component of value-added (P) is statistically compared with the growth of the estimated <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> stock plus inventory holdings (C), it is certainly true that almost all measures will show that the ratio P/C does drop over time. The real value of the physical capital stock appears to grow faster in real terms than the real value of the operating surplus associated with that physical stock, in the long run. The same effect persists even when various different depreciation techniques are used. The data trend is analogous to a rising tendency of the capital coefficient, where in the course of time more and more capital is required to obtain each additional increase in output. The profit rate rises again, only after a major crisis or a war which destroys a sufficiently large amount of capital value, raises the rate of surplus value, and clears the way for new production techniques.|$|E
