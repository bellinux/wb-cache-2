[...] A handful of possible yellow supergiant supernova progenitors have been discovered, but they all appear to be of relatively low mass and luminosity, not hypergiants. [...] SN 2013cu is a type IIb supernova whose progenitor has been directly and clearly observed.

50|$|In manufacturing, the {{simulated}} moving bed (SMB) {{process is a}} highly engineered process for implementing chromatographic separation. It is used to separate one chemical compound or one class of chemical compounds from one or more other chemical compounds to provide significant quantities of the purified or <b>enriched</b> <b>material</b> {{at a lower cost}} than could be obtained using simple (batch) chromatography. It cannot provide any separation or purification that cannot be done by a simple column purification. The process is rather complicated. The single advantage which it brings to a chromatographic purification is that it allows the production of large quantities of highly purified material at a dramatically reduced cost. The cost reductions come about as a result of: the use of a smaller amount of chromatographic separation media stationary phase, a continuous and high rate of production, and decreased solvent and energy requirements. This improved economic performance is brought about by a valve-and-column arrangement that is used to lengthen the stationary phase indefinitely and allow very high solute loadings to the process.|$|E

It also elevated {{the level of}} antioxidant enzymes. GHK-Cu {{has been found to}} induce a systemic enhancement of healing in rats, mice, and pigs; that is, the GHK-Cu peptide injected in one area of the body (such as the thigh muscles) improved healing at distant body areas (such as the ears). These treatments strongly increased healing parameters such as collagen production, angiogenesis, and wound closure in both wound chambers and full thickness wounds. Biotinylated GHK-Cu was incorporated into a collagen membrane, which was used as a wound dressing. This GHK-Cu <b>enriched</b> <b>material</b> stimulated wound contraction and cell proliferation, as well as increased expression of antioxidant enzymes. The same material was tested for wound healing in diabetic rats. GHK-Cu treatment resulted in faster wound contraction and epithelization, higher level of glutathione and ascorbic acid, increased synthesis of collagen, and activation of fibroblasts and mast cells. Ischemic open wounds in rats treated with GHK-copper healed faster and had decreased concentration of metalloproteinases 2 and 9 as well as of TNF-beta (a major inflammatory cytokine) compared with vehicle alone or with untreated wounds.|$|E

Alam (Theoretical physicist) from PAEC had joined the ERL and enriched the uranium at Kahuta. Dr. Anwar Ali and some other scientists also support him. The site quickly installed thousands of gas centrifuges, using the Zippe method, to run at about 65,000rpm {{for an average of}} 10 years.

In the 1970s, the ERL heavily depended on URENCO's method but lessened the dependence in 1979 after local methods were developed. Unverified claims were made by KRL in 1983-84 of conducting weapon-design tests. After visiting the site in May 1981, President Zia-ul-Haq renamed the ERL as [...] in the honor of its founder and senior scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. The KRL established a system of numerical control to control the centrifuges in 1983. By 1986, the KRL began producing the HEUs as well as developing the Krytron while classified work on the uranium weapon-design took place with 6UF being reduced to uranium metal and machined into weapon pits. The KRL began publishing series of academic articles on numerics and computational methods on centrifuge design, including a 1987 article co-authored by Qadeer Khan on techniques for balancing sophisticated ultracentrifuge rotors.|$|E

Work has been performed which analyzed the effect of relocating the CAAS detectors on the process floors of the X- 333 and X- 330 buildings from their current height to a height of 1 m{sup 1 }.

40|$|The Udachnaya East {{kimberlite}} sampled garnet peridotite xenoliths from {{a pressure}} range of 1. 2 to 7. 1 GPa in the underlying Siberian cratonic lithosphere. Samples derived from b 5. 2 GPa lie {{close to a}} typical cratonic geotherm of 40 mW m− 2, whereas more deeply derived samples have temperatures ≥ 100 °C above this geotherm. Minor and trace element compositions of garnet and clinopyroxene indicate the presence of both depleted and metasomatically <b>enriched</b> <b>material</b> in the suite. Depleted material derives from the entire sampled depth interval, but <b>enriched</b> <b>material</b> is confined to pressures of 4. 5 to 6. 6 GPa. Thus, the Siberian cratonic lithosphere under the Undachnaya pipe consisted of a relatively cool and depleted upper layer about 150 km deep, underlain by a hotter layer which extended to at least 210 km depth and contained both depleted and <b>enriched</b> <b>material.</b> Fe K-edge XANES was applied to garnets from this suite to measure their Fe 3 +/ΣFe values, enabling determination of a redox profile through the lithospheric section represented by the xenolith suite. ΔlogƒO 2 [FMQ] varied from − 2. 5 to nearly − 6. 0 over the sampled pressure interval. An overall trend to lower ΔlogƒO 2 [FMQ] values with increasing pressure was defined mostly by the depleted samples. A superimposed oxidation trend to ΔlogƒO 2 [FMQ] values 1 – 2 units higher than the main trend mostly affected the deeper, enriched samples, indicating a clear link between metasomatism and oxidation. The amount of oxidation was insufficient to de-stabilize diamond in the deep lithosphere. A possible mechanism for metasomatic enrichment relates to localized, low degree “redox melting”, whereby upwardly percolating CH 4 ±H 2 O fluids would encounter progressively more oxidizing peridotite wall-rock resulting in diamond crystallization and increased water activity in the fluid. This could lead to local partial melting and enriched melts could migrate into cooler parts of the lithosphere and crystallize, thus enriching parts of the lithosphere. Melts thus formed {{are expected to be}} relatively enriched in Fe 3 + as it is moderately incompatible during partial melting. Lithospheric domains metasomatised by solidification of these melts would be relatively enriched in Fe 3 + and garnets may therefore have higher Fe 3 +/ΣFe values, thus recording relatively higher ΔlogƒO 2 [FMQ] values...|$|E
