40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most {{commonly}} diagnosed malignancy in men in industrialized countries. Many epidemiologic studies support that dietary intake of chemopreventive agents may be protective against prostate cancer. From the several agents we focused on selenium and cruciferous vegetables. The first aim was to produce selenium enriched broccoli and to evaluate the effects. Spraying selenate onto broccoli leaves increased selenium contents in the broccoli without changing glucoraphanin contents. Se-enriched broccoli potently increases phase II detoxifying enzymes and Se-containing antioxidant enzymes in vitro, however 20 % of dietary Se-enriched broccoli and the functional foods produced from it had no influence on enzyme induction and tumor growth in vivo in the LNCaP xenograft model although liver phase II enzymes were induced and sulforaphane metabolites were detectable in the mouse plasma. The second {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of kale sprouts in the LNCaP xenograft model. Dietary kale sprouts for 6. 5 weeks did not show growth inhibitory effects. However, we observed much evidence that kale sprouts reduced the development of prostate cancer and aggressiveness. First of all, the tumors contained less hemorrhage and necrotic areas. Also, invasion of mouse-derived cells into xenografts was reduced by the intervention. Although the vessel density was not different between the groups, vessel maturation in the <b>kale</b> <b>sprout</b> group was increased, which was indicated by increased pericyte coverage of endothelial cells. Vascular maturation was associated with down-regulation of the pro-angiogenic factors and up-regulation of an anti-angiogenic factor, angiostatin. According to the vascular maturation, hemorrhage could be prevented leading to prevention of necrosis. As the third part of the study, we further investigated effects of kale sprouts on epigenetic histone modifications. Dietary kale sprouts increased histone acetylation associated with increased HAT levels rather than inhibition of HDAC activity in the LNCaP xenograft model. The change of balance between HAT and HDAC by was associated with increased histone acetylation at the promoter of p 21 and its gene expression. Dietary kale sprouts indeed increased mitotic arrest which is associated with p 21 gene induction. Interestingly, these effects were not only limited to the xenograft model but could also be shown in human PBMC after intervention. In summary, the presented thesis describes novel mechanistic modes of cruciferous vegetables, which contain potent cancer chemopreventive compounds. Importantly these effects were shown in relevant concentration that they could be used as a dietary supplement...|$|E

40|$|Consuming cruciferous {{vegetables}} such as broccoli <b>sprouts,</b> <b>kale,</b> Brussels <b>sprouts,</b> and {{bok choy}} {{is associated with}} several health benefits, such as a decreased risk of certain cancers. Cruciferous vegetables contain the glucosinolate, glucoraphanin (GFN). Cutting, chopping or chewing these vegetables releases the enzyme myrosinase, which transforms GFN into sulforaphane (SFN). SFN has many demonstrated health benefits including anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties. SFN {{has been shown to}} target apoptosis and excretion of carcinogens, cell cycle arrest, and eradication of H. pylori infections. The purpose of this project was to identify new biological pathways altered by SFN consumption in humans and potential biomarkers of SFN action. To achieve this goal, we utilized novel metabolomics technologies that profile global metabolite levels in biological fluids. We evaluated metabolomic profiles following sprout consumption using high-performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry in plasma from healthy human subjects consuming 200 µmol SFN equivalents from fresh broccoli sprouts. We observed changes in these metabolite profiles following SFN consumption. One feature significantly increased 48 hours following sprout consumption was matched to creatinine in the Human Metabolome Database.

Therefore it is today necessary to develop new strategies to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of current control methods. The so-called “Alternaria Leaf Spot“ is a common disease of crucifers caused by the fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola which affects different crops including cabbage, <b>kale,</b> Brussels <b>sprout,</b> cauliflower and broccoli. Indole phytoalexins camalexin and brassinin play in planta {{a key role in}} crop protection against this necrotrophic agent. However {{it has been shown that}} mutants become phytoalexin-resistant by activating at least three signaling pathways named as Cell Wall Integrity (CWI), High Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) and Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) [1, 2]. The latter is particularly involved in the fungus protection against phytoalexins since UPR deficient avirulent mutants of A. brassicicola appear as hypersensitive to camalexin and brassinin [3]. Since very few UPR inhibitors such as the synthetic STF- 083010 [4] are known we decided to develop an original screening assay, detecting the production of a HAC 1 fluorescence-induced protein, i. e. a transcriptional activator involved in the UPR pathway, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures (Figure 1).

One of the specialties of vegetable production in Montenegro is growing ofcollard (Brassica oleracea var. acephala), which is the simplest variety of the Brassica oleraceaspecies and in the nearest relation with their wild ancestor – the sylvestris variety. Diseases are the main restrictive factors for successful production of these vegetables. Susceptibility of the cultivars and inadequate control often result in more or less damagedcrops in some plots. Causal agents of brassica diseases, especially bacterial, have not been investigated inMontenegro until 2009.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis investigate different {{possibilities for}} vegetative propagating of some outdoor growing biennial and perennial vegetables; artichokes, brussels <b>sprouts,</b> <b>kale</b> and swiss chard. These cultures {{were selected because}} they often remain in the soil until next spring, {{after they have been}} harvested. The harvested part is above ground, which makes their root system untouched. All of these cultures are usually propagated from seed, but in situations when seed is not available, alternative method can be useful. To keep a cultivar genetic constant the vegetative propagation method is necessary and among the cultures for this study it especially regards the artichoke cultivar 'Herrgårds', which traditionally has been propagated vegetatively in Sweden. This study addresses gardeners, therefore practical methods, that are possible for the craftsman to go through with, are used. Eight propagation experiments with 25 different cutting types were conducted during 35 days in mars 2015 at the university's nursery in Mariestad. Plants were exhumed with there entire root system and different cuttings were prepared and added to substrate in mini propagators with bottom heat. The aim of this study was first to explore if vegetative propagation methods are possible to practice for these cultures. Secondly to find out what parts of these plants that are suitable to use and how these parts should be formed and positioned in the substrate. When the experiment was aborted the following results could be declared: Root cuttings from brussels sprouts had good capacity to generate both adventitious roots and shoots. Stem cuttings from brussels sprouts and root cuttings from both artichoke and swiss chard generated new adventitious roots but during this period of time they did not generate any green shoots. Leafy cuttings taken from the stem of kale generated adventitious roots and new vegetative above-ground growth. The experiments in this thesis show {{that it is possible to}} regenerate new plant growth for some of the ingoing vegetables by using vegetative propagation method, though it did not show if the new growth will develop into a new plant.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the epidemiological data concerning the cancer-preventive effect of brassica vegetables, including cabbage, <b>kale,</b> broccoli, Brussels <b>sprouts,</b> and cauliflower. The protective effect of brassicas against cancer may be due to their relatively high content of glucosinolates. Certain hydrolysis products of glucosinolates have shown anticarcinogenic properties. The results of 7 cohort studies and 87 case control studies on the association between brassica consumption and cancer risk are summarized. The cohort studies showed inverse associations between the consumption of cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli and risk of lung cancer; between the consumption of brassicas and risk of stomach cancer; between broccoli consumption and risk of all cancers taken together; and between brassica consumption and the occurrence of second primary cancers. Of the case-control studies, 67 % showed an inverse association between consumption of total brassira vegetables and risk of cancer at various sites. For cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, these percentages were 70, 56, 67, and 29 %, respectively. Although the measured effects might have been distorted by various types of bias, it is concluded that a high consumption of brassica vegetables is associated with a decreased risk of cancer. This association appears to be most consistent for lung, stomach, colon, and rectal cancer and least consistent for prostatic, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. It is not yet possible to resolve whether associations are to be attributed to brassica vegetables per se or to vegetables in general. Further epidemiological research should separate the anticarcinogenic effect of brassica vegetables from the effect of vegetables in general...|$|R
