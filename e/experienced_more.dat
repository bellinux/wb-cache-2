5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} at between 1–3 years. Most Eurasian sparrowhawks {{stay on the}} same territory for one breeding season, though others keep the same one for up to eight years. A change of mate usually triggers the change in territory. Older birds tend {{to stay in the}} same territory; failed breeding attempts make a move more likely. The birds which kept the same territories had higher nest success, though it did not increase between years; females which moved <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> success the year after changing territory.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1781, both pro-British and separatist forces began concentrating in Virginia, a state that had {{previously}} not <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> than naval raids. The British forces were led at first by the turncoat Benedict Arnold, and then by William Phillips before General Charles, Earl Cornwallis, arrived in late May with his southern army to take command. In June he marched to Williamsburg, where he received a confusing series of orders from General Sir Henry Clinton that culminated in a directive to establish a fortified deep-water port (which would allow resupply by sea). In response to these orders, Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in late July, where his army began building fortifications. The presence of these British troops, coupled with General Clinton's desire for a port there, made control of the Chesapeake Bay an essential naval objective for both sides.|$|E
5|$|Following the European tour, Butthole Surfers <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> {{upheaval}} when Nervosa left around Christmas 1985, as she {{was tired}} of the living conditions associated with constant touring and had a desire to be with family. She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez, Jr. in the press soon after joining the band. Cabbage had previously performed with Kathleen Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady) in the band Easturn Stars; Lynch gained fame as Butthole Surfers' infamous naked dancer from 1986 to 1989. Kramer also left during this period and was replaced by Jeff Pinkus, who gave the band's bass position its longest period of stability by staying until 1994.|$|E

While the former typically <b>experience</b> <b>more</b> confined conditions, the airline cabin crew tend to <b>experience</b> <b>more</b> symptoms associated with sopite syndrome; this effect {{may be attributed to}} the lack of visual validation and increased movement of the cabin crew.|$|R
5|$|Light {{rainfall}} and gusty winds caused minor damage in Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Trinidad and Tobago. In the United States Virgin Islands, brief blackouts and damage reaching $200,000 (2000USD) was reported. Effects were most severe in Puerto Rico, where isolated locations <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> than 12inches (300mm) of rainfall. The heavy precipitation resulted in mudslides and flooding, {{which in turn}} damaged roads, bridges, and houses. At least 406homes on the island were flooded, five of which suffered moderate to severe damage. Additionally, there were many car accidents in San Juan due to slick roads. One indirectly fatality was reported after a man fell off his roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish. Damage {{on the island of}} Puerto Rico reached $501,000. In Dominican Republic, the Civil Defense Force reported that severe flooding in the northern portions of that country caused the evacuation of more than 700people. Overall, the storm caused roughly $35,000 in damage across the island. Impact was lesser in Haiti, where squalls tore tin roofs off of numerous shanty homes and subsequently flooded a few. Additionally, rainfall in Cuba brought relief to an 8month long drought impacting the region.|$|E

25|$|The {{blizzard}} {{was part}} of a winter remarkable for its snowstorms in the affected states, where total snowfall for the season ranked in the topten and even higher in some areas. In sections of the coastal northeast, 75inches of total snowfall occurred that year. Some Maryland communities getting more than three feet of snow in the President's Day blizzard, such as Kingsville and Perry Hall, <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> than 80inches of snow for the entire winter season.|$|E
25|$|In the 11th century, the Muslim {{holdings}} fractured into rival Taifa kingdoms, {{allowing the}} small Christian states {{the opportunity to}} greatly enlarge their territories. The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the Almoravids and the Almohads restored unity upon the Muslim holdings, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and saw a revival in Muslim fortunes. This re-united Islamic state <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains.|$|E
25|$|These {{differences}} in development appear {{to play out}} in the way young adoptees deal with major life events. In the case of parental divorce, adoptees {{have been found to}} respond differently from children who have not been adopted. While the general population <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> behavioral problems, substance use, lower school achievement, and impaired social competence after parental divorce, the adoptee population appeared to be unaffected in terms of their outside relationships, specifically in their school or social abilities.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the extreme}} cases {{springing}} may cause severe fatigue cracking of critical structural details, especially in moderate to rough head seas with low peak periods. Vibration is normally more easily excited by waves {{in ballast condition}} than in cargo condition. The converse may also be true since some ships <b>experience</b> <b>more</b> head wind and waves in ballast conditions, while other ships may <b>experience</b> <b>more</b> head wind and waves in cargo condition, thereby vibrating less overall.|$|R
5000|$|A {{possible}} {{mechanism of}} the parietal lobe's involvement in recognition memory may be differential activation for recollected versus familiar memories, and old versus new stimuli. This region of the brain shows greater activation during segments of recognition tasks containing primarily old stimuli, versus primarily new stimuli. [...] A dissociation between the dorsal and ventral parietal regions has been demonstrated, with the ventral region <b>experiencing</b> <b>more</b> activation for recollected items, and the dorsal region <b>experiencing</b> <b>more</b> activation for familiar items.|$|R

25|$|The European economy {{entered a}} vicious circle in which hunger and chronic, {{low-level}} debilitating disease reduced {{the productivity of}} labourers, and so the grain output was reduced, causing grain prices to increase. This situation was worsened when landowners and monarchs like Edward III of England (r. 1327–1377) and Philip VI of France (r. 1328–1350), out of a fear that their comparatively high standard of living would decline, raised the fines and rents of their tenants. Standards of living then fell drastically, diets grew more limited, and Europeans as a whole <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> health problems.|$|E

She is {{the first woman to}} become chair of the NRSC. During her election cycle as chairperson, her Democratic Party counterpart, Senator Chuck Schumer raised significantly more money, and <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> success in recruiting candidates. In the November election, Dole's party lost six U.S. Senate seats to the Democrats, thus losing control of the U.S. Senate. Dole was replaced as NRSC chair by Senator John Ensign of Nevada following the 2006 midterms.|$|E
25|$|The {{party was}} founded in 1921 as the Portuguese section of the Communist International (Comintern). Made illegal after a coup in the late 1920s, the PCP {{played a major role}} in the {{opposition}} to the dictatorial regime of António de Oliveira Salazar. During the five-decades-long dictatorship, the party was constantly suppressed by the political police, the PIDE, which forced its members to live in clandestine status under the threat of arrest, torture, and murder. After the Carnation Revolution in 1974, which overthrew the 48-year regime, the 36 members of party's Central Committee had, in the aggregate, <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> than 300 years in jail.|$|E

Patients with hepatic insufficiency resulting in serum bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) should not be administered docetaxel, though this is not a stated contraindication. Dosage should be reduced by 20% in people who develop; grade 3 or 4 diarrhea following exposure to docetaxel, hepatotoxicity defined by liver enzymes at levels greater than five times the ULN, and grade 2 palmer-planter toxicity.|$|E

Wilson <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> success with his return to writing, and he published short works on the international impact of the American Revolution and the rise of totalitarianism. He also campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 1922 elections, and he hinted to friends that he might pursue a third term in the 1924 presidential election. In August 1923, he attended the funeral of his successor, Warren G. Harding.|$|E
25|$|The Los Angeles {{flood of}} 1938 {{was one of}} the largest floods in the history of Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside Counties in {{southern}} California. The flood was caused by two Pacific storms that swept across the Los Angeles Basin in February-March 1938 and generated almost one year's worth of precipitation in just a few days. Between 113–115 people were killed by the flooding. The Los Angeles, San Gabriel and Santa Ana Rivers burst their banks, inundating much of the coastal plain, the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys, and the Inland Empire. Flood control structures spared parts of Los Angeles County from destruction, while Orange and Riverside Counties <b>experienced</b> <b>more</b> damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} pain {{experienced}} during the piercing process differs {{from person to}} person and depends on the specific location of the piercing. Those with thicker lips or well-exercised facial muscles will have more flesh or muscle to pierce, so they may <b>experience</b> <b>more</b> discomfort. Men may <b>experience</b> slightly <b>more</b> pain than women, as repeated shaving can make the skin of the upper lip tougher and harder to pierce. The orbicularis oris (the sphincter muscle around the mouth) is used in the playing of brass and woodwind instruments; as a result, players of these instruments tend to have a larger muscle around the mouth and may <b>experience</b> <b>more</b> discomfort during the piercing process.|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that higher educated twenty-somethings <b>experience</b> <b>more</b> choice overload than lower educated twenty-somethings was tested. 146 participants, either in university or in community college, filled in questionnaires asserting {{their levels of}} choice overload. As expected, higher educated (WO) twenty-somethings reported more choice overload than lower (MBO) educated twenty-somethings. Correlations were also found between choice overload and peer-pressure, student’s housing situation {{and whether or not}} students regarded themselves as adults. It was concluded that higher educated twenty-somethings indeed <b>experience</b> <b>more</b> choice overload compared to lower educated twenty-somethings...|$|R
