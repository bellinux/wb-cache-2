The individual red, blue and green lasers are then controlled in brightness (modulated) to produce any desired color in the final beam.

50|$|The {{specimen}} is illuminated {{with light}} of a specific wavelength (or wavelengths) which is absorbed by the fluorophores, causing them to emit light of longer wavelengths (i.e., of a different color than the absorbed light). The illumination light is separated from the much weaker emitted fluorescence {{through the use of}} a spectral emission filter. Typical components of a fluorescence microscope are a light source (xenon arc lamp or mercury-vapor lamp are common; more advanced forms are high-power LEDs and lasers), the excitation filter, the <b>dichroic</b> <b>mirror</b> (or dichroic beamsplitter), and the emission filter (see figure below). The filters and the dichroic beamsplitter are chosen to match the spectral excitation and emission characteristics of the fluorophore used to label the specimen.

Multi-color images of several types of fluorophores must be composed by combining several single-color images.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>dichroic</b> <b>mirror</b> or filter, {{instead of}} using an oil film to produce the interference, {{alternating}} layers of optical coatings with different refractive indices are built up upon a glass substrate.

The layers are usually added by vacuum deposition. By controlling the thickness and number of the layers, the frequency (wavelength) of the passband of the filter can be tuned and made as wide or narrow as desired. Because unwanted wavelengths are reflected rather than absorbed, dichroic filters do not absorb this unwanted energy during operation and so do not become nearly as hot as the equivalent conventional filter (which attempts to absorb all energy except for that in the passband).

This is due to constructive optical interference between alternating layers of two thin films of different refractive indices. This study explored the sputtering methods of thin-film multilayers to form <b>dichroic</b> <b>mirrors</b> in the visible spectrum for future solar-cell applications. Silicon oxide and silicon nitride targets were selected as materials used in the sputtering process. The sputtered multilayers and films were then characterized and analyzed using spectrophotometry. The transmission spectrum of the initial multilayer depicted failure in transmission at wavelengths under 500 nm. The components of the multilayer were then sputtered and analyzed to troubleshoot the problematic nitride films. Transmission spectra were utilized to select each following process, and both reactive sputtering and cosputtering were explored as means of creating nitride films with functional properties. Transmission spectra were analyzed using the Swanepoel method to quantify optical characteristics to assure reactive sputtering of the targets in a nitrogen environment as a viable direction of mirror construction.
