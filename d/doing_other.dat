Although Sunday never received a high school diploma, by 1880 he was better educated than many of his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to reduced}} demand for coal, {{resulting}} {{from an economic}} downturn, many of CF's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> useful projects.|$|E

5|$|Those who remained, {{such as the}} lame, {{the blind}} and the aged, {{employed}} themselves in cultivating the land and <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> manual work. Many were made to carry baskets filled with gobra (cowdung) for three days as a public warning to others. The stubborn Christians were given the most menial tasks, and made {{to work in the}} paddy fields. They were underfed, and immediately imprisoned for fighting. Completely isolated from any women, the idea was for the captive men to die of old age without creating any progeny.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E
5|$|The premiere {{took place}} at the EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts in Calgary in February 2011. Performances were {{scheduled}} to run on the centre's Motel stage between February 23 and March 5. Tickets quickly sold out. Four days after the premiere, Burnt Thicket Theatre moved the play to the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer, where the play was scheduled to be performed until March 12. All the performances in Red Deer were sold out. The play drew emotional reactions from the audience. Kooman learned that some audience members at the initial performances later responded to the play by talking with others about human trafficking, writing letters to their Members of Parliament, and <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> creative things on the subject. They also contacted Waldschmidt, sometimes up to a year later, with stories about how the play had continued to affect their lives. In conjunction with the initial run of She Has a Name, Burnt Thicket Theatre provided the names of organizations that assist human-trafficking victims. There was also a panel discussion about human trafficking after the matinée on February 26.|$|E

5|$|The second {{version was}} a lyric video, which {{features}} Hamasaki in a recording studio. It also features candid photos of Hamasaki in Los Angeles, Japan, and <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> endeavours outside of music. The Riff Studio version features Hamasaki as her character design AyuPan and a character titled the Bloody Bunny. Both {{of them are}} in a space ship, and travel throughout different worlds and atmospheres, until landing on a planet with blue aliens. The aliens appear to be sad, whist AyuPan and the Bloody Bunny stand there. AyuPan then plays the song from her space ship, and makes the aliens feel happy; they all begin dancing to the track. It ends with the world turning pink instead of blue, and has heart shapes around it. This version premiered one week before the album's release in July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E

25|$|Educated at Lowell High School, {{following}} {{the guidance of}} her stepfather she enrolled in a business course at the College of Marin.

In defiance to her stepfather's wishes that she attend a business school, Dian wanted to spend her professional life working with animals. As a consequence, Dian's parents failed to give her any substantial amount of financial support throughout her adult life. She supported herself by working as a clerk at White Front (a department store), <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> clerking and laboratory work, and laboring as a machinist in a factory.|$|E

25|$|Other minor sects in India carry no {{specific}} name, {{but they are}} uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition {{was derived from the}} concept of Rahukaalam, in which Hindus believe that a specific time period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have {{led to the development of}} a more constrained religious hierarchy. Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods of time after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include Gudivada, Padalapalli, Pantham, and Kashyap.|$|E

500|$|Julian {{attended}} DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. The college accepted few African-American students. The segregated {{nature of}} the town forced social humiliations. Julian {{was not allowed to}} live in the college dormitories and first stayed in an off-campus boarding home, which refused to serve him meals. [...] It took him days before Julian found an establishment where he could eat. He later found work firing the furnace, waiting tables, and <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> odd jobs in a fraternity house; in return, he was allowed to sleep in the attic and eat at the house. Julian graduated from DePauw in 1920 as a Phi Beta Kappa and valedictorian. By 1930 Julian's father would move the entire family to Greencastle so that all his children could attend college at DePauw. [...] He still worked as a railroad postal clerk.|$|E

Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard [...] "corvettes, North Atlantic.
