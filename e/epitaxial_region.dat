40|$|We have {{deposited}} III-V alloys on 200 mm Si miscut wafers with an oxide pattern. The selective {{epitaxial growth}} (SEG) of GaAs in large windows defined by SiO 2 lines on a thick strained-relaxed Ge buffer layer served as a test vehicle which allowed us to demonstrate the integration of a III-V material deposition process step in a Si manufacturing line using an industrial reactor. High quality GaAs layers with high wafer-scale thickness uniformity were achieved. In a subsequent step, SEG of InP was successfully performed on wafers with a 300 nm shallow trench isolation pattern. The seed layer morphology depended on {{the treatment of the}} Ge surface and on the growth temperature.

40|$|The wafer-scale {{integration}} of advanced optical, electrical, and micromechanical semiconductor devices {{on a single}} chip requires techniques for combining differing semiconductor structures in {{the plane of the}} wafer. We have developed a technique for achieving large-scale monolithic {{integration of}} lattice-mismatched materials in the vertical direction and the lateral integration of dissimilar lattice-matched structures. The technique uses a single non-planar wafer-bonding step to transform epitaxial structures into lateral epitaxial variation across the surface of a wafer. Non-planar wafer bonding begins with multiple epitaxial regions grown vertically on a wafer as shown for the case of four different regions in Fig. 1. The surface is then etched with a step shaped profile to reveal a different <b>epitaxial</b> <b>region</b> on each step level. The backside of the wafer is etched to have a profile complimentary to the step etched epitaxial film side of the wafer, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). This substrate thickness adjustment etch is designed to yield an identical substrate plus epitaxial film thickness at each lateral point on the wafer. The lateral offset between the front side and backside step edges determines the distance over which the substrate and epitaxial layers must accommodate the deformation. The wafer is then direct wafer bonded [1] to a transfer substrate. We can remove the original growth substrate leaving the epitaxial layers attached to the transfer substrate as depicted in Fig. 2 (b). At this point the excess epitaxial layers and the deformation accommodation regions are etched back, leaving a different <b>epitaxial</b> <b>region</b> at each lateral position on the transfer substrate as represented by Fig. 2 (c) ...|$|E
40|$|We present {{two-dimensional}} device physics {{simulations of}} amorphous silicon / crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells {{to explain the}} effects of full and localized epitaxial layers, sometimes observed {{in the early stages}} of amorphous Si deposition, on cell performance. Minimizing the defect density, thickness, and wafer area fraction covered by the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>region</b> are shown to be important factors for maximizing cell open circuit voltage. We find that localized defect-rich epitaxial patches covering small percentages of the wafer surface (~ 5 %) can cause significant reduction in open circuit voltage, which is explained by considering lateral carrier flow in the device. We also show that a thin layer of low-mobility material, such as microcrystalline silicon, included between the wafer and amorphous regions can impede lateral carrier flow and improve conversion efficiencies in cases where isolated defective pinholes limit device performance...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparative}} study of InGaAs/InAlAs high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), intended for cryogenic ultra-low noise amplifiers (LNAs) and fabricated on different substrate and buffer technologies. The first was pseudomorphically grown on InP (InP pHEMT) while the second was grown on a linearly graded metamorphic InAlAs buffer {{on top of a}} GaAs substrate (GaAs mHEMT). Both HEMTs had identical active <b>epitaxial</b> <b>regions.</b> When integrated in a 4 – 8 GHz 3 -stage LNA at 300 K, the measured average noise temperature was 45 K for the InP pHEMT and 49 K (9 % higher) for the GaAs mHEMT. When cooled down to 10 K, the InP pHEMT LNA was improved to 1. 7 K whereas the GaAs mHEMT LNA was only reduced to 4 K (135 % higher). The observed superior cryogenic noise performance of the HEMTs grown on InP is believed to be due to a higher carrier confinement within the channel.

40|$|Integrated CMOS Active Pixel Sensor (APS) arrays {{have been}} {{fabricated}} and tested using X-ray and electron sources. The 128 by 128 pixel arrays, designed {{in a standard}} 0. 25 micron process, use a {approx} 10 micron epitaxial silicon layer as a deep detection region. The epitaxial layer has a much greater thickness than the surface features used by standard CMOS APS, leading to stronger signals and potentially better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). On the other hand, minority carriers confined within the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>region</b> may diffuse to neighboring pixels, blur images and reduce peak signal intensity. But for low-rate, sparse-event images, centroid analysis of this diffusion {{may be used to}} increase position resolution. Careful trade-offs involving pixel size and sense-node area verses capacitance must be made to optimize overall performance. The prototype sensor arrays, therefore, include a range of different pixel designs, including different APS circuits and a range of different epitaxial layer contact structures.

40|$|We {{use what}} is known about {{transition}} metal (TM) defect thermodynamic driving forces and kinetic responses to make predictive simulation of gettering during solar cell fabrication possible. We have developed a simulator to explore the impact of various device and process parameters on gettering effectiveness. The relevant heat treatments are ramps up in temperature, isothermal annealing, and cools from high temperature down to room temperature. We explore a range of surface conditions, density and size of heterogeneous nucleation sites in the bulk, and the degree of contamination {{in order to create a}} framework in which to examine these mechanisms acting in concert. Such simulations enable process optimization for gettering. For solar cell processing, segregation to an Al back contact layer is routine. We have estimated the segregation coefficient between a p-type Si wafer and a molten Al layer by the Calphad method and use these results to estimate the thermodynamic driving force for redistribution of Fe into the Al layer. We simulate gettering treatments of supersaturated levels of Fe contamination in Si samples with FeSi 2 and Al contacts and compare these results with data at various temperatures. The gettering data for FeSi 2 contacts follow a simple exponential decay and can be simulated with appropriate choice of internal gettering time constant. We recognize that radiative heating dominates the temperature ramp for samples in evacuated quartz ampoules and use reasonable parameters to include this effect in our simulations. Fitting parameters for [Fe] data taken from heat treatments at 755 Ê»C on samples with FeSi 2 and Al contacts successfully predict the gettering data of Al coated samples treated at 810 Ê»C. (cont.) Discrepencies in the data for Al coated samples treated at 6950 C and data for Al coated samples treated at 755 Ê»C after long times have exposed a new mechanism dominating internal gettering processes. We propose the existence of a silicide precipitate growth retardation mechanism as a result of supersaturation of the Si vacancy (V). Accumulation of V reduces the ability of precipitates to relax strain free-energy ([Delta]g strain) by further V emission. We performed Cu gettering experiments on p/p+ epitaxial wafers. Photoluminescence measurements revealed significant Cu removal from the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>region</b> compared to similarly doped uniformly doped float zone (FZ) Si wafers. Step etching revealed haze, indicating the presence of silicide precipitates below the epitaxial layer in the heavily doped substrates. Uncontaminated heat treated epitaxial wafers did not demonstrate the presence of haze after step etching. This finding demonstrates that redistribution of Cu from the lightly doped expitaxial layer to the heavily doped substrate as predicted by the dopant enhanced solubility model has occurred. The commonly used T 3 / 2 model for effective density of conduction and valence band states (Nc and Nv respectively) is not accurate for Si, even in the device operation regime, and the available experimentally determined relations of Green do not extend past 500 K.

40|$|In this letter, {{we report}} the {{enhanced}} fringe capacitance in FinFETs {{when compared to}} the equivalent planar MOSFETs at the 22 -nm node.

Using well-calibrated 3 -D mixed-mode simulations, we show that this will cause the performance of FinFETs to be significantly degraded, unless proper device optimizations are carried out. Our results also indicate that the selective epi growth of S/D may adversely affect the overall performance of FinFETs, although it is effective in reducing series resistance. The increased parasitic components in FinFETs can be a serious issue for FinFET circuits with a large fan-out, and the solution lies in the aggressive fin pitch reduction, as shown in this letter...|$|R

40|$|The {{passivation}} of the amorphous crystalline silicon heterojunction SHJ and {{the hole}} transport across the same are the dominating topics in this thesis. The different chapters focus on The influence of hydrogen on SHJ passivation and an alternative passivation process for surfaces with higher surface free energy, {{the application of}} anti reflection nanostructures and the current generation in these structures, {{the application of a}} novel liquid precursor for SHJ passivation, the investigation of its conversion process and the differences between the resulting layer and PECV deposited a Si H layers, the transport across the SHJ and its dependence on the valence band offset and the future research topics for silicon heterojunction solar cells. Chapter 4 comprised an investigation of a two step process for the fabrication of i a Si H passivation layers on non ideal c Si surfaces. The more common approach of directly depositing the best possible passivation layer in a single step is sensitive to surface properties, such as the higher surface free energy of the 100 surface, and results in higher defect densities at Si 100, or crystallographically undefined surfaces, than on Si 111. Using a two step approach allows to deposit structurally worse a Si H layers first. These layers are less likely to form <b>epitaxial</b> <b>regions</b> on surfaces with higher free surface energies. In a second step the layer is then exposed to a hydrogen plasma treatment, which allows to introduce additional hydrogen into the layer and reduce the structural disorder. The two step approach allows to form an epitaxy free and hydrogen rich interface at the SHJ. Chapter 5 describes the application of the aforementioned method to passivate nanotextured silicon surfaces with i a Si H. The technological question in this project was to enable epitaxy free i a Si H growth on the crystallographically undefined nanotexture and then apply a hydrogen plasma, which improves the structural quality of the layer, but does not induce crystallization. Additionally the nanotextured solar cells featured a low quantum efficiency at the shorter wavelengths of the visible spectrum. It was deduced from simulations that this low quantum efficiency is based on parasitic absorption in crystalline silicon and a follow up experiment with nanotextures of varied height enabled to show that this parasitic absorption happens inside the nanotexture. The work on liquid silicon precursors for SHJ passivation is another application for the hydrogen plasma developed in chapter 4. In contrast to the previous application, the structural quality of the as deposited a Si H layers was acceptable, as shown by photo electron spectroscopy measurements of the valence band. Amorphous silicon layers prepared from liquid precursors feature low hydrogen densities. Also, these layers tend to be macroscopically porous. Both issues can be solved by a HPT. In addition to achieving a well passivated SHJ with a liquid silicon precursor, the conversion of the liquid silicon precursor was investigated and the differences of these layers to PECV deposited material were discussed. Using minority carrier lifetime spectroscopy and XPS the conversion from polysilane to a Si H was found to happen at about 350 C. Chapter 7 focuses on the charge transfer across the SHJ.

40|$|The 380 -nm InGaN/AlGaN {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) were fabricated on a conventional and patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs) by metalorganic {{vapor phase epitaxy}} (MOVPE). Micro-photoluminescence (PL) measurements showed superior near-band-edge luminescence intensity from the overhang area {{as compared to the}} layer directly on the flat sapphire region. This was accompanied by a small redshift of the PL peak wavelength that could be attributed to a relief of compressive stress in the <b>epitaxial</b> lateral overgrowth <b>region.</b> From the temperature-dependent PL measurements, we obtain an integrated PL intensity ratio at 300 - 10 K of similar to 13. 7 % and thermal activation energy of 94 meV from the InGaN/AlGaN MQW PSS LED sample. Under a 20 -mA current injection, the output power increased from 3. 75 to 5. 06 mW, corresponding to about 35 % increase in external quantum efficiency. It is evident that the increase in output power depends on both the defect reduction of epitaxial lateral overgrowth of GaN and the scattering of emitted light at the GaN/sapphire interface.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the main aspects in {{chemical}} vapordeposition (CVD) of silicon (Si) and silicon-germanium (Si 1 -xGex) films for high-speed bipolar transistors. In situdoping of polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) using phosphine (PH 3) and disilane (Si 2 H 6) in a low-pressure CVD reactor was investigated toestablish a poly-Si emitter fabrication process. The growthkinetics and P incorporation was studied for amorphous Si filmgrowth. Hydrogen (H) incorporated in the as-deposited films wasrelated to growth kinetics and the energy for H 2 desorption was extracted. Film properties such asresistivity, mobility, carrier concentration and grain growthwere studied after crystallization using either furnaceannealing or rapid thermal annealing (RTA). In order tointegrate an epitaxial base, non-selective epitaxial growth(NSEG) of Si and SiGe in a lamp-heated single-waferreduced-pressure CVD reactor was examined. The growth kineticsfor Si epitaxy and poly-Si deposition showed a differentdependence on the deposition conditions i. e. temperature andpressure. The growth rate difference was mainly due to growthkinetics rather than wafer surface emissivity effects. However,it was observed that the growth rate for Si epitaxy and poly-Sideposition was varying during growth and the time-dependencewas attributed to wafer surface emissivity variations. A modelto describe the emissivity effects was established, taking intoconsideration kinetics and the reactor heating mechanisms suchas heat absorption, emission andconduction. Growth ratevariations in opening of different sizes (local loading) andfor different oxide surface coverage (global loading) wereinvestigated. No local loading effects were observed, whileglobal loading effects were attributed to chemical as well astemperature effects. Finally, misfit dislocations formed in theSiGe epitaxy during NSEG were found to originate from theinterface between the <b>epitaxial</b> and polycrystalline <b>regions.</b> The dislocations tended to propagate across the activearea.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} growth of {{intermetallic}} compounds by co-sputtering from single elemental targets. The preliminary work involved constructing a sputtering set-up to grow a binary alloy (Sm-Co) and investigating how to control the composition spread that was obtained. Having achieved this, a larger sputtering flange was built up to grow the ternary Heusler alloy, Co 2 MnSi. Co 2 MnSi has been predicted to be a half-metallic ferromagnet, which {{means that there is}} an energy gap in the minority spin band at the Fermi energy. This leads to 100 % spin polarised conduction electrons, which would enable ideal spin-device performance to be obtained. Co 2 MnSi is particularly promising because it is predicted to have a large energy gap in the minority band of ~ 0. 4 eV and has the highest Curie temperature among the known Heuslers of 985 K. Initially, Co 2 MnSi was grown on a-plane sapphire and stoichiometric films were single phase and highly (110) textured, without the use of a seed layer. They exhibited the bulk value of the saturation magnetisation, Ms and films grown at the highest deposition temperature (715 K) showed the lowest resistivity (47 µΩcm at 4. 2 K) and the lowest room temperature coercivity (18 Oe). The spin polarisation of the transport current, Pt of a 400 nm film grown at this deposition temperature was 54 %, consistent with measurements on bulk single crystals. Ms decreased with decreasing film thickness indicating a graded disorder. By growing on GaAs (001), which has a similar lattice parameter to Co 2 MnSi it was expected that this disordered region would be confined to the first few atomic layers. However, {{this was not the case}} because interfacial reactions resulted in the formation of an <b>epitaxial</b> Mn-As <b>region,</b> and a thin interfacial layer that was Co-Ga rich. This prevented the lattice matching of the Co 2 MnSi to the GaAs(001) hence hindering epitaxial growth of the Heusler. The reaction zone also meant that films exhibited a Ms slightly below the bulk value. The expected fourfold anisotropy was not obtained for this cubic material, which is most likely due to the anisotropy of the reconstructed GaAs surface. In spite of this anomalous behaviour, Pt was 55 %, similar to the result obtained on sapphire, indicating that either Pt is independent of orientation or that the Heusler surface reconstructs in the same way. Films showed some improved properties to films grown on a-plane sapphire, indicating the potential of growing on this technologically important substrate. With this in mind, pseudo spin valves involving Co 2 MnSi as one of the ferromagnetic electrodes were fabricated in both the CIP and CPP configurations. Clear low-field spin-valve contributions were observed at 15 K but the MR values are much lower than that expected from a PSV with a predicted 100 % spin polarised electrode. EPSR...|$|R
