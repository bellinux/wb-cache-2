50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{here was}} originally built in 1864 and in 1991 {{the light was}} automated. The lighthouse has a white, red, or green light (depending on direction) that is occulting three times every 10 seconds. The 27 m round cast iron tower is painted red with one white horizontal band. The site includes a complete and well-preserved light station, including a 1-1/2 story duplex keeper's <b>house,</b> <b>generator</b> house, boathouse, and farm buildings.|$|E
50|$|Barking's {{original}} A {{station was}} extended by {{the building of}} the B station, which began to operate at full capacity in 1939. The capacity of the B Station was 303 MW with 4 x 75 MW B.T.H. turbo-generators plus a small <b>house</b> <b>generator</b> of 3.5 MW capacity. Steam conditions were 600 psig and 800'F. The B Station had 16 B&W chain grate boilers, each capable of producing 256,000 lbs steam per hour. These were arranged in two boiler houses, with 8 boilers in each. The power station was transferred to the London Division of the British Electricity Authority in 1948. The B station closed on 15 March 1976, at which time its generating capacity was 144 megawatts.|$|E

50|$|On the {{escarpment}} {{above the}} motorway {{is one of}} a network of early warning radar stations that were built around the coast of Britain from 1941, to look for German bombers and shipping during World War II. Earlier Chain Home stations were able to spot aircraft at higher altitudes, so a second network, the Chain Home Low stations, of which Margam was one, were built to detect low-flying planes and shipping. The Margam station, which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, has the inland route of the Wales Coast Path running past it. Three flat-topped buildings stand high on the escarpment, overlooking Port Talbot and Swansea Bay. They would have <b>housed</b> <b>generators</b> and control equipment, with a large antenna on the roof.|$|R

500|$|It was {{replaced}} in 1896, possibly {{on the same}} site, by a new lighthouse built to a design by David Stevenson {{as part of a}} major programme of construction works around northern Scotland. A fog warning system was installed the following year. Stevenson's lighthouse consists of a circular white-painted stone tower standing [...] high at an elevation of [...] above Mean High Water with a number of buildings nearby to <b>house</b> <b>generators</b> and the lighthouse keepers. The light was converted to a paraffin lamp when the former lythene lamp was found to be unsuitable. An oil store was installed in the lighthouse tower, ending the need for a separate building to hold the fuel. The lighthouse was subjected to a machine-gun attack by a German aircraft on 22 February 1941. It caused little damage and no injuries, and the keepers were soon able to make repairs.|$|R
50|$|The farm {{includes}} thirteen buildings, {{eleven of}} which are contributing buildings, and five other contributing resources. Power's original farmhouse, which {{also served as a}} local courthouse, is the farm's oldest building; built in 1929, it was the first frame building in the county north of the Sangamon River. A new main farmhouse with a detached kitchen was built circa 1840-1850; this farmhouse is still the farm's main building. The 1845 wooden stable is the oldest non-residence building on the farm. Three other large 19th-century buildings remain on the farm: the main barn, caretaker's cottage, and scales house. Significant outbuildings include the wood house, smoke house, ice <b>house,</b> gas <b>generator</b> <b>house,</b> privy, pergola, and corn crib. A family cemetery is located to the southeast of the main farmhouse.|$|R

50|$|The City Mills complex {{was built}} as a grist mill. The oldest {{building}} dates to 1869, and was built by Horace King, a well-known regional African-American contractor. The original 1828 dam was replaced in 1908, and the main building was adapted for electrical power generation and distribution. It <b>houses</b> power <b>generators</b> installed in 1919, some of which operated into the 1960s.|$|R
2500|$|The {{remains of}} The Magnetic Battery {{form part of}} the popular [...] {{environmental}} and heritage trail, The Forts Walk. The walking trail begins at the turnoff {{of the road to}} Radical, Florence and Arthur Bays from Horseshoe Bay Road and winds through the hinterland following the approximate route the original track to the battery followed. The track provides excellent views over Arthur and Florence bays and native wildlife can often be seen alongside the track. Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service maintains the track and fortifications and has provided safe staircases to allow near-unrestricted access to the Command Post and Observation Post. It {{is important to note that}} the Command Post building is still an operational radio-repeater and navigational beacon, as such part of the second story of the building has been bricked off to <b>house</b> <b>generators</b> and radio equipment. The walking trail is a popular tourist activity and Magnetic Island Bus Service provides a regular bus service to the entrance to the trail.|$|R

5000|$|A {{brush fire}} on July 13, 2000, burned down the 1895 head keeper’s dwelling, a wood privy, and a storage shed. The two {{assistant}} keeper’s dwellings were torn down around 1960, prior to automation of the lighthouse, but the head keeper's house, {{along with an}} oil <b>house</b> and <b>generator</b> building, had been sold to a hunting club before being taken over by The Nature Conservancy in 1995.|$|R
50|$|During the ghost's next appearance, Liam restarts the <b>house's</b> <b>generator</b> while Scott sets up his equipment. After {{the machine}} reaches its lowest frequency, the attack {{suddenly}} ends, and Holly {{admits that the}} ghost is gone. As the relieved ghost hunters pack up their equipment, Liam notices a strangely-cold corner in the kitchen. Upon further investigation, a hidden passage leads to another room. There, they discover the mummified remains of a woman. Overwhelmed by a paranormal presence, Holly is forced to leave the room, and the others call the police, who, after looking, {{say there is no}} body in the room. As the ghost hunters attempt to convince the police officers of their story, Holly is suddenly possessed and reveals that the first ghost was trying to frighten them off and protect them from the second, the woman. The second ghost quickly kills the police officers, then Scott. Liam saves Holly, only to be killed himself. As Holly flees the house, the ghost kills her. In the final scene the killer ghost finally shows itself and the credits roll.|$|R
