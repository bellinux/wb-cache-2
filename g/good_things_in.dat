25|$|The Chinese {{association}} of Venus to Metal appears at first {{fundamentally different from}} Western notions of love and romance. In Babylonian mythology, her equivalent was Ishtar, goddess of both love and war. The Chinese metal representative is unyielding and forceful, set in their ways and taciturn; yet Venus' Western element is air, which is logical and sanguine. Metal is also sophisticated, and enjoys the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> life. In Western astrology, Venus rules both Libra, which is sophisticated, logical, and romantic, and Taurus, which is reserved, sensual, and unyielding. Some Western astrologers believe that metal is better associated with the qualities of the planet Saturn, arguing that metal equates to air in the western system, and that Saturn is linked to air in Vedic astrology.|$|E

500|$|The mixtape {{received}} general acclaim among music critics, despite {{not being}} an official release. In a review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau {{said he was}} more interested in hearing M.I.A.'s own original music than a mashup: [...] "I find more fascination—and pleasure, if not variety—in M.I.A. juxtaposed against herself than in, for instance, favela funk juxtaposed against 'Walk Like an Egyptian'. Which isn't to deny I also find all these <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> favela funk juxtaposed against 'Walk Like an Egyptian'." [...] Rollie Pemberton from Stylus Magazine called Piracy Funds Terrorism [...] "a genre-bending adventure in shattered preconceptions and club killing beats" [...] and said that, based on the strength of the mixtape, M.I.A.'s first official album had a lot to live up to. Village Voice critic Tom Breihan later expressed relief that M.I.A.'s aesthetic and her debut album did not have much input from Diplo.|$|E
500|$|La Dulzura {{represented}} a stylistic departure for the group, both musically and lyrically.

[...] Guitarist Eliut Gonzalez remarked that the band aimed to shift discussion to [...] "the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the world", explaining [...] that [...] "We know that people need help, and that behind every revolution or movement, there is love. We wanted to document that in our music, but without doing it in a cheesy or typical way." [...] The singles [...] "Baja la Tensión", [...] "La Complicidad", [...] "Para Estar" [...] and [...] "Ilegal" [...] all charted on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart. In 2011, the group collaborated with Dominican musician Vicente García on his single [...] "Mi Balcón".|$|E

[...] He wanted actors {{who would not}} have any preconceived notions to project into their roles. Although Milius had reservations when he witnessed the first few takes of the novices at work, he put faith in them improving their skills {{on the job and}} altered the script to fit their abilities. Schwarzenegger had studied for weeks in 1980 under Robert Easton, a voice coach for several Hollywood stars, to improve his speech. His first line in the film was a paraphrasing of Mongol emperor Genghis Khan's speech about the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> life and the actor delivered it with a heavy Austrian accent; critics later described what they heard as [...] "to crush your enemiessee dem [...] driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of dair vimen [...] ". Subsequently, Schwarzenegger underwent intensive speech training with Milius. [...] Each of his later longer speeches was rehearsed at least 40 times. Lopez's lines were also an issue; although Milius was satisfied with Lopez's work, the surfer's lines were redubbed by stage actor Sab Shimono for the final cut. [...] A source close to the production said this was done because Lopez failed to [...] " [...] a certain quality to his voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|By the 1560s Lassus {{had become}} quite famous, and composers {{began to go}} to Munich to study with him. Andrea Gabrieli went there in 1562, and {{possibly}} remained in the chapel for a year. Giovanni Gabrieli also possibly studied {{with him in the}} 1570s. His renown had spread outside of strictly musical circles, for in 1570 Emperor Maximilian II conferred nobility upon him, a rare circumstance for a composer. Pope Gregory XIII knighted him and in 1571, and again in 1573, the king of France, Charles IX, invited him to visit. Some of these kings and aristocrats attempted to woo him away from Munich with more attractive offers, but Lassus was evidently more interested in the stability of his position, and the splendid performance opportunities of Albrecht's court, than in financial gain.

2500|$|However, {{the root}} in other verses carries {{a sense of}} [...] "trial" [...] as simply a kind of test of a person's {{commitment}} to their faith (without necessarily implying that the testing results from something bad happening, as the sense of trial as [...] "tribulation" [...] might bear).

[...] Things widely recognized as <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> life may serve as trials, as Qur'an [...] and [...] make clear by describing one's own wealth and children as trials.

2500|$|The {{consensus}} on Ashton's Ondine {{is that it}} has some very <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> it – and this is true; as is the implication that it is otherwise unsuccessful, not least because the music (which greatly disappointed Ashton himself) largely fails, except in the storm of Act II and the divertissements of Act III. According to many critics, the music did not suit Ashton [...] "who had been hoping for music as [...] "radiant" [...] as the Mediterranean from which its heroine was born". Yet the music does seem to fit its watery theme well: there are some beautiful passages to Ondine’s Act 3 [...] "swimming" [...] solo where the music seems thin and transparent as watercolour, and entirely suited to this sketch of the sea. The ballet is also a mixture of both the 19th and the 20th century, for the plot is quintessentially romantic while the music and choreography are more modern. Although it bore all the marks of Ashton's familiarly gentle, classically oriented manner, it discarded the classical ballet conventions that appear in such Ashton successes as Cinderella and Sylvia. What he was trying to suggest, says Ashton, was [...] "the ebb and flow of the sea: I aimed at an unbroken continuity of dance, which would remove the distinction between aria and recitative." [...] As a result, Ondine offered few pyrotechnics, gained its effects instead through sinuous mass movements in which the undulation of arm and body suggested forests of sea plants stirring to unseen tides. The sense of submarine fantasy was reinforced by Stage Designer Lila de Nobili's fine scenery: a castle of mist and fruitfulness, shadowy crags and waterfalls, aqueous skies streaked pink and green.|$|E
