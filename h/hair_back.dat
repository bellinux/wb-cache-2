5|$|The man is now standing, {{his arms}} crossed, and watches with {{pleasure}} as Beyoncé continues the private dance. After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her <b>hair</b> <b>back.</b> The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Susan's {{appearance}} {{changed and}} she was seen having her long hair cut when she wanted a fresh start following a split from Karl. Woodburne has revealed {{that there is no}} chance of Susan growing her long <b>hair</b> <b>back.</b> She said [...] "I could never grow it long again. I love the ease of having short <b>hair.</b> <b>Back</b> when it was long, I used to wash and dry my hair every morning at home before going into work. That added an extra half-hour to my day". She also added that the Neighbours bosses at the time believed that women should have long hair. In April 2012, Susan debuted [...] "a stylish new haircut" [...] representing her single status.|$|E

500|$|In January 2011, [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] {{was used}} in a {{commercial}} for L’Oreal Paris Féria hair color in which Beyoncé bleached her hair blonde. Beyoncé wears body-conforming outfits and whips her <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> and forth as she shows off [...] "her luscious locks."

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Good Hit" [...] {{was directed by}} Alexandre Moors. A teaser for the video surfaced and was quickly removed online in October 2010, to later appear again in early 2011. In the video, Lopez acts as a beauty school teacher. Whipping her <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> and forth, she instructs a classroom of students on [...] "Fierceology" [...] and [...] "Work It Out 101". These scenes are, in an alternative video, intercut with behind the scenes footage from the Love? photoshoot. The clip was noted for its sex appeal, in which Lopez and her students were dressed in Dolce & Gabbana.|$|E
500|$|Although {{not highly}} {{thought of as}} a batsman, Poyntz was known for being able to hit the ball hard. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he is described as lacking [...] "technique and consistency" [...] by David Foot, but obituaries suggest that his shortage of talent was offset by application of effort. Wisden declared him [...] "an excellent fielder", but Foot is more reserved, describing him as a [...] "passable slip fielder". Sammy Woods was Poyntz's godfather, while Poyntz in turn acted as a godfather to John Daniell's son Nigel. David Foot portrays an element of caricature about Poyntz, describing him as, [...] "a tall man who slammed his <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> with a distinctive parting in the middle." [...] He also related a story from a Somerset teammate in which Poyntz claimed that he could trace him family {{all the way back to}} William the Conqueror, and had a massive coat of arms in his Bristol flat.|$|E

For example, many knitters use them to fix dropped knitting stitches, and tailors may use a crochet hook to thread a drawstring through its casing. Their use is not limited to fiber arts; crochet hooks can be used to maintain dreadlocks by pulling stray <b>hairs</b> <b>back</b> into the main dread.|$|R

500|$|As Carey, now dry and clothed, {{is shown}} in another {{scenario}} following the dressing scene, a still of Carey and Miller in the video for [...] "It's like That" [...] is shown, during the lyrics [...] "I can't sleep at night / When you are on my mind". After several other scenes of Carey dressed in the purple gown and white shirt are interspersed, the altar is displayed, where before being ordained by the minister, Carey looks into her ex-lover's eyes once more. She turns to Roberts, and begins running towards Miller, leaving the reception. As the song's climax is reached, Carey and Miller are shown running from the reception, as the guests stand up in awe, and watch the pair leave. Carey, dressed in the white shirt, is shown with growing anticipation, crying to the camera and moving her hands and <b>hair.</b> <b>Back</b> at the wedding scene, Carey and her lover get into his vehicle, and drive away as her 27-foot train hangs behind the car. The video was nominated for [...] "Best R Video" [...] and [...] "Best Female Video" [...] at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, the {{popularity}} of Jamaica's reggae music and musician Bob Marley prompted interest in dreadlocks internationally. The anti-establishment philosophy of Rastafari, echoed {{in much of the}} reggae of the time, resonated with leaning youth of all ethnicities – especially and primarily among African Americans and other Blacks, but among counterculture whites as well. Eastern Christians are encouraged [...] to wear long hair with long beard. In the 1980s the view of long hair as a solitary signifier of political or counter-cultural identity was countered and parodied in films such as Rambo and many other militaristic heroes of media which challenged then-contemporary views of tradition. In the 2000s longer hairstyles among men became popular among neopagans and rock enthusiasts; for example, musicians in Metal bands and their fans often wear long hair. Long hair may be grown for the purpose of being donated to an organization, such as Locks of Love, for hairpieces to help those who could not have hair otherwise, such as those who are diagnosed with alopecia aerate. Today long hair has gained even more popularity. Even among mainstream men it is socially acceptable to have hair reaching around the upper back. This could in part be due to the [...] "man bun" [...] trend where men pull their shoulder length or longer <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> into a topknot Bun (hairstyle).|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga the Grammy {{performance}} {{was inspired by}} many things, including Gregorian music, Alvin Ailey dance moves and Martha Graham's dance energy. On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to [...] "whip my <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> and forth on stage," [...] referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice. The idea occurred {{to her when she}} was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos. She had thought to herself, [...] "Gosh, the thing I hate most about doing award shows is, it can be [...] distracting... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage. I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance, think only about the album, think only about the future of my fans. So that's what I did." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the {{performance was}} [...] "surprisingly" [...] sparse compared to Gaga's previous [...] "over-the-top" [...] endeavors. Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the [...] "highly expected" [...] performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography. Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as [...] "spirited", and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards. Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was {{one of the highlights of}} the show. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that [...] "It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga's performance of her new single 'Born This Way' was the evening's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle." ...|$|E

500|$|Liu Kang was {{originally}} {{going to be}} a Japanese character called Minamoto Yoshitsune, but Mortal Kombat co-creator and character designer John Tobias stated that the staff could not [...] "deal with the name." [...] According to Tobias, [...] "Liu Kang {{was originally}} {{going to be a}} traditional monk [...] bald and in robes [...] but he wound up resembling Bruce Lee." [...] As stated on his Mortal Kombat: Armageddon bio card, Ed Boon mentioned that Liu Kang was designed to be the most easily [...] "accessible" [...] character, meaning that both casual and experienced gamers could play as him with little difficulty. According to Tobias, Liu Kang was purposely the only character that voiced his finishing move in the original game, and was [...] "the best" [...] in the first sequel. Liu Kang was the only character in the first game whose finishing move (Fatality) did not explicitly murder his opponent, and also without the background dimming. This was because Liu Kang was depicted therein as a Shaolin monk, who in general have strict beliefs regarding killing and murder. However, starting with Mortal Kombat II, he was given gory Fatalities as he was thereafter depicted as a renegade monk who decided to grow his <b>hair</b> <b>back,</b> and who had [...] "strong Shaolin beliefs, but was no longer a part of the Shaolin monks." [...] In response to rumors that Liu Kang would die in Mortal Kombat II and therefore not make it into Mortal Kombat 3, Boon said, [...] "It'd be like doing part three of Star Wars and not having Luke Skywalker in there. You don't do that." [...] His eventual death caused Dan Forden, the music composer of the series, to make a [...] "funeral song" [...] for Liu Kang as he felt saddened for his death. The track titled [...] "Liu Kang's Tomb" [...] would be used in Mortal Kombat: Deception in the arena that shows his tomb.|$|E

The verse is {{accompanied}} by three illustrations depicting the guinea pig {{in various stages of}} coiffing and dressing. Guinea pigs would have their own story told in the tale of Tupenny in Potter's The Fairy Caravan of 1929.|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} Cycles {{led to the}} release of 1991's Brotherhood, also on Capitol. The group members grew their <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> out, wore denim and leather, and {{attempted}} to revive their biker image of the early 1970s. In spite of the makeover and strong material led by Simmons' now trademark [...] "Dangerous" [...] (featured in the Brian Bosworth biker film vehicle, Stone Cold), Brotherhood was unsuccessful, in part {{due to a lack of}} support on the part of Capitol Records.|$|E
2500|$|To {{get that}} understanding, Englund had darkened his lower eyelids with {{cigarette}} ash {{on his way}} to the audition and slicked his <b>hair</b> <b>back.</b> [...] "I looked strange.

He took the part because it was the only project that fit his schedule during the hiatus between the V miniseries and series.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically {{the song}} is about letting loose, being as wild as can be, while she asks ladies to [...] "whip their hair" [...] and [...] "shake haters off".

2500|$|As college {{students}} across America began demanding [...] "two, three, many Columbias," [...] Jacobs became a recognized national leader of SDS {{and looked to}} by those who saw violence {{as the only way}} to respond to the governing political and economic system of the day. Jacobs began to look the part of a counterculture leader as well. In the middle of 1968, he began wearing tight jeans, a leather jacket, and a gold chain with a lion's tooth, and slicked his <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> 1950s-style to purposefully distinguish himself from the clean-cut, middle-class students who attended most anti-war protests. He became one of SDS' earliest and most prominent ideological thinkers, and was widely recognized as a charismatic persuasive speaker.|$|E
2500|$|Cote de Pablo, {{who was one}} of {{the last}} to audition, was set to perform {{opposite}} Michael Weatherly to test for chemistry. Weatherly improvised during the audition by brushing her <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> and commenting, [...] "You remind me of Salma Hayek." [...] De Pablo, who was initially upset by the departure from the script, stayed in character and [...] "dismissed him completely". She later said in an interview, [...] "He totally did it with the other [...] One other girl sort of flirted back with him, and she was sort of open. Which is what actors do! They're sort of open.

2500|$|... "Whip My Hair" [...] is a high-tempo R-hip hop piece {{incorporating}} dance-pop and crunk, with funk and disco influences. The song {{is said to}} {{be composed}} in an [...] "eclectic" [...] style, and makes use of heavy synthesizers and drums. Smith's vocals are auto-tuned in some parts, while containing keyboard washes over a drum-heavy beat described as [...] "propulsive" [...] and [...] "futuristic". The song features a knocking beat, including the vocal refrain of [...] "I whip my <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> and forth". Some critics have deemed the song too similar to Smith's musical influence Rihanna. Additionally, others said the song was similar to the style of Rihanna contemporaries Ciara and Keri Hilson, with a hip hop feel similar to Lil Mama. Gina Serpe of E! Online called the track a fourth-grade version of Rihanna and Hilson.|$|E
