The <b>filing</b> <b>plan</b> made Oaktree Capital Management the majority owner of Regent after the bankruptcy {{and gave the}} old shareholders 12.8 cents per share. After the privatization, the company was renamed Townsquare Media.

40|$|Public {{institutions}} and organizations organize documents, which result from their services, communications and procedures, according to predetermined classification systems {{in order to}} find them rapidly and easily when they are needed. The purpose of this study called "Standardization in the Filing Systems of Public Institutions and Organizations" is, in general, to find out that standardization in the filing systems of public {{institutions and}} organizations is unavoidable in order to have an organized, effective, rapid and productive system for records, files, communication and archives. Regarding private organizations, the purpose is to prove that standardization of file numbering is possible in advising, supervising and supplementary services and to bring forward suggestions on this topic. In this study, the methods of ""description and survey"" are used. Firstly, filing and classification systems and the importance of filing {{from the point of view}} of archives and administrations are examined. The filing plans taken as examples are introduced and by making comparisons, their similarities and differences are explained. After these comparisons it is shown that standardization of subject numbers, used in filing plans of advising, supervising and supplementary services, is possible. Then advising, supervising and supplementary services for which standardization will be provided are examined and it is explained how standardization is to be carried out. The advantages arising from standardization are explained by preparing a standard <b>filing</b> <b>plan.</b> To profit from the advantages arising from standardization, it is suggested to; a- Develop and prepare a standard <b>filing</b> <b>plan</b> covering all Turkey, b- From a commission among institutions and organizazions to realize this, c- Appoint the Turkish Standardization Institute, The Institute of Turkey and Middle East Public Administration or the Head of Department of Administrative Development of the Prime Ministry as the Secretariat of the commission...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{context of}} this paper is the {{labelling}} of a document image database in an industrial process. Our work focuses on the quality assessment of a given labelled database. In most practical cases, a database is manually labelled by an operator who has to browse sequentially the images (presented as thumbnails) until the whole database is labelled. This task is very repetitive; moreover the <b>filing</b> <b>plan</b> defining the names and number of classes is often incomplete, which leads to many labelling errors. The question is then to certify if the quality of a labelled batch is good enough to globally accept it. Our objective is to ease and speed up that evaluation that needs up to 1. 5 more times than the labelling work itself. We propose an interactive tool for visualizing the data as a graph. That graph enhances similarities between documents as well as the labelling quality. We define criteria on the graph that characterize the three types of errors an operator can do: an image is mislabelled, one class should be split in more pertinent subclasses, several classes should be merged in another. This allows us to focus the operator attention on potential errors. He can then count the errors encountered while auditing the database and assess (or not) the global labelling quality...|$|E

40|$|There {{were some}} {{difficulties}} creating challenges that were {{encountered in the}} process of applying the Standard <b>File</b> <b>Plan</b> as developed by the National Archives Administration. An important part of these challenges originated {{from the fact that the}} subject headings do not correspond with the defined tasks and functions of the municipalities, moreover the subject headings are not descriptive enough and the application of the plan to electronic records is not clear enough. The aim of this article is to offer solutions to such problems on the basis of an illustrative example.

25|$|That legislation, the Higher Education Protection and Freedom of Expression Act of 1969 (Campus Disorder Bill, HR 11941, 91st Congress), was a {{response}} to mass protests and demonstrations at universities and colleges across the nation. It was introduced by House Special Subcommittee on Education chair Rep. Edith Green (D-OR). The bill would have required colleges and universities to <b>file</b> <b>plans</b> of action for dealing with campus unrest with the U.S. Commissioner of Education. The bill gave the institutions the power to suspend federal aid to students convicted—in court or by the university—of violating campus rules in connection with student riots.
