25|$|In 1998 {{director}} Paul Street {{created a}} commercial for the Ford Puma. Footage was shot in modern-day San Francisco, set to the theme music from Bullitt. Archive footage of McQueen was used to digitally superimpose him driving and exiting the car in settings reminiscent of the film. The Puma shares the same number plate of the classic Fastback Mustang used in Bullitt, and as he parks in the garage (next to the Mustang), <b>he</b> <b>pauses</b> and looks meaningfully at a motorcycle tucked in the corner, {{similar to that used}} in The Great Escape.|$|E
500|$|While Logan and Victor {{join forces}} {{to fight off}} Weapon XI, Kayla is mortally wounded leading the captive mutants to Professor Charles Xavier and safety. After Logan kills Weapon XI, Stryker arrives and shoots Logan {{in the head with}} adamantium bullets, {{rendering}} Logan unconscious. Before Stryker can shoot Kayla, she grabs him and uses her mutant power to persuade him to turn around and walk away until his feet bleed. Logan regains consciousness but has lost his memory. He notices his dog tags read [...] "Logan" [...] on one side and [...] "Wolverine" [...] on the other. <b>He</b> <b>pauses</b> upon noticing Kayla's body, but does not recognize her, and leaves the island.|$|E
500|$|Following this, Gordon {{returns to}} the Citadel, unwillingly aiding Freeman in his journey up the Citadel and {{influencing}} {{the plot of the}} game. As Freeman is pursuing Dr. Breen to his teleporter, Frohman is about to kill Freeman—but <b>he</b> <b>pauses</b> {{to come up with the}} perfect one-liner for the occasion, causing him to run out of time; Dr. Breen's teleporter explodes and Frohman is flung off the Citadel peak by the explosion. Dr. Breen also survives, having fallen from the Citadel onto a pile of dead Combine soldiers. However, Frohman falls right onto Breen, killing him. Gordon himself is only seriously injured. Baffled by his ability to survive, he realizes through a flashback that he has been under [...] "Buddha Mode", a cheat code which prevents his health points from dropping below one throughout the comic's duration. Frohman inadvertently turns off the mode, and even spoils an opportunity to be rescued by a group of Vortigaunts, as both Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance are at the start of [...] In the end, Frohman dies unceremoniously, while survivors of the City 17 uprising find him dead.|$|E

2500|$|During the Ten Days of Repentance between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, {{additional}} {{lines are}} {{inserted in the}} first, second, second to last, and last blessings of all Amidot. These lines invoke God's mercy and pray for inscription in the Book of Life. In many communities, when the chazzan reaches these lines during his repetition, <b>he</b> <b>pauses</b> and the congregation recites the lines before him. During the final recitation of the Amidah on Yom Kippur the prayer is slightly modified to read [...] "seal us" [...] {{in the book of}} life, rather than write us.|$|E
2500|$|Burroughs {{subsequently}} made cameo {{appearances in}} a number of other films and videos, such as David Blair's Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees, an elliptic story about the first Gulf War in which Burroughs plays a beekeeper, and Decoder by Klaus Maeck. He played an aging junkie priest in Gus Van Sant's 1989 film Drugstore Cowboy. He also appears briefly at the beginning of Van Sant's Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (based on the Tom Robbins novel), in which he is seen crossing a city street; as the noise of the city rises around him <b>he</b> <b>pauses</b> in the middle of the intersection and speaks the single word [...] "ominous". Van Sant's short film [...] "Thanksgiving Prayer" [...] features Burroughs reading the poem [...] "Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 28, 1986", from Tornado Alley, intercut with a collage of black and white images.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pauses,</b> {{and there}} still hangs a faint perplexity between us.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> and the frown deepened between Wellington's brows.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused.</b> Lewisham {{appeared}} {{involved in}} some interior struggle.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused.</b> <b>He</b> {{addressed}} {{himself to}} the unseen multitudes who stared upon him through those grotesque black eyes. At first he spoke slowly.|$|R
60|$|JAWBONES [He has risen. <b>He</b> <b>pauses</b> in his folding of the paper.] Don't say that.|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>He</b> <b>pauses</b> {{and looks}} toward the doorway, right. DR. JONATHAN [...] {{standing}} there, holding {{in his hand}} a yellow envelope. ASHER [...] starts forward.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I heard a {{very good}} story the other day on the steamer going to Bermuda"--then <b>he</b> <b>pauses</b> with a certain doubt in his face--"but perhaps you've heard this?" ...|$|E
60|$|After each {{question}} <b>he</b> <b>paused,</b> while she nodded an affirmation.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> a {{few moments}} nervously. 'Mrs. Petherwin,' he said.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> and she {{repeated}} {{his last two}} words--gently, encouragingly.|$|R
6000|$|COSMO. 'I won't be a minute.' <b>He</b> <b>pauses</b> at the door. 'I say I believe you're {{trying to}} get rid of me. Look here, I won't budge till you tell me what mother is {{speaking}} about to father.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>He</b> <b>pauses,</b> as if recollecting something.) (Dobleman {{has begun}} to write down the note.) No. I {{remember}} {{there was something in}} the papers about this Professor Vanderwater--a divorce, wasn't it? He has impaired his authority and his usefulness to me.|$|E
60|$|The chief fact which {{confronts the}} student of {{literature}} as <b>he</b> <b>pauses</b> before this great allegory {{is that it}} has been translated into seventy-five languages and dialects, and has been read more than any other book save one in the English language.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> {{and then}} voice and {{expression}} became suddenly fierce.|$|R
60|$|Maxwell's eyes {{signified}} assent, but <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> {{to gather}} breath.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> impressively {{to allow}} this startling {{statement}} to sink in.|$|R
6000|$|CARMODY (pleased). Ah, don't be talkin'! She'll {{know more}} than the lot of us before she's grown even. (<b>He</b> <b>pauses</b> in his walk and stares down at Eileen, frowning.) Are you sick, Eileen, that you're keepin' your eyes shut without a word out of you? ...|$|E
6000|$|This bent, worn man, coming {{towards us}} with quick {{impatient}} steps, which yet cease every fifty yards or so, while <b>he</b> <b>pauses,</b> leaning heavily upon his high Malacca cane: [...] "It is a handsome face, is it not?" [...] I ask, as I gaze upon it, shadow framed.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Ashley: [...] "The {{time has}} seemed long, but I could have waited all day. I couldn't have gone without seeing you, and telling you--" [...] <b>He</b> <b>pauses,</b> as if bewildered at the {{spectacle}} of Miss Ramsey's resolute practice with the cigarette, which she now takes from her lips and waves before her face with innocent recklessness.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> so {{long that}} she ignored his {{injunction}} of silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> and {{captain and}} mate looked despair at each other.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> {{as though}} expecting a reply; but Joe {{remained}} silent.|$|R
60|$|LORD LOAM. When I woke, I wept. Then I {{began to}} feel {{extremely}} hungry. There was a large turtle on the beach. I remembered from the Swiss Family Robinson that if you turn a turtle over he is helpless. My dears, I crawled towards him, I flung myself upon him--(here <b>he</b> <b>pauses</b> to rub his leg)--the nasty, spiteful brute.|$|E
6000|$|After all, when we {{have gone}} through Young’s seven Satires, {{we seem to have}} made but an {{indifferent}} meal. They are a sort of fricassee, with some little solid meat in them, and yet the flavor is not always piquant. It is curious to find him, when <b>he</b> <b>pauses</b> a moment from his satiric sketching, recurring to his old platitudes: ...|$|E
60|$|Later on, down a side street, <b>he</b> <b>pauses</b> {{before a}} house with its face blown away. On the verge {{of one of its}} jagged floors is an old four-posted bed, and beside it a child's cot is {{standing}} pitifully,--the tiny pillow still at the head and the little sheets thrown across the foot. So much for one of the navy's shells.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> looking {{backward}} and forward between {{the picture and}} me.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> {{with his}} eyes glinting brightly and his jaw quivering.|$|R
60|$|Here <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> again--my uncle made a {{movement}} of anxious curiosity.|$|R
