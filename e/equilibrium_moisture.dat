25|$|Wood is a {{hygroscopic}} substance. It has {{the ability}} to take in or give off moisture in the form of vapour. Water contained in wood exerts vapour pressure of its own, which is determined by the maximum size of the capillaries filled with water at any time. If water vapour pressure in the ambient space is lower than vapour pressure within wood, desorption takes place. The largest-sized capillaries, which are full of water at the time, empty first. Vapour pressure within the wood falls as water is successively contained in smaller capillaries. A stage is eventually reached when vapour pressure within the wood equals vapour pressure in the ambient space above the wood, and further desorption ceases. The amount of moisture that remains in the wood at this stage is in equilibrium with water vapour pressure in the ambient space, and is termed the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>moisture</b> content or EMC (Siau, 1984). Because of its hygroscopicity, wood tends to reach a moisture content that is in equilibrium with the relative humidity and temperature of the surrounding air.|$|E

25|$|The {{chemical}} potential is explained here {{since it is}} the true driving force for the transport of water in both liquid and vapour phases in wood (Siau, 1984). The Gibbs free energy per mole of substance is usually expressed as the {{chemical potential}} (Skaar, 1933). The chemical potential of unsaturated air or wood below the fibre saturation point influences the drying of wood. Equilibrium will occur at the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>moisture</b> content (as defined earlier) of wood when the chemical potential of the wood becomes equal to that of the surrounding air. The chemical potential of sorbed water is a function of wood moisture content. Therefore, a gradient of wood moisture content (between surface and centre), or more specifically of activity, is accompanied by a gradient of chemical potential under isothermal conditions. Moisture will redistribute itself throughout the wood until the chemical potential is uniform throughout, resulting in a zero potential gradient at equilibrium (Skaar, 1988). The flux of moisture attempting to achieve the equilibrium state is assumed to be proportional to the difference in chemical potential, and inversely proportional to the path length over which the potential difference acts (Keey et al., 2000).|$|E

Moisture saturation curves for natural and synthetic esters have been presented in the temperature range up to 140 °C together with curve for mineral oil as a reference. Sorption isotherms have been established for cellulose based and aramid fiber based materials. Eventually, the <b>moisture</b> <b>equilibrium</b> diagrams have been created for given combinations of solids and liquids. <b>Moisture</b> <b>equilibrium</b> curves have been created for combinations of mineral oil and ester fluids with aramid fiber based papers and boards, as they are commonly used in alternative insulation systems.

It has been observed that insulation components made of aramid insulation may have lower water content comparing to cellulose based conventional materials at the same water content measured in dielectric liquid.
