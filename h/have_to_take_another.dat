50|$|Wheeled IFVs {{can travel}} great {{distances}} {{on their own}} without needing to be transported by flat-bed trucks and railway, as required by tracked IFVs. Tracked IFVs need to have their treads serviced or replaced on a regular basis. The tracks themselves {{and the weight of}} the IFVs tend to be tough on road surfaces, wearing them down more quickly than a wheeled IFV. Many wheeled IFVs can extract themselves from a battlefield with specialised run-flat tires when not operating in difficult terrain, while an IFV with damaged tracks would require its tracks repaired in the field or an armoured recovery vehicle to tow it out. However, tracks cannot be punctured like a tire so are more difficult to immobilize. A weapon that destroys a track will do significantly more damage to a wheeled vehicle (such as destroying the axles in which case the vehicle will have to be towed away as well). Tracks also offer far greater off-road mobility, greater obstacle climbing capabilities and greater maneuverability than wheels. Unlike a wheeled vehicle, a tracked vehicle will not be stopped by a spike strip or roadblock. A tracked vehicle can reach places a wheeled vehicle can not. As IFVs often operate alongside tanks, being tracked means that the vehicle can go everywhere that the tanks go, which a wheeled vehicle could not. In this case wheeled vehicles would either <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> route (leaving the tanks without IFV support and the IFVs without tank protection) or the tanks would have to stay where the wheeled IFVs can go and drastically limit their own tactical mobility. Tracked vehicles can attack and operate from and in areas which a wheeled vehicle could not which is a great tactical advantage. A wheeled vehicle is limited to roads and less difficult terrain which may enable the enemy to predict where they will come from. Generally, therefore, tracked vehicles have greater mobility except on roads where wheeled vehicles have a greater top speed. Many countries only use wheeled armour for support functions or low-risk peacekeeping missions whereas combat functions are performed by tracked vehicles. A compromise between wheels and tracks is the band track, which combines some of the advantages of wheels and tracks.|$|E

40|$|As {{predicted}} by Moore 2 ̆ 7 s law, {{the number of}} transistors on a chip has been doubled approximately every two years. As miraculous as it sounds, for many years, the extra transistors have massively benefited the whole computer industry, by using the extra transistors to increase CPU clock speed, thus boosting performance. However, due to heat wall and power constraints, the clock speed cannot be increased limitlessly. Hardware vendors now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> path other than increasing clock speed, which is to utilize the transistors {{to increase the number}} of processor cores on each chip. This hardware structural change presents inevitable challenges to software structure, where single thread targeted software will not benefit from newer chips or may even suffer from lower clock speed. The two fundamental challenges are: 1. How to deal with the stagnation of single core clock speed and cache memory. 2. How to utilize the additional power generated from more cores on a chip. Most software programming languages nowadays have distributed computing support, such as C and Java [1]. Meanwhile, some new programming languages were invented from scratch just to take advantage of the more distributed hardware structures. The X 10 Programming Language is one of them. The goal of this project is to evaluate X 10 in terms of performance, programmability and tool support...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} way of publishing books is a one-dimensional procedure. An author creates content, believing that somebody {{may be interested in}} it. A publisher in-vests money in his book project, financing the production, the marketing and the distribution to the bookstores. The readers select the books in the bookstore under a wide range of decision criteria?s. At the end of the chain, the public libraries save the book, storing the information as cultural heritage. With the growth of digital printing technology, the Internet and data based publishing, a new type of book production is also in the discussions: Book-on-Demand (BoD). Especially suppliers of the new enabling technologies promote this new type of book. The argumentation for this book publishing strategy is guided very strong by the {{traditional way}} of book production and of traditional book concepts itself. Core feature of this BoD concept is the masterless print process of digital presses. Be-cause of this, the make ready times for printing decline to zero, the print production costs of one copy are the same as multi copy production. Since more then ten years this technical capability is used as Print-on-Demand PoD in invoice printing and other applications. Now also the bindery becomes ?on-Demand?, the inline production of a single brochure is possible on a low but acceptable quality stage. But the extension from PoD to BoD did not change the book market in a larger way. Only some specific branches occurred where BoD could take some significant parts of the market share. But today?s BoD does not cast any doubt on the tradi-tional book itself. The main error of these first BoD concepts is that they ignore the real cost struc-ture of the books. Typically for a book for 20 $ in the bookstore, only 0, 17 $ must be paid for the printing, and all technical costs including materials are below 2, 50 $ [1]. Because of this reason, real cost savings in production and logistics are not so high and only in some special applications BoD is attractive. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> important fact into account: There are only a few authors writing books without any commercial interest and with the goal to sell only two or three copies. The success story of a book is, either in non-material or in commer-cial categories, to spread it. From this point of view, BoD is a disaster for the author and the publisher, who can not think about individual books economically. BoD solved only their second problem, the production. But the first problem, how to reach the reader who needs the book, remains. Consistently, today?s BoD is not really successful. We call this concepts ? 1 st stage BoD (1 ?BoD) ?, whereby the books are characterized by new production concepts and new output technologies (PoD, but also E-Books and CD-ROMs), but tradi-tional business models and content handling...|$|E
