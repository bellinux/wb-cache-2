5|$|Stone wool or {{rock wool}} is a spun mineral fibre {{used as an}} {{insulation}} product and in hydroponics. It is manufactured in a blast furnace <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> diabase rock which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is drawn off and spun to form the rock wool product. Very small amounts of metals are also produced which are an unwanted by-product and run to waste.|$|E

5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae {{has been}} the subject of {{research}} into possible medicinal applications. Experiments in the 1980s concluded that two glucans isolated from the species showed potent antitumour properties when used on mice artificially implanted with Sarcoma 180 tumours. This was despite the conclusion of earlier research indicating that, while aqueous extracts from several other fungal species had antitumour effects, extracts from A.auricula-judae did not. Further, research on genetically diabetic mice showed that a polysaccharide extracted from A.auricula-judae had a hypoglycemic effect; mice <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> food including the polysaccharide showed reduced plasma glucose, insulin, urinary glucose and food intake.|$|E

Increasing {{the concentration of}} LiF in the composite dielectric reduces the operating gate voltages significantly from 10 V to 1 V required leading to a decrease in resistance. Electron and hole mobility of 350 and 310 cm 2 /Vs at VD = - 5 V are obtained for graphene <b>FEDs</b> <b>with</b> 10 % LiF concentration in the composite.

A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city. As part of this mission, the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu.|$|E
5|$|Like other thyreophorans, Scelidosaurus was herbivorous. However, {{while some}} later ornithischian groups possessed teeth capable of {{grinding}} plant material, Scelidosaurus had smaller, less complex leaf-shaped teeth suitable for cropping vegetation and jaws capable of only vertical movement, {{due to a}} short jaw joint. Paul Barrett concluded that Scelidosaurus <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> a puncture-crush system of tooth-on-tooth action, with a precise but simple up-and-down jaw movement, in which the food was mashed between the inner side of the upper teeth and the outer side of the lower teeth, without the teeth actually touching each other as shown by very long vertical wear facets on the lower teeth alone.|$|E
5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E

5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Nigersaurus are grouped within the subfamily Nigersaurinae {{of the family}} Rebbachisauridae, {{which is part of}} the sauropod superfamily Diplodocoidea. Nigersaurus was probably a browser, and <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> its head close to the ground. The region of its brain that detected smell was underdeveloped, although its brain size was comparable to that of other dinosaurs. There has been debate on whether its head was habitually held downwards, or horizontally like other sauropods. It lived in a riparian habitat, and its diet probably consisted of soft plants, such as ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms. It is one of the most common fossil vertebrates found in the area, and shared its habitat with other dinosaurian megaherbivores, as well as large theropods and crocodylomorphs.|$|E
5|$|By {{the close}} of 1961, the Food for Peace program was {{operating}} in a dozen countries, and 10 million more people had been <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> American surplus than the year before. In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded school lunch program thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently one in five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it, and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world. During an audience in Rome, Pope John XXIII warmly praised McGovern's work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine {{the interactive effects of}} Zn, Cu and Mn addition to diets of 0 to 14 -d old broilers on growth performance, bone breaking strength, bone ash percentage and tissue mineral concentrations. Two levels of Zn (0 or 75 ppm, as Zn sulfate), 2 levels of Mn (0 or 100 ppm, as Mn sulfate) and 2 levels of Cu (0 or 7 ppm, as Cu sulfate) were supplemented to corn-soybean meal diets in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Each treatment had 6 replications with 5 chicks each and the initial and final BW were 46 and 382 g. Daily gain, daily feed intake, gain:feed, bone breaking strength and bone and pancreatic Zn concentrations were increased (p< 0. 05) in chicks <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> supplemental Zn. Bone, liver and pancreatic Mn levels were increased (p< 0. 01) in chicks <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> supplemental Mn. Bone breaking strength was increased when Zn was added to the diets with or without Cu addition, but the increase was greater in chicks fed the diets without Cu addition (Zn×Cu, p< 0. 05). Bone ash percentage was increased in chicks <b>fed</b> the diets <b>with</b> Zn, Mn, or Cu addition but the increase was not additive (Zn×Mn×Cu, p< 0. 03). Liver Cu level was increased (p< 0. 01) in chicks <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> Cu addition. Bone and liver Cu levels were decreased (p< 0. 05) in chicks <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> Zn addition. Bone and pancreas Fe levels were decreased (p< 0. 05) in chicks <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> added Zn. Bone Zn level was decreased (p< 0. 03) in chicks <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> added Cu. Liver and pancreatic Mn levels were increased (p< 0. 05) in chicks <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> added Zn. This study indicates that Zn addition is necessary for normal growth and bone strength of chicks and that Zn addition had negative effects on tissue Cu and Fe levels and a positive effect on tissue Mn levels...|$|R

5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for {{an equal amount of}} time.|$|E
5|$|The North Mere is 5.6-acres (2.25 ha) large, and {{is blocked}} off on its {{northern}} end by a sod-cast bank, {{adjacent to the}} site of the North Gate. The southern half takes the form of a 331-foot (101 m) long moat, which was recorded as being 18-foot (5.5 m) deep in the medieval period, terminating in the West Gate. The northern part of this mere occasionally floods in the 21st century, creating a temporary lake, and the moated section usually still contains some standing water. The West Mere, covering 2.25-acres (1 ha), stretches away from the location of West Gate and is blocked at the far end by a small, stone dam. Three rectangular fishponds were built alongside the West Mere, the smallest, probably a stew pond for raising young fish, being <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> water from the lake. A protective earthen bank, probably originally reinforced by a timber palisade, ran for approximately 490 feet (150 m) along either side of the West Gate, where a gatehouse was probably built. At the far end of the lake complex was the South Mere, 2.25-acres (1 ha) in size, with the South Gate positioned in its eastern corner.|$|E
5|$|The Andean condor is {{considered}} near {{threatened by the}} IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that {{is in danger of}} extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which {{stems from the fact that}} it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are <b>fed</b> <b>with</b> glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Glycerine from {{biodiesel}} {{production was}} used as a pure energy source in broiler diets formulated to meet typical commercial standards. In the first experiment, glycerine was added at 0, 5, and 10 % of the diet while in the second experiment glycerine was added at 0, 2. 5, and 5 %. Glycerine was assigned a metabolizable energy value of 3527 ME kcal/kg in formulating the diets. In each experiment the various treatments were assigned to eight replicate pens of 60 male broilers each. In the first experiment, birds <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> 5 % glycerine did not differ significantly in performance from birds fed the control diet with no glycerine. Birds <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> 10 % glycerine consumed significantly less feed than did those <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> 0 or 5 % glycerine and consequently had significantly reduced body weight. It is felt that this was {{due in large part to}} reduced flow rate in the feeders used in this study as previous researchers have shown acceptance of higher levels of glycerine. In the second study, birds <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> 2. 5 or 5 % glycerine had growth rate and feed conversion that did not differ significantly from that of birds <b>fed</b> the diet <b>with</b> no glycerine. Breast yield as a percent of the dressed carcass was significantly greater for birds <b>fed</b> diets <b>with</b> 2. 5 or 5 % glycerine as compared to those <b>fed</b> the diet <b>with</b> no glycerine. These data indicate that glycerine from biodiesel can be a useful energy source for use in broiler diets. Concerns remain regarding acceptable levels of residual methanol resulting from separation of the fatty acids in biodiesel production...|$|R
