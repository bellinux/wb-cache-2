It would beg to be considered merely as what it calls itself, a Family Chronicle--a domestic record of home events, large and small, during those years of early life when the character is chiefly formed, and as an endeavour to trace the effects of those aspirations which are a part of every youthful nature. That the young should take one hint, to think whether their hopes and upward-breathings are truly upwards, and founded in lowliness, may be called the moral of the tale.|$|E
60|$|Reader, this {{following}} {{account of}} the people called Quakers, &c. {{was written in the}} fear and love of God: first, as a standing testimony to that ever blessed truth in the inward parts, with which God, in my youthful time, visited my soul, and for the sense and love of which I was made willing, in no ordinary way, to relinquish the honours and interests of the world. Secondly, as a testimony for that despised people, that God has in his great mercy gathered and united by his own blessed Spirit in the holy profession of it; whose fellowship I value above all worldly greatness. Thirdly, in love and honour to the memory of that worthy servant of God, George Fox, the first instrument thereof, and therefore styled by me--The great and blessed apostle of our day. As this gave birth to what <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> thy view, in the first edition of it, by way of preface to George Fox's excellent Journal; so the consideration of the present usefulness of the following {{account of the}} people called Quakers, by reason of the unjust reflections of some adversaries that once walked under the profession of Friends, and the exhortations that conclude it, prevailed with me to consent that it should be republished in a smaller volume; knowing also full well, that great books, especially in these days, grow burthensome, both to the pockets and minds of too many; and that there are not a few that desire, so it be at an easy rate, to be informed about this people, that have been so much every where spoken against: but blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, it is upon no worse grounds than it was said of old time of the primitive Christians, as I hope will appear to every sober and considerate reader. Our business, after all the ill usage we have met with, being the realities of religion, an effectual change before our last and great change: that all may come to an inward, sensible, and experimental knowledge of God, through the convictions and operations of the light and spirit of Christ in themselves; the sufficient and blessed means given to all, that thereby all may come savingly to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent to enlighten and redeem the world: which knowledge is indeed eternal life. And that thou, reader, mayst obtain it, is the earnest desire of him that is ever thine in so good a work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{approach}} <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> embed a low-priority {{data stream}} into a high-priority data stream for OFDM wireless communications.

As a consequence, the expected performance is independent of the channel estimation method used to equalize the channel. The low-priority signal is superimposed on the highpriority symbols using a dirty paper coding technique. As {{a result of the}} analysis of the proposed method, several improvements to reduce the interference on the high-priority symbols are introduced. The performance of our scheme has been compared with that of a conventional hierarchical modulation using DVB-T system parameters, showing a considerable improvement for multipath fading channels.

40|$|While {{investigating}} {{the destruction of}} coenzymes in shock induced by hemor-rhage and in anoxia we compared the rate of amino and lactic acid oxidation by various excised tissues after preliminary incubation in oxygen or in nitrogen.

Analyses for co-zymase, the coenzyme required for the oxidation of lactate, and alloxazine adenine dinucleotide, the coenzyme required for amino acid oxidation, showed only slight differences between the anoxic and normal tissues. Moreover, addi-tion of these coenzymes to anoxic tissue, while producing an increase in the rate of oxidation, did not increase it to the normal value.

40|$|International audienceSince the 50 last years, {{the rapid}} {{development}} of modern agriculture in industrialised countries has considerably affected {{the quality of}} water resources, {{up to the point}} to jeopardise the capacity of rural territories to produce drinking water. Hence, agronomy has been interested in the complex nitrate biogeochemical interactions for a long time. While agronomists are able to produce very accurate physical models of nitrate propagation at different scales, their tools have a limited relevance if the information regarding geology or agriculture is missing. Consequently, in many cases, it prevents the specialists of being affirmative about the prediction of their current actions on the water quality. By opposition, a system identification methodology <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> predict nitrate concentration in water. It has the advantage of being applicable even when very little knowledge is available. It will be shown how external variables such as rainfall and temperature can {{play an important role in}} modelling water pollution systems.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{numerical}} frequency-domain model {{based on the}} joint use of two distinct meshless methods (the Method of Fundamental Solutions and Kansa’s Method) is discussed. In this context, the MFS is used to model the homogeneous part of the propagation domain, while the Kansa’s Method is applied to model the presence of possible heterogeneities. For Kansa’s Method, the MQ RBF is used, and the optimal value of its free parameter is computed by minimizing the residual of the PDE throughout the subdomain. The coupling between the {{two parts of the}} propagation domain is performed iteratively, allowing totally independent spatial discretizations to be used for each of the sub-domains of the model. Given this strategy, the use of matching collocation points at common surfaces is not necessary. To improve the behavior of the iterative process, an optimized algorithm, based on the use of a varying relaxation parameter, is used to speed up and/or to ensure the convergence of the iterative coupling.

40|$|Climate {{change has}} the {{potential}} of affecting the behaviour and distribution of organic pollutants, including POPs. Direct effects of climate change, like temperature increase, modification of wind and precipitation patterns, sea level rise, snow and ice cover, may be very effective in altering the partitioning of POPs among the environmental compartments. Other consequences of future climate scenarios may imply the alteration of degradation rates, soil properties (and hence land use), air-particle partitioning of chemicals and so forth. A case study <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> illustrate the major implications of climate change on the long term at the local scale. A dynamic multimedia model was applied to selected PCB and PCDD/F congeners to simulate the effects of climate change on their distribution and fluxes over the next 50 y in the Venice Lagoon (Italy). Different climate change scenarios were tested, finding noticeable variations in POPs concentration even for minor environmental changes. PCBs and PCDFs environmental concentrations may differ by a factor two in a moderate climate change scenario, compared to a situation with stable climate over the next 50 y. However, model results also suggest that if global warming may have the potential of reducing the environmental levels of these chemicals, it would probably enhance their mobility and hence their potential for long range atmospheric transport...|$|E
