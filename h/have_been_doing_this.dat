5|$|The {{circumstances}} {{regarding how}} Ray came into {{possession of the}} Gretzky T206 Wagner have been shrouded in mystery. He tried to avoid answering any questions regarding the matter but, in a 2001 interview, claimed to have received it from a relative, whose name he did not disclose. Inside the memorabilia community, there was speculation that the card had been cut from a printing sheet during the deal made with Mastro. Mastro has told colleagues in the memorabilia circuit that he purchased the card from a printer, which was not Ray's profession. Ray personally stated that Mastro might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> to prevent others from trying to trace the card. Some also claim that Mastro bought the card from Sevchuk, not Ray.|$|E

500|$|The {{group also}} held an improvisational {{approach}} to live performances, which connected the band with jam band culture. [...] "Jazz and blues musicians <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> for decades, but I {{think they really}} brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else {{at any given time}} to rock music," [...] said Haynes. [...] "We sure didn’t set out to be a [...] "jam band" [...] but those long jams just emanated from within the band, because we didn’t want to just play three minutes and be over," [...] said Allman. Rolling Stone referred to the group as [...] "without question the first great jam band, and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached." ...|$|E

2500|$|Growth {{continued}} until about 2003, but has generally followed the trends {{of the larger}} music industry since that point. In 2009 a The New York Times op-ed placed the entire music industry on a [...] "deathwatch," [...] pointing out that new forms of media, piracy, and new pricing options are driving gross sales down. In another example of parallelism, the Christian music industry has experienced largely the same phenomenon. In the Christian marketplace, music consumption has risen {{by as much as}} 30% since 2005, but overall album sales have dropped to about half of their 1999 levels. However, some critics point out that the current downturn may have long term positive effects for the industry. John J. Thompson told Christianity Today that [...] "The lack of monetary benefit has filtered out {{some of the people who}} should not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> in the first place. If the people who are in it for the money are gone, it leaves more turf for those who had something a little bit loftier in mind." ...|$|E
