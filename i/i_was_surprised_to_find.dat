2500|$|Van Dyck's portraits {{certainly}} flattered {{more than}} Vel√°zquez's; when Sophia, later Electoress of Hanover, first met Queen Henrietta Maria, {{in exile in}} Holland in 1641, she wrote: [...] "Van Dyck's handsome portraits had given me so fine {{an idea of the}} beauty of all English ladies, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that the Queen, who looked so fine in painting, was a small woman raised up on her chair, with long skinny arms and teeth like defence works projecting from her mouth..." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{late as the}} 1920s, Coventry {{was being}} {{described}} as [...] "The best preserved Medieval City in England". On visiting the city (before the devastation that resulted from the Blitz), the novelist J. B. Priestley wrote: [...] "I knew {{it was an old}} place, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> how much of the past, in soaring stone and carved wood, still remained in the city." [...] However, the narrow medieval streets proved ill-suited to modern motor traffic, and during the 1930s many old streets were cleared to make way for wider roads, creating an odd mix of medieval and contemporary streets and buildings.|$|E

5000|$|... "My dear doctor, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> {{hear you}} say that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{coughing}} very badly, as <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> practising all night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O no. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite glad to {{find you}} had it. Everybody gets so {{indifferent}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> know you thought of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> myself resenting the imputation, and deeply. [...] "I'm afraid he's one {{of those}} who can't be 'attended to,'" [...] I answered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she replied, laughing. [...] "Don't think me inquisitive, Arthur; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{you knew}} these girls, with whom I am myself but lightly acquainted." ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{forgotten}} {{there was such}} a thing as food, and my throat and lips were dry; but on descending <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> myself capable of making an excellent meal.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> {{see you in}} {{the very}} last place where you ought to be, if you regard your safety,' {{observed}} Glossin, coolly.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{really was}} an armed {{man in this}} spence," [...] said Mary; [...] "and because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> see him, <b>I</b> cried out to Halbert and Edward--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> {{find you}} in New York. I {{knew you had}} come over. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find you on the stage, being bullied by Mr. Miller." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{thought we}} saw a coachman's head {{and the top of}} a {{carriage}} passing through the lanes, and when we came home <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> my sister-in-law in tears, thoroughly shaken and agitated.|$|E

6000|$|... "I rather {{counted on}} him," [...] said Lord de Mowbray, [...] "to assist me in {{resisting}} this joint branch here; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> learn he had consented." ...|$|R
60|$|I glanced {{towards the}} Duke, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> {{see that his}} hands were shaking. For a man who rarely {{displayed}} feeling the Duke seemed to be wonderfully affected.|$|R
60|$|We came to {{a stream}} that ran north and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> see a goodly volume of water. It evidently flowed down from the {{mountain}} far to the west.|$|R
60|$|On {{the fourteenth}} day I {{went into the}} kitchen, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across {{the hole in the}} wall, turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured obscurity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was pleased}} with you both, in the fights upon the day we entered. You both behaved like brave gentlemen and good swordsmen.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{the streets}} quite full. People were bustling along {{as if it}} were some {{reasonable}} hour and not the grey dawn.

60|$|I confess, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{my theory}} so {{perfectly}} proved in this case.
