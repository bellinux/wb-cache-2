25|$|Though Carson's {{program was}} based in Burbank {{beginning}} in 1972, NBC's editing and production services for the program were located in New York, resulting in the requirement that Carson's program be transmitted from Burbank to New York. In 1976, NBC used the Satcom 2 satellite to do this, feeding the live taping (which usually {{took place in the}} early evening) directly to New York, where it would be edited prior to the normal broadcast. This live feed lasted usually from two to two-and-a-half hours a night and was uncensored and commercial-free. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> breaks, the audio and picture would be left on, capturing at times risqué language and other events that would certainly be edited out later going out over the feed.|$|E

Cronkite remained on the air for the next ten minutes, continuing to read bulletins as they were handed to him, and recapping the events as they were known. He also related a report given to reporters by Texas Congressman Albert Thomas that the President and Governor were still alive, the first indication of their condition. At 2:00 EST, with the top of the hour station break looming, Cronkite told the audience that there would be a brief pause so that all of CBS' affiliates, including those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones which were not on the same schedule, could join the network. He then left the radio booth and went to the anchor desk in the newsroom.|$|E

500|$|The Trivection oven’s {{inclusion}} in 30 Rock was {{widely seen as}} an example of product placement, especially as the product was later advertised <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> break. However, Tina Fey, the show’s creator and writer of the episode, stated the oven was actually included in the show purely as a joke and that GE {{had nothing to do with}} it, although she suspects that [...] "maybe somebody's taking credit for it." [...] Allison Eckelkamp, a spokesperson for GE, confirmed this and says that GE chose to run ads for the oven <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> break to make sure viewers knew it was a real product, rather than one invented by the screenwriters for the purposes of the joke.|$|E

500|$|Although not {{the first}} to do so, 24 embraced the concept of real time. This idea started when {{producer}} Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing [...] "24 episodes in a season, with each episode lasting an hour". They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a [...] "race against the clock". Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> breaks. The exact time is denoted by the digital clock display {{at the beginning and end}} of each segment. The protocol is that mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen. The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode. In line with the depiction of events in real time, 24 does not use slow motion techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first-season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours. As a result of the timing nature of the series, a number of visual cues were projected onto the screen.|$|E
