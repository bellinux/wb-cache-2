5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems. <b>Ethnobotany</b> {{is the study of}} the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships <b>ethnobotany</b> may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants. This relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} using <b>ethnobotany,</b> investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that in vitro studies of their activity often provide unreliable data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as lead compounds in drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|Plants serve many {{functions}} in culture. The reliable provision of food through agriculture {{is the basis}} of civilization. The study of plant uses by native peoples is <b>ethnobotany,</b> while economic botany focuses on modern cultivated plants. Plants are used in medicine, providing many drugs from the earliest times to the present, and as the feedstock for many industrial products including timber and paper as well as a wide range of chemicals. Plants give millions of people pleasure through gardening.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, McClintock {{received}} {{funding from}} the National Academy of Sciences to start research on indigenous strains of maize in Central America and South America. She was interested in studying the evolution of maize through chromosomal changes, and being in South America would allow her {{to work on a}} larger scale. McClintock explored the chromosomal, morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various races of maize. After extensive work in the 1960s and 1970s, McClintock and her collaborators published the seminal study The Chromosomal Constitution of Races of Maize, leaving their mark on paleobotany, <b>ethnobotany,</b> and evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{she made}} an {{extensive}} study of the cytogenetics and <b>ethnobotany</b> of maize races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and genetic regulation that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; {{she is the only}} woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{historical records}} of herbs are found from the Sumerian civilisation, {{where hundreds of}} medicinal plants including opium are listed on clay tablets. The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt describes over 850 plant medicines, while Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in De materia medica, forming the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research makes use of <b>ethnobotany</b> to search for pharmacologically active substances in nature, and has in this way discovered hundreds of useful compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, digoxin, quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes.|$|E

25|$|Research and {{teaching}} {{activities related to}} natural products fall {{into a number of}} different academic areas, including organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, pharmacognosy, <b>ethnobotany,</b> traditional medicine and ethnopharmacology. Other biological areas include chemical biology, chemical ecology, chemogenomics, and systems biology.|$|E

Leonard Co, a Filipino botanist {{was shot}} to death in November 2010, along with two others by soldiers of the Philippine Army whilst doing a study on the flora of Kananga, Leyte. Co was considered as the foremost authority in <b>ethnobotany</b> in the Philippines. Agham together with 14 other organizations conducted a fact-finding mission, which resulted in the formation of a coalition consisting of Co's family, friends, and supporters as well as concerned civil-society groups.|$|E

25|$|The native flora of the Saskatchewan {{includes}} vascular plants, {{plus additional}} species of other plants and plant-like organisms such as algae, lichens and other fungi, and mosses. Non-native {{species of plants}} are recorded as established outside of cultivation in Saskatchewan, of these some non-native species remain beneficial for gardening, and agriculture, where others have become invasive, noxious weeds. Saskatchewan is committed to protecting species at risk in Canada. The growing season has been studied and classified into plant hardiness zones depending on length of growing season and climatic conditions. Biogeographic factors have also been divided into ecoregions and floristic kingdoms across Saskatchewan, and natural vegetation varies depending on elevation, moisture, soil and weather. The study of <b>ethnobotany</b> uncovers the interrelation between humans and plants and the various ways people have used plants for economic reasons, food, medicine and technological developments.|$|E
25|$|During {{their years}} of residence, the Mosers {{collected}} extensive lexical and cultural information, {{much of which}} would be published later in various books and articles. Recorded legends and history were published in the Seri language, and some appear in later collections in English and Spanish. A Seri-Spanish vocabulary book was published in 1961, an <b>ethnobotany</b> (with botanist Richard S. Felger) in 1985 (which has been hailed as a modern classic), and a major dictionary in 2005, thirty years after Edward’s death, but based largely on work that he and Roberto Herrera Marcos (a.k.a. Roberto Herrera Thomson) had done. What is known today about Seri history and culture, including the so-called “band” structure of this group, is the result of work that the Mosers and Herrera did. Even work that does not bear either of their names as authors, such as the article in the journal Science about hibernating sea turtles, the book about the San Esteban people, and the 2005 dictionary, as well as most work on the Seri language and culture during the past half century) is part of their legacy.|$|E
500|$|Cal Poly Pomona's {{institute}} for sustainability {{education is the}} Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies. The center was built adjacent to an old landfill and conducts research {{in the areas of}} sustainable technology and agriculture. As an example of Cradle to Cradle Design, it uses solar-powered dormitories, aquaculture ponds, and organic gardens while providing an environmentally-sustainable housing accommodation for 22 graduate students. In 2010, with the installation of a 210,000kW hours CPV system by Amonix, the center became the first carbon neutral facility in the California State University system. The center is part of Agriscapes, a [...] research project that showcases environmental and agricultural sustainable practices including methods to grow food, conserve water and energy and recycle urban waste. Agriscapes is home of the Farm Store at Kellogg Ranch which sells locally and campus grown foods and products. The Cal Poly campus also contains a rainforest greenhouse, a California <b>ethnobotany</b> garden, and an aquatic biology center collectively known as BioTrek, which provides environmental education to all academic levels.|$|E

500|$|Botany (Greek [...] - grass, fodder; Medieval Latin [...] – herb, plant) and zoology are, historically, {{the core}} {{disciplines}} of biology whose history is {{closely associated with}} the natural sciences chemistry, physics and geology. A distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense, as the study of plants themselves, and botany as applied science, which studies the human use of plants. Early natural history divided pure botany into three main streams morphology-classification, anatomy and physiology – that is, external form, internal structure, and functional operation. The most obvious topics in applied botany are horticulture, forestry and agriculture although there are many others like weed science, plant pathology, floristry, pharmacognosy, economic botany and <b>ethnobotany</b> which lie outside modern courses in botany. Since the origin of botanical science there has been a progressive increase in the scope of the subject as technology has opened up new techniques and areas of study. Modern molecular systematics, for example, entails the principles and techniques of taxonomy, molecular biology, computer science and more.|$|E
500|$|Early in his career, Chamberlin {{studied the}} {{language}} and habits of indigenous peoples of the Great Basin. [...] He worked with the Goshute band of the Western Shoshone to document their uses of over 300 plants in food, beverages, medicine, and construction materials—their ethnobotany—as well as the names and meanings of plants in the Goshute language. His resulting publication, [...] "The Ethno-botany of the Gosiute Indians of Utah", is considered the first major ethnobotanical study of a single group of Great Basin peoples. He also published surveys of Goshute animal and anatomical terms, place and personal names, and a compilation of plant names of the Ute people. One of Chamberlin's later colleagues at the University of Utah was Julian Steward, known as the founder of cultural ecology. Steward himself described Chamberlin's work as [...] "splendid", and anthropologist Virginia Kerns writes that Chamberlin's experience with indigenous Great Basin cultures facilitated Steward's own cultural studies: [...] "in terms of ecological knowledge, [...] probably could not match the elders who had instructed Chamberlin. That made his research on Goshute <b>ethnobotany</b> all the more valuable to Steward." [...] Chamberlin gave Goshute-derived names {{to some of the}} organisms he described, such as the spider Pimoa, meaning [...] "big legs", and the worm Sonatsa, meaning [...] "many hooks", in the Goshute language.|$|E

2500|$|Adolph Ernst {{carried out}} {{important}} studies in {{different regions of}} Venezuela, such as the Caracas valley, Lake Maracaibo, the Andes, the Venezuelan Guayana, the island of La Orchila, the Aroa copper mines and Betijoque diamond mines. He created the precursor of <b>ethnobotany</b> in Venezuela by developing themes such as Historia de la Yuca (1890) and El Banano(1893). The ethnographic and archaeological collections acquired by the National Museum {{formed the basis for}} publishing a series of descriptive anthropological works of diverse indigenous groups in the country: Wayuu, ayamanes, Warao. In relation to his archaeological work, he emphasized work on the Andean region, which specifically described the lytic plaques also known as the [...] "Batwing". He also provided ethnographic data on Andean Aboriginals and spent time with petroglyphs (1885-1889). One of Adolf Ernst's main merits was his disclosing Venezuelan material to the international scientific societies of the nineteenth century, and publishing their contributions in journals such as Globus, Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, American Anthropologist and in the Bulletin de la Société du Antrhopologie Paris.|$|E
