40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that a high-level radioactive waste tank generates quantities of hydrogen, ammonia, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen that are potentially well within flammability limits. These gases are produced from chemical and nuclear decay reactions in a slurry of radioactive waste materials. Significant amounts of combustible and reactant gases accumulate in the waste over a 110 - to 120 -d period. The slurry becomes Taylor unstable owing to the buoyancy of the gases trapped in a matrix of sodium nitrate and nitrite salts. As {{the contents of the}} tank roll over, the generated waste gases rupture through the waste material surface, allowing the gases to be transported and mixed with air in the cover-gas space in the dome of the tank.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many hydrocarbon-contaminated soils contain nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) {{following}} releases from facilities such as {{underground storage}} tanks and pipelines. The recovery of free product by pumping from extraction wells or trenches {{is often an}} essential prerequisite step prior to further remedial actions. Vacuum-enhanced NAPL recovery (sometimes referred to as dual-phase extraction or bioslurping) has attracted recent attention because it offers a means to increase NAPL recovery rates compared with conventional methods, and to accomplish dewatering, while also facilitating vapor-based unsaturated zone cleanup. A conceptual model is presented that recognizes the effects that vacuum-enhanced recovery has on soil water and NAPL, {{with a focus on}} liquid residing at negative <b>gage</b> <b>pressures</b> and therefore lacking sufficient potential energy to flow into a conventional recovery well or trench. The imposition during vacuum-enhanced recovery of subatmospheric pressures within the subsurface can reduce the required potential energy (i. e., the entry suction), allowing liquid to be extracted that hitherto {{had not been able to}} flow into the well; moreover, it induces both pneumatic and hydraulic gradients toward the vacuum source that increase the rate of water and NAPL recovery.

40|$|Grinding is {{a process}} of {{material}} removal using a grinding wheel. Virtually all the energy generated from the grinding process is converted into unavailable energy (heat energy). Coolant supply to remove heat effectively from the grinding zone is very important to prevent thermal damage to the workpiece. This experimental investigation is intended to provide the information about conditions necessary for a coherent coolant jet, and detailed measurements of fluid pressure under an operating grinding wheel for various working conditions. ^ The test program began with a study of the conditions necessary for producing coherent jet. Tests have shown that the secondary flow generated from elbows normally fitted to a coolant pipeline has a significant influence on jet dispersion. To reduce the resulting secondary flow a flow conditioner has been designed and tested. Moreover, round converging nozzles based on Rouse, et al (1952) and a new rectangular nozzle with concave inner walls were designed and built. Jet coherency, therefore, has been improved to a greater degree than before. ^ The coolant pressure measurements show fluid behavior in the grinding zone. The experimental data indicate that workpiece burn is associated with no negative <b>gage</b> <b>pressure,</b> where the temperature confirms that a typical film boiling process has occurred. The pressure measurements also demonstrate that a higher coolant pressure in grinding zone is a measure of improved cooling effectiveness. The coherent jet, presence of the workpiece sidewalls, and downcut grinding mode will increase the pressure reading to a certain degree. The jet direction into the grinding zone, and the use of electroplated superabrasive wheels also have significant effects on the measured pressure. ...|$|E

Static test conditions included 20 C to 150 C, 0 to 3000 tensile microstrain, - 1000 to + 1000 bending microstrain and + or - 650 G vibration. The spin test conditions included 20 C to 82 C at 0 to 90, 000 G. Durability was excellent. Pressure transducer sensitivity changed by only a few percent over this range of environmental conditions. Noise signal due to oscillatory acceleration normal to the diaphragm was acceptable (0. 33 Pa/G). Noise signal due to oscillatory strain was acceptable (0. 5 Pa/microstrain) when the transducer was mounted on a 0. 05 mm rubber pad, with a total buildup of 0. 38 mm on the measure surface. Back mounting or partial recessing to eliminate buildup, increased the strain effect to 1. 2 Pa/microstrain. Flush mounting within the blade to eliminate buildup reduced the strain effect, but required development of a special transducer shape. This transducer was not available in time for spin tests.

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} the design, fabrication, use, {{and benefits of}} a prototype aluminum solvothermal vapor annealing chamber which facilitates the self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) on silicon wafers which are then used to generate nanoscale patterns {{through the use of}} additive lithography. The chamber aids in the low-waste production of research and development silicon wafers possessing unparalleled surface resolution and feature density, by way of nanoscale lithography. The concept of this chamber came out of a need by the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering for a faster and more controlled lithographic production process. The chamber's design lends to a more simplistic, more durable, safer, and environmentally cleaner process than traditional custom-made laboratory instruments. The prototype has the potential to become the standard apparatus for improving the process of solvothermal vapor annealing as a custom-built single solution. The chamber's design is intended to enable a safer, cleaner testing environment, and provide increased control to the researcher by decoupling the temperature control of the solvent, chamber, and sample holder. As a result, the chamber has the potential to allow for a decrease in time for the production of annealed silicon wafers with more dense features than current commercial processes enable. The chamber not only meets the required specifications of the solvothermal vapor annealing process, it also exceeds those expectations by allowing the researcher to reduce overall solvent usage. It supports an internal <b>gage</b> <b>pressure</b> of at least one atm psi and temperatures much greater than 100 degrees Celsius, both necessary conditions for the annealing process. These benefits are the direct result of five unique design characteristics. The following unique characteristics of the solvent chamber design are: a) A tightly toleranced sliding rod; b) A precisely machined sample-specific sized holder; c) A modular mount for the optical film measurement device; d) A set of digitally controlled heaters; e) A set of bolted and press-fitted pieces of aluminum, PTFE, quartz, and copper serve to contain the highly flammable gases, toluene and heptane, normally present in this process, safeguarding the researcher. Although the chamber has not been fully tested in an end-to-end solvothermal vapor annealing process, it demonstrates in self-testing to be a viable alternative and promising solution for Kevin Gotrik, Ph. D. Candidate in the Materials Science and Engineering. There is potential for modifications based on user feedback and implementation.

Surface elevations derived from pressure sensors are lower, {{mainly in the}} region of the crest, compared with the same surface elevations measured with wave <b>gages.</b> <b>Pressure</b> records are more smoothed than wave gage records, and the energy computed for waves measured with a pressure sensor is con­sistently smaller than for waves measured with a wave gage. Methods for converting pressure to surface elevation are given which include the non-linear velocity term (u 2 +v 2) which is usually neglected in the Bernoulli equation. Two techniques are proposed to include this term: 1) flowmeters are used to measure u and v, and 2) the Bernoulli term is derived by determining the velocities by convolving the pressure records using a weighting function determined from shallow water theory. The first technique gave improvements on the order of 3. 4 % to 7. 8 % of the total variance of the wave gage spectrum, whereas the second technique gave improvements on the order of 3. 1 % to 9. 7 %.
