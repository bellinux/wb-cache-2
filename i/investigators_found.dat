5|$|Through {{ballistics}} examination, {{law enforcement}} investigators determined that Cho used the Glock 19 pistol during the attacks at the West Ambler Johnston dormitory and at Norris Hall on the Virginia Tech campus. Police <b>investigators</b> <b>found</b> that Cho fired more than 170 shots during the killing spree, evidenced by technicians finding at least 17 empty magazines at the scene. During the investigation, {{federal law enforcement}} <b>investigators</b> <b>found</b> that the serial numbers were illegally filed off on both the Walther P22 and the Glock 19 handguns used by Cho during the rampage.|$|E
5|$|Crash <b>investigators</b> <b>found</b> the British Rail-designed Mark 4 coaches, {{aside from}} the {{restaurant}} coach, had good structural integrity and remained intact after the accident. Coincidentally, the locomotive in the crash was also involved in the Great Heck rail crash (where the leading Driving Van Trailer hit a road vehicle on the track) a few months later.|$|E
50|$|Although torture was outlawed in China in 1996, a UN <b>investigator</b> <b>found</b> it {{to still}} be {{widespread}} in 2005, particularly because the narrow definition of the law, leaving a mark, does not comply with the UN definition.|$|R
50|$|After Seema Bhat, a {{water quality}} manager at WASA, told her {{superiors}} {{at the agency}} and at the EPA about the lead levels and warned that federal guidelines required aggressive action, she was fired by the agency.

50|$|According to Channel News Asia, Lian Yak Building was {{designed}} by an unqualified draftsman instead of a professional structural engineer. An <b>investigator</b> <b>found</b> that he had under-estimated the dead weight which the columns and walls could support. The draftsman claimed that the building owner Ng Khong Lim, who eventually died in the collapse incident, had appointed him to design Lian Yak Building but Ng directed that building work.

5|$|<b>Investigators</b> <b>found</b> that Fall and a {{relative}} {{had received a}} total of about $400,000 from Doheny and Sinclair, and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases. Fall was ultimately convicted in 1929 for accepting bribes and, in 1931, became the first U.S. cabinet member to be imprisoned for crimes committed while in office. Sinclair was convicted only of contempt of court for jury tampering. Doheny was brought to trial before a jury in April 1930 for giving the bribe Fall had been convicted of accepting, but he was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{told the}} court that, during her {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed a friendship with someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel she could be herself. Army <b>investigators</b> <b>found</b> 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E

5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission <b>investigators</b> <b>found</b> no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E
5|$|According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, {{a former}} WikiLeaks spokesperson, {{part of the}} WikiLeaks {{security}} concept was {{that they did not}} know who their sources were. The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning, or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could be charged with conspiracy. Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him. WikiLeaks did not identify Manning as their source. Army <b>investigators</b> <b>found</b> pages of chats on Manning's computer between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Nicks writes that, despite this, no decisive evidence was found of Assange's offering Manning any direction.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{newspapers}} that printed the story had relied on the Hearst article, and they immediately retracted it with apologies upon learning of the libelous error. Hearst, however, tried to avoid paying the anticipated court judgments of $20,000 ($ in today's dollars) by sending an investigator to Darke County, Ohio {{with the intent of}} collecting reputation-smearing gossip from Oakley's past. The <b>investigator</b> <b>found</b> nothing.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence of witnesses and CCTV cameras, there was substantial forensic evidence linking him to the murders. <b>Investigators</b> <b>found</b> over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on the boots with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he was still wearing {{at the time of}} his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which he had driven. Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E
5|$|While the {{wreckage}} was being examined, <b>investigators</b> <b>found</b> that all four engines were producing thrust {{at the time}} of impact. There were only two ways that the propeller could be reversed during the take-off sequence. Investigators ruled out electrical malfunction since, after detailed examination of the engine hub, there was no evidence found of this happening. Therefore, it was concluded that the only way the propeller could have been reversed was through an unintentional crew action. Although there was no formal evidence that a simulated engine failure was being performed, statements submitted by witnesses suggested that it was likely this was the case. United Airlines procedure calls for No. 4 engine to be shut down in a simulated engine failurethe same engine which was found at the crash site with its propellers reversed.|$|E
5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's {{testified that he}} bragged about dating three women on the bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts {{on the night of the}} murders, <b>investigators</b> <b>found</b> records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders. Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, testified that her father had talked about killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, testified that she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for room service. She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, {{investigators}} deduced {{the final}} {{location of the}} wreckage according to the documents in the archive. With {{the help of a}} modern electronic rangefinder, they followed Jing Pu Railway from Dangjiazhuang Station to six kilometers north, to a village called Chaomidian, which is north of the crash site. Ranging 1 kilometer from the village, the <b>investigator</b> <b>found</b> the valley, which was identical to eyewitnesses' description.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise, {{arriving}} at Point Barrow about a fortnight {{later than the}} <b>Investigator,</b> <b>found</b> its passage blocked by ice and had to turn back and winter in Hong Kong, losing an entire season before returning again the following year, this time successfully. The two ships never made contact {{for the remainder of}} their journeys, and the Enterprise carried out its own separate Arctic explorations.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{newspapers}} that printed the story had relied on the Hearst article, and they immediately retracted it with apologies upon learning of the libelous error. Hearst, however, tried to avoid paying the anticipated court judgments of $20,000 ($ in today's dollars) by sending an investigator to Darke County, Ohio {{with the intent of}} collecting reputation-smearing gossip from Oakley's past.

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. <b>Investigators</b> <b>found</b> that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
5|$|Accidents {{involving}} {{human error}} include American Airlines Flight 965, which {{crashed into a}} mountain in Buga, Colombia, on December 20, 1995, killing 151 passengers and eight crew members with four survivors, and the mid-air collision of DHL Flight 611 near Überlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, on July 1, 2002, {{with the loss of}} two on board plus 69 on a Bashkirian Airlines Tupolev Tu-154. The American Airlines Flight 965 crash was blamed on navigational errors by the crew, while the collision of DHL Flight 611 involved air traffic control errors. Accidents attributed to pilot disorientation due to improperly maintained instruments include Birgenair Flight 301 on February 6, 1996, in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, with the loss of all 189 passengers and crew, and Aeroperú Flight 603 on October 2, 1996, off the coast of Pasamayo, Peru, with the loss of all 70 on board. In the Birgenair accident, <b>investigators</b> <b>found</b> that the aircraft had been stored without the necessary covers for its pitot tube sensors, thus allowing insects and debris to collect within, while in the Aeroperú accident, protective tape covering static vent sensors had not been removed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Investigators</b> <b>found</b> {{that as the}} jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E

5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. <b>Investigators</b> <b>found</b> her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB <b>investigators</b> <b>found</b> severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' seats to fracture where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E
