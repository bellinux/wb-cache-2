Serious research to test chiropractic theories did not begin until the 1970s, and is continuing to be hampered by [...] antiscientific and pseudoscientific ideas that sustained the profession in its long battle with organized medicine. In 1975, the National Institutes of Health brought chiropractors, osteopaths, medical doctors and PhD scientists together in a conference on spinal manipulation to develop strategies to {{study the effects of}} spinal manipulation. In 1978, the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics (JMPT) was launched, and in 1981 it was included in the National Library of Medicine's Index Medicus. Joseph C. Keating, Jr. dates the birth of chiropractic as a science to a 1983 commentary in the JMPT entitled [...] "Notes from the (chiropractic college) underground" [...] in which Kenneth F. DeBoer, then an instructor in basic science at Palmer College in Iowa, revealed the power of a scholarly journal (JMPT) to empower faculty at the chiropractic schools.

Business interest in CV has stimulated academic interest in the topic, resulting in a rapidly growing but fragmented body of literature. Despite the <b>growing</b> international <b>scholarly</b> <b>interest</b> in CV, researchers have devoted little effort to integrating prior findings in a cumulative fashion. As a result, studies do not build upon one another, making it difficult to gauge the progress being made in addressing the fundamental research questions related to CV. In this paper, we examine the literature on CV seeking to synthesize, integrate and link its key findings. To do so, we analyze this literature over the past decade to identify its major themes and research findings setting the stage for greater coherence in future research on CV. We give special attention to the challenges and rewards of theory building in future CV research. Our review clearly shows that CV is an area of scholarly inquiry that has important implications for managerial practice. Corporate venturing Corporate venture capital Spin-off...|$|R
30|$|In recent times, {{attempts}} to explain Chinese social practices to foreign social scientists {{have for the}} first time made face a theme for research and systematic study by Chinese social scientists. The discussion of face by Chinese sociologists, beginning with Hsien Chin Hu (1944), whose work is drawn upon and acknowledged by Goffman, and later including David Ho (1976), Chuansi Stephen Hsu (1996), Kwang-kuo Hwang (1987 a) and Wenshan Jia (2001), is motivated at least in part to explain Chinese social practices to non-Chinese audiences and is written in English. More recently, however, there has risen not only in mainland China but also in Taiwan an interest among Chinese-language social scientists to compare Chinese and non-Chinese societies. In this context, face has become a topic about which there is now Chinese-language discussion among Chinese sociologists and social psychologists (Hwang 1987 b; Lu 1996; Zhai 1994, 1995, 2006). The <b>growing</b> <b>scholarly</b> and research <b>interest</b> in face in China has meant that Ho was encouraged to later publish a Chinese version of his (1976) paper in a book (Ho et al. 2006), and similarly, Kwang-kuo Hwang’s (1987 a) paper was simultaneously published in Chinese (Hwang 1987 b).|$|R

40|$|Gridlock in the {{multilateral}} climate negotiations has created <b>growing</b> <b>scholarly</b> and practical <b>interest</b> {{in the use}} of minilateral forums. A large variety of climate club proposals have been developed in recent years, which promise more effective bargaining among the main climate powers, better incentives to encourage mitigation efforts and discourage free-riding, and new ways to align international power asymmetries with the interests of the global climate regime. I investigate the three dominant rationales that underpin minilateralist proposals. I offer a critical review of their potential as well as their limitations in promoting global climate action. I argue that minilateralism is unlikely to overcome the structural barriers to a comprehensive and ambitious international climate agreement. However, climate clubs can enhance political dialogue in the context of multilateral negotiations and can provide a more conducive environment for great power bargaining. They can create club benefits that strengthen mitigation strategies and help reduce the dangers of free-riding for so-called coalitions of the willing. And they can help re-legitimate the global climate regime against the background of profound power shifts that have slowed down progress in {{the multilateral}} negotiations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Despite <b>growing</b> <b>scholarly</b> v <b>interest</b> {{in social}} {{entrepreneurs}} {{and the social}} enterprises which they create, {{few studies have examined}} the hybridity of social enterprises including, surprisingly, whether they adoption an entrepreneurial orientation (EO) One explanation for this may be the continuing lack of an appropriate scale measuring a social entrepreneurship orientation. This paper seeks to address this research gap by proposing an initial social entrepreneurship orientation (SEO) scale based on input from scholars in the fields of entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach – This study presented employed mixed-methods and a two stage design. In stage one a Delphi study with 18 researchers with expertise of investigating entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship was used to generate constructs combining aspects of both social and entrepreneurial orientations. In stage two, we assessed the face validity of the derived items from the Delphi study by conducting a survey with 82 such experts. Findings – The paper provides empirical insights into how SEO can be measured by proposing, for the first time, a 12 -item scale with 4 dimensions that allows the measurement of a social entrepreneurship orientation for the first time. Research limitations/implications – We recommend that future studies employ quantitative methods, particularly with firms exhibiting differing levels of the ‘socialness’ dimension which we propose and that such studies involve a variety of research informants. Statistical analysis of data collected across large sample sizes will help evaluate {{the reliability and validity of}} the scale which we propose. Practical implications – The paper includes implications for future research based on the proposed social entrepreneurship orientation measurement scale.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the graphic works of Bruno Schulz have gained <b>growing</b> public and <b>scholarly</b> <b>interest</b> during the past three decades, much of his {{pictorial}} work seems to remain subject to marginalization. On the one hand, within the entirety of his oeuvre, Schulz’s graphics and drawings still tend to be perceived as mere preliminaries to the widely acclaimed story collections "Cinnamon Shops" and "The Sanatorium under the Sign of the Hourglass". On the other hand, with regard to Schulz’s position in art history, his graphic works have never stopped generating opinions about their alleged anachronistic and outdated artistic character. Instead of perpetuating these generalizing assumptions, this paper will focus on some undeniably “modernist” aspects of Schulz’s pictorial work, in particular its profound tendency toward self-referentiality (which permeated Schulz’s artistic endeavors even before the time of his literary debut). In fact, as a modern artist of Jewish descent, Schulz can be said to hold a position quite similar to that occupied by other monuments of European Modernism such as Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin, and Marc Chagall. Each one of them stood at the crossroads between tradition and modernity and shaped his artistic ideas through a creative exploration of the Jewish heritage. In Schulz’s case, this contamination of the age-old Judaic tradition and the artistic tendencies of the day becomes very clear in the way his early graphic works call attention to their ambiguous status as artifacts. status: accepte...|$|R

There are several barriers between primary care physicians and chiropractors for having positive referral relationships which includes a lack of good communication. The medical establishment has not entirely accepted chiropractic care as mainstream. After 100 years, the chiropractic profession has failed to define a message that is understandable, credible, and scientifically valid.
