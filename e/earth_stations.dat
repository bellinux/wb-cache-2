25|$|Iridium routes {{phone calls}} through space. In {{addition}} to {{communicating with the}} satellite phones in its footprint, each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites, and routes data between them, to effectively create a large mesh network. There are several <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> which link to the network through the satellites visible to them. The space-based backhaul routes outgoing phone call packets through space {{to one of the}} earth station downlinks ("feeder links"). Station-to-station calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an earth station. As satellites leave the area of an earth station, the routing tables are updated and packets headed for the earth station are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the earth station. Communication between satellites and <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> is at 20 and 30GHz.|$|E

25|$|ANICS {{service is}} {{provided}} by FAA-owned satellite <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> and leased transponders on two communications satellites. NAS facilities are connected to ASTI demarcation points through access circuits. These access circuits may be implemented by a copper or fiber optic cable, microwave radio, or leased services. Communications interfaces provide for Voice Grade (VG) services (VG1, VG2, VG3, VG5, VG6, VG7, VG8, VG10) and for digital services for data rates from 300 bit/s to 1.544 Mbit/s.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} recover {{meaningful}} signal and error free audio from a signal impaired by interference and fading, the receiver uses concatenated Reed-Solomon block coding and Forward Error Correction encoding and decoding (codec). This technique was proven {{in the early}} days of satellite modems in the late 1970s. Linkabit, then run by Irwin Jacobs prior to his involvement with Qualcomm, offered such a codec for rack mounting in satellite <b>earth</b> <b>stations.</b> The Sirius signal uses more robust error correction on control channels than on the audio content, trading off error correction and bandwidth differently for separate categories of bits in the signal waveform.|$|E

500|$|Scientific Atlanta helped NASA {{establish}} ground {{stations for}} communication with astronauts during the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo projects. When John Glenn {{became the first}} American to orbit the Earth in 1962 on Mercury-Atlas 6, his voice was transmitted and received by radio antennas designed and equipment built by Scientific Atlanta. In the 1970s, Robinson recognized the potential combination of communications satellites and cable television. Ted Turner purchased one of Scientific Atlanta's first satellite systems, which {{formed the basis of}} Turner's [...] "Super Station" [...] that was broadcast around the country to other cable providers. In 1975, HBO and TelePrompTer used Scientific Atlanta equipment to transmit the first live satellite-delivered cable event, the [...] "Thrilla in Manila" [...] heavyweight boxing championship bout between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.

2500|$|Also, it is {{very easy}} to {{transmit}} a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite's transponder. It is common for <b>Earth</b> <b>stations</b> to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space, and dual-illuminate the transponder, rendering the frequency unusable. Satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, the {{satellite}} television industry {{developed from the}} cable television industry as communication satellites were being used to distribute television programming to remote cable television headends. Home Box Office (HBO), Turner Broadcasting System (TBS), and Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN, later The Family Channel) {{were among the first}} to use satellite television to deliver programming. Taylor Howard of San Andreas, California became the first person to receive C-band satellite signals with his home-built system in 1976. PBS, a non-profit public broadcasting service, began to distribute its television programming by satellite in 1978. On October 18, 1979, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began allowing people to have home satellite <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> without a federal government license. The front cover of the 1979 Neiman-Marcus Christmas catalogue featured the first home satellite TV stations on sale for $36,500. The dishes were nearly [...] in diameter and were remote-controlled. The price went down by half soon after that, but there were only eight more channels. The Society for Private and Commercial <b>Earth</b> <b>Stations</b> (SPACE), an organisation that represented consumers and satellite TV system owners was established in 1980.|$|E

50|$|Satellite antenna {{aperture}} {{is closely related}} to quality factor (G/T value) of <b>earth</b> <b>station.</b> G/T value and satellite power demand, i.e. equivalent rent bandwidth, show logarithmic linear relationship. In other words, the value of equivalent rent bandwidth increases with the narrowing of {{antenna aperture}}. Therefore, when selecting <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> aperture, it is not the smaller, the better. And <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> aperture should make a compromise between space overhead (equivalent rent bandwidth) and ground overhead (antenna aperture) to make system achieve optimum allocation.|$|R
