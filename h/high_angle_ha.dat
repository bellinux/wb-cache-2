40|$|Ground {{vibrations}} from {{trains are}} {{a major problem for}} people living close to railway lines. When a high-speed train passes at an embankment constructed on soft soils resonance effects can appear and cause high amplitude vibrations for the surrounding environment. To design appropriate railways without expensive costs on field tests it is important to create models and simulate the effects of countermeasures for the embankment and the surrounding soil. In this thesis countermeasures with Lime-Cement Columns have been integrated into a 3 D FEM 90 train-induced ground vibration model developed by the Computational Dynamics Group at Chalmers. Three types of configurations of Lime-Cement Columns have been studied: 1. A case with columns straight under the rails (LC-Column Model). 2. Leaning columns under the embankment (LLC-Column Model). 3. Barrier, where the columns is placed outside the embankment. The column configurations has been evaluated and compared when an X 2000 train pass in velocities between 140 km/h and 300 km/h. The effect of the angle for the leaning columns has been evaluated as well as the influence of the diameter and the strength of the columns. At the track the simulations demonstrate the importance with columns near the rail when reducing dynamic amplifications at the track. The simulations also show that the effect of the countermeasures in the soil is dependent of the critical velocity of the system. For low train velocities below the critical the columns straight under the track is the most effective. At higher velocities the leaning columns works better regarding the vertical amplitude in the soil. The leaning column angle shows that a <b>higher</b> <b>angle</b> <b>has</b> good effect at the track. In the soil a <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>has</b> opposite effect...|$|R

50|$|The {{first years}} of World War II had shown that British destroyers were ill-equipped to deal with {{concentrated}} air attacks, and the Royal Navy suffered heavy losses as a result. In 1941 urgent consideration of the problem led to a naval staff requirement for {{a new class of}} large fleet destroyer with <b>High</b> <b>Angle</b> (<b>HA)</b> twin guns and an HA control system. It was decided that this main armament would be set forward in a superfiring configuration for all guns to engage one target. Arcs of fire were increased by setting the bridge structure further aft than normal. The proposed anti-aircraft (AA) armament were eight 40/60 mm guns in twin mountings set atop the middle and after deck houses to give all around, overlapping arcs of fire. These were to be supplemented by 20 mm guns positioned variously around the ship. Eight 21 in torpedo tubes were to be carried in two quadruple mounts. A/S armament called for two depth charge rails and four depth charge throwers to be fitted. A new feature was the first use of stabilisers in a destroyer, allowing a steady platform for AA gunnery.|$|E

In general, {{the trend of}} decreasing ductility with increasing strength was observed for the UFG alloys. As compared to the coarse grained (CG) alloys, the UFG alloys show a lower ductility, a lower extent of work-hardening and a lower uniform elongation. Unlike the CG alloys, which show a large fraction of uniform to total elongation, in UFG alloys this fraction varies with processing technique.
