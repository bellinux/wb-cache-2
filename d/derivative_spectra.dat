40|$|This study {{investigated}} the performance of different data types used in a hyperspectral data classification process. Data {{in the form of}} spectral reflectance, first <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra</b> and wavelet coefficients were used as inputs for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm used to classify five different classes. The first <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra</b> gave a lower classification accuracy (35. 6 %) than the spectral reflectance (82 %) and the use of wavelet coefficients further improved the classification accuracy to 100 %. Proper selection of the wavelet transformation method, the mother wavelet, the number of vanishing moments and the decomposition level could improve classification accuracy. In summary, wavelet coefficients could maximise discrimination capability as compared to the spectral reflectance and first <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra...</b>|$|E

In order to apply the technique in the in-situ chlorophyll monitoring of estuarine turbid waters, two cruises were carried out in May, 2004 and August, 2006, respectively, in Pearl River Estuary, China.

The first classification is between Broadleaves and pines; the second classification is between Broadleaves, Corsican Pines, and Scots Pines, {{and the third}} classification is between six tree species including different ages of Corsican and Scots Pines. These three classifications are performed by having single- and multiple-endmember and considering five different spectral measure techniques (SMTs) in combination with reflectance spectra (ReflS), first and second <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra.</b> The result shows that using single-endmember, <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra</b> are not useful for a more challenging classification.

The relationships between canopy field spectra {{and the first}} <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra</b> of rice at milky-ripe stage and total salt content and pH value of soil were discussed initiatively. The results indicate {{that there are no}} significant correlations between total salt content and pH value of soil and canopy field spectra (the range of wavelength is between 350 and 1350 nm) of rice, and between total salt content and pH value of soil and vegetation indices, and between total salt content and pH value of soil and the locations and swings of red edges, but the correlation between total salt content and pH value of soil and the first <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra</b> of rice at milky-ripe stage is significant.

40|$|Abstract: We {{studied the}} near UV {{absorption}} spectrum of canine plasminogen. There are 19 tryptophans, 19 phenylalanines and 34 tyrosines in the protein. 4 th <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra</b> optimized for either tryptophan or tyrosine give {{a measure of}} the polarity of the environments of these two aromatic amino acids. Plasminogen at temperatures between 0 °C and 37 °C exists as a mixture of four conformations: closed-relaxed, open-relaxed, closed-compact, and open-compact. The closed to open transition is driven by addition of ligand to a site on the protein. The relaxed to compact transition is driven by increasing temperature from 0 °C to above 15 – 20 °C. When the conformation of plasminogen is mainly closed-relaxed, the 4 th <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra</b> suggest that the average tryptophan environment is similar to a solution of 20 % methanol at the same temperature.

Cheddar cheeses (n = 24) were manufactured and stored at 8 degrees C for 12 mo. Mid-infrared spectra (640 to 4000 /cm) were recorded after 4, 6, 9, and 12 mo storage. At 4, 6, and 9 mo, the water-soluble nitrogen (WSN) content of the samples was determined and the samples were also evaluated for 11 sensory texture attributes using descriptive sensory analysis. The mid-infrared spectra were subjected to a number of pretreatments, and predictive models were developed for all parameters. Age was predicted using scatter-corrected, 1 st <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra</b> with a root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) of 1 mo, while WSN was predicted using 1 st <b>derivative</b> <b>spectra</b> (RMSECV = 2. 6 %).

Within the mathematical limits defined for resolving spectral features, it was demonstrated that the integrated intensity of the doublet feature near 450 nm associated with ferrocytochrome a is independent of the ligand and oxidation state of cytochrome a 3. Furthermore, the doublet features, also observed in cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans, were similarly associated with the heme A component and were correspondingly independent of the ligand and oxidation state of the heme A 3 chromophore.
