5|$|A {{few months}} before the {{election}} Cheney put his home in Dallas up <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids electors from voting for someone from their own state for both President and Vice President.|$|E
5|$|From 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace {{travelled}} {{through the}} Malay Archipelago or East Indies (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> to study natural history. A set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in Indonesia and associated documentation {{can be found}} in the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology. His observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the Wallace line.|$|E

5|$|Setting up an {{exchange}} gives a state partial discretion on standards and prices of insurance. For example, states approve plans <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> <b>and</b> influence (through limits on and negotiations with private insurers) the prices on offer. They can impose higher or state-specific coverage requirements—including whether plans {{offered in the}} state can cover abortion. States without {{an exchange}} do not have that discretion. The responsibility for operating their exchanges moves to the federal government.|$|E

He was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2006. Then, in 2013, he was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, a police investigation into child sexual abuse by media celebrities, and was convicted for indecent assault and imprisoned for five years nine months in June 2014. His art work was largely withdrawn <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> <b>and</b> became worthless, and the CBE was cancelled and annulled.|$|E
5|$|Charles Harmison's {{older brother}} {{had moved to}} Romney, where he {{established}} and operated a hotel (the Virginia House). In 1867, the brother learned that the Parsons farm was <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> <b>and</b> he advised Charles to buy it. Charles' wife, who wanted to live nearer to Virginia, also urged her husband to buy the property. Charles did, and he, his wife, their (then) seven children and a young African American boy named Snoden moved from Harrison to Hampshire County in three days. They traveled on the Northwestern Turnpike in an ambulance Charles had bought after the war. Influenced by her childhood home and by its view of the South Branch Potomac River valley, Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and farm Valley View.|$|E

5|$|His {{mother was}} {{supportive}} of his comic endeavours and would often drive him to stand-up gigs at the comedy club Yuk Yuks. With his deadpan humour, {{he won the}} Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest at 16 years old. Also when Rogen was 16, his father lost his job and his mother quit hers, forcing them to put their house up <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> relocate to a significantly smaller apartment. Around this time, he landed a role on Judd Apatow's television show Freaks and Geeks after attending a local casting call. Despite a strong academic performance, Rogen {{dropped out of high}} school, began working for Apatow, and relocated with his family to Los Angeles. Rogen paid the bills and had become the main wage earner at just16.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House was up <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> <b>and</b> as architects {{with an interest}} in Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills and his family had left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford a mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, H.non-scripta is a {{protected}} species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

This legislation was strengthened in 1998 under Schedule 8 of the Act making any trade in wild common bluebell bulbs or seeds an offence, punishable by fines of up to £5,000 per bulb.

5|$|By January 1947 the Army {{no longer}} needed a ship with Crusaders capabilities, and she was loaned to the Australian Shipping Board. In February that year she transported a load of earth moving {{equipment}} from Melbourne to Launceston, and carried a cargo of timber back to Melbourne. She continued to be manned by an Army crew and made several further trips between Tasmania and the mainland, but in April 1947 {{it was reported that}} the ship was to be scrapped on the grounds that she was considered unseaworthy. Gil Duthie, the Federal member for Wilmot, sought to have Crusader retained in service until the shortage of shipping capable of transporting heavy loads to and from Tasmania was rectified. The Shipping Control Board rejected Duthrie's representations on the grounds that Crusader would need extensive alterations before she could be permanently used for commercial trade, and it would take at least a year to complete the necessary works. However, the Board gave a commitment to make other ships available to transport timber from Tasmania. Crusader was subsequently offered <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> <b>and</b> was purchased by the Queensland Cement and Lime Company (QCL). She arrived at Brisbane on 28 September 1947 and was subsequently renamed Cementco.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury has two rugby union clubs, Toc H R.F.C. and Old Bedians. Toc H, {{founded in}} 1924, plays at Simons Fields, on Ford Lane. Its first team {{plays in the}} North Lancashire and Cumbria league. The club runs four senior teams and a youth section, and has run a 10-a-side {{competition}} every May since 1951, as a charity fund raiser for local hospices. Old Bedians is based in East Didbury, and was founded in 1954. It regularly fields three senior teams {{as well as a}} junior section. Desmond Pastore, believed to be the oldest rugby player in the world, was a founder member of the club, and later became its president. Formerly a player <b>for</b> <b>Sale</b> <b>and</b> Cheshire, Desmond played his last game for Manchester club Egor on his 91st birthday. Bedians AFC (an amateur football club founded in 1928) share the Underbank Farm ground with Old Bedians RUFC.|$|E
5|$|Some recent historians paint a more {{favourable}} {{picture of}} the emperor's rule. For example, Martijn Icks, in Images of Elagabalus (2008; republished as The Crimes of Elagabalus in 2012), doubts {{the reliability of the}} ancient sources and argues that it was the emperor's unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome, to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, in The Emperor Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction? (2008), is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality {{played a role in the}} fall of the young emperor. He was simply the loser in a power struggle within the imperial family; the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> <b>and</b> Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. In this version of events, once Elagabalus, his mother, and his immediate circle had been murdered, a campaign of character assassination began, resulting in a grotesque caricature that has persisted to the present day. Historians have not only kept the tradition alive, but often embellished it, reflecting their own bias against effeminacy, religious zealotry and other traits with which Elagabalus is commonly identified.|$|E

5|$|The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) had an {{ownership}} {{stake in}} the complex ever since Centre Square was constructed and in 1992 became the sole owner. Wolgin sold his {{stake in the}} complex in the early 1980s, and a partnership led by Metropolitan Life of Virginia {{took control of the}} complex around 2000. In 2002 MetLife put the property up <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> <b>and</b> in October of that year HRPT Properties Trust bought Centre Square for US$183.5 million plus closing costs. With the acquisition of Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust (now called Equity Commonwealth) began an improvement and renovation plan for the complex. Improvements included modernization of its elevator, air conditioning, and safety systems. Architectural firm Daroff Design Inc.'s plans included cleaning the structures and a redesign of parts of the atrium and the plaza in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Trafford Council {{depicts a}} griffin on a shield flanked by two unicorns. The line {{bisecting}} the shield horizontally symbolises the River Mersey running through Trafford {{from east to west}} and the canals in the borough. The white legs of a lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle on a white background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families. The fist holding bolts of lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog on the arm represents Altrincham's engineering industry. The unicorns stand <b>for</b> <b>Sale</b> <b>and</b> Altrincham. The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers. The fleet {{proved to be an}} embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed them, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work due to its weak finances. Negotiations dragged on into the early 1900s, but Hamidiye {{was not included in the}} program. Instead, Hamidiye was decommissioned in 1903; the Ottoman Navy considered rebuilding the ship that year, like many of the other ironclads, but the ship was in too poor a condition to merit reconstruction. On 11 November 1909, she was placed <b>for</b> <b>sale,</b> <b>and</b> she was finally purchased by ship breakers in 1913 and thereafter dismantled.|$|E
