The hazard of ignited petroleum running into the culvert {{in the event of}} derailment of a tank wagon means special arrangements have to be made to prevent occupation of the tunnel by passenger trains while <b>hazardous</b> <b>liquid</b> loads are being worked through. Evacuation arrangements are in place to enable the escape of passengers and staff in the event of serious accident in the tunnel.|$|E
25|$|Respondent {{was convicted}} of storing <b>hazardous</b> <b>liquid</b> mercury without a permit, “on or about September 19, 2002 to October 19, 2004,” in {{violation}} of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq.). The jury was not asked to determine the exact duration of the violation. In sentencing, the probation office set a maximum fine of $38.1 million, calculated by assessing the $50,000 maximum daily fine for each of the 762 days between September 19, 2002 and October 19, 2004. Respondent appealed on the basis that the jury never determined the exact duration of the violation. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the sentence, agreeing that the jury had not determined the duration of the violation, but holding that Apprendi did not apply to criminal fines.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the all-solid state batteries, most lithium batteries employ liquid electrolytes, which pose safety issues due to their flammability. [...] Many different solid electrolytes have been proposed to replace these <b>hazardous</b> <b>liquid</b> electrolytes. For most solid-state batteries, high interfacial resistance lowers the reversibility of the intercalation process, shortening the life cycle. [...] These undesirable interfacial effects are less problematic for TiS2. [...] One all-solid-state lithium battery exhibited a power density of 1000 W/kg over 50 cycles with a maximum power density of 1500 W/kg. [...] Additionally, the average capacity of the battery decreased by less than 10% over 50 cycles. Although titanium disulfide has high electrical conductivity, high energy density, and high power, its discharge voltage is relatively low compared to other lithium batteries where the cathodes have higher reduction potentials.|$|E
