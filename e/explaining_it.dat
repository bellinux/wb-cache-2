Ganon recognizes Tetra's Triforce necklace, and realizes she is the {{incarnation}} of Princess Zelda he is seeking. Link's Rito allies and Valoo save Link and Tetra from Ganon. The King of Red Lions brings the two back to the underwater realm, <b>explaining</b> <b>it</b> is the legendary kingdom of Hyrule, which the goddesses submerged long ago to contain Ganon while the people fled to the mountaintops. The King of Red Lions reveals himself to be Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule, the last King of Hyrule, and Tetra is his heir, Zelda, keeper of the Triforce of Wisdom.|$|E

Vidošević however rejected these claims. Hebrang also hesitated before accepting the party nomination, <b>explaining</b> <b>it</b> with health reasons. Vidošević formally announced his bid as an independent candidate on September 2, and was expelled from his party soon after that. Also, Ivo Sanader was not {{the only member of the}} cabinet to resign as Minister of Education Dragan Primorac also announced his retirement on the very same day as the prime minister.

The speculation proved to be true and Primorac announced his candidacy on 9 November 2009. He was then also ejected from HDZ membership.|$|E

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives.

500|$|Challenged with inventing an {{original}} way for Quark {{to survive the}} fight without directly paralleling prior material, writers devised a [...] "holographic puppeteer" [...] system. Worf is seen wearing a headset which allows him to control the body movements of Quark, who is wearing a concealed receiver. It is not made clear how the [...] "virtual control device" [...] works. Indeed, Ronald D. Moore clarified: [...] "I wasn't interested in <b>explaining</b> <b>it</b> to the viewers. We just buy the premise and move on." [...] However, science consultant André Bormanis agreed that the [...] "web of sensors and actuators" [...] was conceptually sound. Dan Curry, who originally designed the bat'leth and helped developed Klingon fighting techniques, was instrumental in choreographing the combat scene between Quark and Thopok. Despite his character's apparent ineptitude at hand-to-hand combat, Shimerman practiced extensively with a bat'leth to make Worf's influence over Quark seem convincing. Shimerman also {{enlisted the help of}} a mime artist to improve his technique.|$|E
