5|$|Elemental <b>iodine</b> {{is used as}} a {{disinfectant}} {{either as}} the element, or as the water-soluble triiodide anion I3− generated in situ by adding iodide to poorly water-soluble elemental <b>iodine</b> (the reverse chemical reaction makes some free elemental <b>iodine</b> available for antisepsis). Elemental <b>iodine</b> may also be used to treat <b>iodine</b> deficiency.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Bernard Courtois {{discovered}} <b>iodine</b> {{was present}} in seaweed, and <b>iodine</b> intake was linked with goiter size in 1820 by Jean-Francois Coindet. Gaspard Adolphe Chatin proposed in 1852 that endemic goiter {{was the result of}} not enough <b>iodine</b> intake, and Eugen Baumann demonstrated <b>iodine</b> in thyroid tissue in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Lugol's iodine: <b>iodine</b> and iodide {{in water}} alone, forming mostly triiodide. Unlike {{tincture}} of <b>iodine,</b> Lugol's <b>iodine</b> has a minimised {{amount of the}} free <b>iodine</b> (I2) component.|$|E
5|$|After <b>iodine</b> {{fortification}} {{programs such}} as iodisation of salt have been implemented, some cases of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism have been observed (so-called Jod-Basedow phenomenon). The condition seems to occur mainly in people over forty, and the risk appears higher when <b>iodine</b> deficiency is severe and the initial rise in <b>iodine</b> intake is high.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} <b>iodine,</b> it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of <b>iodine</b> produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive <b>iodine</b> isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive <b>iodine,</b> taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{the third}} halogen, being a nonmetal in group 17 of the {{periodic}} table. Its properties are thus {{similar to those of}} fluorine, chlorine, and <b>iodine,</b> and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and <b>iodine.</b> Bromine has the electron configuration 3d104s24p5, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell. Corresponding to periodic trends, it is intermediate in electronegativity between chlorine and <b>iodine</b> (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than <b>iodine.</b> It is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine, but a stronger one than <b>iodine.</b> Conversely, the bromide ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride. These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and <b>iodine</b> together being classified as one of the original triads of Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, whose work foreshadowed the periodic law for chemical elements. It is intermediate in atomic radius between chlorine and <b>iodine,</b> and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and <b>iodine,</b> such as first ionisation energy, electron affinity, enthalpy of dissociation of the X2 molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. The volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.|$|E
5|$|Cuprous halides (with chlorine, bromine, and <b>iodine)</b> are known, as are cupric halides with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Attempts {{to prepare}} copper(II) iodide yield only cuprous iodide and <b>iodine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elemental <b>iodine</b> {{is also a}} skin irritant, {{and direct}} contact with skin can cause damage and solid <b>iodine</b> {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental <b>iodine</b> concentration, such as tincture of <b>iodine</b> and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E
5|$|Elemental <b>iodine</b> is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of <b>iodine</b> vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when <b>iodine</b> is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. <b>Iodine</b> is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E
5|$|Further {{purification}} {{is done by}} {{a chemical}} transport reaction developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer. In a closed vessel, the metal reacts with <b>iodine</b> at temperatures above 500°C forming metal(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of nearly 2000°C the reverse reaction happens and the <b>iodine</b> and metal are set free. The metal forms a solid coating on the tungsten filament and the <b>iodine</b> can react with additional metal resulting in a steady turnover.|$|E
5|$|Further {{purification}} is {{effected by}} a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, hafnium reacts with <b>iodine</b> at temperatures of 500°C, forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of 1700°C the reverse reaction happens, and the <b>iodine</b> and hafnium are set free. The hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament, and the <b>iodine</b> can react with additional hafnium, {{resulting in a}} steady turn over.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, {{when the}} Parisian saltpetre {{manufacturer}} Bernard Courtois made <b>iodine</b> {{for the first}} time from the kelp ash, his discovery was greeted with great interest by experts. Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments to isolate <b>iodine.</b> In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the <b>iodine</b> content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for <b>iodine</b> production.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little <b>iodine</b> in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, <b>iodine</b> deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. <b>Iodine</b> deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of <b>iodine</b> to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but <b>iodine</b> deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. <b>Iodine</b> deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by <b>iodine</b> repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iodine</b> {{accounts}} for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. Fifteen to 20mg of <b>iodine</b> {{is concentrated in}} thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all <b>iodine</b> in the body is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The action of <b>iodine</b> in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, it is (at least) partially unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iodine</b> deficiency, {{most common}} in inland and mountainous areas, can {{predispose}} to goitre – if widespread, known as endemic goitre. Pregnant women deficient of <b>iodine</b> can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency. The use of iodised salt used to add <b>iodine</b> to the diet has eliminated endemic cretinism in most developed countries, and over 120 countries have made the iodination of salt mandatory.|$|E
5|$|Less {{reactive}} than <b>iodine,</b> astatine is {{the least}} reactive of the halogens, although its compounds have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their radioactive disintegration. The reactions involved have been typically tested with dilute solutions of astatine mixed with larger amounts of <b>iodine.</b> Acting as a carrier, the <b>iodine</b> ensures there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques (such as filtration and precipitation) to work. Like <b>iodine,</b> astatine {{has been shown to}} adopt odd-numbered oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{sources of}} dietary <b>iodine</b> include seafood, such as fish, {{seaweeds}} (such as kelp) and shellfish, dairy products and eggs {{so long as}} the animals received enough <b>iodine,</b> and plants grown on iodine-rich soil. Iodised salt is fortified with <b>iodine</b> in the form of sodium iodide.|$|E
5|$|Potassium tetraiodomercurate(II), K2HgI4, is {{also known}} as Nessler's reagent. It is often used as a {{sensitive}} spot test for ammonia. Similarly, Cu2HgI4 is used as a precipitating reagent to test for alkaloids. The iodide and iodate anions are often used for quantitative volumetric analysis, for example in iodometry and the <b>iodine</b> clock reaction (in which <b>iodine</b> also serves as a test for starch, forming a dark blue complex), and aqueous alkaline <b>iodine</b> solution is used in the iodoform test for methyl ketones. The <b>iodine</b> test for starch is still used to detect counterfeit banknotes printed on starch-containing paper.|$|E
5|$|Povidone <b>iodine</b> (an iodophor).|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of <b>iodine,</b> {{and a member of the}} halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and <b>iodine).</b> Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that of <b>iodine.</b> Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of <b>iodine.</b> It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E
5|$|The caliche was {{the main}} source of <b>iodine</b> in the 19th century and {{continues}} to be important today, replacing kelp (which is no longer an economically viable source), but in the late 20th century brines emerged as a comparable source. The Japanese Minami Kanto gas field east of Tokyo and the American Anadarko Basin gas field in northwest Oklahoma are the two largest such sources. The brine is hotter than 60°C from the depth of the source. The brine is first purified and acidified using sulfuric acid, then the iodide present is oxidised to <b>iodine</b> with chlorine. An <b>iodine</b> solution is produced, but is dilute and must be concentrated. Air is blown into the solution to evaporate the <b>iodine,</b> which is passed into an absorbing tower where sulfur dioxide reduces the <b>iodine.</b> The hydrogen iodide (HI) is reacted with chlorine to precipitate the <b>iodine.</b> After filtering and purification the <b>iodine</b> is packed.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{producers of}} <b>iodine</b> today are Chile and Japan. <b>Iodine</b> {{and its compounds}} are primarily used in nutrition. Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds, it has also found favour as a non-toxic radiocontrast material. Because of the specificity of its uptake by the human body, radioactive isotopes of <b>iodine</b> {{can also be used}} to treat thyroid cancer. <b>Iodine</b> is also used as a catalyst in the industrial production of acetic acid and some polymers.|$|E
5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} <b>iodine</b> {{are the highest}} among the halogens, {{conforming}} to the increasing trend down the group, since <b>iodine</b> has the largest electron cloud among them {{that is the most}} easily polarised, resulting in its molecules having the strongest van der Waals interactions among the halogens. Similarly, <b>iodine</b> is the least volatile of the halogens. Because it has the largest atomic radius among the halogens, <b>iodine</b> has the lowest first ionisation energy, lowest electron affinity, lowest electronegativity and lowest reactivity of the halogens.|$|E
5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is the only}} source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process {{requires}} <b>iodine</b> and the amino acid tyrosine. <b>Iodine</b> in the bloodstream is taken up by the gland and incorporated into thyroglobulin molecules. The process is controlled by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), which is secreted by the pituitary. Not enough <b>iodine,</b> or not enough TSH, can result in decreased production of thyroid hormones.|$|E
5|$|These sources {{ensure that}} Chile and Japan {{are the largest}} {{producers}} of <b>iodine</b> today. Alternatively, the brine may be treated with silver nitrate to precipitate out <b>iodine</b> as silver iodide, which is then decomposed by reaction with iron to form metallic silver and a solution of iron(II) iodide. The <b>iodine</b> may then be liberated by displacement with chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, <b>iodine</b> {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, <b>iodine</b> will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and <b>iodine</b> can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since <b>iodine</b> has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in <b>iodine</b> heptafluoride.|$|E
5|$|Tincture of iodine: <b>iodine</b> in ethanol, or <b>iodine</b> {{and sodium}} iodide {{in a mixture}} of ethanol and water.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{chlorine}} and bromine {{which have}} one significant main use dwarfing all others, <b>iodine</b> {{is used in}} many applications of varying importance. About half of all produced <b>iodine</b> goes into various organoiodine compounds; another 15% remains as the pure element, another 15% is used to form potassium iodide, and another 15% for other inorganic <b>iodine</b> compounds. The remaining 5% is for minor uses. Among the major uses of <b>iodine</b> compounds are catalysts, animal feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation (from tincture of <b>iodine),</b> and photography; minor uses include smog inhibition, cloud seeding, and various uses in analytical chemistry.|$|E
5|$|As {{an element}} with high {{electron}} density and atomic number, <b>iodine</b> absorbs X-rays weaker than 33.3keV {{due to the}} photoelectric effect of the innermost electrons. Organoiodine compounds are used with intravenous injection as X-ray radiocontrast agents. This application is often in conjunction with advanced X-ray techniques such as angiography and CT scanning. At present, all water-soluble radiocontrast agents rely on <b>iodine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and <b>iodine,</b> {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to <b>iodine,</b> and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than <b>iodine.</b> This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E
5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or <b>iodine</b> oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises <b>iodine</b> to <b>iodine</b> pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|Elemental <b>iodine</b> (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted. The {{lethal dose}} {{for an adult}} human is 30mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4grams for a human {{weighing}} 70 to 80kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000mg/kg dose). Excess <b>iodine</b> can be more cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. <b>Iodine</b> supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism may be {{prevented}} {{in a population}} by adding <b>iodine</b> to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate <b>iodine</b> deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization (USI). Encouraged by the World Health Organization, 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, <b>iodine</b> deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries {{as a result of}} attempts to reduce salt intake.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iodine</b> {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary <b>iodine,</b> hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iodine</b> is an {{essential}} element for life and is the heaviest element commonly needed by living organisms. (Lanthanum and the other lanthanides, as well as tungsten, are used by a few microorganisms.) It {{is required for the}} synthesis of the growth-regulating thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T4 and T3 respectively, named after their number of <b>iodine</b> atoms). A deficiency of <b>iodine</b> leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 and a concomitant enlargement of the thyroid tissue in an attempt to obtain more <b>iodine,</b> causing the disease known as simple goitre. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is between 14:1 and 20:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (T1a) and thyronamine (T0a'). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes; thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production.|$|E
5|$|<b>Iodine</b> oxides are {{the most}} stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I–O bonds {{resulting}} from the large electronegativity difference between <b>iodine</b> and oxygen, {{and they have been}} known for the longest time. The stable, white, hygroscopic <b>iodine</b> pentoxide (I2O5) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of iodic acid (HIO3), which it is the anhydride of. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to carbon dioxide at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, ethylene, and hydrogen sulfide. It reacts with sulfur trioxide and peroxydisulfuryl difluoride (S2O6F2) to form salts of the iodyl cation, +, and is reduced by concentrated sulfuric acids to iodosyl salts involving +. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, or chloryl fluoride, resulting <b>iodine</b> pentafluoride, which also reacts with <b>iodine</b> pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF3. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I4O9 and I2O4; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are IIII(IVO3)3 and +− respectively.|$|E
