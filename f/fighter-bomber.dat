5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in June 1950, Loring was attached to Air University and was not immediately sent to Korea for combat duty. On February 3, 1952, Loring was reassigned to the 2353rd Personnel Processing Squadron at Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California. This unit was quickly moved to South Korea, where it was assigned to the 8th <b>Fighter-Bomber</b> Wing, Fifth Air Force, with the assignment of supervising training for replacement pilots before they were moved into combat units. During this time he flew with the 36th <b>Fighter-Bomber</b> Squadron and 80th <b>Fighter-Bomber</b> Squadron, while assisting the new pilots.|$|E

5|$|By April 1975, morale in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force {{had sunk}} {{so low that}} some of their {{personnel}} simply defected to the Communist side. In a well-known incident, South Vietnamese pilot Nguyen Thanh Trung used his F-5E <b>fighter-bomber</b> to attack the Presidential Palace in Saigon instead of North Vietnamese troops. Shortly afterwards, Trung joined the Communist forces and he was ordered to train a group of North Vietnamese pilots to operate the U.S.-made A-37 Dragonfly <b>fighter-bomber,</b> in order to support the Ho Chi Minh Campaign. On the afternoon of April 28, 1975, Trung led a flight of five A-37 fighter-bombers against Tan Son Nhut Air Base, which temporarily stopped U.S. and South Vietnamese evacuation efforts.|$|E
5|$|The F-4 Phantom is a tandem-seat <b>fighter-bomber</b> {{designed}} as a carrier-based interceptor to fill the U.S. Navy's fleet defense fighter role. Innovations in the F-4 included an advanced pulse-Doppler radar and extensive use of titanium in its airframe.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of modern}} {{conventional}} attack capability prompted {{calls for a}} specialized attack aircraft. On 7 June 1961, Secretary of Defense McNamara ordered the air force to develop two tactical aircraft, one for the long-range strike and interdictor role, and the other focusing on the <b>fighter-bomber</b> mission. The former became the Tactical Fighter Experimental, or TFX, which emerged as the F-111, while the second was filled by {{a version of the}} U.S. Navy's F-4 Phantom II. While the Phantom would go on {{to be one of the}} most successful fighter designs of the 1960s, and proved to be a capable <b>fighter-bomber,</b> its lack of loiter time was a major problem, and to a lesser extent, its poor low-speed performance. It was also expensive to buy and operate, with a flyaway cost of $2 million in FY1965, and operational costs over $900 per hour.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, the SADC {{procured}} Shorts Skyvan search-and-locate {{aircraft and}} Douglas A-4 Skyhawk <b>fighter-bombers.</b> With a reliable mix of fighters, <b>fighter-bombers,</b> helicopters and transport aircraft, the SADC {{was ready to}} assume the functions of a full-fledged air force. On 1 April 1975, the SADC was renamed the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).|$|R

5|$|Although effective, the B-52 was {{not ideal}} for the {{low-level}} role. This {{led to a}} number of aircraft designs known as penetrators, which were tuned specifically for long-range low-altitude flight. The first of these designs to see operation was the supersonic F-111 <b>fighter-bomber,</b> which used variable-sweep wings for tactical missions. Similar aircraft also emerged for other users as well, notably the BAC TSR-2, and later, Panavia Tornado and Sukhoi Su-24. A number of studies on a strategic-range counterpart followed.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, {{following}} {{the introduction of}} the supersonic English Electric Lightning in the interceptor role, the Hunter transitioned to being operated as a <b>fighter-bomber</b> and for aerial reconnaissance missions, using dedicated variants for these purposes. Two-seat variants remained in use for training and secondary roles with the RAF and the Royal Navy until the early 1990s. Sixty years after its original introduction it was still in active service, being operated by the Lebanese Air Force until 2014.|$|E
5|$|Five {{of these}} had been {{completed}} {{by the spring of}} 1956 and were undergoing preflight tests when the entire program was canceled on 13 April 1956 and all components in preparation scrapped. A week later, the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the <b>Fighter-Bomber</b> branch and the doctrine of the VVS was drastically modified. No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army, but rather it would use tactical nuclear weapons as part of the nuclear battlefield.|$|E

5|$|Göring also placed {{emphasis}} on correct rendezvous with the bombers, {{which had been}} lacking in recent operations (see Adlertag). The longer-range bombers were ordered directly to fighter airfields {{to pick up their}} escorts {{on the way to the}} target. He determined that as many fighters as possible should remain on sweeps while a smaller number maintained close contact with the bombers. For now, this would be the main tactical arrangement of <b>fighter-bomber</b> cooperation.|$|E
5|$|In the Vietnam War, Blanchard flew 113 {{missions}} from Thailand, 84 of {{them over}} North Vietnam. He piloted a <b>fighter-bomber</b> during a one-year tour of duty that ended in January 1969. He retired from the Air Force in 1971 as a colonel. After retiring from the Air Force, he spent several more years as the commandant of cadets at the New Mexico Military Institute, a junior college that prepares students to enter the service academies.|$|E
5|$|Sebille {{commanded}} the 67th <b>Fighter-Bomber</b> Squadron at {{the outbreak of}} the Korean War, flying F-51 Mustangs in close air support and air strike missions. On August 5, 1950, he attacked a North Korean armored column advancing on United Nations military units. Though his aircraft was heavily damaged and he was wounded during the first pass on the column, he turned his plane around and deliberately crashed into the convoy at the cost of his life.|$|E

5|$|The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is a tandem two-seat, twin-engine, all-weather, {{long-range}} supersonic jet interceptor and <b>fighter-bomber</b> {{originally developed}} for the United States Navy by McDonnell Aircraft. It first entered service in 1960 with the U.S. Navy. Proving highly adaptable, it was also adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force, and by the mid-1960s had become {{a major part of}} their air wings.|$|E
5|$|The Panavia Tornado is {{a family}} of twin-engine, variable-sweep wing multirole combat aircraft, which was jointly {{developed}} and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom, and West Germany. There are three primary Tornado variants: the Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) <b>fighter-bomber,</b> the suppression of enemy air defences Tornado ECR (electronic combat/reconnaissance) and the Tornado ADV (air defence variant) interceptor aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{operated}} 24 McDonnell Douglas F-4E PhantomII <b>fighter-bomber</b> {{aircraft in}} the ground attack role between 1970 and 1973. The Phantoms were leased from the United States Air Force (USAF) as an interim measure owing to delays {{in the delivery of}} the RAAF's 24 General Dynamics F-111C bombers. The F-4Es were considered successful in this role, but the government did not agree to a proposal from the RAAF to retain the aircraft after the F-111s entered service in 1973.|$|E
50|$|North American F-100 Super Sabre <b>fighter-bombers</b> {{capable of}} {{carrying}} hydrogen bombs were also present at Kadena Air Base.|$|R

5|$|The plan of Bodenplatte {{called for}} a {{surprise}} attack against 16 Allied air bases in Belgium, the Netherlands and France. The object was to destroy or cripple as many Allied aircraft, hangars and airstrips as possible. Every fighter and <b>fighter-bomber</b> Geschwader (Wing) currently occupied with air defence along the Western Front was redeployed. Additional night-fighter units (Nachtjagdgeschwader) and medium bomber units (Kampfgeschwader) acted as pathfinders. The strike formations themselves were mostly single-engine Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters.|$|E
5|$|Word of the dogfight spread {{throughout}} the area, and an air alert was quickly posted over Seoul. In response, four F-80C Shooting Star aircraft of the 35th <b>Fighter-Bomber</b> Squadron under US Captain Raymond E. Schillereff were posted in the skies over Seoul to counter any North Korean aircraft appearing in the area. The F-80s were jet engine-powered fighter aircraft which would easily defeat all of the aircraft known in the North Koreans' air force.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft {{had been designed}} and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom <b>fighter-bomber,</b> which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5000|$|... 16 F4E <b>fighter-bombers</b> from Hamadan Air Base bombed Kut Air Base. According to Iranian reports, the airbase was {{completely}} destroyed.|$|R

50|$|However, the {{first-line}} {{strength of}} the JRV was still declining, so in 1951 the Yugoslav Chief of Staff, Colonel General Koča Popović, visited the United Kingdom to discuss the situation. It was agreed that a substantial shipment of aircraft would be forthcoming. In October 1951, the first de Havilland Mosquito F.B.6 <b>fighter-bombers</b> were supplied. The following year, 150 Republic F-47D Thunderbolt <b>fighter-bombers</b> were delivered from the USA under a Mutual Assistance Pact.|$|R
