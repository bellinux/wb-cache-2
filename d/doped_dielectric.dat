In this paper, the effects of design geometries and nonlinear losses on the gain in crystalline silicon waveguides with erbium-doped regions are investigated. We show that by using multitrench geometries, the power confinement can be increased and higher gain-to-nonlinear-loss ratio achieved. Net gain can be improved as much as 0. 38 dB/cm in multitrench waveguides compared to single-trench waveguides. Index Terms — Erbium, integrated optics, laser amplifiers, waveguides. I...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{plasmonic}} nanoparticles (NPs) have gained {{a lot of}} interest due to their exceptional and fascinating properties which have been accomplishing vital role in emerging science and technology towards multifunctional applications. The extensive current research efforts in nanoplasmonics trigger towards various opto-electronic and medical applications such as invisibility, perfect lens, increasing the efficiency of solar cells, designing and extra-sensitive single-particle detection of biomolecular recognition and in particular optical metamaterials. The negative real part and the low value of the imaginary part of dielectric permittivity are crucial for applications of nanoparticles as subunits of optical metamaterials. However, the performance of plasmonic nanostructures is significantly limited by the intrinsic and strong energy dissipation in metals, especially in the visible range. In fact, regardless of the challenges to synthesize plasmonic nanostructures, the path to use them as building blocks of optical metamaterial is crossing through the finding a solution to mitigate their optical losses. In this research thesis, it is demonstrated experimentally that the incorporation of gain material such as organic dye molecules and quantum dots in close proximity of enhanced local fields of various properly designed plasmonic systems makes it possible to induce resonant energy transfer processes from gain units to plasmonic nanoparticles, to accompanish loss compensation in optical metamaterials. Steady-state experiments and time resolved spectroscopy along with modification of Rayleigh scattering and optical transmission of a probe beam as a function of impinging energy are crucial evidences of mitigation of absorptive losses in different gain doped plasmonic systems The strategy that has been followed here towards mitigation of absorptive losses in optical metamaterials acts at different spatial scales from nano to macro (see Figure 1). The systems at nano-scale (10 - 100 nm) are based on dispersion of NPs, in particular, gain assisted (nanoparticle-dye dispersion), gain-functionalized core-shell gold NPs (encapsulated dye molecules into the shell) and dye grafted gold core multimeric nanostructures. The study of such nano-composites allows to recognize experimentally how the parameters such as the geometry and size of the metal nanostructures, inter-particle distance, overlap between emission spectrum of gain material and plasmon band of metal NPs, concentration and quantum yield of donor molecules are playing an important role to create more efficient nonradiative RET processes from donor molecules to acceptors. Figure 1 The followed spatial stages on this research study ranged from (a) nano-scale and (b) mesco scale towards (c) macro scale. The obtained results in nano-scale generate further motivations to move forward to study meso-scale (100 - 900 nm) plasmonic systems which include both dispersion (nanoshell composites) and bulk (periodic layers of gain materials and lossy metal elements) systems. The nanoshells which are consisted of dye <b>doped</b> <b>dielectric</b> core coated gold shell dispersed in ethanol solution are designed with an optimized ratio of core diameter and metallic shell thickness. The time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy results along with pump-probe experiments on nanoshells are convincing evidences for optical loss mitigation. Finally in third stage, the optical properties of gain-plasmon composites dispersed in PDMS host matrix as an example for bulk samples at the macroscopic scale (1 μm and beyond) have been investigated. The achieved results on this stage can help to design and fabricate such plasmonic structures that lead from fundamental physics towards practical applications. In this regard, the first four chapters provide the background concerning the main elements of this research work. The first chapter contains an introduction to the metamaterials. Second chapter describes the optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures. In third chapter, gain materials and the optical processes beyond these materials have been investigated. The fourth chapter deals with the optical properties of hybrid systems consisted of active materials and nano-plasmonic elements. After providing a brief introduction regarding the applied setups and instruments in this research study in chapter five, the last three chapters represent the acquired experimental results in each mentioned spatial scale. In chapter six, the optical properties of nano-scaled gain-plasmon systems in solution including gain-assisted, gainfunctionalized and dye grafted multimeric samples are investigated. Chapter seven explores the optical characteristics of dispersion of nanoshell sample {{as an example of the}} study in mesoscale. Finally, the thesis is completed with the study of the optical features of macro-scaled bulk samples based on core–shell type quantum dots and gold NPs dispersed in PDMS, and a short conclusion of this research study.
