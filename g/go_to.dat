50|$|Between 1842 and 1870 a {{total of}} 525,482 Indians emigrated to the British and French Colonies. Of these, 351,401 <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Mauritius, 76,691 <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Demerara, 42,519 <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Trinidad, 15,169 <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Jamaica, 6,448 <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Natal, 15,005 <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Réunion and 16,341 <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the other French colonies. This figure {{does not include the}} 30,000 who <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Mauritius earlier, labourers who <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Ceylon or Malaya and illegal {{recruitment}} to the French colonies. Thus by 1870 the indenture system, transporting Indian labour to the colonies, was an established system of providing labour for European colonial plantations and when, in 1879, Fiji became a recipient of Indian labour it was this same system with a few minor modifications.|$|R

40|$|Kratzer (1991) {{discusses}} syntactic {{restrictions on}} the construction of focus alternatives in the sense of Rooth 1992. She presents an example with a focus in the antecedent of a deleted VP. (d 0) Peter: What a copy cat you are! You <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because I did. You <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Elk Lake Lodge because I did. And you <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood because I did. Jane: I only <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD because you did. By reconstructing the deleted VP, Jane´s objection becomes I only <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD because you <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD. For this sentence standard alternative semantics al-lows for the construction of an alternative set A 0 which comprises predicates like <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood, i. e. predicates of the form <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> y. Jane´s objection therefore excludes that she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island. Kratzer claims that this is not intended. The alternative set (A 1) may only comprise predi-cates of the form <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x. This restriction is due to syntactic, and not contextual reasons. In constructing an alternative set the focus in a formerly deleted VP must always be replaced by the same value as the corresponding focus in the antecedent VP. Kratzer´s view is widely accepted. We did an experiment to test whether listeners always interpret utterances like Jane´s ac-cording to Kratzer´s hypothesis. We integrated a German analogue of Jane´s objection into two different German dialogues (d 1,d 2). As there is no VP-deletion in German, the German and English examples differ in their anaphoric means. The English example employs VP-deletion, the German ones pronominal anaphora. We placed the dialogues into a context where Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Berlin (resp. Tanglewood), which inspired Jane, who then <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Dort-mund (Block Island), Kiel (Elk Lake Lodge) and Berlin. After she came back, Peter went t...|$|R
