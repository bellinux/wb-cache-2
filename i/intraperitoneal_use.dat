40|$|Mesh-related adhesions are a {{significant}} clinical problem following intraperitoneal mesh placement. In this study, we evaluated adhesion formation to three relatively new meshes for <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>use.</b> Three new meshes for <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>use</b> (Omyra(A (R)) mesh, Physiomesh(A (R)), and Hi-Tex Endo-IPA (R)) were implanted intraperitoneally in rats and compared with a polypropylene control mesh (Parietene(A (R))) after 7 or 90 days. Adhesion formation, incorporation (tensile strength), shrinkage, and foreign body reaction were scored. Hi-Tex Endo-IP and Physiomesh(A (R)) showed significantly less adhesion formation when compared to Parietene at both time points (p < 0. 05). Shrinkage was highest in Omyra mesh after 90 days, which was significantly more compared to Parietene(A (R)) (p < 0. 001). Physiomesh(A (R)) only showed {{a significant}} reduction in craniocaudal mesh length, compared to Parietene and Hi-Tex Endo-IP (p < 0. 05). After 90 days, Hi-Tex Endo-IPA (R) showed significantly higher and Physiomesh(A (R)) significantly lower incorporation strengths compared to all other groups (p < 0. 05). Microscopic evaluation revealed massive foreign body reaction to Hi-Tex Endo-IPA (R), leading to an extensive and thick collagenous scar adherent to the abdominal wall. Fractioning of the Physiomesh(A (R)) coating over time led to an increase in interfilamentary granuloma formation, leading to scar plate formation, but with only minimal to no abdominal wall adherence. Both Parietene(A (R)) and Omyra(A (R)) showed a mild foreign body response. Although clear distinctions can be made between meshes and some meshes excel, none of the meshes are superior in all aspects required for effective and safe incisional hernia repai...|$|E
40|$|Incisional hernia is an {{important}} complication of abdominal surgery. Procedures for the repair of these hernias with sutures and with mesh have been reported, {{but there is no}} consensus about which type of procedure is the best. We have performed a retrospective analysis on 1128 patients operated on in our unit between 1994 and 2004 for simple or recurrent incisional hernias.

There were 1 enterocutaneous fistula and 5 wound sinus developed. The mesh had to be removed in 6 cases. All of these complication developed when the mesh has been placed either extraperitoneally/subfascial or onlay. We note 5 recurrent incisional hernias after a period of up to 24 months.

40|$|Aims: A Krukenberg tumor (KT) is an {{uncommon}} type {{of ovarian cancer}} (OC) with poor prognosis. We sought to identify prognostic factors for KT originating from primary gastrointestinal (GI) tumors. Methods: Forty-four patients with KT were assessed with follow-up. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) after first gynecological or GI surgery. Results: The use of postoperative chemotherapy, unilaterally involved ovarian mass, resection of primary tumors, absence of metastatic residuals, and diagnosis of GI tumors synchronously with or after gynecological surgery were identified to be prognostically favorable. For OS after the first cancer-related surgery, only the resection of primary tumor and absence of metastatic residuals {{were found to be}} favorable prognostic factors. The use of postoperative chemotherapy correlated with intraoperative <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>use</b> of chemotherapy, but not with patients’ clinicopathological characteristics, which were not found to be associated with any factors.

A total of 21 sheep were operated using a hernia model with two fascial defects of 2 cm(2) at the linea alba. One week later two polypropylene meshes (Dynamesh(A (R))) were implanted laparoscopically, using cyanoacrylate glue (Ifabond(A (R))) or conventional fixation (Securestrap(A (R))). In {{half of the}} animals the fascial defect was closed before mesh placement. After 1 day (n = 6), 2 weeks (n = 8) and 6 months (n = 6), a second laparoscopy was performed at which hernia recurrence, mesh integration and adhesion formation were evaluated. After euthanasia, burst strength testing and histopathology were evaluated. One animal died due to intestinal incarceration. In 20 surviving animals, no hernias were diagnosed and mesh placement was satisfying. Adhesions could hardly be observed after 1 day but were omnipresent in both groups at 2 weeks and 6 months. Burst strength testing exceeded 100 N in all samples, independent of the fixation device used. Not after 1 day, but after 2 weeks the inflammatory cell response was significantly higher in the glue group. At 6 months minor inflammation was seen, as was foreign body reaction (FBR).

To investigate the potential adverse side effects of its use in the peritoneal cavity, the effect of t-PA on colonic anastomotic wound healing and on systemic coagulation parameters was examined in the rat. T-PA did not adversely affect colonic healing five and ten days after anastomosis. In animals infected intraperitoneally {{at the time of the}} anastomosis, t-PA reversed the inhibition of healing induced by perianastomotic abscesses at five days.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionRepair of incisional hernias {{continues}} to be a challenging surgical procedure for general surgeons. Currently open mesh repair and laparoscopic repair are the two main options available for general surgeon for managing this complication. Laparoscopic repair though offers all the advantages of minimal access surgery but is a costly procedure especially due to the use of costly composite mesh. The present study is aimed to compare the open and laparoscopic repair of incisional hernia {{and at the same time}} evaluate the safety and feasibility of using comparatively cheaper polypropylene mesh. MethodsBetween December 2005 and December 2009 80 patients underwent incisional hernia repair, 40 open repairs and 40 laparoscopic repair. The results of the two procedures were compared with a mean follow up of 26 months for open repair and 28 months for laparoscopic repair. ResultsObstetrical or gynecological procedure was the most common index surgery leading to incisional hernia and lower midline incision was the most common site of hernia. The mean defect size in open repair group was 55. 2 cm 2 and 62. 2 cm 2 in laparoscopic repair group. Polypropylene mesh was used in all cases. We had 1 (2. 5 %) major complication of enterotomy and 1 (2. 5 %) conversion in laparoscopic repair group. Postoperative complications were most commonly seen in open repair group 10 (25 %) and 2 (5 %) in laparoscopic repair group. Mean hospital stay in open repair group is 4. 33 days and 1. 53 days in laparoscopic repair group. We had 1 (2. 5 %) recurrence in both groups. ConclusionLaparoscopic repair of incisional hernia is a much better procedure for curing incisional hernia as compared to open mesh repair and additionally <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>use</b> of polypropylene mesh was not associated with any significant complication...|$|E
40|$|Systemic infection, major surgery, {{trauma and}} many other causes can lead to {{impaired}} organ function. Compensated shock is not detected by global hemodynamic and oxygen measurements, as they take no account for regional variations. Focus has therefore gradually turned from looking at systemic changes to selective investigations of regional blood flow and ischemia. This thesis presents a series of experiments evaluating new application and validation of various monitoring techniques. An experimental porcine model with anesthetized and invasively monitored animals was used. The circulatory interventions included endotoxin infusion (septic shock), aortic constriction and selective clamping of splanchnic arteries. The aim was to compare air with saline tonometry, to validate the <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>use</b> of tonometry and to reexamine the use of endoluminal reflectance pulse oxymetry. To investigate the relative contributions of regional blood flow and detection of ischemia, measurements of hepatic venous oxygen saturation (ShvO 2), lactate concentrations and PCO 2 gap were used. Our findings {{support the use of}} air instead of saline as the preferred technique for tonometric measurements. With the intraperitoneal application of tonometry we gain more information on regional aspects of the splanchnic circulation, and {{it appears to be a}} reliable monitoring option for early detection of ischemia in the small intestine. Measurements of ShvO 2 will give an overall reflection of the intestinal circulation. The sigmoid colonic pulse oximetry showed a non-linear response in relation to regional blood flow, and will therefore not be able to detect gradual changes in oxygen saturation. Determination of the regional to endtidal PCO 2 gap might prove valuable for monitoring of the intestinal circulation. Because of sophisticated interactions between portal and hepatic arterial blood flow and hepatic compensation for regional ischemia, a combination of monitoring techniques might be needed. The results of this study will hopefully encourage clinical evaluation of intraperitoneal tonometry and endtidal PCO 2 gap recordings for non-invasive, semi-continuous, trend monitoring of the splanchnic circulation...|$|E

We {{would like to take}} this opportunity to report some preliminary results regarding our clinical experience with intraperitoneal Teicoplanin treatment in CAPD peritonitis. Based on Teicoplanin pharmacokinetics data (2), three CAPD patients with gram-positive bacterial peritonitis were treated by intermittent intraperitoneal administration, in accordance with both our and others (3) clinical experience regarding the intermit-tent <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>use</b> of vancomycin in CAPD peritonitis. On every fourth day, 400 mg of Teicoplanin were added to fresh dialysate prior to a 12 -h dwell time, followed by standard CAPD exchanges. Teicoplanin concentrations were determined twice a day in both serum and dialysate, applying a chromatographic method (3). All investigated patients conserved a residual diuresis and a creatinine clearance of < 2 mL/min/l. 73 m 2. After the first 12 -h exchange, the amount of Teicoplanin recovered from the effluent peritoneal fluid was 74. 7 &plusmn; 19. 2 mg., and the calculated bioavailability was 0. 81. Teicoplanin concentration in effluent dialysate after 24 and 36 h was respectively 13. 23 &plusmn; 6. 7 and 3. 8 &plusmn; 1. 1; after 48 hours Teicoplanin was undetectable in all effluent dialysate samples. Teicoplanin serum concentration dropped from 8. 3 &plusmn; 2. 9 mg/L three hours after starting Teicoplanin administration, to 4. 4 &plusmn; 1. 8 mg/L and 3. 3 &plusmn; 1. 1 mg/L respectively after 24 and 48 h. N one of the treated patients ever showed definitive resolution of the clinical signs during Teicoplanin therapy. Moreover, peritoneal effluent dialysate cultures remained positive and leukocyte count showed only a slight decrease. Following the third administration in the first patient and the second administration in the other two patients, Teicoplanin was discontinued and successfully replaced by vancomycin using the same intraperitoneal route. In conclusion, unlike vancomycin, Teicoplanin was ineffective in the treatment of CAPD patients using an intermittent intraperitoneal schedule.

Entretanto, isto não ocorreu com a cepa Bolívia, pois os animais apresentaram o mesmo padrão de parasitemia e os demais caracteres morfológicos, quer se utilizasse a via subcutânea ou intraperitoneal.

By {{means of}} comparative {{studies of the}} infection of mice with T. cruzi <b>using</b> <b>intraperitoneal</b> and subcutaneous inoculation, {{it was concluded that}} more uniform and virulent infections are obtained after subcutaneous inoculation.

The results revealed that after subcutaneous inoculation when the Y strain was used in the tests, some significant differences appear, with more virulent and uniform infections. However, these did not appear when the Bolivia strain was used, because the animals showed the same standard parasitemy and other morpho-biological features, whether by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal inoculation.

40|$|The {{peripheral}} {{effect of}} the ‘opioid-like' peptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) on joint blood flow was investigated in acutely inflamed rats. Sensory neuropeptide release from capsaicin-sensitive nerves and the involvement of synovial mast cells and leukocytes on these vasomotor responses were also studied. Blood flow measurements of exposed knee joints were performed in urethane-anaesthetised rats (2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 <b>intraperitoneal)</b> <b>using</b> laser Doppler perfusion imaging. Topical administration of N/OFQ (10 − 13 – 10 − 8 [*]mol) to acutely inflamed joints caused a dose-dependent increase in synovial perfusion with an ED 50 of 4. 0 × 10 − 10 [*]mol. This vasodilatatory response was blocked by the selective NOP receptor antagonist [Phe 1 -(CH 2 -NH) -Gly 2]-Nociceptin(1 – 13) -NH 2 (10 − 9 [*]mol) (P< 0. 0001). Co-administration of N/OFQ with the neurokinin- 1 (NK 1) receptor antagonist [D-Arg 1,D-Phe 5,D-Trp 7, 9,Leu 11]-Substance P (10 − 12 [*]mol), the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptor antagonist VIP 6 – 28 (10 − 9 [*]mol) or the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist CGRP 8 – 37 (10 − 9 [*]mol) all blocked the hyperaemic effect of N/OFQ (P< 0. 0001). Treatment of acutely inflamed knees with capsaicin (8 -methyl-N-vanillyl- 6 -noneamide) to destroy unmyelinated joint afferents also inhibited N/OFQ vasomotor activity. Stabilisation of synovial mast cells with disodium cromoglycate (cromolyn) ameliorated N/OFQ responses, whereas inactivation of circulating leukocytes with the pan-selectin inhibitor fucoidin completely blocked N/OFQ-induced hyperaemia in these joints. These experiments show that in acutely inflamed knee joints, N/OFQ acts on NOP receptors located on synovial mast cells and leukocytes leading to the secondary release of proinflammatory mediators into the joint. These agents subsequently stimulate sensory neuropeptide release from capsaicin-sensitive nerves culminating in vasodilatation and increased articular blood flow...|$|R

Consequently, the results of this study suggest that a selective reduction in cholinergic transmission in the basal forebrain is, by itself, insufficient to account for the functional impairments observed in spatial learning in the rat. These data do not support the use of 192 -lgG saporin as a viable approach to the elucidation of the neuropathological mechanisms that are associated with the cognitive deficits seen in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s Disease...|$|R
40|$|A 75 -year-old man {{developed}} an incisional hernia over the upper abdomen following a wedge resection of a gastric stromal tumour in 1996. This {{is the first}} published report of a successful repair of an incisional hernia via a laparoscopic <b>intraperitoneal</b> on-lay technique <b>using</b> GORE-TEX DualMesh material in Hong Kong. Compared with conventional open repair of incisional hernia, long incisions and wound tension are avoided using the laparoscopic approach. This translates into a reduced risk of wound-related complications and facilitates recovery. In selected cases, minimally invasive surgery is a safe technique for the repair of incisional hernias. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Similar significant results were obtained when killed-spore preparations were used. Microsporidial gill disease (MGDS) of salmon (Loma salmo-nae) {{is a leading}} cause of mortality in farmed Pacific salmon in Canada (1). During the disease, large spore-filled xenomas (cysts with contributions from host and parasitic cells) develop within the gills; when the xenomas rupture, they evoke a severe inflammatory response in the gills which can lead to death (1). Previous work has demonstrated a strong protective immune re-sponse in those fish which recover from initial infection (1); the prophylactic efficacy of an nonadjuvanted whole-spore vaccine based on a low-virulence strain of Loma salmonae has also been demonstrated, with vaccinated fish developing up to 93 % fewer gill lesions than control fish following experimental challengewith virulent L. salmonae (2).

40|$|ABSTRACT Peganum harmala seed {{extracts}} {{have been}} frequently reported to possess antibacterial potential through in vitro studies, but in vivo studies have acquired less attention. The {{present study was}} therefore designed to investigate its efficacy on the course of colibacillosis and effects of long-term feeding on selected parameters of general health in chickens. Two experiments were con-ducted in this regard. Experiment 1 (a pilot study) was performed to determine the dose of a field strain of Esche-richia coli (O 1 :K 1) required to induce clinical symptoms in 4 - and 15 -d-old specific-pathogen-free chickens. A suc-cessful induction of colibacillosis, in terms of clinical signs, mortality, and pathological lesions in addition to reisolation of the pathogen was observed by inoculating 4 - and 15 -d-old chicks with 4. 3 log 10 and 6. 4 log 10 cfu of E. coli, respectively, by <b>intraperitoneal</b> injection. <b>Using</b> these doses experiment 2 (main study) consisting of a single experiment with 3 parts was performed. Parts A and B generated the information regarding efficacy o...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis plays {{critical}} role in diabetic cardiomyopathy and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is one of intrinsic apoptosis pathways. For previous {{studies have shown that}} endoplasmic reticulum become swell in diabetic myocardium and ERS was involved in diabetes mellitus and heart failure, this study aimed to demonstrate whether ERS was induced in myocardium of streptozocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats. We established type 1 diabetic rat model with STZ <b>intraperitoneal</b> injection, <b>used</b> echocardiographic evaluation, hematoxylin-eosin staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated DNA nick-end labeling staining to identify the existence of diabetic cardiomyopathy and enhanced apoptosis in the diabetic heart. We performed immunohistochemistry, Western blot and real time PCR to analysis two hallmarks of ERS, glucose regulated protein 78 (Grp 78) and Caspase 12. We found both Grp 78 and Caspase 12 had enhanced expression in protein and mRNA levels in diabetic myocardium than normal rat’s, and Caspase 12 was activated in diabetic heart. Those results suggested that ERS was induced in STZ-induced diabetic rats’ myocardium, and ERS-associated apoptosis took part in the pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasmosis {{drugs have}} the longest history {{and are still}} the first choice for most conditions. Alternative drugs such as Co-trimoxazole and Tetracycline have been tried and {{acclaimed}} successful. The lack of general acceptance, however, {{is an indication that}} the results are not very convincing. A wide range of antibiotics is urgently needed for patients with drug reaction or resistance problems. The anti-toxoplasmic activity of water and ethanol extracts as well as the oil of some home spices (Piper nigrum, Capsicum frutescens, Cinnamomum cassia and Curcuma longa), were evaluated in murine models of <b>intraperitoneal</b> infection <b>using</b> the RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii. Female mice were infected with 2 × 102 tachyzoites/ml, and then treated intraperitoneally with the home spices at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day for seven days. The tested extracts reduced the mean number of tachyzoites present in the peritoneal fluid of the experimental mice. The most effective extract was Curcuma longa ethanol extract which showed a 98. 6 % and 99. 2 % inhibition of the growth of Toxoplasma tachyzoites in 100 and 200 doses respectively compared to the control infected untreated mice...|$|R
