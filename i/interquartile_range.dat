All data are presented as medians and 25 to 75 <b>interquartile</b> <b>ranges.</b> We performed trend estimations of different perfusion and microcirculatory variables computing the average ranks for each variable using Pearson's correlation coefficient as described by Cuzick [24]. We also performed a normalization procedure for lactate, P(cv-a)CO 2, and CRT values to rescaling {{them in order to}} allow comparison of these parameters' relative changes in specific time periods. For each variable, the highest normal value was taken, and each individual value was divided by it. Hence, medians and <b>interquartile</b> <b>ranges</b> were plotted. Fractional polynomials analyses were done to model realistic fitting curves for each parameter trend. All reported p values are two-sided, with a significant alpha level at 5 %. SPSS 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and Stata 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) statistical packages were used for analyses.|$|R
