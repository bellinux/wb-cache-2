5|$|For {{believe me}} gentlemen, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> this {{question}} {{so important that}} in the same moment I get the definite answer {{that it is not}} embraced by the Swedish Riksdag, I will no longer stay in this place.|$|E
5|$|I {{am not a}} man who can {{be driven}} or drummed by threats or abuse into an {{attitude}} of justification. But <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> it due to my honour as a loyal British subject and my personal dignity as a man to retire all my public positions.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>consider</b> {{him to be}} one of my {{best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to {{communicate}} through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E

5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{collaboration}} {{with one of}} my friends from the international music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is very particular. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{objects are}} conceptually {{imported}} {{into the situation}} as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.|$|E
40|$|From the {{symmetry}} between definitions of {{left and right}} divisors in associative D-algebra A, the possibility to define quotient as A⊗ A-number follows.

25|$|To put {{artifacts}} {{in their proper}} context <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> it most important {{to pay attention to}} the chronological sequence, and I believe that the old idea of first stone, then copper, and finally iron, appears to be ever more firmly established as far as Scandinavia is concerned.|$|E

25|$|In {{a letter}} to the campus that next month, {{university}} President David O'Connell wrote: <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> any pro-choice advocacy—whether deliberate or accidental, whether presented under the guise of academic freedom or right to free speech—as incompatible with that fidelity and not worthy of The Catholic University of America.|$|E
25|$|I {{approach}} {{the presentation of}} Kierkegaard with some trepidation. Next to Nietzsche, or rather, prior to Nietzsche, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> {{him to be the}} most important thinker of our post-Kantian age. With Goethe and Hegel, an epoch had reached its conclusion, and our prevalent way of thinking – that is, the positivistic, natural-scientific one – cannot really be considered as philosophy.|$|E
25|$|I didn't {{have the}} luxury - and <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> it a luxury - of being a protester because my focus was {{concentrated}} on getting information. I knew I wasn't {{going to be in}} that position for very long. I wanted to participate in gathering whatever information I could in the time I had, and I wanted to bring it all together, really to see what would happen. I needed time to work by myself.|$|E

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>considered</b> our (British) cavalry so {{inferior}} to the French from the want of order, that although <b>I</b> <b>considered</b> one squadron a match for two French, I didn't like to see four British opposed to four French: and as the numbers increased and order, of course, became more necessary I was the more unwilling to risk our men without having a superiority in numbers.|$|R
25|$|From {{beyond the}} boundary, it is {{difficult}} to gauge Snow's pace as Lindsay Hassett conceded. He appears to bowl his bumper appreciably faster than most of his fuller-length deliveries, but I do not believe even his faster bumper knocks {{at the door of the}} pace of bowlers I have named. His top pace, <b>I</b> <b>consider,</b> lies somewhere between that of Statham and Trueman...Snow's loping, almost lazy run, of course, is sinisterly deceptive. It is in that last stride, or last two strides, when that long, straight powerful arm gathers its impetus and either whips or coasts through, that the potential is born.|$|E
25|$|A {{movement}} <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> dangerous (despite {{the great}} sympathy I have for its perpetrators) is taking shape among a small clan of youngsters. A chapel has been established, two haughty priests officiating. MM Derain and Matisse; {{a few dozen}} innocent catechumens have received their baptism. Their dogma amounts to a wavering schematicism that proscribes modeling and volumes {{in the name of}} I-don't-know-what pictorial abstraction. This new religion hardly appeals to me. I don't believe in this Renaissance... M. Matisse, fauve-in-chief; M. Derain, fauve deputy; MM. Othon Friesz and Dufy, fauves in attendance... and M. Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907).|$|E
25|$|I don't hate Islam. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> it a {{backward}} culture. I have travelled {{much in the}} world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E
