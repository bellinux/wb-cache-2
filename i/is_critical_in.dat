5|$|Education of {{families}} <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses; helping {{the family to}} cope improves outcomes in children. Prognosis may be improved by diagnosis {{at a younger age}} that allows for early interventions, while interventions in adulthood are valuable but less beneficial. There are legal implications for individuals with AS as they run the risk of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend the societal implications of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Mark McNeilly {{writes in}} Sun Tzu and the Art of Modern Warfare that a modern {{interpretation}} of Sun and his importance throughout Chinese history <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> understanding China's push {{to becoming a}} superpower in the twenty-first century. Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategic lessons and The Art of War in developing their theories, seeing a direct relationship between their modern struggles and those of China in Sun Tzu's time. There is a great perceived value in Sun Tzu's teachings and other traditional Chinese writers, which are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.|$|E
25|$|The antireligious {{propaganda}} <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> {{order to}} demonize active believers and foster a mindset of hostility against them as 'vermin' or 'scum', {{and it was}} in some ways similar to the contemporary anti-Semitic propaganda of Nazi Germany. Creating this mindset <b>was</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> order to make the public accept the campaign.|$|R

5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently {{has the advantage}} of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E
5|$|The uptake of {{nutrient}} {{and water}} by the cluster roots peaks through winter and spring, but ceases when the upper layer of soil dries out in summer. The cluster roots are then allowed to die, but the laterals are protected from desiccation by a continuous {{supply of water}} from the sinker root. The water supplied to the laterals by the sinker root is continually lost to the soil; thus this plant facilitates the movement of ground water from the water table into surface soil, a process known as hydraulic redistribution. Cluster roots have been estimated as comprising about 30% of total root biomass in this species; the seasonal production of so much biomass, only for it to be lost {{at the end of the}} growing season, represents a substantial investment by the plant, but one that <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> the competition for nutrients.|$|E
5|$|While {{progressing}} {{through the}} game, the player can {{take control of}} three different characters: Juno, Vela, and Lupus. Each character has a special ability {{that allows them to}} uncover areas which the other characters cannot reach. Juno can walk through magma safely, Vela can swim underwater indefinitely, and Lupus can hover {{for a short period of}} time. Therefore, choosing the right character for the right stage <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> order to complete the game. Initially, the game forces the player to use the three characters individually until they reach a meeting point. Once they reach the meeting point, all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order. The overall objective of the game is to explore all the galaxy to collect several starship parts and save a large number of survivors. The player can then use a starship and travel to the final stage.|$|E

25|$|Ozone {{destruction}} occurs principally in polar regions, but {{the formation}} of ozone occurs principally in the tropics.

25|$|Such data <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> {{determining}} {{the effect of}} alloy constituents in a bulk material, identification of solid-state reaction features, such as solid phase precipitates. Such information may not be amenable to analysis by other means (e.g. TEM) owing to the difficulty in generating a three-dimensional dataset with composition.|$|E
25|$|While the XOR metric is {{not needed}} to {{understand}} Kademlia, it <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> {{the analysis of the}} protocol. The XOR arithmetic forms an abelian group allowing closed analysis.

Using groups of bits as routing information also simplifies the algorithms.|$|E

25|$|Proper shoeing <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> the {{management}} of a horse with bone spavin. Shoes most helpful for these horses include shoes that assist in breakover (like a square or rolled toe, or shoes with wedge pads).

Drenching, shearing or crutching are some basic procedures that can be done. Crutching is the trimming of excess wool from the breech area, and the timing of both shearing and crutching <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> {{reducing the amount of}} flystrike.|$|E
25|$|In most {{passenger}} vehicles where manually adjustable head restraints are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, {{the height of}} the head restraint <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes.|$|E
25|$|Lower leg {{and foot}} pain {{management}} <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> reducing {{the progression of}} further injuries, uncomfortable sensations and limiting alterations while walking and running. Most individuals suffer from various pains in their {{lower leg and foot}} due to different factors. Muscle inflammation, strain, tenderness, swelling and muscle tear from muscle overuse or incorrect movement are several conditions often experienced by athletes and the common public during and after high impact physical activities. Therefore, suggested pain management mechanisms are provided to reduce pain and prevent the progression of injury.|$|E
