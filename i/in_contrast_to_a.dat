5|$|One of {{the first}} modern {{histories}} of the Arab nation <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> history of an individual Arab country was composed by Darwaza in the late 1920s under the title Lessons of Arab History: From Antiquity to Present Times. In the book, Darwaza begins by describing {{the origins of the}} Semitic peoples, the rise of Islam, the end of Arab rule in the Middle East by Turkic groups, and the foreign rule over the Arabs by Western powers. The book was intended {{to be used as a}} textbook in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later Iraq, hence its simplified and direct language. Nonetheless, it played a pioneering role in the development of pan-Arabism.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} also projected {{an impact}} {{on the future of the}} community; 22,000 people were projected to leave the region with 9,900 direct and indirect jobs affected, and a loss of over $92 million of regional income. This was <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> regional population of over 49,100, available jobs of 33,320, and an annual income of $755 million. The net savings by the end of 1997 from closing the base was $182 million, or about $61.8 million annually.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclination}} {{distribution of}} Jupiter-family (or ecliptic) comets would become broader {{under the influence}} of Planet Nine. Jupiter-family comets originate primarily from the scattering objects, trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes that vary over time due to distant encounters with Neptune. In a model including Planet Nine, the scattering objects that reach large semi-major axes dynamically interact with Planet Nine, increasing their inclinations. As a result, the population of the scattering objects, and the population of comets derived from it, is left with a broader inclination distribution. This inclination distribution is broader than is observed, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> five-planet Nice model without a Planet Nine that can closely match the observed inclination distribution.|$|E
50|$|A finite wing is an {{aerodynamic}} wing with {{tips that}} result in trailing vortices. This is <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> infinite wing.|$|R
50|$|An inelastic {{collision}}, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> elastic collision, is {{a collision}} in which kinetic energy is not conserved {{due to the}} action of internal friction.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> anacrotic or bisferiens pulse, the 2 {{peaks in}} a dicrotic pulse occur in systole and {{diastole}} (as opposed to both occurring in systole).|$|R
5|$|Also present {{were such}} {{distinct}} companions as Sa'id ibn Zayd, Fadl ibn Abbas, Abdul-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr (the son of Abu Bakr), Abdullah ibn Umar (the son of Umar), Aban ibn Uthman (the son of Uthman), Abdulreman ibn Khalid (the son of Khalid), Abdullah ibn Ja'far (the nephew of Ali), Ammar ibn Yasir, Miqdad ibn Aswad, Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, Malik al-Ashtar, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, Qays ibn Sa'd, Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, Ubada ibn as-Samit, Hisham ibn al-A'as, Abu Huraira and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl. As {{this was a}} citizen army <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mercenary one, {{the age of the}} soldiers ranged from 20 (in the case of Khalid's son) to 70 years old (in the case of Ammar). Three of the ten companions promised paradise by Muhammad, namely Sa'id, Zubayr and Abu Ubaidah, were present at Yarmouk.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the New York City Department of City Planning {{projected}} that Manhattan's population will increase by 289,000 people between 2000 and 2030, {{an increase of}} 18.8% over the period, second only to Staten Island, {{while the rest of}} the city is projected to grow by 12.7% over the same period. The school-age population was expected to grow 4.4% by 2030, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small decline in the city as a whole. The elderly population was forecast to grow by 57.9%, with the borough adding 108,000 persons ages 65 and over, compared to 44.2% growth citywide. However, these 2006 projections may have become outdated, as Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom, well above the overall birth rate in Manhattan, with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001. The Financial District alone has witnessed growth in its population to approximately 43,000 , nearly double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census. The southern tip of Manhattan became the fastest growing part of New York City between 1990 and 2014.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gas, the {{pressure}} and the density are provided by separate species, {{the pressure}} by the electrons and the density by the ions. The two are coupled through a fluctuating electric field.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{traditional}} bladed propeller, the Virginia class uses pump-jet propulsors (built by BAE Systems), {{originally developed}} for the Royal Navy's s. The propulsor significantly reduces the risks of cavitation, and allows quieter operation.|$|E
50|$|Flaccid {{paralysis}} can {{be associated}} with a lower motor neuron lesion. This is <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> upper motor neuron lesion, which often presents with spasticity, although early on this may present with flaccid paralysis.|$|R
50|$|A {{symmetric}} or balanced fault affects each of {{the three}} phases equally. In transmission line faults, roughly 5% are symmetric. This is <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> asymmetrical fault, where the three phases are not affected equally.|$|R

25|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, a false vacuum is a vacuum that exists {{at a local}} minimum of energy and is {{therefore}} not truly stable. This is <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> true vacuum, which exists at a global minimum and is stable. A false vacuum may be very long-lived, or metastable.|$|E
25|$|A pentatonic {{scale is}} a musical scale or mode with five notes per octave <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> heptatonic (seven-note) scale {{such as the}} major scale and minor scale. Pentatonic scales are very common and are found all over the world. They are divided into those with semitones (hemitonic) and those without (anhemitonic).|$|E
25|$|Inverted OLED: <b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{conventional}} OLED, {{in which}} the anode {{is placed on the}} substrate, an Inverted OLED uses a bottom cathode that can be connected to the drain end of an n-channel TFT especially for the low cost amorphous silicon TFT backplane useful in the manufacturing of AMOLED displays.|$|E
50|$|In England, a {{civil parish}} is a {{territorial}} designation {{which is the}} lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority.

30|$|In particular, last year's mean gross {{weekly pay}} is {{available}} for only 58 dependently self-employed workers. However, they earned £ 437 (SD 320) on average, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> average of £ 348 (SD 303) for the 22, 219 other workers.|$|R
25|$|On March 19, 2010, the FDA issued another {{statement}} regarding simvastatin, {{saying it}} {{increases the risk of}} muscle injury (myopathy) when taken at high doses or at lower doses in combination with other drugs. The highest dose rate causes muscle damage in 610 of every 10,000 people <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lower dose, which causes muscle damage in eight of 10,000 people.|$|E
25|$|When {{considering}} equations, the indeterminates (variables) of polynomials {{are also}} called unknowns, and the solutions are the possible {{values of the}} unknowns for which the equality is true (in general more than one solution may exist). A polynomial equation stands <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> polynomial identity like , where both expressions represent the same polynomial in different forms, {{and as a consequence}} any evaluation of both members gives a valid equality.|$|E
25|$|A {{varistor}} is {{an electronic}} component with an electrical resistance that {{varies with the}} applied voltage. Also known as a voltage-dependent resistor (VDR), it has a nonlinear, non-ohmic current–voltage characteristic {{that is similar to}} that of a diode. <b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> diode however, it has the same characteristic for both directions of traversing current. At low voltage it has a high electrical resistance which decreases as the voltage is raised.|$|E
50|$|The Sartrean {{claim is}} best {{understood}} <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> established principle of metaphysics that essence precedes existence, i.e. a typical claim for this traditional thesis {{would be that}} man is essentially selfish, or {{that he is a}} rational being.|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attire so {{whimsical}} and uncommon, however, a pair {{of small}} and richly-mounted pistols were at the stranger's girdle; and the haft, of a curiously-carved Asiatic dagger was seen projecting, rather ostentatiously, from between {{the folds of the}} upper garment.|$|R
50|$|One major {{characteristic}} used <b>to</b> identify <b>a</b> {{lower motor}} neuron lesion is flaccid paralysis - paralysis accompanied by loss of muscle tone. This is <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> upper motor neuron lesion, which often presents with spastic paralysis - paralysis accompanied by severe hypertonia.|$|R
25|$|Freight trains that {{consist of}} {{isolated}} cars {{must be made}} into trains and divided according to their destinations. Thus the cars must be shunted several times along their route <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> unit train, which carries, for example, cars from the plant to a port, or coal from a mine to the power plant. This shunting is done partly at the starting and final destinations and partly (for long-distance-hauling) in classification yards.|$|E
25|$|Written {{just after}} or {{possibly}} contemporarily with Adomnán's Vita Sancti Columbae ("Life of Saint Columba"), the Anonymous Life {{is the first}} piece of Northumbrian Latin writing and the earliest piece of English Latin hagiography. This is an honour sometimes given to the anonymous Vita of Gregory the Great written at Whitby, though the date of 710 attributed to the latter by historian R. C. Love (<b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> date between 680 and 704) makes it later than the Anonymous Life of Cuthbert.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930 gubernatorial election, George W. Joseph—who {{had been}} disbarred during an {{extensive}} {{dispute with the}} Oregon Supreme Court over the will and estate of E. Henry Wemme—won the Republican nomination for Governor of Oregon, but died shortly after. When Meier declined the nomination, the Republican Party selected Phil Metschan, Jr., son of a former Oregon state treasurer, as a replacement nominee. <b>In</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> core element of Joseph's platform, Metschan opposed public development of hydroelectric power along the Columbia River.|$|E
