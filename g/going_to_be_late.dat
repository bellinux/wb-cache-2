50|$|Prevalence of Violence: Last Stop 174 {{shows how}} common {{violence}} in Brazil is, {{and how it}} <b>is</b> not contained <b>to</b> the favelas. One instance of this is when Sandro and his friend hold up {{a woman who has}} her window open in a traffic jam. She gives Sandro what he asks for, but him and his friend shoot her anyhow, in front of a number of cars and no one does anything about it. Furthermore, when Sandro holds up the bus, the lipstick woman casually calls her boss, explaining that she’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> slightly <b>late</b> <b>to</b> work because she’s “just getting mugged.” Her action of casually making a call displays how desensitized Brazilians have become to everyday violence.|$|R

6000|$|Ten o'clock struck {{upon the}} clock on the mantelpiece--half-past ten--eleven. Sir Thomas {{stretched}} his legs, yawned, and muttered audibly, [...] "Confounded slow, really." [...] Half-past eleven. Sir Thomas went over noiselessly to the side table, where the decanters were standing, and helped himself to a brandy and seltzer, squeezing down the cork of the bottle carefully with his thumb, to prevent its popping, till all the gas had escaped piecemeal. Then he crept back, still noiselessly, feeling more like a convicted thief himself than a Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and wondering when the deuce this pilfering lock-breaker <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> begin his nightly depredations. Not till after Harry came back most likely. The thief, whoever he or she was, would probably <b>be</b> afraid <b>to</b> venture into the library while there was still a chance of Harry returning unexpectedly and disturbing the whole procedure. But when once Harry had gone to bed, they would all have heard from Morton that Sir Thomas <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> out <b>late,</b> and the thief would then doubtless seize so good an opportunity of helping himself unperceived to the counted sovereigns.|$|R

60|$|For {{this reason}} I have {{deliberately}} called {{a halt in}} his dramatic career, in order to consider these two essential points: What did the mass of Englishmen, who had now learnt to admire him, imagine {{his point of view}} <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> and second, What did he imagine it <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> or, if the phrase be premature, What did he imagine it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> In his <b>latest</b> work, especially in Man and Superman, Shaw has become a complete and colossal mystic. That mysticism does grow quite rationally out of his older arguments; but very few people ever troubled to trace the connection. In order to do so it <b>is</b> necessary <b>to</b> say what <b>was,</b> {{at the time of his}} first success, the public impression of Shaw's philosophy.|$|R

Djinn/Jean asks the narrator to join her social cause, and as proof of his fidelity, she asks him to meet someone at the Parisian train station, the Gare du Nord.

5000|$|John is a loyal {{companion}} and, {{in spite}} of his idiosyncrasies, surprisingly moral and upstanding. John also promised to follow through with the last wishes of the two hostages who didn't make it back from Vegas, spreading the rumors of Fred Chu's ghost haunting the city, and keeping an eye on Amy for Jim. Later, when Amy is uncomfortable about digging into her brother's old stuff for information, John said something wildly inappropriate to make her laugh, making Dave remember why he [...] "keeps John around". By the third act, John and Dave both feel that even though their mission is doomed from the start, they had better try. John's enthusiasm when saying [...] "Let's go, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>late</b> for certain death," [...] shows they knowingly walking into ridiculously bad odds. John is pivotal in helping resolve Dave's identity crisis, recruiting Amy to protect Dave from himself, and keeping the situation light and humorous to reduce the need for negative consequences.|$|E
