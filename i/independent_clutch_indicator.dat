50|$|One {{method of}} {{drastically}} reducing shift time {{is to use}} a direct-shift gearbox which has two <b>independent</b> <b>clutches</b> that predict the next gear change making the shift time very small. Using a freewheel may reduce shift time as it may not be necessary to use the clutch. A shift kit is also intended to reduce the shift time of a manual vehicle.In simple terms, a DSG is two separate manual gearboxes (and clutches), contained within one housing, and working as one unit.It was designed by BorgWarner,and was initially licensed to the Volkswagen Group, with support by IAV GmbH.needed By using two <b>independent</b> <b>clutches,</b> a DSG can achieve faster shift times (8ms), and eliminates the torque converter of a conventional epicyclic automatic transmission.|$|R

50|$|The unit {{itself is}} {{designed}} to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two <b>independent</b> <b>clutches</b> like tooth or dog clutches which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving.

40|$|Purpose: Manufacturers of {{uncoupled}} cycling cranks {{claim that}} their use will increase economy of motion and gross efficiency. Purportedly, this occurs by altering the muscle-recruitment patterns {{contributing to the}} resistive forces occurring during the recovery phase of the pedal stroke. Uncoupled cranks use an <b>independent</b> <b>clutch</b> design by which each leg cycles independently of the other (ie, the cranks are not fixed together). However, research examining the efficacy of training with uncoupled cranks is equivocal. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of short-term training with uncoupled cranks on the performance-related variables economy of motion, gross efficiency, maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max), and muscle-activation patterns. Methods: Sixteen trained cyclists were matched-paired into either an uncoupled-crank or a normal-crank training group. Both groups performed 5 wk of training on their assigned cranks. Before and after training, participants completed a graded exercise test using normal cranks. Expired gases were collected to determine economy of motion, gross efficiency, and VO 2 max, while integrated electromyography (iEMG) was used to examine muscle-activation patterns of the vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, and gastrocnemius. Results: No significant changes between groups were observed for economy of motion, gross efficiency, VO 2 max, or iEMG in the uncoupled- or normal-crank group. Conclusions: Five weeks of training with uncoupled cycling cranks had no effect on economy of motion, gross efficiency, muscle recruitment, or VO 2 max compared with training on normal cranks...|$|R
40|$|The condition-dependent {{model of}} optimal clutch size assumes body {{reserves}} required to initiate egg production include those for subsequent breeding phases. The threshold {{is expected to}} be similar among individuals, and hence postlaying condition should be <b>independent</b> of <b>clutch</b> size and lay date. Alternatively, the cost of incubation hypothesis predicts that females laying larger clutches should secure extra resources for incubation, and the expected fitness hypothesis suggests females adjust their condition according to the anticipated fitness benefits of the clutch. In these 2 cases, postlaying condition is predicted to be positively related to clutch size. We tested these predictions in common eider (Somateria mollissima), a precocial bird that produce eggs mostly from stored lipids and partly from endogenous proteins and rely extensively on reserves to incubate. We collected females at incubation onset and measured body condition <b>indicators.</b> <b>Clutch</b> size (number of eggs laid or number found in the nest at incubation onset) was not related to postlaying fat stores but females that laid fewer eggs maintained extra protein reserves. Timing of breeding was not related to postlaying body mass or protein reserves, whereas lay date's relationship with fat stores varied annually. Our results are generally consistent with the condition-dependent model and indicate variation in postlaying condition is mostly driven by factors other than clutch size and lay date. These data are inconsistent with the cost of incubation and the expected fitness hypotheses and suggest body store differences at incubation onset are mostly caused by environmental conditions encountered by laying females.

5000|$|This {{system is}} based around a second, simple, gearbox (gears and other {{components}} built by Carraro Engineering), taking {{power from the}} front of the engine. This gearbox (designated [...] "power take off unit", or PTU) has only two forward gears (2nd and 4th) plus reverse (with gear ratios 6% taller than the corresponding ratios in the main gearbox), so the system is only active in 1st to 4th gears.

25|$|The 4RM {{system used}} in the Ferrari FF in 2011 is unique in {{that it has a}} rear {{transaxle}} with secondary front transaxle connected directly to the engine. The car operates primarily as a rear wheel drive vehicle. Clutches in the front transaxle engage when the rear wheels slip. Drive to the front wheels is transmitted through two infinitely-variable clutch packs which are allowed to 'slip' to give the required road wheel speeds. The front transaxle has three gears, two forward, and reverse. The two forward gears of the front transmission match the lower four forward gears of the rear transmission. It is not used in higher gears. The connection between this gearbox and each front wheel is via <b>independent</b> haldex-type <b>clutches,</b> without a differential.

40|$|Although {{functional}} {{explanations for}} female engagement in extra-pair copulation {{have been studied}} extensively in birds, {{little is known about}} how extra-pair paternity is linked to other fundamental aspects of avian reproduction. However, recent studies indicate that the occurrence of extra-pair offspring may generally decline with laying order, possibly because stimulation by eggs induces incubation, which may suppress female motivation to acquire extra-pair paternity. Here we tested whether experimental inhibition of incubation during the laying phase, induced by the temporary removal of eggs, resulted in increased extra-pair paternity, in concert with a later cessation of laying, in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). As expected, experimental females showed a more gradual increase in nocturnal incubation duration over the laying phase and produced larger clutches than controls. Moreover, incubation duration on the night after the first egg was laid predicted how extra-pair paternity declined with laying order, with less incubation being associated with more extra-pair offspring among the earliest eggs in the clutch. However, incubation duration on this first night was unrelated to our experimental treatment and <b>independent</b> of final <b>clutch</b> size. Consequently, the observed decline in extra-pair paternity with laying order was unaffected by our manipulation and larger clutches included proportionally fewer extra-pair offspring. We suggest that female physiological state prior to laying, associated with incubation at the onset of laying, determines motivation to acquire extra-pair paternity <b>independent</b> of final <b>clutch</b> size. This decline in proportion of extra-pair offspring with clutch size may be a general pattern within bird species. ...|$|R
40|$|During 1976, 1977, and 1978, 26, 29, and 19 nests, respectively, of the groundnesting, 2 ̆ 2 Pink-sided 2 ̆ 2 Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis mearnsi) were {{monitored}} in a sprucefir ecosystem {{in northern}} Utah. In 1976 and 1977, 4 -egg clutches, found mainly in June through mid-July, produced more young than did 3 -egg clutches, found after mid-July. In these two years, nestlings from 4 -egg clutches {{in which all}} eggs hatched gained significantly more weight than did nestlings from 3 -egg clutches. In 1978, only 5 - and 4 -egg clutches were found, and these nestlings were intermediate in weight between nestlings from the 4 - and 3 -egg clutches of the previous years but {{not significantly different from}} nestlings of either clutch size. Growth rates (K) of body weight were not significantly different among nestlings from all clutch sizes, so that the rate of weight gain seems <b>independent</b> of <b>clutch</b> size in the Pink-sided Junco. Final tarsal length upon leaving the nest also did not differ significantly among clutch sizes, but the rate of tarsal growth did. The length of tarsi was <b>independent</b> of <b>clutch</b> size, and the length upon leaving the nest was equal to that of adult juncos. We interpret this as support for the adaptive-growth hypothesis, as tarsal length should have high functional importance in passerines that run rather than fly from the nest. Populations of major food items and potential nest predators were monitored. Although climatic conditions varied dramatically during the three seasons we studied these juncos, the dry biomass of food items in junco diets peaked 1 week after the mean hatching date of 4 -egg clutches in all three years. We suspect that nestlings from late 3 -egg clutches experienced reduced food availability, which explains the difference in weight between nestlings from 3 - and 4 -egg clutches. Total rodent predation pressure remained at or above 10 individuals/ha, although populations of the species involved fluctuated between years. Increased predation was noted in 1977, when weasel populations were unusually high. Latespring snowstorms and late-summer thunderstorms also probably influence nesting success. We hypothesize that predation pressure and short periods of both food abundance and favorable weather influence the initiation of breeding, clutch size, and nestling-growth patterns and lead to a decline in clutch size as the breeding season progresses...|$|R

40|$|Clutch size of {{the gall}} wasp Diplolepis rosae was studied in galls on Rosa spp. in Eastern Hungary and Romania, Transylvania on four dry pastures. We {{hypothesised}} {{that there was an}} optimal clutch size, and it was controlled by the emerging rate of the gall inducer and the escaping failure of hatched adults. The most frequent clutch size was 25 - 30 chambers, and there was a second peak around 60 chambers in each frequency distribution. The most common clutch size did not produce the highest proportion of larval emergence to adulthood. Parasitism rate decreased with increasing clutch size, while the proportion of emerged gall wasps increased and the proportion of dead individuals remained constant.

40|$|In {{seasonally}} reproducing organisms, timing reproduction {{to match}} food availability {{is key to}} individual fitness. Ambient temperature functions as an important cue for {{the timing of the}} food peak in temperate-zone birds. After laying start, individual birds may still improve synchrony between offspring hatching and food availability by adjusting the onset of incubation to most up-to-date cues about the development of the food source. However, it is unknown whether individuals respond to changes in temperature after the onset of laying, and whether individuals adjust incubation onset <b>independent</b> of <b>clutch</b> size. Here, I show in free-living blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) that experimental heating of nestboxes in the laying phase resulted in increased duration of nocturnal incubation bouts prior to clutch completion, leading to earlier hatching of eggs and increased hatching asynchrony. Experimental heating did not affect the number of laying gaps, egg volume and clutch size, nor were any carry-over effects on offspring detected. These results are best explained as a response to increased temperature acting as a cue for an advanced food-peak, rather than a relief of energetic constraints, because improved energetic conditions would not favour more hatching asynchrony. Other benefits cannot be excluded, since increased laying-phase incubation under warmer conditions may also help maintain egg viability. This study is the first to show that temperature has a causal effect on the time between clutch completion and hatching of the first offspring, indicating that behavioural adjustment to climate change can continue after laying start...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{invasion}} of egg contents {{is a cause}} of embryonic death. To counter infection risks, the embryo is protected physically by the eggshell and chemically by antimicrobial proteins. If microbial pressure drives embryo mortality, then females may have evolved, through natural selection, to adapt their immune investment into eggs. Although frequently hypothesized, this match between immune allocation and microorganisms has not been explored yet. To examine if correlations between microbes on eggs and immunity in eggs exist, we collected eggs from red-capped larks (Calandrella cinerea) and simultaneously examined their bacterial communities and antimicrobial components [...] pH, lysozyme and ovotransferrin [...] during natural incubation. Using molecular techniques, we find that bacterial communities are highly dynamic: bacterial abundance increases from the onset to late incubation, Shannon's α-diversity index increases during early incubation stages, and β-diversity analysis shows that communities from 1 day-old clutches are phylogenetically more similar to each other than the older ones. Regarding the antimicrobials, we notice a decrease of pH and lysozyme concentration, while ovotransferrin concentration increases during incubation. Interestingly, we show that two eggs of the same clutch share equivalent immune protection, <b>independent</b> of <b>clutch</b> age. Lastly, our results provide limited evidence of significant correlation between antimicrobial compounds and bacterial communities. Our study examined simultaneously, {{for the first time}} in a wild bird, the dynamics of bacterial communities present on eggshells and of albumen-associated antimicrobial components during incubation and investigated their relationship. However, the link between microorganisms and immunity of eggs remains to be elucidated further. Identifying invading microbes and their roles in embryo mortality, as well as understanding the role of the eggshell microbiome, might be key to better understand avian strategies of immune maternal investment...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} altitudinal variation in sexual size dimorphism of a Tibetan frog Nanorana parkeri. Size dimorphism was female-biased in all populations, although this bias became less at higher altitudes {{because of a}} steeper altitudinal decrease in female size than male size. Operational sex ratios, {{an indicator of the}} opportunity for sexual selection on larger males, changed independently of altitude. <b>Clutch</b> volume, an <b>indicator</b> of the strength of fecundity selection on larger females, was positively with female size, and tended to decrease approaching high altitudes. Females lived longer and grew more slowly than males, and the mean age in both sexes increased and growth rate decreased altitudinally, although the changes were more rapid in females than males. These results suggest that, relative to males, females (i. e. the sex that typically bears greater reproductive costs and experiences stronger directional selection for larger size to take fecundity advantages) should be more sensitive to environments, attaining a larger size via enhancing growth under favourable lower-latitude conditions but a smaller size as a result of retarding growth when conditions become harsher at higher altitudes. This supports the condition-dependence hypothesis with respect to intraspecific variation in sexual size dimorphism.

40|$|Hatching {{asynchrony}} {{is widespread}} amongst animals, but no consensus has yet emerged {{as to why}} asynchronous hatching has evolved. It is generally thought to have adaptive benefits during the raising of dependent young. However, here, we considered an alternative view of hatching asynchrony in birds {{as a consequence of}} factors acting at the onset of incubation. We recorded parental nest attendance behaviour during laying using continuous records of nest temperature in herring gulls, Larus argentatus. We tested whether nest attendance during laying was related to individual factors (clutch size and diet) and whether it had consequences on fitness outcomes (hatching spread, incubation period, hatching success and chick survival). Low nest attendance was associated with small <b>clutch</b> size, and <b>independent</b> of <b>clutch</b> size, pairs on a more marine diet had lower nest attendance than pairs on a lower trophic level terrestrial diet, possibly due to higher foraging effort for marine food. Broods hatched more asynchronous where pairs had a lower nest attendance during laying or took longer to complete a clutch and where the last egg took longer to hatch. Low nest attendance was also related to shorter incubation periods, possibly representing a strategy of birds in poor condition to reduce the demand of incubation by reducing the length of incubation. We found that low nest attendance during laying and increasing hatching asynchrony had detrimental effects on hatching success for small eggs laid early in the laying sequence. Increasing hatching asynchrony also had a detrimental effect on the survival of the youngest sibling. In our study population, hatching asynchrony was influenced by a more complex set of factors than simply onset of incubation and appears to be constrained by circumstances at the onset of incubation rather than to be an adaptive strategy. Thus, factors acting both during offspring rearing and at the onset of incubation need to be considered for a better understanding of hatching asynchron...|$|R
40|$|Between April, 1981 and July, 1983, I {{collected}} 563 (211 male, 352 female) house sparrows (Passer domesticus) around London, Ontario, weighed their nutrient reserves (protein, fat, calcium) {{and determined}} their food habits, {{to see if}} nutrient reserves proximately control clutch size in this species. Daily energy demands during egg production were evaluated by analyzing changes in nutrient reserves. Captive house sparrows were studied to determine if stored fat was deposited in eggs.;The proportion {{of males and females}} that consumed high-protein foods varied with the seasonal availability of insects. Insect use was low until egg laying but then increased and remained high thereafter. Insect consumption by males and females was similar throughout breeding. The porportion of males and females that ate calciferous material was constant (low) until egg production began. Then most females, but few males, consumed claciferous materials. After laying, female consumption of calciferous materials declined and again equaled males.;Before egg production began, males used protein and fat but not calcium reserves; protein and fat reserves of females were constant but calcium was accumulated. Because the proportion of females that consumed calciferous materials did not change during prereproduction, females must have accumulated calcium through increased retention of calcium from their normal diet. After egg production began, male nutrient reserves remained constant through postreproduction. Female protein and calcium reserves declined linearly during egg production; fat reserves, however, increased while 50 % of the fat in a clutch was being allocated, and declined rapidly thereafter. The use of protein and fat reserves was <b>independent</b> of <b>clutch</b> size as all postlaying females had at least enough protein and fat to build an additional egg. Protein and calcium reserves of postlaying females remained constant but fat increased.;Maximum daily energy required for egg production was, at most, 50 % of basal metabolic rate. Fat ingested by captive house sparrows was deposited daily in the developing follicles and fat not put into follicles went to fat depots, which were used rapidly. I conclude that, although female house sparrows do use nutrient reserves during egg laying, their clutch size is not controlled thereby...|$|R
