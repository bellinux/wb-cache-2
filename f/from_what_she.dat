Historian Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted that besides being a greatly reduced figure <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had asked for recompense, it also never addressed the question of the legality of the seizure itself.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Jane Addams {{gathered}} inspiration <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> read. Fascinated by {{the early}} Christians and Tolstoy's book , she was baptized a Christian in the Cedarville Presbyterian Church, {{in the summer of}} 1886. Reading Giuseppe Mazzini's Duties of Man, she began to be inspired by the idea of democracy as a social ideal. Yet she felt confused about her role as a woman. John Stuart Mill's The Subjection of Women made her question the social pressures on a woman to marry and devote her life to family.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{artists with}} synesthesia, such as Carol Steen and Marcia Smilack (a {{photographer}} who waits until {{she gets a}} synesthetic response <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> sees and then takes the picture), use their synesthesia to create their artwork. Brandy Gale, a Canadian visual artist, experiences an involuntary joining or crossing of any of her senses – hearing, vision, taste, touch, smell and movement. Gale paints from life rather than from photographs and by exploring the sensory panorama of each locale attempts to capture, select, and transmit these personal experiences.|$|E
25|$|On a date {{already set}} for a week before she died, Catherine had {{intended}} to formally announce that Paul would be excluded from the succession, and that the crown would go to her eldest grandson, Alexander (whom she greatly favoured, and who subsequently became the emperor Alexander I in 1801). Her harshness towards Paul probably stemmed as much from political distrust as <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw of his character. Keeping Paul {{in a state of}} semi-captivity in Gatchina and Pavlovsk, she resolved not to allow her son to dispute or to share in her authority during her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|In Pride's first book, The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality, she chronicled {{her journey}} away <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> argued were feminist and anti-natal ideas of happiness, within {{which she had}} lived as an activist before her {{conversion}} to conservative evangelical Christianity in 1977. She described her discovery of happiness surrounding what she felt was the Biblically mandated role of wives and mothers as bearers of children and workers in the home {{under the authority of}} a husband. Pride argued that such a lifestyle was Biblically required of married Christian women but that most had been unknowingly duped by feminism. She meanwhile countered in the book various versions of Christian feminism.|$|E

5000|$|She did {{not appear}} until the Royal Ascot meeting in June. In the Coronation Stakes she started at 8/1 and ran on {{steadily}} in the straight to finish fourth to Kissing Cousin. In July she was made favourite for the Falmouth Stakes, then a Group Two race, at Newmarket. Piggott moved her into the lead two furlongs out and she ran on strongly to win [...] "comfortably" [...] by one and a quarter lengths. Hannon paid tribute to the filly's recuperation, saying that [...] "to come back <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> been through is unbelievable." ...|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner {{was trying}} to figure out what to do about K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> ought to be on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E
500|$|Shelley differentiates her travel {{book from}} others by {{presenting}} her material <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> describes as [...] "a political point of view". In so doing, she challenges the early nineteenth-century convention {{that it was}} improper for women to write about politics, following {{in the tradition of}} her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Lady Morgan. Shelley's aim was to arouse sympathy in England for Italian revolutionaries, such as Gatteschi. She rails against the imperial rule of Austria and France over Italy and criticises the domination of the Catholic Church. She describes the Italians as having an untapped potential for greatness and a desire for freedom.|$|E

500|$|... "My Happiness" [...] {{peaked at}} number 23 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, {{making it the}} first Powderfinger song to appear on a Billboard chart. According to Susan Groves of WHRL, part of the song's success came about because very few people knew of Powderfinger, but were drawn towards [...] "My Happiness" [...] because it was [...] "melodic, [...] pretty"—a change <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{described}} as [...] "middle of the road rock" [...] popular in the United States. Meanwhile, Australians were [...] "starting to get sick of My Happiness"—Cameron Adams argued in The Hobart Mercury that {{this was one of}} the reasons Powderfinger decided to focus on the offshore market.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} to [...] "Free Free" [...] {{was directed by}} Japanese movie maker Takashiro Akihisa. Talking to the Japanese magazine Hot Express, she commented that her idea was to convey her thoughts <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> created with the tune, into the visual; she identified that [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "cute" [...] appeal was her go-to for the visual. Originally, Suzuki crafted plans to shoot the video for [...] "Super Music Maker" [...] instead, and had given {{the details of her}} proposed layout for the set to the director and to the executives at Avex Trax. However, Nakata believed that the ideas would have portrayed better with [...] "Free Free", and advice the singer to change her mind, which she did. As Suzuki walked into the set of the video, she revealed that the entire layout was exactly what she had in mind.|$|E
500|$|The Empress {{remained}} strong-willed {{even after}} years of marriage. Pedro II revealed in a letter written to the Countess of Barral in early 1881 that: [...] "The [...] with the earrings which you mentioned, has been the cause for much recrimination {{on the part of}} someone [...] who thinks that I have been to blame for their disappearance." [...] Her son-in-law, Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, wrote a letter recounting how she had accidentally broken her arm in October 1885: [...] "On Monday 26 when crossing the library on the way to dinner with the emperor who as usual preceded her by a few steps (and with whom, I infer <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> told us, she was arguing as she sometimes does), she caught her foot in a file under a table and fell down flat face forward." [...] Nonetheless, she continued to express undiminished love for her husband.|$|E

500|$|Some critics, such as Larry Flynt's {{magazine}} Hustler and Gene Healy, {{allege that}} Dworkin endorsed incest. In the closing chapter of Woman Hating (1974), Dworkin wrote that, [...] "The parent–child relationship is primarily erotic because all human relationships are primarily erotic", and that, [...] "The incest taboo, because it denies us essential fulfillment {{with the parents}} whom we love with our primary energy, forces us to internalize those parents and constantly seek them. The incest taboo does the worst work of the culture... The destruction of the incest taboo {{is essential to the}} development of cooperative human community based on the free-flow of natural androgynous eroticism". Dworkin, however, does not explain if [...] "fulfillment" [...] is supposed to involve actual sexual intimacy, and one page earlier characterized what she meant by [...] "erotic relationships" [...] as relationships whose [...] "substance is nonverbal communication and touch", which she explicitly distinguished <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> referred to as [...] "fucking".|$|E
2500|$|Lovesong, {{her third}} last novel, is, Riemer suggests, [...] "the riskiest book she wrote".

2500|$|In Queens of Literature of the Victorian Era (1886), Eva Hope summarises Emily's {{character}} as [...] "a peculiar mixture of timidity and Spartan-like courage", {{and goes on}} to say, [...] "She was painfully shy, but physically she was brave to a surprising degree. She loved few persons, but those few with a passion of self-sacrificing tenderness and devotion.

2500|$|In the Catholic journal Commonweal, Paul Q. Kane {{writes that}} Russell has done her {{research}} on the early historic Jesuit missions and on Jesuit spirituality. He continues that she is successfully updating the stories of other important Jesuits who have sent men to distant lands or went themselves to foreign cultures to represent Christianity. [...] "Russell subtly raises concerns {{about the ways in}} which sophisticated cultures tell themselves cover stories in order to justify actions taken at a terrible cost to others". This is also reflected in the way that Sofia has to buy her freedom <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> describes as an institution of intellectual prostitution; as well as the differences between the simple Runa who live in the countryside and the Jana'ata, who are the sophisticated city dwellers that created the beautiful music which triggered the mission originally.|$|E
