5|$|Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca {{state in}} Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a {{different}} orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> over Monte Albán.|$|E
5|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. The distance from the magnetopause {{to the center of}} the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ (where RJ=71,492km is the radius of Jupiter) at the subsolar point—the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> to an observer. The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130RJ from the planet's center) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.|$|E
5|$|Europa orbits Jupiter in {{just over}} {{three and a half}} days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900km. With an {{eccentricity}} of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter's equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Like its fellow Galilean satellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang <b>directly</b> <b>overhead.</b> Europa's prime meridian is the line intersecting this point. Research suggests that the tidal locking may not be full, as a non-synchronous rotation has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior.|$|E
50|$|The {{shipyard}} has a {{fully equipped}} build hall and engineering workshop; build hall is 80 metres in length by 25 metres in height with 10.4-metre-high doors opening {{directly onto the}} slipway. Engineering shop is 50 metres in length and is <b>directly</b> adjacent. <b>Overhead</b> cranage {{is available in the}} form of one 25- and two 5-ton travelling cranes; engineering shop has similar capacities to hand.|$|R
50|$|The {{overhead}} press exercise {{which is}} used by runners can illustrate {{the concept of a}} general strength exercise. It is a common exercise in which the arms move <b>directly</b> upward <b>overhead.</b> In running, however, the arms move in a forward-backward motion in relation to the trunk. Thus, the overhead press is a good exercise for strengthening the shoulders and arms, but, even though it uses some of the same muscles that are involved in running, it is not directly related to running.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{important}} to understand what the planned actions are going to cost, as well as the ongoing [...] "management" [...] and <b>overheads</b> <b>directly</b> related to this particular asset system. Also essential from a local perspective, is optimizing the approach to providing the SoS.|$|R
5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise {{on the eastern}} horizon and set on the western horizon. North latitude is fairly easy to determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above the horizon indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he North Pole. When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is Polaris <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels south toward the equator, Polaris appears to descend toward the northern horizon. At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris is 45 degrees above the northern horizon. Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below the northern horizon.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} a city on the planet Efate. Here, as on all explorable planets in this game, the player observes the party and its {{surroundings}} from a <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> {{point of view and}} issues commands via hotkeys or clickable icons displayed onscreen. The explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions. Cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets, including a store for purchasing or selling armor, weapons and other items, a library, hospital, police station, and a starport for launching and outfitting a spaceship. Some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non-player characters are located. Building types are color-coded for easier player identification. The player directs the party's movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non-player characters, using objects or firing a weapon. Combat takes place in real-time and requires the player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons, reload, or move to a better position.|$|E
25|$|Cancer was the {{location}} of the Sun's most northerly position in the sky (the summer solstice) in ancient times, though this position now occurs in Taurus due to the precession of the equinoxes, around June 21. This is also the time that the Sun is <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> at 23.5°N, a parallel now known as the Tropic of Cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{intensity}} of UV radiation reaching {{the surface of}} the earth depends on the angle of the sun in the sky. Each day, the sun achieves its highest angle (highest intensity, shortest shadows) at solar noon, which only approximately corresponds to 12:00 on clocks or 13:00 during daylight saving time. This is because of the differences between solar time and local time in a given time zone. UV risk is high when the sun is <b>directly</b> enough <b>overhead</b> that people's shadows are shorter than their height.|$|R
30|$|Above the data-link layer, {{throughput}} [6] and QoS [15, 21] are {{the common}} indicators for AP selection. The problem of gathering high-layer indicators {{lies in the}} time latency of AP association, which has to be established before starting the measurement. In contrast to the indicators used in lower layers, such as SNR and MPD, the higher-layer AP selection indicators are not easily derived <b>directly.</b> The <b>overhead</b> of associating with the APs for obtaining the measure leads to the impracticability of higher-layer indicator measurement. Consequently, most current AP selection schemes rely on lower-layer indicators.|$|R
50|$|Although most locomotive-hauled trains take power {{directly}} from the locomotive, there have been examples (mainly in continental Europe) where restaurant cars would take power <b>directly</b> from the <b>overhead</b> wires. For example, the German restaurant cars WRmz 135 (1969), WRbumz 139 (1975) and ARmz 211 (1971) were all equipped with pantograph.|$|R
25|$|Auroras seen {{within the}} auroral oval may be <b>directly</b> <b>overhead,</b> but from farther away they {{illuminate}} the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, {{as if the}} Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs, which can be sub-visual.|$|E
25|$|Aerial landscapes {{depict a}} surface or ground from above, {{especially}} {{as seen from}} an airplane or spacecraft. (When the viewpoint is <b>directly</b> <b>overhead,</b> looking down, there is of course no depiction of a horizon or sky.) This genre can be combined with others, as in the aerial cloudscapes of Georgia O'Keeffe, the aerial moonscapes of Nancy Graves, or the aerial cityscapes of Yvonne Jacquette.|$|E
25|$|The hottest {{month is}} November, {{just before the}} onset of the main rain season. The heat index {{sometimes}} rises above , while the actual temperature is usually below , because of humidity levels that most would find uncomfortable. Because of its long dry season, Darwin has the second most daily average sunshine hours (8.4) of any Australian capital with the most sunshine from April to November; only Perth, Western Australia averages more (8.8). The sun passes <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> in mid October and mid February.|$|E
50|$|Traction current {{converter}} plants are either decentralized (where one plant <b>directly</b> supplies the <b>overhead</b> lines or third rail of the traction system, with no feed into a traction current distribution network) or centralized (for {{the supply of}} the traction power network, usually {{in addition to the}} direct supply of the overhead lines or third rail).|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of a {{centralized}} holistic scheduling of tasks and messages, the complexity of the involved kernels is of utmost importance. Its complexity influences <b>directly</b> the <b>overhead</b> at the computing nodes. In this paper, an architecture of a kernel is presented. This kernel can be integrated in the computing nodes of a distributed control system without introducing a significant overhead. A central node dispatches both tasks and messages to other nodes that are only required to possess a nano-kernel. A case study where these concepts were partially implemented is also presented. This case study demonstrates that this kind of kernel can easily be implemented with low processing power microcontrollers. DET...|$|R
50|$|The colonia, {{especially}} the Tepito neighborhood, {{is known as}} a high crime area in Mexico City. It is known for the handling and selling of stolen merchandise as well as drug dealing, mostly of marijuana. According to a city statistics, 14.45% of the city’s jail population indicates this colonia as its residence. Another major problem for the area’s infrastructure is the theft of electrical services by residents and businesses tapping <b>directly</b> into <b>overhead</b> wires and bypassing meters. In May 2010, the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), or federal electricity commission, announced steps to eliminate these practices, as well as the replacement of faulty transformers and other equipment.|$|R
25|$|East of Fort York, the Gardiner {{was built}} entirely as an {{elevated}} route, through a predominantly industrial area, {{to the south}} of railway lands to reach downtown. The roadway was built <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> of Fleet Street (Fleet is now called Lake Shore Boulevard West) through much of this section. The expressway off-ramp to York Street was developed as a two-lane eastbound 'finger' flying over Harbour Street, south of the main roadway, descending to Harbour Street with a circular off-ramp to York Street northbound.|$|E
25|$|Inconsistencies of {{atmospheric}} conditions affect {{the speed of}} the GPS signals as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere, especially the ionosphere. Correcting these errors is a significant challenge to improving GPS position accuracy. These effects are smallest when the satellite is <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> and become greater for satellites nearer the horizon since the path through the atmosphere is longer (see airmass). Once the receiver's approximate location is known, a mathematical model can be used to estimate and compensate for these errors.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{the main}} sculptural areas around the portals themselves, the deep porches are filled with myriad other carvings {{depicting}} a range of subjects including local saints, Old Testament narratives, naturalistic foliage, fantastical beasts, Labours of the Months and personifications of the 'active and contemplative lives' (the vita activa and vita contemplativa). The personifications of the vita activa (<b>directly</b> <b>overhead,</b> just inside {{the inside of the}} left hand porch) are of particular interest for their meticulous depictions of the various stages in the preparation of flax – an important cash-crop in the area during the Middle Ages.|$|E
50|$|Kjofossen Power Station is a {{hydroelectric}} power plant at Sogn og Fjordane built during World War II. Part of its power is used as railway traction current, i.e. single-phase electric power at 16 2/3 hertz, fed <b>directly</b> into the <b>overhead</b> wire of the railway to Bergen. The only other power station in Norway to produce traction current is Hakavik Power Station.|$|R
500|$|The {{power station}} was well {{situated}} for coal deliveries {{as it was}} only [...] from Lemington Staithes. The staithes {{marked the end of}} the Wylam Waggonway, which brought coal from a number of nearby collieries to the staithes for export. Coal was hauled from the staithes to the power station, before being dumped <b>directly</b> into <b>overhead</b> hoppers in the boiler house. From there it was burned in the boilers to provide steam for the turbo generators. This steam was then cooled after use, using condensers, the water for which was taken from the Lemington Gut. This was a backwater of the River Tyne, created when a new channel was cut in 1876.|$|R
50|$|A call button, that, when pressed, alerts an {{attendant}} on board {{to serve the}} passenger(s)in the row with the pressed button (the attendant is directed by a small light on the console and alerted by a quiet audio signal). As with the reading light buttons, the call button is usually located <b>directly</b> on the <b>overhead</b> console on most narrowbody aircraft, while they are found together with IFE controls on most widebody aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The figure {{shows the}} {{geometry}} of a cross-section of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the Earth and the Sun at the December solstice when the Sun is overhead at some point of the Tropic of Capricorn. The south polar latitudes below the Antarctic Circle are in daylight, whilst the north polar latitudes above the Arctic Circle are in night. The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. Only at latitudes in between the two tropics {{is it possible for}} the Sun to be <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> (at the zenith).|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{precession}} of the equinoxes the December solstice {{no longer}} takes place while {{the sun is}} in the constellation Capricornus, as it did until 130 BCE, but the astrological sign called Capricorn begins with the solstice. The solstice now takes place when the Sun is in the constellation (not the sign) of Sagittarius. The sun's most southerly position, which is attained at the northern hemisphere's winter solstice, is now called the Tropic of Capricorn, a term which also applies to the line on the Earth at which the sun is <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> at noon on that solstice. The Sun is now in Capricorn from late January through mid-February.|$|E
25|$|In the Second World War {{the station}} was {{severely}} damaged. After the war, the shell was repaired {{to the point where}} it could be used temporarily. However, the postwar division of Germany spelled the end for most of West Berlin's mainline stations. On 28 August 1951 the final train departed from Lehrter Bahnhof, heading for the Wustermark and Nauen. On 9 July 1957 demolition began, and on 22 April 1958 the main entrance was blown up. The biggest challenge in the demolition of {{the station was}} to preserve the viaducts of the Stadtbahn, which ran <b>directly</b> <b>overhead.</b> Work was completed in the summer of 1959.|$|E
50|$|A {{reading light}} (often very similar in {{appearance}} to the nozzle) {{that can be}} turned on by the passenger for extra light, especially when the main cabin lights are turned off. The buttons to turn the lights on and off are usually located <b>directly</b> on the <b>overhead</b> console on most narrowbody aircraft, while on most widebody aircraft, the buttons are usually found together with the in-flight entertainment controls, generally located on the armrests, on seat backs, or through the touch screen interface on some personal televisions.|$|R
50|$|It {{became popular}} to use {{transparent}} film for presentations (with opaque text and images) using overhead projectors in the 1940s, and slide projectors in the 1950s. Transparencies for overhead projectors could be printed by some photocopiers. Computer presentation programs became {{available in the}} 1980s, {{making it possible to}} lay out a presentation digitally. Computer-developed presentations could be printed to a transparency with some laser printers, transferred to slides, or projected <b>directly</b> using LCD <b>overhead</b> projectors. Modern presentations are often displayed digitally using a video projector, computer monitor, or large-screen television.|$|R
5000|$|Nowadays, {{automotive}} use of side-valves {{has virtually}} disappeared, and valves are almost all [...] "overhead". However, most are now driven more <b>directly</b> by the <b>overhead</b> camshaft system. Few pushrod-type engines remain in production {{outside of the}} United States market. This is in part a result of some countries passing laws to tax engines based on displacement, because displacement is somewhat related to the emissions and fuel efficiency of an automobile. This has given OHC engines a regulatory advantage in those countries, which resulted in few manufacturers wanting to design both OHV and OHC engines.|$|R
25|$|The {{shape of}} the {{shoreline}} and the ocean floor changes the way that tides propagate, {{so there is no}} simple, general rule that predicts the time of high water from the Moon's position in the sky. Coastal characteristics such as underwater bathymetry and coastline shape mean that individual location characteristics affect tide forecasting; actual high water time and height may differ from model predictions due to the coastal morphology's effects on tidal flow. However, for a given location the relationship between lunar altitude and the time of high or low tide (the lunitidal interval) is relatively constant and predictable, as is the time of high or low tide relative to other points on the same coast. For example, the high tide at Norfolk, Virginia, U.S., predictably occurs approximately {{two and a half hours}} before the Moon passes <b>directly</b> <b>overhead.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the ground, a Bosnian Serb Army 2K12 Kub {{surface-to-air missile}} battery near Mrkonjić Grad was readying to fire its {{missiles}} on NATO aircraft. The Serbs had moved the mobile tracked missile battery and laid a trap. They switched on their missile radars sparingly, giving F-16 fighters little warning. Waiting until a plane was <b>directly</b> <b>overhead,</b> where the aircraft's warning and countermeasures {{would be at}} their weakest, they fired two missiles. In the cockpit, O'Grady's instruments alerted him that a missile was coming but, because he was flying through an overcast, {{he could not see}} it. The first missile exploded between the two aircraft. The second struck the F-16 piloted by O'Grady. His flight lead, Captain Bob Wright, saw O'Grady's plane burst into flames and break in two. Wright did not see a parachute, but O'Grady survived by ejecting from the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese {{navigation}} {{down and}} around the coast of Africa {{in the latter half}} of the 1400s gave wide-scale observational evidence for Earth's sphericity. In these explorations, the sun's position moved more northward the further south the explorers travel. Its position <b>directly</b> <b>overhead</b> at noon gave evidence for crossing the equator. These apparent solar motions in detail were more consistent with north-south curvature and a distant sun, than with any flat-earth explanation. The ultimate demonstration came when Ferdinand Magellan's expedition completed the first global circumnavigation in 1521. Antonio Pigafetta, one of the few survivors of the voyage, recorded the loss of a day in the course of the voyage, giving evidence for east-west curvature. No flat-earth theory could reconcile the daily apparent motions of the sun with the ability to sail around the world, and the loss of a day could make no sense, either.|$|E
5000|$|The USAAF saw the {{greatest}} innovations in 1944 under Gen. Elwood Quesada, commander of IX Tactical Air Command, supporting the First U.S. Army. He developed the [...] "armored column cover", where on-call fighter-bombers maintained a high-level of availability for important tank advances, allowing armor units {{to maintain a}} high tempo of exploitation even when they outran their artillery assets. He also used a modified antiaircraft radar to track friendly attack aircraft to redirect them as necessary, and experimented with assigning fighter pilots to tours as forward air controllers to familiarize them with the ground perspective. In July 1944, Quesada provided VHF aircraft radios to tank crews in Normandy. When the armored units broke out of the Normandy beachhead, tank commanders were able to communicate <b>directly</b> with <b>overhead</b> fighter-bombers. However, despite the innovation, Quesada focused his aircraft on CAS only for major offensives. Typically, both British and American attack aircraft were tasked primarily to interdiction, even though later analysis showed them to be twice as dangerous as CAS.|$|R
30|$|Störl et al. [23] {{conducted}} a comparison and performance evaluation of Object-NoSQL Database Mappers (ONDMs). However, the study does not quantify the <b>overhead</b> <b>directly,</b> making a comparison difficult. Moreover, these benchmarks were obtained {{on a single}} node, and as a consequence, the results may be affected by CPU contention. Highly surprising in their results is the read performance of DataNucleus, which is shown {{to be at least}} 40 times as slow EclipseLink. We only measured similar results when entity enhancement was left enabled at-runtime, which recompiles entity classes to a meta model on each read. As a result, this may indicate fundamental flaws in the study’s measurement methodology.|$|R
40|$|A unique moderated USENET newsgroup, sci. med. aids, {{was created}} on June 13, 1987 to host an {{electronic}} discussion of medical, social, ethical {{and political issues}} associated with AIDS.
