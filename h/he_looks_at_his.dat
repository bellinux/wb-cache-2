500|$|Many of the 82 Fredman's Epistles remain {{popular in}} Sweden. Their diverse styles and themes may be {{illustrated}} {{with examples of}} some of the best-known songs. To begin with No. 23, Ach du min Moder! (Alas, thou my mother), which has been described as [...] "the to-be-or-not-to-be of Swedish literature", tells, in realist style, the story of a drunk who wakes in a Stockholm gutter outside the Crawl-In Tavern. He curses his parents for conceiving him [...] "perhaps upon a table" [...] as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> torn clothes. Then the tavern door opens, and he goes in and has his first drink. The song ends with loud thanks to the drunk's mother and father. In contrast, the Rococo No. 28, I går såg jag ditt barn, min Fröja (Yesterday I saw thy child, my Freya), tells the tale of an attempt to arrest the [...] "nymph" [...] Ulla Winblad, based on a real event. Bellman here combines realism – Ulla wearing a black embroidered bodice, and losing her watch in a named street (Yxsmedsgränd) in Stockholm's Gamla stan – with images from classical mythology, such as a myrtle crown and an allusion to the goddess Aphrodite.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{keep talking}} to him, I ask him {{questions}} and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch," [...] Millen said. [...] "I said, 'You got some place {{you need to}} be?' And he goes, 'Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Sorry, sir.' So I ask him another question, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch and I said, 'You're done, get out of here." [...] Millen said he then told Russell to go to see head coach Rod Marinelli, who later also told Russell to leave his office. [...] "So I'm done, I can't believe what I just witnessed, and so I call Al," [...] Millen said, [...] "I {{get on the phone}} and I say, 'Coach, I don't know what you're thinking, but don't take JaMarcus Russell. Don't take Calvin Johnson, but don't take JaMarcus Russell." ...|$|E
2500|$|The game {{begins as}} the Roman army, {{under the command}} of centurion Agrippa (voiced by Rick Weiss), is {{fighting}} a Germanic army in the northeastern provinces. In Rome, Julius Caesar (Michael Bell) {{is on his way to}} the Senate when he is stabbed. As he dies, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> killer and says [...] "Et tu, Brute?" [...] As he is cremated in the Foro Romano, Cicero (Peter Renaday) reveals the assassin to the public; Vipsanius (Daniel Riordan), Agrippa's father. As Vipsanius maintains his innocence, Cicero announces Caesar's successor, Antonius (Chris Cox). Listening from the crowd, Octavianus (Scott Menville), Caesar's nephew, refuses to believe Vipsanius is guilty. Meanwhile, in Germania, Agrippa receives word of Caesar's death, and orders him men to return to Rome.|$|E
60|$|Wilmore was {{genuinely}} startled. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> companion curiously.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{reflection}} {{in a mirror}} and laughed ruefully.|$|R
60|$|He passed out, and the iron-master {{smiled as}} <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wife.|$|R
6000|$|NAPOLEON (brusquely, rising). No: lay {{nothing here}} until the officer for whom I am waiting comes back. (<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch, and takes to walking {{to and fro}} between the {{fireplace}} and the vineyard.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{the rays}} reach {{in through the}} open door, And <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hand, and the sun glows through his fingers, While he's {{thinking}} thoughts whose tenour is no more To me than the swaying rose-tree shade that lingers." ...|$|E
60|$|Then vanity, {{the vice}} which {{promotes}} so many virtues, asserts itself. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> comrades and they at him. So far {{he has shown}} no sign of weakness. He thinks, they are thinking him brave. The dearly longed-for reputation glitters before his eyes. He executes the orders he receives.|$|E
60|$|At last it was finished, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{work with}} complacency.|$|R
60|$|Mabane paused. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> pipe, but <b>he</b> did not relight it.|$|R
60|$|Morel stood watching. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> son, helplessly, and in horror.|$|R
6000|$|She bows {{her eyes}} rather than her head, the {{movement}} is so slight and curious, and he withdraws. Clear of the room <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch but is inclined to doubt it by a minute or thereabouts. There is a splendid clock upon the staircase, famous, as splendid clocks not often are, for its accuracy. [...] "And what do YOU say," [...] Mr. Tulkinghorn inquires, referring to it. [...] "What do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [She {{lifts the}} coat. But ROBERTS puts it back, and wraps it [...] round her. He tries {{to meet her}} eyes, but cannot. MRS. [...] ROBERTS stays huddled in the coat, her eyes, that follow him [...] about, are half malicious, half yearning. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch [...] again, and turns to go. In the doorway he meets JAN THOMAS, a [...] boy of ten in clothes too big for him, {{carrying}} a penny [...] whistle.] ...|$|E
60|$|BURGESS (pretending to belittle the aristocracy, {{but with}} his eyes gleaming). Hm, I thort you wouldn't git a piorr's (peer's) nevvy visitin' in Victoria Park unless he were {{a bit of a}} flat. (Looking again at the picture.) Of course I don't 'old with that pictur, Candy; but still it's a 'igh class, fust rate work of art: I can see that. Be sure you hintroduce me to him, Candy. (<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch anxiously.) I can only stay about two minutes.|$|E
60|$|He stood {{a moment}} in thought and then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{companion}} again.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> daughter's {{attentive}} {{face and}} {{jumped to his}} feet upsetting the chair.|$|R
60|$|He stopped {{where the}} servant had stopped. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Lucilla; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> brother; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
6000|$|WAITER. Quite sure, sir. She expects you at {{a quarter}} to one, sir. (The gentleman, soothed at once by the waiter's voice, looks {{at him with a}} lazy smile. It is a quiet voice, with a gentle melody in it that gives {{sympathetic}} interest to his most commonplace remark; and he speaks with the sweetest propriety, neither dropping his aitches nor misplacing them, nor committing any other vulgarism. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch as he continues) Not that yet, sir, is it? 12:43, sir. Only two minutes more to wait, sir. Nice morning, sir? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Buster Jack {{made two}} bursts this hyar day," [...] {{concluded}} Lem, reflectively. [...] "Miss Collie, I ain't shore how you're regardin' thet individool, but I'm tellin' you this, fer your own good. He's bad medicine. He has his old man's temper thet riles up at nuthin' an' never felt a halter. Wusser'n thet, he's spoiled an' he {{acts like a}} colt thet'd tasted loco. The idee of his ropin' Pronto right thar near the round-up! Any one would think he jest come West. Old Bill is no fool. But he wears blinders when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> son. I'm predictin' bad days fer White Slides Ranch." ...|$|E
6000|$|CRICHTON (slowly). You do please me, child, very much--(he half rises)--very much indeed. (If {{he meant}} to say more he checks himself. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> plate.) No more, thank you. (The simple island meal is ended, save for the walnuts and the wine, and CRICHTON is too busy a man to linger long over them. But he is a stickler for etiquette, end the table is cleared charmingly, though with dispatch, before they are placed before him. LADY MARY is an artist with the crumb-brush, and there are few arts more {{delightful}} to watch. Dusk has come sharply, and she turns on the electric light. It awakens CRICHTON from a reverie {{in which he has}} been regarding her.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> Lieutenant, {{and both}} of them laughed. Then the Chefe made a little sign.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch again, and {{the world}} grew black. It was twelve minutes after ten.|$|R
60|$|With {{an effort}} the Russian shook off the vagary of <b>his</b> fancy. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{does it in}} this way. He puts five sovereigns {{under his}} hand. That is the limit, you know. Then <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> card, and pushes it out. With his hand still {{touching}} it, he watches the dealer and, if he can see by his face that his card is a good one--and you can generally tell that--he withdraws his hand with four of the sovereigns, leaving only one on the card. If, on the other hand, he thinks it is a bad one, he leaves the whole five there. He does the trick cleverly enough; but I am certain that I have, four or five times, seen him do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Frenchman who {{means to}} marry you. When the others fell back he came at {{me on his}} horse as I was setting a fresh arrow, {{thinking}} to get me. I had to shoot quick, and aimed low for his heart, because in that light I could not make certain of his face. He saw, and jerked up the horses head, so that the shaft took it in the throat and killed the beast without hurting its rider. He was off in an instant and at me, with others, before I could draw again. So I thought it time to go, which I did, backward, as he thrust. Perhaps he thinks he killed me, as I meant he should, only when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> sword he'll find it clean. That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. The {{only reason}} that one paints is that one can't help it. It's a {{function}} like {{any of the other}} functions of the body, only comparatively few people have got it. One paints for oneself: otherwise one would commit suicide. Just think of it, you spend God knows how long trying to get something on to canvas, putting the sweat of your soul into it, and what is the result? Ten to one it will be refused at the Salon; if it's accepted, people glance at it for ten seconds as they pass; if you're lucky some ignorant fool will buy it and put it on his walls and look at it as little as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> dining-room table. Criticism {{has nothing to do with}} the artist. It judges objectively, but the objective doesn't concern the artist." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> feet. Then <b>he</b> {{took off}} his overcoat. His mother {{wondered}} if he were drunk.|$|R
60|$|The direct {{simplicity}} {{of this argument}} came home to the colonel's understanding. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> subordinate fixedly.|$|R
60|$|Cuthbert went up {{and rang}} the bell. Cumming himself opened the door. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> visitor inquiringly.|$|R
60|$|A {{man walking}} by the water-side sees by chance a {{kingfisher}} fly past, its colour a wonderful blue, far surpassing in beauty and brilliancy any blue {{he has ever}} seen in sky or water, or in flower or stone, or any other thing. No sooner has he seen than he wishes to become the possessor of that rare loveliness, that shining object which, he fondly imagines, will be a continual delight to him and to all in his house,--an ornament comparable to that splendid stone which the poor fisherman found in a fish's belly, which was his children's plaything by day and his candle by night. Forthwith he gets his gun and shoots it, and has it stuffed {{and put in a}} glass case. But it is no longer the same thing: the image of the living sunlit bird flashing past him is in his mind and creates a kind of illusion when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> feathered mummy, but the lustre is not visible to others.|$|E
6000|$|Not so the Philosophical Society of the Midlands. The {{chairman}} rises. He doesn't {{call for}} silence. It is there, thick. [...] "We have with us to-night," [...] he says, [...] "a man {{whose name is}} well known to the Philosophical Society" [...] (here <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> card), [...] "Mr. Stephen Leacock." [...] (Complete silence.) [...] "He {{is a professor of}} political economy at--" [...] Here he turns to me and says, [...] "Which college did you say?" [...] I answer quite audibly in the silence, [...] "At McGill." [...] "He is at McGill," [...] says the chairman. (More silence.) [...] "I don't suppose, however, ladies and gentlemen, that he's come here to talk about political economy." [...] This is meant as a jest, but the audience takes it as a threat. [...] "However, ladies and gentlemen, you haven't come here to listen to me" [...] (this evokes applause, the first of the evening), [...] "so without more ado" [...] (the man always has the impression that there's been a lot of [...] "ado," [...] but I never see any of it) [...] "I'll now introduce Mr. Leacock." [...] (Complete silence.) ...|$|E
60|$|Suppose for instance, a study card, {{like the}} one {{described}} in a preceding chapter, is made, so as to mark the time of recess and of study. The teacher near the close of recess, is sitting {{with a group of}} his pupils around him, telling them some story. They are all interested, and they see he is interested. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch, and shows by his manner, that he is desirous of finishing what he is saying, but that he knows that the striking of the bell will cut short his story. Perhaps he says not a word about it, but his pupils see that he is submitting to the control which is placed over them: and when the card goes up, and he stops instantly {{in the middle of his}} sentence, and rises with the rest, each one to go to his own place, to engage at once in their several duties, he teaches them a most important lesson, and in the most effectual way. Such a lesson of fidelity and obedience, and such an example of it, will have more influence, than a half hour's scolding about whispering without leave, or a dozen public punishments. At least so I find it, for I have tried both.|$|E
60|$|A {{feeling of}} hostility {{instantly}} sprang up in Shelton; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> little host, who, however, merely blinked.|$|R
60|$|Oliver's {{heart was}} too full to speak. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> friend with {{swimming}} eyes and nodded his head.|$|R
