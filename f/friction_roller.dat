As the shuttle enters the shuttle-box {{at the end of}} its travel, it depresses a lever which acts as a brake. If this lever is not depressed then the loom is stopped.|$|E
50|$|Hullámvasút at Vidámpark, Budapest, Hungary - Wooden {{roller coaster}} built in 1922 after the plans of Ervin Dragon, is 17 m in height and travels 980 m in five minutes. It {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} side <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> coasters in the world, and is an ACE Coaster Classic, operated since 1926, and still running.|$|E
50|$|There {{were other}} similar {{installations}} including an identical Leap the Dips at Mounds State Park in Anderson, Indiana. The amusement park met an early demise in the 1920s. Very few side <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> coasters survived into the 1980s, and Leap the Dips at Lakemont {{is believed to}} be the last remaining figure-eight model of its kind still in operation.|$|E
50|$|Early {{restriction}} methods {{could be}} defeated by simple physical modifications (e.g. cutting out the restriction plate). Modern electronic limiters {{at the very}} least require replacing the <b>friction</b> <b>rollers</b> in a scooter's CVT transmission, or even changing wheel size and/or reprogramming the engine management system, all in an effort to fool the sensors into detecting a lower than actual road speed.|$|R
5000|$|Buckle folders work {{by feeding}} the paper {{at high speeds}} until it can move no further; the {{reaction}} of the paper is to buckle. High <b>friction</b> <b>rollers</b> then grip the paper and push it through, folding the paper, which is squeezed between the rollers, in the process. Attached rubber provides the rollers with the required grip. The front edge of the paper is then finally placed into a [...] "pocket"—a result of the rollers pressing together {{with the aid of a}} spring.|$|R
5000|$|A knife folder {{works by}} {{striking}} {{the paper with}} a knife between two rollers. This knife is not sharp enough {{to cut through the}} paper and simply strikes and creases the paper along the line where the fold is required. Ideally, knife folding is used with thick paper, for [...] "cross folds" [...] (commonly employed for maps and also known as a [...] "French fold") or if the paper has been stitched during the folding process; stitched sheets can ruin high <b>friction</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Side <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> {{coasters}} were {{an early}} innovation in roller coasters which {{enabled them to}} run at greater speeds and without a brakeman. Extra wheels were mounted {{on the sides of}} the cars to guide their movement on the track. This design became obsolete after World War I when side friction was supplanted by under-track mechanisms, which offered better vehicle security and support for greater speeds.|$|E
50|$|Leap-The-Dips was {{designed}} by Edward Joy Morris and constructed by the Federal Construction Company. It {{opened to the public}} in 1902 at Lakemont Park. Its figure-eight design was common on side <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> coasters constructed in the early 1900s, reaching peak popularity in the Roaring Twenties. Leap-The-Dips {{was one of the few}} to survive from the era and is considered the oldest operating roller coaster in the world.|$|E
50|$|Valves {{are driven}} by roller-follower rocker arms with low <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, and a unique, concave cam lobe design to {{increase}} valve lift over the traditional shimless lifter type system of the 1GR-FE. This increases overall cylinder head height to accommodate the slightly taller roller rocker system. Moreover, the cylinder head is segmented into 3 parts: valve cover, camshaft sub-assembly housing, and cylinder head sub-assembly. As such, this valvetrain is used across all other GR engines with Dual VVT-i. Its service weight is 163 kg.|$|E
50|$|The wire {{ferry boat}} {{was built by}} William Hall, ship and {{boatbuilder}} with dimensions of 25 feet length, 8 feet 10 1/2 inches width and 2 feet 4 inches in depth. It was fitted with a large wheel and two <b>friction</b> <b>rollers</b> for the wire that was strung across the river and would carry eight tons. When tested with sixty men on board she was stable in the water, {{but there was no}} room for anyone to sit and was therefore toploaded. Oars and rowlocks were available on board.|$|R
5000|$|Casler, {{following}} Dickson's proposal, {{invented the}} [...] "Mutoscope", which displayed short films through flip-cards rotated by a hand crank {{that could be}} slowed at the operator's will, unlike Edison's motorized Kinetoscope, in which films were viewed through actual 35 mm film. The prototype of the [...] "Mutograph" [...] camera was completed in November 1894, first tested with film in June 1895, and the first official Mutoscope films were made in August 1895. To avoire infringement on Edison's motion photo patents, the Mutograph camera used continuous movement <b>friction</b> <b>rollers</b> to move 68 mm film into the camera, instead of intermittent movement by sprockets as Edison's 35 mm camera did. Casler's patents, which he assigned to American Mutoscope in January 1896, were used as security for financing the new company.|$|R
50|$|In the 1720s, the English clockmaker Henry Sully {{invented a}} marine clock that was {{designed}} to determine longitude: this was {{in the form of a}} clock with a large balance wheel that was vertically mounted on <b>friction</b> <b>rollers</b> and impulsed by a frictional rest Debaufre type escapement. Very unconventionally, the balance oscillations were controlled by a weight at the end of a pivoted horizontal lever attached to the balance by a cord. This solution avoided temperature error due to thermal expansion, a problem which affects steel balance springs. Sully's clock only kept accurate time in calm weather, because the balance oscillations were affected by the pitching and rolling of the ship. However his clocks were amongst the first serious attempts to find longitude in this way. Harrison's machines, though much larger, are of similar layout: H3 has a vertically mounted balance wheel and is linked to another wheel of the same size, an arrangement that eliminates problems arising from the ship's motion.|$|R
50|$|The first Kennywood Racer {{was first}} built in 1910 {{as a side}} <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> coaster by Frederick Ingersoll. It was a twin-track racing coaster {{designed}} by John Miller that cost nearly $50,000. When it was built, {{it was the largest}} racing coaster in the world. The original Racer had two trains racing side by side on two separate tracks, but it didn't have wheels under the track, so dips and curves were gentle. The trains consisted of three-seat cars with a seating capacity of 18. The Racer was torn down in 1926 and replaced by Kiddieland.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{spinning}} {{roller coaster}} was the Virginia Reel, first built in 1908 by Henry Riehl. Instead of trains, the ride had [...] "tubs" [...] with seats {{built around the}} perimeter facing inward. These tubs spun freely on their chassis as they travelled down the track, which was trough-like and {{similar to that of}} a side <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> coaster. Virginia Reels did not have big hills or drops, but rather many sharp turns. Toward the end were two helices, and finally a drop into a dark tunnel. The last full size Virginia Reel closed at Pleasure Beach Blackpool in 1982.|$|E
50|$|Leap-The-Dips is {{a wooden}} roller coaster located at Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Constructed in 1902 by the Federal Construction Company and {{designed}} by E. Joy Morris, {{it is the}} oldest operating roller coaster {{in the world and}} believed to be the last surviving side <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> coaster of the figure-eight variety. Leap-the-Dips operated continuously until 1985, when it closed after falling into disrepair. A fund-raising campaign led to its restoration, with refurbishment efforts beginning in 1997 and ending with a grand-reopening in 1999. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996 and received the Coaster Classic and Coaster Landmark awards from American Coaster Enthusiasts.|$|E
40|$|Robotic {{assisted}} gastroscope delivery {{could solve}} various problems like understaffing, radiation and infection risk. The <b>friction</b> <b>rollers</b> {{commonly used in}} the few existed systems for traditional flexible endoscope, however, has potential risk of destroying scopes for non-uniform clamping. This research develops a novel gastroscope intervention mechanism (GIM) with a specially designed airbag. It evenly clamps the gastroscope with circumferential uniform pneumatic pressure. The GIM realizes axial and radial motion {{by means of the}} relay delivery mode similar to clinician&# 39;s operation. The critical slipping force at different air pressure was analyzed to provide guidelines for safe intervention. Experiments were performed to evaluate the delivery accuracy and velocity and measure the critical slipping force. The results showed the axial and radial accuracy for delivery are 0. 025 ± 0. 2 mm and - 0. 03 ± 0. 25 deg, respectively. The average velocity of 6. 00 mm·s- 1 and 75 deg·s- 1 were achieved to push/pull and twist the gastroscope. The relationship between the critical slipping force and air pressure could be fitted with a quadratic polynomial...|$|R
2500|$|Invented in 1897, {{the duck}} brake or duck roller brake used a rod {{operated}} by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin <b>friction</b> <b>rollers</b> (usually made of wood or rubber) against the front tyre. [...] Mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set {{at an angle to}} conform to the shape of the tyre, the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre, thus braking the front wheel. [...] A tension spring held the rollers away from the tyre except when braking. [...] Braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar, which provided additional leverage when braking (two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary). [...] Used in combination with a rear coaster brake, a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake. [...] Known colloquially as the duck brake, the design was used by many notable riders of the day, and was widely exported to England, Australia, and other countries. [...] In 1902, Louis H. Bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the Duck Roller Brake (Patent 708,114) for use on motorized bicycles (motorcycles).|$|R
50|$|The {{valvetrain}} {{features a}} number of innovations: <b>friction</b> reducing <b>roller</b> swing arm, hydraulic lash adjusters which ensure proper clearances between the valve stem and roller swing arm, which significantly reduce valve tapping noise. The valve springs feature a beehive shape and smaller retainer. The reduced weight and spring load further help lower friction and improve fuel economy. The valvetrain is driven by a silent-type, maintenance free steel timing chain that replaces a roller-type timing chain: The optimized design greatly reduces impact forces and noise when the gear tooth and chain engage.|$|R
50|$|Scenic railways, {{particularly}} {{in the form of}} side <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> coasters, require a brakeman to ride with the train around the track to slow it down at certain points on the layout, particularly bends; as the trains are not mechanically held onto the track. The brakeman is responsible for slowing the train down when necessary and stopping it in the station {{at the end of the}} ride. There are only a few examples of such rides now left in existence; the Scenic Railway at Luna Park, Melbourne, Australia, and the Roller Coaster at Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach, UK, are two of the largest examples.|$|E
5000|$|Like steel roller {{coasters}}, wooden {{roller coasters}} usually {{use the same}} three-wheel design, pioneered by John Miller. Each set of wheels includes a running wheel (on top of the track), a side friction (or [...] "guide") wheel (to guide motion in the lateral plane and reduce excessive side-to-side movement known as [...] "hunting") and an upstop wheel (beneath the track to prevent cars from flying off the track). Some wooden coasters, such as Leap-The-Dips, do not have upstop wheels and are known as side <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> coasters. As a result, the turns and drops are more gentle than on modern wooden roller coasters. Scenic Railway roller coasters also lack upstop wheels but rely on a brake operator to control the speed so that upstop wheels are not necessary. A handful of wooden coasters use flanged wheels, similar to a rail car, {{eliminating the need for}} side friction wheels.|$|E
50|$|By 1912, {{the first}} underfriction roller coaster was {{developed}} by John Miller. Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world. Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, The Cyclone, was opened at Coney Island in 1927. Like The Cyclone, all early roller coasters were made of wood. Many old wooden roller coasters are still operational, at parks such as Kennywood near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Pleasure Beach Blackpool, England. The oldest operating roller coaster is Leap-The-Dips at Lakemont Park in Pennsylvania, a side <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> coaster built in 1902. The oldest wooden roller coaster in the United Kingdom is the Scenic Railway at Dreamland Amusement Park in Margate, Kent and features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. It was severely damaged by fire on April 7, 2008, but was subsequently restored and reopened {{to the public in}} 2015. Scenic Railway at Melbourne's Luna Park built in 1912, is the world's oldest continually-operating roller coaster, and it also still features a system where the brakeman rides the car with wheels. One of only 13 remaining examples of John Miller's work worldwide is the wooden roller coaster at Lagoon in Utah. The coaster opened in 1921 and is the 6th oldest coaster in the world.|$|E
50|$|Also, the ATSF was {{the first}} company to have roller bearing trucks made by Timken under their {{passenger}} cars, much {{to the delight of}} their passengers, and the bottom line for the company. Timken commissioned the construction of a demonstration boxcar in 1943 that was first seen at the 1948 Chicago Rail Fair. It was a rolling advertisement for a new way of reducing <b>friction</b> - <b>roller</b> bearings (made by the Timken Roller Bearing Company). The car's trucks lacked the then common axle journal boxes, with the bearings mounted on the ends of the axles outside the wheels.|$|R
50|$|Cages are {{typically}} used {{to secure the}} balls in a Conrad-style ball bearing. In other construction types they may decrease the number of balls depending on the specific cage shape, and thus reduce the load capacity. Without cages the tangential position is stabilized by sliding of two convex surfaces on each other. With a cage the tangential position is stabilized by a sliding of a convex surface in a matched concave surface, which avoids dents in the balls and has lower <b>friction.</b> Caged <b>roller</b> bearings were invented by John Harrison in the mid-18th century {{as part of his}} work on chronographs.|$|R
5000|$|Tape {{tension is}} {{controlled}} primarily by <b>friction</b> in two <b>rollers</b> that the belt loops around. 3M controlled belt-roller friction (and hence the tape tension) {{with a very}} precise amount of STP lubricant on the bearing surfaces. A better design was to use large axles and Teflon-filled plastic for the bearing rollers, which eliminated the need for lubrication.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of back and seat rest inclination on the kinematics of manual hand-rim wheelchair propulsion in subjects with spastic type cerebral palsy. Subjects ranged in age from nine to twenty-one and were classified as USCPAA Class III or IV functional ability. Subjects were required to propel a standardized wheelchair at six seat positions from combinations of back rest angles of 0, 3 and - 5 degrees from vertical and thigh angles of 0 and 5 degrees from horizontal. Combinations of thigh/seat rest angles were 0 /- 5, 5 /- 5, 5 / 0, 5 / 3, 0 / 3, 0 / 0 constituting the six different conditions. Subjects were filmed while wheeling in each seat position. Wheeling was performed at two and three kilometers per hour on a low <b>friction</b> <b>roller</b> system. It was hypothesized that since individuals with spastic type cerebral palsy have improved functional upper extremity performance as the body center of mass is positioned over the ischial tuberocities and hip flexion angle is maintained at 90 degrees (0 / 0), that similar results would be found in wheelchair propulsion. Based on the results of kinematic data analyzed in this study there was no indication that the 0 / 0 seat position was superior for subjects with cerebral palsy under the conditions of this study. Larger elbow flexion/extension range of motion (p =. 06) exhibited by the 5 / 3 and 5 / 0 seat orientations suggests that these positions provide a more effective wheelchair propulsion orientation for subjects in this study...|$|E
40|$|Background: Robot-assisted {{manipulation}} {{is promising}} for solving {{problems such as}} understaffing {{and the risk of}} infection in gastro-intestinal endoscopy. However, the commonly used <b>friction</b> <b>rollers</b> in few existing systems have a potential risk of deforming flexible endoscopes for non-uniform clamping. Methods: This paper presents a robotic system for a standard flexible endoscope and focuses on a novel gastroscope intervention mechanism (GIM), which provides circumferentially uniform clamping with an airbag. The GIM works with a relay-on mechanism in a way similar to manual operation. The shear stiffness of airbag and the critical slipping force (CSF) were analyzed to determine the parameters of the airbag. A fuzzy PID controller was employed to realize a fast response and high accuracy of pneumatic actuation. Experiments were performed to evaluate the accuracy, stiffness and CSF. In vitro and in vivo animal experiments were also carried out. Results: The GIM realized an accuracy of 0. 025 ± 0. 2 mm and – 0. 03 ± 0. 25 ° for push–pull and rotation without delivery resistance. Under < 10 N delivery resistance, the error caused by the airbag stiffness was < 0. 24 mm. A quadratic polynomial could be used to describe the relationship between the CSF and pneumatic pressure. Conclusions: The novel GIM could effectively deliver gastroscopes. The pneumatic-driven clamping method proposed could protect the gastroscope by circumferentially uniform clamping force and the CSF could be properly controlled to guarantee operating safety...|$|R

However, for polyester fibres, the rotor spun yarn showed highest friction, followed by friction and ring spun yarns.|$|R
50|$|The warp {{passes from}} the warp beam, passes over a <b>friction</b> guide <b>roller,</b> where it {{horizontally}} {{passes through the}} loom to a breastbeam. Here it turns vertically to the cloth beam. Even tension is essential as any variation will lead to broken threads. As the warp beam empties its effective diameter changes making the warp slacker- tension is maintained by adding a wooden pulley to the beam, around which are two turns of rope that are attached to mill weights- thus retarding the beam through friction. The cloth beam bears a toothed wheel which works a pinion. A ratchet wheel is attached with a click level {{to take up the}} slack in the cloth. This was Roberts invention.|$|R

All the remaining yg class coaches were then equipped with Minden-Deutz MD 36 bogies.All the coaches were cleared to run at up to 120 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{transit telescope}} was not {{placed in the}} middle of the axis, but nearer to one end, to prevent the axis from bending under the weight of the telescope. Later, it was usually placed in the centre of the axis, which consisted of one piece of brass or gun metal with turned cylindrical steel pivots at each end. Several instruments were made entirely of steel, which was much more rigid than brass. The pivots rested on V-shaped bearings, either set into massive stone or brick piers which supported the instrument, or attached to metal frameworks on the tops of the piers. The temperature of the bearings was monitored by thermometers.The piers were usually separate from the foundation of the building, to prevent transmission of vibration from the building to the telescope. To relieve the pivots from the weight of the instrument, which would have distorted their shape, each end of the axis was supported by a hook with <b>friction</b> <b>rollers,</b> suspended from a lever supported by the pier, counterbalanced so as to leave only about 10 pounds force (45 N) on each bearing. In some cases, the counterweight pushed up on the bearing from below. The bearings were set nearly in a true east-west line, but fine adjustment was possible by horizontal and vertical screws. A spirit level was used to monitor for any inclination of the axis to the horizon. Eccentricity (an off-center condition) of the telescope's axis was accounted for, in some cases, by providing another telescope through the axis itself. By observing the motion of an artificial star through this axis telescope as the main telescope was rotated, the shape of the pivots, and any wobble of the axis, could be determined.|$|R
40|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} in mechanical setups to reduce rubbing. In some applications, the thermal dissipation involved mostly due to <b>friction</b> between <b>rollers</b> and rings is important.

In this work, the resulting dynamical and ther-mal fields within the enclosures limited by rollers and rings in cylindrical bearingsare obtained through numerical modelling. Convective heat transfer is quantified by Nu-Re-Pr correlations for various dynamical and thermal configurations of thebearing. Two specific shape factors of the cavity and common fluids of engineer-ing interest are considered, including air, water and a specific oil.

Both the fixed-roller and the V-grooved fixtures yielded an error in stress of about 4 to 7 %. They also exhibited an appreciable amount of load strain hysteresis. Dynamic fatigue testing of 96 wt. % alumina verified the error: the fatigue strength was overestimated by 7 to 9 % for the fixed roller configuration.

50|$|A scrollerwheel is a {{mechanical}} device {{composed of a}} number of rollers (four or more) and connective bands under tension, which wrap around and weave between the rollers forming a self-supporting cluster possessing a central roller. The cluster of rollers is bound by the connective bands {{in such a way that}} the static <b>friction</b> between the <b>rollers</b> and bands prevent the rollers from slipping as they roll and orbit the central roller. Scrollerwheels are related in operational principle to rolamite linear bearings (developed at Sandia National Labs in the late 1960s), and like them, they display only rolling friction, and not the kinetic friction inherent in most mechanical bearings.|$|R
