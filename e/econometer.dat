40|$|Analysis of driver {{behavior}} {{has been the}} purpose of many studies for several years. A new aspect is the introduction of electric vehicles on the car market and the fact drivers {{are more concerned with}} their consumptions in EV (Electric Vehicle) {{due to the lack of}} the appropriate infrastructures. However, only a few studies focusing on ecological behavior and consumption have been carried out. The primary goal of the present study was to assess empirically the impact of feedback on EV driving behavior involving autonomy management performance. We hypothesized that we could help the driver to manage his autonomy more efficiently if we’d give him feedback on his driving behavior and battery consumption. Our second hypothesis is that participants would allocate more attention on feedback information when they reach a critical battery autonomy situation, so the subjects had to drive a course with 100 % and 15 % autonomy left. Preliminary results indicate better driver performances and enhanced safety with <b>econometer</b> gauge feedback, probably due to the increased driver control and better applied driver attention.

Search to identify a set of factors that exerts influence in the prescription components and expenditure with benefits of the RGPS. Of this form, two models, one for esteem of the equation revenues of the RGPS and another one for the equation of the expenditures with benefits of the RGPS are used. An identity for verification of the result (balance) of the accounts of the RGPS. The aforementioned models were submitted to the multiple regression analysisâs method applied to the <b>econometer</b> series to the referencial light. The results confirm the influence of the formal labor factors, demographics, minimum salary and industrial production in the balances, benefits and financial balances of the GRSS. On the basis of these premises, utilizes the parameters of the equations to be able to estimate the future results from 2008 through 2050. Esta dissertaÃÃo faz uma anÃlise dos principais fatores que afetam o resultado do Regime Geral de PrevidÃncia Social â RGPS, apontando os motivos que geram o dÃficit previdenciÃrio e a sua relaÃÃo com o mercado de trabalho formal. Procura identificar um conjunto de fatores que exerce influÃncia nos componentes de receitas e despesa com benefÃcios do RGPS. Dessa forma, utilizam-se dois modelos, um para estimaÃÃo da equaÃÃo de ArrecadaÃÃo da PrevidÃncia e outro para a equaÃÃo das Despesas com BenefÃcios do RGPS. Utiliza-se ainda uma identidade para apuraÃÃo do resultado (saldo) das contas da PrevidÃncia. Esses modelos foram submetidos ao mÃtodo de anÃlise de regressÃo mÃltipla aplicada Ã luz do referencial teÃrico da econometria de sÃries temporais. Os resultados confirmam a influÃncia dos fatores mercado de trabalho formal, demogrÃficos, salÃrio mÃnimo e produÃÃo industrial nas receitas, benefÃcios e resultado financeiro do RGPS. Com base em premissas, utilizam-se os parÃmetros das equaÃÃes estimadas para elaboraÃÃo de cenÃrios para o resultado da previdÃncia de 2008 a 2050...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on equilibrium search models, where labor market equilibrium results from workers strategy (a reservation wage strategy) and firms strategy (which post a wage). One particular aspect of those models is {{to lead to a}} non degenerated wage offer distribution even with ex-ante agents. There are identified from microeconomic data (panel data of workers and firms). The basic models have a number of attractive features but the wage-offer and wage-earning distributions have increasing densities. This implication is at odds with the data. During the past years, substantial progress were made which allow micro <b>econometers</b> to use such models for policy analysis. Classification JEL : J 21, J 31, J 64. ...|$|R
