40|$|The {{future of}} the National Library of Medicine will be shaped {{by a number of}} scientific, technical, and social influences. Among these are the {{continuing}} rapid development of computer technology and storage systems. Artificial intelligence techniques, factual databases, the emergence of medical informatics as a formal discipline, and the development of Integrated Academic Information Management Systems (IAIMS) are also important influences on the direction of the library. Public policy issues will influence the future of NLM [...] among them, sharing of scientific information between nations and the role of federal agencies in dissemination of information domestically. The <b>formal,</b> <b>long-range</b> <b>plan</b> now being prepared for the library by panels of expert advisers will be a guide for future programs and goals...|$|R

Strategic planning is defined as a combination of written objectives. written financial forecasts, and long range budgets. Operational planning is defined as short-term financial, marketing, inventory, and sales planning.

40|$|The {{continuous}} operation planning approach {{developed for the}} operations planning of the International Space Station (ISS) is reported on. The approach {{was designed to be}} a robust and cost-effective method. It separates ISS planning into two <b>planning</b> functions: <b>long-range</b> <b>planning</b> for a fixed length planning horizon which continually moves forward as ISS operations progress, and short-range planning which takes a small segment of the <b>long-range</b> <b>plan</b> and develops a detailed operations schedule. The continuous approach is compared with the incremental approach, the short and <b>long-range</b> <b>planning</b> functions are described, and the benefits and challenges of implementing a {{continuous operation}}s planning approach for the ISS are summarized...|$|R
