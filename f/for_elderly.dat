40|$|This paper aims to {{understand}} the geographic concentration {{and the structure of}} the system of facilities <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> I used the location quotient and other statistical methods to analyze four types of facilities <b>for</b> the <b>elderly,</b> namely, special nursing homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly,</b> homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> with moderate fees, private residential homes, and elderly housing with support services. Three main findings were revealed. First, among the facilities offered <b>for</b> the <b>elderly,</b> the inequality in the supply between prefectures was the highest for private residential homes. Second, the structure of the system of facilities <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> varied between prefectures. Third, the significant correlation between these facilities indicated that they were not independent in location. This finding suggests {{that there should be a}} relationship of competition or complementarity between the locations of these services.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} {{connected with the}} placement of senior citizens into homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> The objectives of the thesis are {{to find out how}} long the waiting period for the placement into a home for senior citizens is and which obstacles and problems connected with the placement into homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> appear. The theoretical part of the thesis is focused on some demographic trends, the opinion of the Czech population about the old age and senior citizens, history of social services for senior citizens in the Czech Republic and abroad, and the current offer of social services for senior citizens. In this part, I also describe the process of placing of senior citizens into homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> and the services which homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> offer to their clients; I also focus on the senior citizens´ financial reimbursement of board and lodging in homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> The research was conducted by means of quantitative and qualitative methods and techniques. In the qualitative research, I deal with the second part of my goal identifying obstacles to placement in homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> Firstly, I set the following research questions: 1) What are the obstacles and problems in the process of placing senior citizens into homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly?</b> and 2) Do senior citizens have any other options of care instead of the care in homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly?</b> Then, I conducted semi-standardized interviews with 3 social workers, 8 senior citizens and with 3 members of families which put their senior citizens into homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> I asked all of them almost identical questions to be able to compare their responses later. The results show that nowadays, dependent senior citizens who have no other option of care {{are more likely to be}} placed into homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> The answers to the question "What are the obstacles and problems when placing senior citizens into homes for the elderly?" were rather variable and they cannot be generalized. The quantitative part of my research relates to the first part of my goal. Here I primarily focused on the waiting period. The following two hypotheses were set for the research. H 1 : Senior citizens negatively evaluate the waiting period for their placement into homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> H 2 : Senior citizens know only one possibility of care homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> To verify the above hypotheses, I used the method of secondary analysis of the data taken from the client's documentation and the method of controlled conversation. Therefore, I conducted my research in the following homes for the elderly: Home <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> Light in Písek, Home <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> Bechyně, Home <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> Diaconia Centre ČCE Blanka in Písek, Home <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> Centre <b>for</b> Social Assistance Vodňany. Social workers in each facility advised me to use the greatest possible number of clients who were oriented and able to answer my questions. In total, I analyzed 100 files of personal documentation and then I conducted the structured interviews with the analysed clients in the homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> which are mentioned above. The average waiting period was 243 days. In the category of the waiting period shorter than 1 month there were 26 senior citizens; from 1 to 2 months 33 senior citizens; from 3 to 4 months 11 senior citizens; longer than 5 months 30 senior citizens. 79 senior citizens rated their waiting periods positively, but 21 senior citizens rated their waiting periods negatively. 56 senior citizens had some knowledge about other possibilities of care; most of them reported the nursing service (54 responses); homes with nursing (8 responses); personal assistance (3 responses); pensions for senior citizens (1 response) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is "Leisure activities in homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> {{in the city}} compared with the village". A theoretical part of the bachelor thesis {{is divided into three}} circuits, in the first one there are explained conceptions of an old age, ageing process and changes associated with it. The second circuit is devoted to a leisure time of the elderly and an introduction of possible activities. Last, but not least, there is mentioned a social work with seniors. A practical part is focused on achieving the defined objectives. The fist goal was to compare leisure activities in chosen homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> in cities and villages {{with the help of a}} secondary data analysis. Activity plans and their websites underwent the secondary data analysis in the chosen homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> The second goal was to find out seniors´ satisfaction with provided leisure time activities. The satisfaction was measured through a questionnaire. The research showed that the seniors are satisfied with the leisure activities in all the chosen homes both in the cities and in the villages. Following hypotheses were established before an implementation of the research: Hypothesis No. 1 : Leisure activities in homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> in cities are comparable with leisure activities in the homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> in the villages. This hypothesis was confirmed by the research. In all selected homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> there is an emphasis on leisure activities, all homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> hold similar (comparable) leisure activities for their clients. Hypothesis No. 2 : There are no differences between an organization of leisure activities in the homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> in cities and villages, was not confirmed. The secondary analysis revealed that the homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> in the cities have more employees engaged in the leisure activities. Therefore they can devote more attention to immobile clients. Additionally there still come volunteers to those homes, who individually attend to the single clients of the homes. The thesis can be used by both by professionals and the general public to obtain information about leisure activities in the homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> in the cities and villages and a possibility to assess any differences in an offer of the leisure time activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the topic of fulfilment of selected quality standards for social services in care homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> The theoretical part of the piece of work deals with defining the terms pertaining to the quality standards of social services in care homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> These are the terms ?old age?, ?need?, ?care home <b>for</b> the <b>elderly?,</b> ?social services?, ?quality standards?, and ?client?. The aim of the dissertation was to map the fulfilment and realisation of selected quality standards in care homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> Partial aims were {{to determine the extent of}} fulfilment of quality standards from the point of view of the client and to compare the individual levels of application of the quality standards for social services. Two care homes were chosen for the study, the Care Home <b>for</b> the <b>Elderly</b> Tep in Veselí nad Lužnicí and the Care Home <b>for</b> the <b>Elderly</b> in Horní Stropnice. Two hypotheses were established. Quantitative research was chosen to facilitate reaching the aims and verifying the hypotheses, utilising questioning methods, interviewing techniques and questionnaire enquiry. Furthermore, analysing the data was accomplished using secondary document analysis. The research file contained the clients and staff of both selected care homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> Following the evaluation of the results I believe that the aims of the dissertation were fulfilled. Selected quality standards are realised well in both care homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> and the essential criteria of individual quality standards are fulfilled as well. In addition, the research study proved both hypotheses to be correct. Selected quality standards are fulfilled from the point of view of the clients and at the same time applied in accordance with their needs. The dissertation can provide the selected care homes <b>for</b> the <b>elderly</b> with feedback regarding the fulfilment and realisation of selected quality standards of social services. It can also equally serve as guidance for potential clients in choosing their social services provider...|$|R
