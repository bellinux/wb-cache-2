5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. <b>Hysteroscopy</b> only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. <b>Hysteroscopy</b> can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
25|$|Using <b>hysteroscopy</b> the Nd:YAG laser {{has been}} used for removal of uterine septa within the inside of the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{is largely}} {{achieved}} by obtaining a complete medical history followed by physical exam and ultrasound. If need be, laboratory tests or <b>hysteroscopy</b> may be used. The following are {{a list of}} diagnostic procedures that medical professionals may use to identify {{the cause of the}} abnormal uterine bleeding.|$|E
30|$|Discussion: 6 of {{operative}} and 3 {{of diagnostic}} perforations occurred during cervix dilation with hegars. In diagnostics with 2.7 mm optics with {{minimally invasive method}} no perforation was observed. When the diagnostic <b>hysteroscopies</b> prior to operative <b>hysteroscopies</b> were used, halving of the occurrence of uterine perforation during operative procedures were observed.|$|R
30|$|Diagnostic <b>hysteroscopies</b> had low {{complication}} rate, {{indicating that}} they are safe procedures to evaluate intrauterine pathology. The incidence of complications was lower among operations carried out in outpatient clinic than in the operating theatre. The rate of complications of operative <b>hysteroscopies</b> from our study was similar to rates described in recent prospective studies.|$|R
30|$|The <b>hysteroscopies</b> in the {{operating}} room were always performed by the same two gynecologists.|$|R
25|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} staged by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system, {{which is based}} on {{clinical}} examination, rather than surgical findings. It allows only these diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, <b>hysteroscopy,</b> cystoscopy, proctoscopy, intravenous urography, and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical conization.|$|E
25|$|Screening by <b>hysteroscopy</b> {{to obtain}} cell samples {{obtained}} for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives—the full results of the trial will be published in 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E

30|$|Material and Methods 520 office <b>hysteroscopies</b> {{have been}} {{performed}} with 2.7 mm optics, without hegars, tire-balles or local anesthesia. In the remaining 4503 office <b>hysteroscopies</b> - 3 mm optics and local anaesthesia were used. The highest tolerance of the procedure was noted in cases of thin 2.7 mm optics without cervical manipulation. The operative procedures were performed with bipolar electrodes - loop and spring - and 3 and 5 mm optics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hysteroscopy</b> is the {{inspection}} of the uterine cavity by endoscopy with access through the cervix. It allows for the diagnosis of intrauterine pathology {{and serves as a}} method for surgical intervention (operative <b>hysteroscopy).</b>|$|E
50|$|Fertility may {{sometimes}} be restored by removal of adhesions, {{depending on the}} severity of the initial trauma and other individual patient factors. Operative <b>hysteroscopy</b> is used for visual inspection of the uterine cavity during adhesion dissection (adhesiolysis). However, <b>hysteroscopy</b> is yet to become a routine gynaecological procedure and only 15% of US gynecologists perform office <b>hysteroscopy</b> {Isaacson, 2002}. Adhesion dissection can be technically difficult and must be performed with care in order to not create new scars and further exacerbate the condition. In more severe cases, adjunctive measures such as laparoscopy are used in conjunction with <b>hysteroscopy</b> as a protective measure against uterine perforation. Microscissors are usually used to cut adhesions. Electrocauterization is not recommended.|$|E

50|$|If the {{ultrasonography}} is not reassuring, <b>hysteroscopy</b> and {{endometrial biopsy}} should be performed.

40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of an integrated educational strategy to change clinician behaviour and {{reduce the number of}} <b>hysteroscopies</b> and/or dilatation and curettages for women 40 years or less with dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). Design Randomised controlled trial with six-month followup. Setting Public teaching hospital gynaecology units with 12, 000 - 13, 000 relevant procedures per year. Participants Six public gynaecology units made up of 62 gynaecologists or trainees allocated at random to intervention group - three, or control group - 3. Intervention An educational strategy that included dissemination of evidence-based guidelines via a problembased interactive workshop facilitated by an opinion leader and a laminated algorithm and guidelines. Main outcome measures The number of <b>hysteroscopies</b> and/or dilatation and curettages performed for DUB on women 40 years or less, clinician behaviour change and perceived booking rates of the procedure. Results At six months, there was no significant effect on the number of <b>hysteroscopies</b> and/or dilatation and curettages performed but there was an increase in evidence-based behaviour.

50|$|In <b>hysteroscopy,</b> the {{diameter}} of the hysteroscope is generally too large to conveniently pass the cervix directly, thereby necessitating cervical dilation to be performed prior to insertion. Cervical dilation can be performed by temporarily stretching the cervix with a series of (cervical) dilators of increasing diameter. Misoprostol prior to <b>hysteroscopy</b> for cervical dilation appears to facilitate an easier and uncomplicated procedure only in premenopausal women.|$|E
50|$|Polyps can be surgically removed using {{curettage}} with {{or without}} <b>hysteroscopy.</b> When curettage is performed without <b>hysteroscopy,</b> polyps may be missed. To reduce this risk, the uterus can be first explored using grasping forceps {{at the beginning of}} the curettage procedure. <b>Hysteroscopy</b> involves visualising the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) and polyp with a camera inserted through the cervix. If it is a large polyp, it can be cut into sections before each section is removed. If cancerous cells are discovered, a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) may be performed. A hysterectomy would usually not be considered if cancer has been ruled out. Whichever method is used, polyps are usually treated under general anesthetic.|$|E
