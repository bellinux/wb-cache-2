5|$|A {{panel of}} MPs began {{the task of}} going through over 40,000 {{documents}} related to Afghan detainees on 10 July 2010. The MPs, consisting of one member and one alternate from the Liberal, Conservative and Bloc parties, determines what <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> to the allegations of abuse. An independent panel of jurists determines how documents will be released publicly, in some cases censoring documents that may threaten national security, international relations, or soldiers in Afghanistan. This panel consists of Frank Iacobucci, fellow former Supreme Court justice Claire L'Heureux-Dubé and former B.C. Supreme Court judge Donald Brenner. Any documents that the government claims to contain legal advice may force the panel to determine whether to allow the MPs to see them.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Second Law asserts {{the direct}} {{proportionality}} of acceleration to {{force and the}} inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain {{as to what is}} the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of an en passant capture <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> to claims of a draw by threefold repetition. Two positions whose pieces are {{all on the same}} squares, with the same player to move, are for this purpose considered different if there was an opportunity to make an enpassant capture in the first position, and of course that opportunity no longer exists the second time the same configuration of pieces occurs.|$|E

5|$|Since {{free speech}} may be {{exercised}} during assemblies and gatherings, Article 14(1)(b) of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of assembly, <b>is</b> <b>relevant.</b> Prior to October 2009, the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act ("PEMA") required a licence to {{be obtained from}} the Public Entertainments Licensing Unit (PELU) of the Singapore Police Force before talks, discussions or similar events open to the public were held. Holding an event without a licence would result in a fine or imprisonment. Members of opposition parties claimed that PELU acted inconsistently in issuing licences, and that they had been denied licences without reason. The Workers' Party was fined $800 after a dinner event in 1986, at which the Party's Secretary-General J.B. Jeyaretnam had given a speech. PELU decreed that since the publicly delivered speech had been unrelated to the festivities, a separate licence from the dinner itself was needed. In addition, the Act exempted public entertainments provided by or {{under the auspices of the}} Government, thus allowing MPs from the ruling PAP to speak without a licence in their capacity as grassroots advisors.|$|E
5|$|The parity of zero <b>is</b> <b>relevant</b> to odd–even rationing, {{in which}} cars may drive or {{purchase}} gasoline on alternate days, {{according to the}} parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E
