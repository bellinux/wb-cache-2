50|$|Fishing and oyster {{industries}} {{were established}} in the 1880s, with prawn trawling pioneered in the 1940s. Sugar cane farming is now the major cropping industry in the region following <b>full</b> <b>mechanisation</b> of the cane cutting process in 1978. Riverboats and steamers that plied between Grafton and Sydney were gradually replaced by rail and better road connections and from the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The mine is also {{important}} in demonstrating the development of mining technology insofar that it illustrates a transitional phase between hand mining methods and <b>full</b> <b>mechanisation.</b> The practise of sorting and sizing of coal by hand, commonly at the coalface, ceased {{with the introduction of}} aboveground screening plants and picking belts. These were used at Acland No 2 Colliery where the picking belt and part of the screen assembly remain intact. Picking belts, in turn, were rendered obsolete by mechanical washing plants such as jigs.|$|E
50|$|Meidenmolen {{was built}} in 1855 to drain the Dwergsmear Polder. In 1953, the water board decided to fully mechanise the mill. Meetings held on 27 December 1961 and 13 March 1962 {{resulted}} in the mill being assisted by an electric motor, but <b>full</b> <b>mechanisation</b> was not carried out. The mill was restored in 1966. The mill was sold to Stichting De Fryske Mole (Frisian Mills Foundation) on 4 May 1976. Further restorations were carried out in 1978 and 1994, the latter {{was carried out by}} millwright Thijs Jellema of Birdaard. In 2004 a new steel Archimedes' screw was fitted. In 2006, the mill was officially listed as being held in reserve for use in an emergency.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} mechanisation and computerisation in the Midland Bank from 1945 to 1975. It {{concentrates on the}} human resources available to the bank to manage technical change. The Midland was slow to realise the <b>full</b> potential of <b>mechanisation</b> but introduced computers very successfully. Batch-processing, second generation systems were introduced in major conurbations, producing staff savings and reliable performance without disrupting work practices: However, the Midland developed limited specialist management resources, {{in part because the}} ease of early computerisation. Short of specialist managers, the Midland was unable to manage the huge leap in complexity associated with third generation systems. Accordingly, the introduction of on-line, real-time computing was badly delayed and the Midland board henceforth adopted a more conservative approach to technical change. banking, mechanisation, computerisation, labour process, human resources, business knowledge,...|$|R
50|$|Not {{only did}} the Long Depression grip world {{agriculture}} for {{almost a quarter of}} a century, but any relief was slight and temporary. After World War I, the even deeper Great Depression was to place more pressure on agriculture. Moreover, there were changes in farming techniques that tended to drive down employment even when the market was good. Boscobel House has a good selection of late Victorian and early 20th century far machinery. Still horse-powered, it is nevertheless ingenious and substantial, and manufactured already in the Uttoxeter area or along the Humber, not locally. It had the power to displace many labourers. A simple potato plough, for example, could harvest several acres a day, undermining the bargaining power of labourers at precisely {{the time of year when}} it was traditionally strongest, and starving families of the little extra, often earned by women and children, that cleared debts and kept their heads above water. When less successful farmers sold out to the more efficient, the effect was irreversible: employers did not sacrifice efficiencies of scale when the times were better. By 1940, eleven of the farms exceeded 150 acres - very different from the small holdings of one and two centuries earlier - and the <b>full</b> effects of <b>mechanisation</b> and scientific agriculture were yet to be felt.|$|R
5000|$|In France, {{the second}} largest tank producer, {{mechanisation}} was motivated by a need to compensate for severe manpower shortages due to a collapsed birth rate during World War I. This {{led to the development}} of a vast range of specialised armoured vehicles, not just tanks but also armoured cars, self-propelled guns, mechanised artillery, armoured tractors, armoured supply vehicles, armoured artillery observation vehicles, armoured command vehicles, half-tracks, and fully tracked armoured personnel carriers. As the mechanisation progressed, slowly the French armour doctrine began to reflect the increased capacity, evolving from direct infantry support, to independent breakthrough and eventually envelopment with the Infantry, and to deep strategic exploitation with the Cavalry.Despite the increase in tank numbers, in all countries financial constraints prohibited a <b>full</b> <b>mechanisation</b> of the entire armed ground forces. Necessarily, most of the divisions still consisted of infantry that was not even motorised. As a result, tanks tended to be allotted to special armoured units, where the limited and expensive expert maintenance and training capacity could be concentrated. Only the Soviet Union had enough tanks to equip an organic tank battalion in each infantry division. Nevertheless, this country was the first to create large armoured units: in 1934 two Mechanised Corps were formed of 430 tanks each. In July 1935, in France the 4th Cavalry Division was transformed into the 1e Division Légère Mécanique, the first French armoured division of the Cavalry. In Germany, after the Nazi Regime started open rearmament in March 1935, on 15 October 1935 three Panzerdivisionen were formed. Though some tank brigades were part of the Cavalry or Infantry arm, most German tanks were concentrated into a special branch, from 1936 called the Panzerwaffe. The precise interpretation of this phenomenon has proven controversial among military historians. Traditionally, it has been seen as part of a [...] "Blitzkrieg strategy" [...] of swift world conquest by means of armoured forces. Later it has been argued, among others by Karl-Heinz Frieser, that the German army in the 1930s did not even possess an explicit Blitzkrieg tactical doctrine, let alone strategy. This would have been reflected by the relatively unimpressive rate of tank production and development. During the 1930s the United Kingdom gave priority to the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. The British Army began the conversion of its cavalry from horse to tanks and all but a few regiments were fully converted by 1939. The British First Armoured Division was formed, as the [...] "Mobile Division", in November 1937.|$|E
