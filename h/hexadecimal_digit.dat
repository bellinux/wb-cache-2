25|$|Hexadecimal numerals {{are widely}} used by {{computer}} system designers and programmers. As each <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>digit</b> represents four binary digits (bits), it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. One <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>digit</b> represents a nibble (4 bits), which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, but this may be more conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.|$|E
500|$|This formula, unlike {{others before}} it, can produce any {{individual}} <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>digit</b> of [...] without calculating all the preceding digits. Individual binary digits may be extracted from individual hexadecimal digits, and octal digits can be extracted {{from one or}} two hexadecimal digits. Variations of the algorithm have been discovered, but no digit extraction algorithm has yet been found that rapidly produces decimal digits. An important application of digit extraction algorithms is to validate new claims of record [...] computations: After a new record is claimed, the decimal result is converted to hexadecimal, and then a digit extraction algorithm {{is used to calculate}} several random hexadecimal digits near the end; if they match, this provides a measure of confidence that the entire computation is correct.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} (IEEE 802) {{format for}} printing MAC-48 addresses in human-friendly form is six groups of two <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>digits,</b> separated by hyphens (-) in transmission order (e.g. 01-23-45-67-89-ab).This form is also commonly used for EUI-64 (e.g. 01-23-45-67-89-ab-cd-ef).Other conventions include six groups of two <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>digits</b> separated by colons (:) (e.g. 01:23:45:67:89:ab), and {{three groups of}} four <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>digits</b> separated by dots (.)

See hexadecimal for more details). The remainder gives us the second <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>digit.</b> For instance the RGB value 201 divides into twelve groups of sixteen, thus the first digit is C.
