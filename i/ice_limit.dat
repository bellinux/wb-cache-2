25|$|Ice is {{a hazard}} to sailors venturing far below 40° south. Although the <b>ice</b> <b>limit</b> dips south around the horn, icebergs are a {{significant}} hazard for vessels in the area. In the South Pacific in February (summer in Southern Hemisphere), icebergs are generally confined to below 50° south; but in August the iceberg hazard can extend north of 40° south. Even in February, the Horn is well below the latitude of the iceberg limit. These hazards have made the Horn notorious as perhaps the most dangerous ship passage in the world; many ships were wrecked, and many sailors died attempting to round the Cape.|$|E

40|$|The easternmost {{extremity}} {{of the ice}} {{cap that}} developed in the Tasmanian Central Highlands {{during the time of}} most extensive Late Cainozoic glaciation lay on the doleritecapped Central Plateau east and north-east of Lake St Clair. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the more restricted ice cover included a small discrete ice cap (probably less than 250 ± 300 m thick) that formed on the Central Plateau. The LGM <b>ice</b> <b>limits</b> on {{the southern part of the}} Central Plateau, including all five southern outlet valleys, are reported here. Earlier <b>ice</b> <b>limits</b> have been identifed in two of these valleys, but on the plateau proper earlier glacial deposits have been generally extensively reworked beyond the LGM limit, such that confirmation of a glacial origin for diamictons on slopes is difficult. South of the plateau, the oldest deposits fooring lower reaches of two outlet valleys indicate that ice flowed southwards directly from the plateau, but later deposits indicate diffluent flow from the Derwent Glacier...|$|R

50|$|From its {{inception}} until {{the beginning of}} World War II, the Ice Patrol was conducted from two surface patrol cutters alternating surveillance patrols of the southern <b>ice</b> <b>limits.</b> In 1931 and thereafter a third ship was assigned to Ice Patrol to perform oceanographic observations {{in the vicinity of the}} Grand Banks. After World War II, aerial surveillance became the primary ice reconnaissance method with surface patrols phased out except during unusually heavy ice years or extended periods of reduced visibility. Use of the oceanographic vessel continued until 1982, when the Coast Guard's sole remaining oceanographic ship, , was converted to a medium endurance cutter. The aircraft has distinct advantages for ice reconnaissance providing much greater coverage in a relatively short period of time.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{palaeoclimate}} reconstructions provide {{data for}} evaluating the mechanisms of past, natural climate variability. Geometries of former mountain glaciers, constrained by moraine mapping, afford the opportunity to reconstruct palaeoclimate, due to the close relationship between ice extent and local climate. In this study, we present results {{from a series of}} experiments using a 2 -D coupled energy balance–ice flow model that investigate the palaeoclimate significance of Last Glacial Maximum moraines within nine catchments in the central North Island, New Zealand. We find that the former <b>ice</b> <b>limits</b> can be simulated when present-day temperatures are reduced by between 4 and 7  °C, if precipitation remains unchanged from present. The spread in the results between the nine catchments is likely to represent the combination of chronological and model uncertainties. The majority of catchments targeted require temperature decreases of 5. 1 to 6. 3  °C to simulate the former glaciers, which represents our best estimate of the temperature anomaly in the central North Island, New Zealand, during the Last Glacial Maximum. A decrease in precipitation of up to 25  % from present, as suggested by proxy evidence and climate models, increases the magnitude of the required temperature changes by up to 0. 8  °C. Glacier model experiments using reconstructed topographies that exclude the volume of post-glacial ([*]<[*]  15  ka) volcanism generally increased the magnitude of cooling required to simulate the former <b>ice</b> <b>limits</b> by up to 0. 5  °C. Our palaeotemperature estimates expand the spatial coverage of proxy-based quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions in New Zealand. Our results are also consistent with independent, proximal temperature reconstructions from fossil groundwater and pollen assemblages, as well as similar glacier modelling reconstructions from the central Southern Alps, which suggest air temperatures were ca. 6  °C lower than present across New Zealand during the Last Glacial Maximum...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{summarized}} recent NASA research into scaling of SLD conditions {{with data from}} both SLD and Appendix C tests. Scaling results obtained by applying existing scaling methods for size and test-condition scaling will be reviewed.

Within {{the limits of the}} conditions tested to date, the results show that the similarity parameters needed for Appendix C scaling also can be used for SLD scaling, and no additional parameters are required. These results were based on visual comparisons of reference and scale ice shapes. Nearly all of the experimental results presented have been obtained in sea-level tunnels. The currently recommended methods to scale model size, <b>icing</b> <b>limit</b> and test conditions are described...|$|R
