50|$|Schmidlin {{became an}} agent for the London {{electrical}} firm of Karl Schall from RGS, Reiniger, Gebbert & Schall. Of interest to note, Schall {{just happened to be}} Schmidlin's brother-in-law. With the connection to Schall, Schmidlin became an initial importer and supplier of X-ray coils and tubes into Sydney for the medical practitioners. In the early days with this new technological advancement, the supplier of X-ray apparatus became the expert and the demonstrator. Schmidlin operated in the capacity as demonstrator and instructor for several years. He trained the medical men in the electrics of the new techniques. Beginning in June 1896, Schmidlin and his expertise as radiographer with x-ray apparatus were requested by surgeons for locating foreign bodies. His equipment consisted of a 6-inch coil, a 6 cell bichromate battery configuration and Crookes <b>Focus</b> <b>Tube,</b> and on occasion necessitated that a 30-minute exposure be applied. With this apparatus, he produced successful negatives.|$|E
50|$|Another such {{demonstration}} of the expertise of Schmidlin and witnessed by prominent medical men of the day, was recorded in the 22 August 1896 issue of The Town and Country Journal.The Rontgen Rays. Successful Use at Sydney Hospital.A series of interesting experiments with the Rontgen rays were completed at Sydney Hospital {{on the afternoon of}} August 14 by Mr. Schmidlin, electrician of Elizabeth - street. Under a 6 in Rumkorff induction coil and a Crookes <b>focus</b> <b>tube</b> previously exhausted, he photographed, or more properly speaking, shadowgraphed the bullet wound {{on the inside of the}} right thigh of Frederick Atcheson, the victim of the Tilpa shooting case. Mr. Schmidlin used extra rapid full plates, and allowed half an hour exposure in each case. The plate, wrapped in specially prepared silk and paper to protect it against the natural light, was placed immediately beneath the patient’s leg on the opposite side to the wound. Then the wound itself was laid bare, and with the patient stretched at full length in bed, and perfectly at ease, the fluorescent rays were flashed intermittently, and a splendid shadowgraph picture was the result. The bones of the leg were clearly defined, and the bullet itself equally so. A second exposure from a slightly different position was afterwards taken with another full plate for the purpose of showing the exact angle of the embedded bullet. Atcheson was placed under chloroform, and Dr. Bowker cut into the wound and removed the bullet with ease. The patient, said the doctors present, is necessarily subject to the usual dangers arising from surgery, but as an operation, success was complete and emphatic. Those who witnessed the removal were Drs. McCormick, Goode, Chisholm, Binnie (medical superintendent of Sydney Hospital) and others, including the resident medical staff of the institution. - The Town and Country Journal.|$|E
5000|$|Sutton then {{explained}} the apparatus he had prepared to demonstrate. The contraption consisted {{of an electric}} battery and large induction coil which provided the electric current to illuminate the Crookes <b>focus</b> <b>tube.</b> He asked the audience to observe an ordinary vacuum tube or Geissler tube. He passed electric current through the tube, a large three-bulb tube, and the tube was instantly filled with the well-known phosphorescent glow. Sutton remarked that X-rays were emanating from the tube, but the rays were so diffuse as to be of no effect. Next, the Geissler tube {{was replaced by a}} Crookes tube. Electric current was passed through the Crookes tube. He explained that the Crookes tube had [...] "a more complete vacuum" [...] and [...] "other improvements made". Sutton explained that it was necessary to make additional improvements and refinements in the vacuum tube which required [...] "a more complete vacuum". The final step involved an arrangement of aluminium and platinum discs utilized to focus the X-rays. Further recollections of the evening:"Having thus {{explained the}} apparatus, Mr. Sutton made several exposures of plates with remarkably good results. One interesting exposure was a collection of various articles, offering various degrees of opacity to the rays. The development of the plates was admirably carried out by Mr. Ferguson under circumstances decidedly unfavourable to such delicate work, with capital results. The exhibition of articles on the fluorescent screen, where the wonderful effects of the X-rays were at once visible, called forth frequent applause. Coins placed in a cigar case were plainly seen, and so were similar articles placed between two-inch thick deal boards, or {{in the middle of a}} thick book. Neither the wood nor the paper seemed to offer much resistance to the light. The proceedings were terminated by a hearty vote of thanks to the lecturer and demonstrator." ...|$|E

The most significant result of the tests is that a comparison among tubes with a similar number of stages (or gain) showed that the magnetically focused intensifiers were generally superior to the electrostatically focused intensifiers in resolving power, geometrical distortion, and uniformity of response. However, the electrostatically <b>focused</b> <b>tubes</b> exhibited only about one fifth the light- induced background of the magnetic tubes.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a {{comprehensive study of}} the ice particle production process through experimentation and numerical methods using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{that can be used}} to produce ice particles with controlled temperature and hardness for use in ice jet (IJ) process for industrial applications. The analytical and numerical modeling for the heat exchanger system are developed that could predict the heat, mass and momentum exchange between the cold gas and water droplets. Further, the feasibility study of the deployment of ice particles produced from the ice jet system for possible cleaning and blasting applications are analyzed numerically. Although the use of Abrasive Water Jet (AWJ) technology in cutting, cleaning, machining and surface processing is a very successful industrial process, a considerable amount of secondary particle waste and contamination impingement by abrasive materials has been an important issue in AWJ process. Some alternate cryogenic jet methods involving vanishing abrasive materials, such as plain liquid nitrogen or carbon dioxide have been tried for these applications, but they also suffer from certain drawbacks relating to the quality, safety, process control and materials handling. The use of ice jet process involving minute ice particles has received relatively little attention in industrial applications. Some researches have concentrated on the studies of effects of Ice Jet outlet parameters of the nozzle and <b>focus</b> <b>tube</b> for machining soft and brittle materials. Most of the work in this area is qualitative and researchers have paid a cursory attention to the ice particles temperature and the efficiency of production of these particles. An extensive investigation to gain insight knowledge into the formulation of ice formation process parameters is required in arriving at a deeper understanding of the entire ice jet process for production application. Experimental investigations were focussed on the measurement of ice particle temperature, phase transitions, ice particle diameter, coalescence and hardness test. The change in ice particle diameter from the inlet conditions to the exit point of the heat exchanger wasinvestigated using the experimental results. These observations were extended to numerical analysis of temperature variations of ice particles at different planes inside the custom built heat exchanger. The numerical predictions were carried out with the aid of visualization studies and temperature measurement results from experiments. The numerical models were further analysed to find out the behaviour of ice particles in the transportation stage, the mixing chamber of the nozzle and <b>focus</b> <b>tube.</b> This was done to find out whether the methodology used in this research is feasible and if it can be used in applications such as cleaning, blasting, drilling and perhaps cutting. The results of the empirical studies show that ice particles of desired temperature and hardness could be produced successfully with the current novel design of the heat exchanger. At the optimum parameters, ice particles could be produced below - 60 0;C, with hardness of particles comparable to gypsum (Moh's hardness of 1. 5 to 3). The visualization studies of the process assisted in observation of the phases of ice at various points along the heat exchanger. The results of numerical analysis were found to agree well with the experiments and were supported by the statistical model assessments. Numerical analyses also show the survival of ice particles at the nozzle exit even with high-pressure, high-velocity water/air mixture...|$|E
