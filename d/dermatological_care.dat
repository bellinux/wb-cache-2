40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were threefold: to determine the prevalence of skin diseases among primary school children in the UAE; to assess the ability of the primary health care physicians (PCPs) to diagnose skin diseases; and to plan a dermatological education program for children of the UAE. An epidemiological survey included the clinical examination of selected school children by two quantified dermatologists and the relationships between the prevalence of skin diseases and a range of hygiene and socioeconomic factors were examined. 1536 Local schoolchildren aged 6 - 9 years were included. The prevalence of common skin diseases in the children was 19 %. The most common skin diseases included: dermatitis (8. 1 %), viral diseases (3. 8 %), and pigmentation disorders (1. 7 %). Selected skin diseases showed significant associations with a range of socioeconomic and hygiene factors on multivariate analyses. Physicians were better at correctly diagnosing common skin diseases compared with the less frequent, or rare skin diseases. Finally, PCPs with specific training in dermatology showed more ability to diagnose a range of skin diseases compared with those with no relevant training. Based on the results of this study, an improvement in socioeconomic and personal hygiene conditions along with the initiation of pertinent educational programs for children, patients and teachers may reduce the prevalence of some skin disorders. Important aspects of such <b>dermatological</b> health <b>care</b> programs are proposed. In addition, specific dermatological training for PCPs should be considered to increase their ability to diagnose and manage common skin diseases in children.

40|$|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Because {{the skin}} is the only organ {{completely}} accessible to visual examination, digital technology has therefore {{attracted the attention of}} dermatologists for documenting, monitoring, measuring and classifying morphological manifestations. To describe a digital image management system dedicated to <b>dermatological</b> health <b>care</b> environments and to compare it with other existing softwares for digital image storage. METHODS: We designed a reliable hardware structure that could ensure future scaling, because storage needs tend to grow exponentially. For the software, we chose a client-web server application based on a relational database and with a 'minimalist' user interface. RESULTS: We developed a software with a ready-made, adaptable index of skin pathologies. It facilitates classification by pathology, patient and visit, with an advanced search option allowing access to all images according to personalized criteria. The software also offers the possibility of comparing two or more digital images (follow-up). The fact that the archives of years of digital photos acquired and saved on PCs can easily be entered in the program distinguishes it from the others in the market. This option is fundamental for accessing all the photos taken in years of practice in the program without entering them one by one. The program is available to any user connected to the local Intranet and the system may directly be available in the future from the Internet. CONCLUSIONS: All clinics and surgeries, especially those that rely on digital images, are obliged to keep up with technological advances. It is therefore hoped that our project will become a model for medical structures intending to rationalise digital and other data according to statutory requirements...|$|R
40|$|A {{picture is}} worth more than a {{thousand}} words’ - (Mann & Colven, University of Washington Medical School), that simply can justify the necessity of teledermatology. In this paper, five information technology (IT) efforts in the field of teledermatology that based on skin image transmission procedure and their historical transformations in context of the notions of information infrastructures and actor-network theory have been discussed. The main purpose of these efforts was to decentralize specialist’s services to the GP, nurses or district levels. Among the five efforts, only in one effort namely DMS Nord Troms, added telemedicine tool of the UNN creates virtual hospital, decentralized regional healthcare services. This thesis paper tries to figure out the contents of dermatologic e-health services in North Norway from the mid 1980 s onwards; the problems involved in previously non-sustainable and related some <b>dermatological</b> heath <b>care</b> services. Some of these services have been quite successful, such as Videoconferencing among UNN and Kirkenes, Hammerfest, Nordeisa etc. The paper applies some notions of theoretical approach whether they may be helpful to address the challenges in establishing sustainable telemedicine services in case of dermatology. Furthermore, the paper points out the actual strategy for establishing teledermatological services from the perspectives of different historical transformation. In this interpretive study based thesis, fifteen interviews have been conducted to illustrate the five teledermatological efforts. Five teledermatological efforts were started with high motivation to reach their final goals. But four of them had not been sustainable due to finishing of funding or lacking control for the integrated nature of technology. The thesis concludes that e-health services of teledermatology should be very much linked into practice. The efforts should be evaluated through the lens of practice oriented processes or approaches such as information infrastructure or actor-network theory...|$|R

Due to their abundance, these species can be exploited as sustainable sources of botanical materials and include Carapa guianensis Aubl., family Meliaceae; Eperua falcata Aubl., family Fabaceae; Quassia amara L., family Simaroubaceae; and Attalea speciosa Mart. and Oenocarpus bataua Mart., family Arecaceae. For each species, the general features, major constituents, overall medicinal properties, detailed <b>dermatological</b> and skin <b>care</b> applications, and possible harmful effects have been considered. The major products include seed oils from A. speciosa and C. guianensis, fruit oil from O. bataua, and active compounds such as limonoids from C. guianensis, flavonoids from E. falcata, and quassinoids from Q. amara. The dermatologic and cosmetic applications of these plants are growing rapidly but are still widely based on empiric knowledge. Applications include skin rehydration and soothing; anti-inflammatory, antiage, and antiparasite effects; hair care; burn and wound healing; and the amelioration of rosacea and psoriasis conditions.

40|$|Hydrogels {{have been}} long {{considered}} as a favorable biomaterial to cover topical wounds or close surgical incisions in dermatology because of their good biocompatibility and structural similarity with the aqueous environment of extracellular matrix. Their high water content and porous structure are biologically beneficial but these properties result in low mechanical strength and lack of adhesion to natural tissues. These deficiencies {{make it difficult for}} patients and health professionals to apply hydrogel dressings on acute wounds and deep burns. Approaches that can enhance both mechanical and adhesive properties of hydrogels will improve their applications in dressings and bandages to skin when immediate wound care or closure is necessary. ^ This dissertation will focus on engineering the mechanical and adhesive properties of hydrogels for <b>dermatological</b> and wound <b>care</b> applications. The synthesis and formulation of nanocomposite hydrogels with both physically and covalently crosslinked networks will be presented along with elastomeric and adhesive property characterization. The resulting hydrogels can be extensively deformed and adhere to various surfaces such as metal, glass, collagen sheet and skin. The adhesive properties and deformability of the hydrogels are useful for the further development of robust hydrogels that adhere to skin and wounded tissue upon contact. We expect these hydrogels to have potential for dermatological applications including adhesive transdermal patches, temporary wound covers or hydrogel bandages for skin regeneration. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} tasks {{required}} of dermatologists {{has increased in}} the last decade. This article discusses potential ways to enhance the efficiency ofdermatological patient care and prevent problems of capacity. A study conducted in the UK found that, for the top 10 skin disorders, the accessibility of general practitioners with special expertise in dermatology was better {{than that of the}} dermatology clinic. Waiting times were considerably shorter with the general practitioners, but care was more expensive. Outcomes were similar for these skin disorders in terms of disease-specific quality of life. The study made no comment on the actual diagnostic ability of the specialised general practitioners. Teledermatology can reduce the number of referrals to a dermatologist by half. However, a considerable percentage of teledermatological consultations result in a different diagnosis than that obtained during a standard 'in vivo' consultation. Teledermatology can be a useful option for the follow-up of patients with ulcus cruris. The efficiency of <b>dermatological</b> <b>care</b> can be increased by working in teams. Dermatological nurses can be trained and conduct their own consultations under the supervision of a dermatologist. <b>Dermatological</b> <b>care</b> can also be organised in regional cooperative groups with general practitioners.

(i) To evaluate the dimensional structure of the CQI-CSD, (ii) to assess its ability to distinguish between hospitals according to patients' experiences with {{quality of care}}, (iii) to explore patients' experiences with <b>dermatological</b> <b>care</b> and priorities for quality improvement according to the patients, and (iv) to optimize the questionnaire based on psychometric results and stakeholders' input. In a cross-sectional study 5647 adult patients who received <b>dermatological</b> <b>care</b> in the past 12 months in 20 hospitals were randomly selected and invited to fill out the questionnaire. Overall 1160 of 3989 eligible respondents (29 % response rate, 30 - 87 per hospital) were included for analysis. The CQI-CSD comprised seven scales with high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0 · 74 - 0 · 92). The instrument's discriminative power was limited. Patients were positive about the care provided by nurses and doctors, but the provision of information by healthcare providers, accessibility of care and patient involvement could be improved.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} teledermatology on efficiency, quality and costs of care following selection in the general practitioner's practice. Prospective cohort study. Teledermatology was used by general practitioners in a self-selected group of patients. Efficiency of care was measured {{on the basis of}} {{decrease in the number of}} referrals to the dermatologist. Quality was assessed on the basis of the number of teledermatology consultations (TDCs) conducted to obtain advice that resulted in actual referral to the dermatologist, the dermatologist's response time, the usefulness of the dermatologist's response, and the educational effect experienced by the general practitioner. Costs of teledermatology and conventional <b>dermatological</b> <b>care</b> were compared on the basis of the percentage of referrals that had been prevented, the average standard charge for a single out-patient visit for the most common diagnoses and the current standard charges for teledermatology. Between March 2007 and September 2010 TDCs were conducted by 1, 821 general practitioners and 166 dermatologists; 37, 207 TDCs were included in this study. The most commonly diagnosed abnormalities were eczema, infectious conditions and benign tumours. In cases where teledermatology was used to prevent a physical referral (n = 26, 596), 74 % of referrals to the dermatologist were actually prevented. 10, 611 TDCs were conducted in order to obtain advice; 16 % of these resulted in a physical referral to the dermatologist. In the total population 68 % of referrals were prevented by TDCs. The mean dermatologist response time was 4. 6 hours. General practitioners experienced an educational effect in 86 % of the TDCs, and 88 % found the dermatologist's response to be useful. The estimated cost reduction was 18 %. Teledermatology contributed to an improvement in <b>dermatological</b> <b>care</b> at lower cost. We are therefore of the opinion that teledermatology deserves a place as a new referral pathway to secondary car...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{pruritus}} is a frequently occurring {{symptom of}} various dermatoses that causes a high burden and impaired quality of life. An effective anti pruritic therapy {{is important for}} the patient, but its effectiveness is difficult to evaluate. Diverse methods and interpretations of pruritic metrics are utilized in clinical trials and the daily clinical practice in different countries, resulting in difficulties comparing collected data. METHODS: We founded a European Network on Assessment of Severity and Burden of Pruritus (PruNet) that is supported by the EADV. PruNet consists of 28 experts from 15 EU countries (21 dermatologists, 5 medical informaticists, 2 psychologists) and aims to unify the assessment of itch in routine <b>dermatological</b> <b>care.</b> Following a preliminary survey, a consensus conference was held in order to agree upon the prioritization of patient-reported outcome tools.

This group is therefore at risk for undiagnosed and untreated dermatological disease including inflammatory dermatoses and skin cancer. Methods: Two large aged care facilities providing both low level (residential) and high level (hospital) care were selected for this cross-sectional study. Each participant underwent a full dermatological examination. In addition, functional and cognitive status were assessed using the Rehabilitation Complexity Scale and Abbreviated Mental Test score. Results: 88 participants were recruited and 81. 8 % {{were found to have}} at least one significant condition. Inflammatory disease was more common in those with little physical disability compared to those with serious physical disability (odds ratio 3. 69; 95 % CI 1. 1 - 12. 6, p= 0. 04). No significant association was found between skin disease and cognitive impairment. Conclusion: A high rate of dermatological disease was found. Findings ranged from frequent but not lifethreatening conditions (e. g. onychomycosis), to those associated with a significant morbidity (e. g. eczema, lichen sclerosus and bullous pemphigoid), to potentially life-threatening (e. g. squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and breast cancer).

Little {{is known about}} the profile of these lesions compared to the profile of lesions diagnosed by conventional routes of public <b>dermatological</b> <b>care.</b> OBJECTIVE: To identify if basal {{cell carcinoma}}s identified in prevention campaigns and referred to surgery are smaller than those routinely removed in a same medical institution. METHODS: Cross-sectional study including tumors routed from 2011 - 2014 campaigns and 84 anatomopathological reports of outpatients. RESULTS: The campaigns identified 223 individuals with suspicious lesions among 2, 531 examinations (9 %), with 116 basal cell carcinomas removed. Anatomopathological examinations revealed that the primary lesions identified in the national campaigns were smaller than those referred to surgery by the conventional routes of public health care (28 [13 - 50] x 38 [20 - 113] mm 2, p < 0. 01). On the other hand, after a mean follow-up of 15. 6 ± 10. 3 months, 31 % of cases identified in campaigns showed new basal cell carcinoma lesions.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to examine and {{integrate}} patient reported outcomes (PROs) in <b>dermatological</b> <b>care.</b> In part I, we specifically examined health-related quality of life (HRQoL), treatment satisfaction, and experiences with care in patients with chronic skin diseases. Our results indicated that patients with a chronic skin disease experienced an impaired HRQoL, were only moderately satisfied with their treatment, although satisfaction among psoriasis patients varied across treatment types, and were generally positive about their care. Based on our results, we made several suggestions to improve quality of care, for instance to focus on improving doctor-patient communication and information provision. In part II, we developed and tested two eHealth applications to integrate PROs in dermatological practice: 1) PROM portal Dermatology, a web-based application to electronically assess PROs in dermatological practice, and 2) E-learning Quality of Life, a web-based, educational, HRQoL intervention for patients with a chronic skin disease. Our {{results indicated that the}} two eHealth applications are relevant in the opinion of important stakeholders. However, implementation in clinical practice and patients’ daily life remains difficult. To optimize implementation, we recommend an implementation process involving all stakeholders using a plan-do-study-act approach.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease of multifactorial etiology, with participation of genetic, autoimmune and environmental factors. Recent {{studies have demonstrated}} the role of inflammatory cells and mediators in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, which is now defined as a systemic and autoimmune inflammatory disease that {{may be associated with}} other diseases of inflammatory nature. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the occurrence of obesity and dyslipidemia in patients with psoriasis treated at a dermatology clinic in Manaus. METHODS: We performed a prospective descriptive study to assess the prevalence of obesity and dyslipidemia in patients with psoriasis. Besides the recommended <b>dermatological</b> <b>care,</b> a physical examination was performed to measure weight, height and waist circumference. RESULTS: We included 72 patients, 44 (61. 1 %) female and 28 (38. 9 %) male, {{with a mean age of}} 51. 0 years &# 177; 15. 9 years. As for body mass index (BMI), 16 (22. 2 %) were overweight and 20 (27. 8 %) were obese. In the analysis of waist circumference in relation to gender, we found that 79. 5 % of women surveyed had central obesity, a percentage statistically higher than that observed among men (42. 9 %) at the 5 % level of significance (p = 0. 001). Regarding the diagnosis of dyslipidemia, 29 (65. 9 %) females and 22 (78. 6 %) males showed alterations in lipid profile.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{circumstances of the}} diagnosis and access to <b>dermatological</b> <b>care</b> for patients with cutaneous melanoma (CM) and to investigate factors associated with early detection. DESIGN: Retrospective population-based study of incident cases of invasive CM in 2004, using questionnaires to physicians and a survey of cancer registries and pathology laboratories. SETTING: Five regions in northeastern France. PATIENTS: Six hundred fifty-two patients who were referred to dermatologists by general practitioners (group 1) or by other specialists (group 2), who directly consulted a dermatologist for CM (group 3), or who were diagnosed as having CM during a prospective follow-up of nevi (group 4) or when consulting a dermatologist for other diseases (group 5). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Characteristics of patients, tumors, and patients' residence in each group, including the geographical concentration of dermatologists. We performed multivariate analysis of these factors to determine association with Breslow thickness. RESULTS: Age, tumor location, Breslow thickness, ulceration, histological type, and geographical concentration of dermatologists significantly differed among groups. Patients consulting dermatologists directly formed the largest group (45. 1 %). Those referred by general practitioners (26. 1 %) were the oldest and had the highest frequency of thick (> 3 mm), nodular, and/or ulcerated CM. Patients from groups 4 (8. 4 %) and 5 (14. 1 %) had the thinnest CMs. Ulcerated and/or thick tumors were absent in group 4. In multivariate analysis, histological types superficial spreading melanoma and lentigo maligna melanoma, younger age, high concentration of dermatologists, and detection by dermatologists {{were significantly associated with}} thinner CMs. CONCLUSION: Easy access of patients to dermatologists, information campaigns targeting elderly people, and education of general practitioners are complementary approaches to improving early detection...|$|E
40|$|Background: Family {{medicine}} physicians play {{a pivotal}} role in the prevention and early detection of skin cancer. Our objective was to evaluate how family physicians believe their postgraduate training in skin cancer screening and prevention has prepared them for independent practice and to assess the need for enhanced skin lesion teaching in a family medicine residency setting. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey investigating provider demographics, confidence in providing <b>dermatological</b> <b>care,</b> residency training, current medical practice, and skin cancer prevention beliefs was mailed to all family medicine physicians in the state of Iowa as listed in the Iowa Academy of Family Physicians annual directory in 2006 (N[*]=[*] 1069). Results: A total of 575 family medicine physicians completed the survey for an overall response rate of 53. 8 %. Overall, family medicine physicians reported feeling confident in their ability to diagnose skin lesions (83. 2 %), differentiate between benign and malignant lesions (85. 3 %), and perform a biopsy of a lesion (94. 3 %). Only 65 % of surveyed physicians felt that their residency program adequately trained them in diagnosing skin lesions and 65. 7 % of physicians agree that they could have benefited from additional training on skin lesions during residency training. Nearly 90 % of clinicians surveyed believe that skin cancer screenings are the standard of care; however, only 51. 8 % perform skin cancer screening examinations during adult health maintenance visits more than 75 % of the time. The primary reason listed by respondents who said they do not routinely perform skin cancer screenings was inadequate time (68. 2 %). Conclusion: Family medicine physicians in the state of Iowa are confident in evaluating skin lesions. However, they reported a need for additional enhanced, targeted skin lesion education in family medicine residency training programs. Physicians believe that skin cancer screening examination is the standard of care, but find that inadequate time increasingly hinders skin cancer screening during routine health maintenance examinations...|$|E
40|$|Atopic eczema is a hereditarydiseaseof chronicorchronic-relapsing nature characterised by its {{clinical}} picture changing morphologically with {{the age of}} the patient as well as the acuteness of skin manifestations. The manifestations in adolescents and adults tend to persist for a longer period oftime. The remissionof the conditionoccursafterthe 30 thyearoflifeof the patients and diseaserelapsesoccuratprolongedintervals. The most significant manifestation of the disease is severe itching secondarily aggravating the present clinical changes. The therapy of an adult patient suffering from atopic dermatitis is highly specific and ought not to be unilateral and focused on the treatment of single symptoms. It is necessary to follow a complex approach to the problems of the patients and respect their home and working environment as well as their mental state. It is possible to divide the therapy into three basic groups: (1) Basic therapeutic guidelines (elimination of trigger factors, indifferent therapy with emollients, topical antimicrobial and antifungal therapy, diet, treatment ofotherdisorders), (2) Recommended therapy (topical -with antihistami-nics, topical corticoids, poultices, baths, dyes, other topically used preparations, skin cleansing, systemic - antihistaminics, antibiotics, cyclo-sporine A, steroids, phototherapy, photochemotherapy, hospitalisation in daily <b>dermatological</b> <b>care</b> centres, treatment of complications - infec-tions caused by viruses, bacterias, fungi as well as dishidrosis, eczema manifestations, psychotherapy, climatic therapy), (3) Alternative and experimental therapy (essentialfattyacids, Chinese herby, allergen desensitisation, interferon gammaglobuline, thymeextracts, localgammaglo-buline, phosphodiesterase inhibitors) and (4) the group dealing with therapy news: tacrolimus, pimecrolimus. Afterhavingmanagedtotreatthe acute manifestations, it is inevitable to treat the patient continuously which results in the prolongation of remission periods. The patient ought to be capable of mastering the guidelines for integrated skin therapy. What also is of extreme importance is the appropriate working environment of atopic patients (clean environment with no risk of allergisation) and the patient ought to be made acquainted with this fact as well. An erudite dermatologist ought to have sufficient information on available dermatocosmetic preparations and recommend these to the patient as supple-mentary skin care products...|$|E
40|$|Hyperpigmentation is {{a common}} {{dermatological}} complaint that can have profound effect on appearance and quality of life.   Disorders of hyperpigmentation comprise {{a large group of}} skin conditions characterized by an increase of melanin production, increase in density of active melanocytes, abnormal melanin distribution, and/or deposition of exogenous pigments. This cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the impact hyperpigmentation disorders on health-related quality of life and to better understand patient knowledge, approaches, and experiences. The study was conducted on 298 consenting adult patients with a skin related disorder of hyperpigmentation who sought <b>dermatological</b> <b>care</b> at Boston Medical Center (BMC) or East Boston Neighborhood Health Center (EBNHC) from February of 2015 to March of 2016. Patients were anonymously surveyed in order to collect an assortment of information including demographic characteristics, skin condition, health practices, knowledge base, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) (Finlay and Khan 1994) and SDIEQ, a five-item, non-validated, brief health-related quality of life questionnaire (A. Taylor et al. 2008). Disease severity was assessed by Melasma Area Severity Index (MASI), Post Acne Hyperpigmentation Index (PAHPI) and body surface area when appropriate. The mean overall DLQI was 6. 56 (SD 5. 35). In sub-analysis, the mean DLQI in those diagnosed with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation was 7. 89 (SD 0. 61), melasma 6. 75 (SD 0. 45), and other hyperpigmentation disorders 4. 5 (SD 0. 55). The disease type and duration were both factors associated with a change in DLQI scores. The factors associated with a higher likelihood of patients’ knowledge of their diagnosis included a higher level of formal education, younger age, longer duration of having the condition, and current use of sunscreen, which were found to have 2. 4, 2, 3. 7, and 2. 4 significantly higher odds of knowing their diagnosis, respectively. This study found that the overall impact of hyperpigmentation on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was small to moderate; however, about 22 % reported a very large affect on quality of life. Patients with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) and melasma have significantly lower quality of life when compared with other hyperpigmentation disorders. MASI had a significantly weak correlation with DLQI and SDIEQ, demonstrating that disease severity does not predict patient perception and impact on quality of life...|$|E
