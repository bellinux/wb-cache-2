5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is quite terrestrial, hopping with its head held up and body erect; when excited, it will flick its wings and tail. The flight {{consists}} of undulating bounds interspersed with <b>glides.</b>|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight progress is rather indirect. Their flight pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long <b>glides</b> on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E

5|$|The Mascarene {{martin has}} a heavy flight with slow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with <b>glides,</b> and may repeatedly {{return to a}} favourite perch. This martin is often seen perched on wires, and sometimes rests on sandy beaches. The martin roosts in small flocks in bushes, on buildings or on cliffs. Sometimes it is joined at the roost by other birds, such as blue-cheeked bee-eaters in the Seychelles.|$|E
5|$|The pale crag martin's {{flight is}} slow, with rapid wing beats {{interspersed}} with flat-winged <b>glides,</b> {{and it is}} more acrobatic than the larger Eurasian crag martin. It is a quiet bird; the song is a muffled twitter, and other calls include a trrt resembling {{the call of the}} common house martin, a nasal vick, and a high pitched twee contact call.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short <b>glides.</b> When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E

5|$|The pilot lay flat on {{the lower}} wing, as planned, to reduce {{aerodynamic}} drag. As a glide ended, the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through {{an opening in the}} wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the framework. Within a few <b>glides,</b> however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} flies solitarily, {{with wings}} held in a {{dihedral}} position. It <b>glides</b> at a low altitude over wetlands while locating food, and perches on fence posts or on other low perches. When flying, it travels alone and is rarely found in groups. The flight of the lesser yellow-headed {{is an example of}} static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings. This vulture rarely soars high in the air, preferring low altitudes. This bird is believed to be somewhat migratory in response to the changes in water level where it lives. The lesser yellow-headed vulture, like other New World vultures, has the unusual habit of urohidrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them by evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} flies with long <b>glides</b> on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and {{typically}} at a greater height. The {{flight of the}} tawny owl is rather heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff. As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and a fringe {{on the leading edge}} of the outer primaries. Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; great grey, eagle and Ural owls are similar in shape, but much larger.|$|E

50|$|Formulated in 1946, the Home Command <b>Gliding</b> Instructors School (HCGIS) was {{established}} in 1949 at RAF Detling to train Qualified <b>Gliding</b> Instructors for the gliding schools. With the disestablishment of Home Command, HCGIS was split into two <b>Gliding</b> Centres to accommodate the gliding schools {{in the north and}} south of the UK. A further reorganisation amalgamated the <b>Gliding</b> Centres into the Central <b>Gliding</b> School in 1972 at RAF Spitalgate, where it renamed the Air Cadet Central <b>Gliding</b> School (ACCGS) in 1974. In 2009, following the formal approval of the CGS unit badge, the Air Cadet Central <b>Gliding</b> School was renamed the Royal Air Force Central <b>Gliding</b> School and in 2010 restructured under No.1 Elementary Flying Training School.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} wind, lift and sink on best <b>glide</b> speed {{is to move}} the curve within the plot {{by the amount of}} each component. That is, if flying into a headwind, with no {{vertical}} air movement, the curve would move left toward the origin by an amount equal to the velocity of the wind. The effect is the tangent line for best <b>glide</b> speed moves further down the graph for an increasing best <b>glide</b> speed but a lower best <b>glide</b> ratio. Thus, when flying into a head wind, the best <b>glide</b> speed is higher but the best <b>glide</b> ratio is lower. Conversely, for a tail wind, the polar curve moves away from the origin so that best <b>glide</b> speed is lower and the effective <b>glide</b> ratio is improved. In lift, move the curve up for a lower best <b>glide</b> speed and better <b>glide</b> ratio. In sink, move the curve down for a higher best <b>glide</b> speed and a worse <b>glide</b> ratio. The effect is that when flying between thermals, you would slow down in rising air and speed up when encountering sink. Wind with lift/sink would simply move the plot the according amount for each component.|$|R
5|$|These martins are 12–15cm (4.7–5.9in) {{long with}} drab brown or grey plumage {{and a short}} square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and {{outermost}} pairs of feathers. The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes are similar, but juveniles show pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. The species differ in plumage shades and size, Eurasian crag martin being significantly larger than the others. The flight is slow, with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat-winged <b>glides.</b> The songs of these birds are simple twitterings, and contact calls include a high-pitched twee or chi, chi, and a tshir or trrt call {{like that of the}} house martin.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene {{martin is}} a small swallow that has grey-brown underparts {{becoming}} white on the throat and lower abdomen, dark grey-brown upperparts and a slightly forked tail. The underparts are heavily streaked with black. It nests in small colonies anywhere with suitably sheltered sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The nest is a shallow cup of twigs and other plant material, and the normal clutch is two or three brown-spotted white eggs. The incubation and fledging times are unknown. The Mascarene martin has a heavy flight with slow wingbeats interspersed with <b>glides,</b> and frequently perches on wires. It feeds on insects in flight, often hunting low over the ground or vegetation. In eastern Africa, open habitats such as deforested areas are frequently used for hunting. A number of internal and external parasites have been detected in this species.|$|E
5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades <b>glides</b> through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E

5|$|The African river martin feeds in flocks over {{river and}} forest, often far from water. It eats insects, mainly taking winged ants. The flight {{is strong and}} fast, {{interspersed}} with <b>glides.</b> Wintering birds regularly perch on treetops, wires and roofs. The white-eyed river martin feeds on insects, including beetles, which are caught on the wing. Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may take larger insects than other swallows. This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears reluctant to use perches. This behaviour, together with its unusual toe-shape {{and the fact that}} mud was found on the toes of one of the first specimens, suggests that this species may be relatively terrestrial. In winter, it roosts with barn swallows in reedbeds. Pamela C. Rasmussen suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species might be nocturnal or crepuscular, a factor that could make it highly cryptic and thus partly explain how such a distinctive species remained undetected for so long. Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reed-beds might be a contraindication, {{it is possible that the}} birds might not actually have been caught at the roost; or they might be crepuscular, feeding at dawn and dusk; or they might be capable of both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, depending on the season or local circumstances.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>glide</b> plane {{symmetry}}, the symmetry group of an object contains a <b>glide</b> plane operation, and hence the group generated by it. For any symmetry group containing <b>glide</b> plane symmetry, the translation vector of any <b>glide</b> plane operation is one half of {{an element of the}} translation group. If the translation vector of a <b>glide</b> plane operation is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding <b>glide</b> plane symmetry reduces to a combination of reflection symmetry and translational symmetry.|$|R
40|$|It {{turned out}} that the gap {{transfer}} illusion takes place even when the short <b>glide</b> is down to 8 dB below the level of the long <b>glide.</b> This supports our claim that the illusory continuity of the long <b>glide</b> in the gap transfer illusion is different from the continuity illusion in its typical form. It is required for the occurrence of the continuity illusion that the inserted tone be intense enough to be a potential masker of the discontinuous tone (Warren et al., 1999). It is difficult to assume that the long <b>glide</b> can be masked with the short <b>glide</b> less intense than the long <b>glide.</b> Our results may imply a high ability of auditory completion. The gap transfer illusion took place when a discontinuous long <b>glide</b> crossed with a less intense continuous short <b>glide,</b> but there should be a lack of sound energy, up to 8 dB, to fill in the gap of the long <b>glide</b> even if the sound energy of the short <b>glide</b> is allocated to the long <b>glide.</b> We should perceive discontinuity for the temporal dip, but the gap transfer illusion took place in such a stimulus condition, and the long <b>glide</b> was perceived as continuous. Auditory system behaves as if it could generate new energy to fill in the gap...|$|R
