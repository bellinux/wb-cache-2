40|$|Information {{encoded in}} {{networks}} of stationary, interacting spin- 1 / 2 particles is central for many applications ranging from quantum spintronics to quantum information processing. Without control, however, information transfer through such networks is generally inefficient. Currently available control methods {{to maximize the}} transfer fidelities and speeds mainly rely on dynamic control using time-varying fields and often assume <b>instantaneous</b> <b>readout.</b> We present an alternative approach to achieving efficient, high-fidelity transfer of excitations by shaping the energy landscape via the design of time-invariant feedback control laws without recourse to dynamic control. Both <b>instantaneous</b> <b>readout</b> and the more realistic case of finite readout windows are considered. The technique {{can also be used}} to freeze information by designing energy landscapes that achieve Anderson localization. Perfect state or super-optimal transfer and localization are enabled by conditions on the eigenstructure of the system and signature properties for the eigenvectors. Given the eigenstructure enabled by super-optimality, it is shown that feedback controllers that achieve perfect state transfer are, surprisingly, also the most robust with regard to uncertainties in the system and control parameters...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{previous}} work on chalcogenide-glass (ChG) -based radiation sensors is extended {{to include the}} effects of mechanical strain and temperature stress on sensors formed on a flexible polymer substrate. We demonstrate the feasibility of producing inexpensive flexible radiation sensors, which utilize radiation-induced migration of Ag+ ions in germanium selenide (Ge 20 Se 80) films to produce a decrease in resistance of several orders of magnitude between surface electrodes. This change in resistance {{can be related to}} total ionizing dose to give an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>readout</b> of radiation exposure. The ChG films are inherently flexible and this, along with an extremely simple device fabrication process at or near room temperature, allows inexpensive sensor structures to be fabricated on lightweight pliable polymeric substrates such as polyethylene napthalate (PEN). Test samples were irradiated with ionizing radiation (UV light and 60 Cobalt gamma rays). Irradiated samples were subjected to both tensile and compressive stress, and elevated operating temperatures. Stress and exposure to increased ambient temperature had little effect on device resistance. Analysis of the experimental data is supported by the results of COMSOL simulations that model radiation-induced lateral Ag diffusion in ChG...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{computational}} {{model of a}} hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal cell to demonstrate that spine head calcium provides an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>readout</b> at each synapse of the postsynaptic weighted sum of all presynaptic activity impinging on the cell. The form of the readout {{is equivalent to the}} functions of weighted, summed inputs used in neural network learning rules. Within a dendritic layer, peak spine head calcium levels are either a linear or sigmoidal function of the number of coactive synapses, with nonlinearity depending on the ability of voltage spread in the dendrites to reach calcium spike threshold. This is strongly controlled by the potassium A-type current, with calcium spikes and the consequent sigmoidal increase in peak spine head calcium present only when the A-channel density is low. Other membrane characteristics influence the gain of the relationship between peak calcium and the number of active synapses. In particular, increasing spine neck resistance increases the gain due to increased voltage responses to synaptic input in spine heads. Colocation of stimulated synapses on a single dendritic branch also increases the gain of the response. Input pathways cooperate: CA 3 inputs to the proximal apical dendrites can strongly amplify peak calcium levels due to weak EC input to the distal dendrites, but not so strongly vice versa. CA 3 inputs to the basal dendrites can boost calcium levels in the proximal apical dendrites, but the relative electrical compactness of the basal dendrites results in the reverse effect being less significant. These results give pointers as to how to better describe the contributions of pre- and postsynaptic activity in the learning "rules" that apply in these cells. The calcium signal is closer in form to the activity measures used in traditional neural network learning rules than to the spike times used in spike-timing-dependent plasticity...|$|E

5000|$|An angle-of-attack {{indicator}} {{for light}} aircraft, the [...] "AlphaSystemsAOA" [...] and a nearly identical [...] "Lift Reserve Indicator", are both pressure differential instruments that display margin above stall and/or {{angle of attack}} on an <b>instantaneous,</b> continuous <b>readout.</b> The General Technics CYA-100 displays true angle of attack via a magnetically coupled vane. An AOA indicator provides a visual display {{of the amount of}} available lift throughout its slow speed envelope regardless of the many variables that act upon an aircraft. This indicator is immediately responsive to changes in speed, angle of attack, and wind conditions, and automatically compensates for aircraft weight, altitude, and temperature.|$|R
40|$|Recurrent neural {{networks}} are very powerful engines for processing {{information that is}} coded in time, however, many problems with common training algorithms, such as Backpropagation Through Time, remain. Because of this, another important learning setup known as Reservoir Computing has appeared in recent years, where one uses an essentially untrained network to perform computations. Though very successful in many applications, using a random network can be quite inefficient when considering the required number of neurons and the associated computational costs. In this paper we introduce a highly simplified version of Backpropagation Through Time by basically truncating the error backpropagation to one step back in time, and we combine this with the classic Reservoir Computing setup using an <b>instantaneous</b> linear <b>readout.</b> We apply this setup to a spoken digit recognition task and show it to give very good results for small networks...|$|R
40|$|The CMS Beam Radiation Instrumentation and Luminosity (BRIL) {{project is}} {{composed}} of several systems providing the experiment protection from adverse beam conditions while also measuring the online luminosity and beam background. Although the readout bandwidth of the Fast Beam Conditions Monitoring system (BCM 1 F - one of the faster monitoring systems of the CMS BRIL), was sufficient for the initial LHC conditions, the foreseen enhancement of the beams parameters after the LHC Long Shutdown- 1 (LS 1) imposed the upgrade of the system. This paper presents the new BCM 1 F, {{which is designed to}} provide real-time fast diagnosis of beam conditions and <b>instantaneous</b> luminosity with <b>readout</b> able to resolve the 25 ns sub-bunch structure...|$|R
40|$|TileCal is the Tile hadronic {{calorimeter}} of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The LHC upgrade program, {{currently under}} development, will culminate in the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), {{which is expected}} to increase about five times the LHC nominal <b>instantaneous</b> luminosity. The <b>readout</b> electronics of the Tile calorimenter being redesigned introducing a new read-out strategy in order to accommodate the detector to the new HL-LHC parameters. The data generated inside the detector at every bunch crossing will be transmitted to the PreProcessor (PPR) boards before any event selection is applied. The PPRs will be located at off-detector sites. The PPR will be responsible of providing preprocessed trigger information to the ATLAS first level of trigger (L 1). In overall it will represent the interface between the data acquisition, trigger and control systems and the on-detector electronics. The PPR, being {{an important part of the}} readout system, needs to be remotely accessed and monitored to prevent failures or, in case some failure occurs, to accurately diagnose the problem. With that purpose in mind, the PPR is included in an ATCA shelf that, not only provides high-speed communication capabilities, but also includes an IPMI-compliant out-of-band control architecture. A Module Management Controller (MMC) is part of the PPR hardware, in this way, the PPR can be remotely accessed to read the state and value of the sensors, to be rebooted in case of firmware failure or the be evaluated even before the FPGAs have been booted...|$|R
