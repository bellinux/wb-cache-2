5|$|In Islam, doves and {{the pigeon}} family <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>are</b> {{respected}} and favoured {{because they are}} believed to have assisted the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in distracting his enemies outside the cave of Thaw'r, in the great Hijra. A pair of pigeons had built a nest and laid eggs at once, and a spider had woven cobwebs, which {{in the darkness of the}} night made the fugitives believe that Muhammad could not be in that cave.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>are</b> visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,400 gastroliths (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) {{were found}} among the ribs and gastralia of {{specimen}} MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to total weight, 0.0022, supports the theory that these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such {{as the presence of}} a beak and a U-shaped, downturned jaw, are indicators of facultative (optional) herbivory among coelurosaurian theropods. In spite of these features, fish vertebrae and scales were also {{found among the}} gastroliths, which suggests that it was an omnivore. Ornithomimosaurs <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>are</b> thought to have fed on both plants and small animals.|$|E

5|$|Angel sharks <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>are</b> highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries {{due to their}} susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>are</b> found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|Cave 7, {{originally}} a Buddhist vihara, has been adapted as a Hindu temple {{dedicated to the}} god Ganesha. It {{is one of the}} Ashtavinayak shrines, a set of the eight prominent Ganesha shrines in Western Maharashtra. Twenty-six of the caves are individually numbered. The caves face to the south and are numbered serially from east to west. Caves 6 and 14 are chaitya-grihas (chapels), while the rest are viharas (dwellings for monks). The latter are in the form of dwellings and cells. There are also several rock-cut water cisterns; two of them have inscriptions. The layout of the caves, <b>in</b> <b>general,</b> <b>are</b> similar in pattern and shape. They generally have one or two sides with two long benches for occupants' use.|$|E

5|$|The trends {{going down}} from {{scandium}} and yttrium to lanthanum {{tend to be}} more similar to those going down groups 1 and 2 in the periodic table, while those going down from scandium and yttrium to lutetium {{tend to be more}} similar to those in the early transition metals. Since Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, {{it has been argued that}} lanthanum and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical transition metals, as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, lanthanum is a strongly electropositive metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity. The rare earth metals <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>are</b> more similar in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals that immediately precede them than to the transition metals proper which follow them.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, <b>in</b> <b>general,</b> <b>are</b> readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. Because they are not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} mammals, {{primates}} <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>are</b> very vocal, and lemurs are no exception. Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some {{of the most}} common calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls and reactions to specific types of predators. With mating calls, {{it has been shown that}} mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the calls of their own species, particularly when exposed to the calls of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range. Lemur calls can also be very loud and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1km (0.62mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the indri, whose calls can be heard up to 2km (1.2mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40hectares (0.13 to 0.15sq mi) home range. Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the indri can last 45seconds to more than 3minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} that birds are {{a type of}} dinosaur showed that dinosaurs <b>in</b> <b>general</b> <b>are</b> not, in fact, extinct as is commonly stated. However, all non-avian dinosaurs {{as well as many}} groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 66million years ago. It has been suggested that because small mammals, squamata and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size, non-avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small-bodied species, which led to their downfall when large-bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the mass extinction event. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and many groups of mammals. Significantly, the insects suffered no discernible population loss, which left them available as food for other survivors. This mass extinction is known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.|$|E
