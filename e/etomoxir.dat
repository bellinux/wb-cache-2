From 1984 to 1993, <b>etomoxir</b> was developed through phase I and II trials that showed favorable effects on the heart and a good safety profile. In 1999, the patent was out-licensed to MediGene for further trials. In 2001, MediGene was granted extended patent rights for the use of <b>etomoxir</b> for the treatment of congestive heart failure. In 2002, MediGene announced that it terminated a phase II trial for the use of <b>etomoxir</b> for heart failure due to adverse side effects. MediGene funded a study of <b>etomoxir</b> as a treatment of heart failure in 2007, but the study was once again terminated prematurely. Four of the 226 patients taking the drug showed unacceptably high liver transaminase levels, which was determined by the experimenters to likely be due to the treatment. The University of Colorado currently holds patents for the use of <b>etomoxir</b> as an anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic agent. However, the clinical development of <b>etomoxir</b> has been terminated due to severe hepatotoxicity associated with treatment.|$|E

Left ventricular weight was increased (P< 0. 05) by 8 %. <b>Etomoxir</b> blunted the increase in left ventricular chamber volume. <b>Etomoxir</b> raised the proportion of V 1 isomyosin (35 ± 4 % versus 24 ± 2 %; P< 0. 05) and decreased the percentage of V 3 isomyosin (36 ± 4 % versus 48 ± 3 %; P< 0. 05). Maximum isovolumically developed pressure was higher in <b>etomoxir</b> treated rats than in untreated pressure overloaded rats (371 ± 22 versus 315 ± 23 [*]mmHg; P< 0. 05).

40|$|International audienceEtomoxir is an {{inhibitor}} of mitochondrial carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase 1 (CPT 1) {{and thereby}} switches the energy metabolism from fatty acids to glucose oxidation. For two reasons such a metabolic change {{may be beneficial}} in heart failure: (1) Energy production (generation of ATP molecules per oxygen consumption) is more economical in case of glucose oxidation. (2) Glucose oxidation is associated with altered gene expression of important myocardial proteins {{that are related to}} function (sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase and myosin isoenzymes). <b>Etomoxir</b> was planned to be tested in a dose of 80 and 40 mg versus placebo for a period of six months in patients with heart failure. As principle measures of efficacy a maximal exercise tolerance test using an exercise bicycle and a sub-maximal six minute corridor walk test were used. Secondary endpoints were echocardiographical dimensions and scores of quality of life assessments. 350 patients were planned to be screened with the expectation that endpoint data will be available for approximately 260 patients. This study had to be stopped prematurely, because unacceptably high values for liver transaminases were detected in four patients taking 40 mg or 80 mg <b>etomoxir.</b> At the time {{of the end of the}} study, 121 patients were randomised to placebo, 118 to 40 mg <b>etomoxir</b> and 108 to 80 mg <b>etomoxir.</b> 21 patients in the placebo group, 17 and 14 patients in the 40 mg <b>etomoxir</b> and the 80 mg <b>etomoxir</b> group respectively, had completed the study at that time.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate its effect on uterine contractility in different hormonal situations. METHODS: Uterine samples were collected from 60 cows during follicular phase, luteal phase and pregnancy. The cows were slaughtered at a local abattoir. Longitudinal strips were mounted vertically in a 30 -ml organ bath connected to an isometric force transducer. Contractions were recorded with an ink-writing polygraph. After the equilibration period, <b>etomoxir</b> was added to the organ bath at different concentrations. The amplitude and frequency of contractions were registered before and after addition of <b>etomoxir.</b> RESULTS: In 17 strips from pregnant cows, <b>etomoxir</b> increased the amplitude (p < 0. 05) of contractions but not the frequency in comparison with basal conditions.

To address the role of lipid metabolism in prostate cancer, we have used <b>etomoxir</b> and orlistat, clinically safe drugs that block lipid oxidation and lipid synthesis/lipolysis, respectively. <b>Etomoxir</b> is an irreversible inhibitor of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT 1) enzyme that decreases b oxidation in the mitochon-dria.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} <b>etomoxir,</b> an {{inhibitor}} of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation, on triacylglycerol metabolism in rat hepatocytes and adipocytes were investigated. <b>Etomoxir</b> inhibited {{the depletion of}} triacylglycerol stores in hepatocytes incubated without exogenous fatty acids and inhibited lipolysis in adipocytes.

This effect was specific for the R-enantiomer and was associated with increased triacylglycerol secretion. At higher concentrations (50 – 100 μM) RS-etomoxir inhibited lipolysis and triacylglycerol secretion, independently of inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I.

Due to the lipid-driven {{metabolic}} phenotype of PCa, imaging with 2 -deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18 F]FDG) is suboptimal, since tumors tend to have low avidity for glucose. Procedures: We have used the fat oxidation inhibitor <b>etomoxir</b> (2 -[6 -(4 -chlorophenoxy) -hexyl]oxirane- 2 -carboxylate) that targets carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase- 1 (CPT- 1) to increase glucose uptake in PCa cell lines.

Little {{information is available}} whether and how these processes are causally related. Therefore, the objectives were to investigate whether intra-cellular lipid metabolites are involved in FA-induced NF-κB activation and/or insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and to investigate whether FA-induced insulin resistance and NF-κB activation are causally related. Inhibiting DGAT or CPT- 1 by using, respectively, amidepsine or <b>etomoxir</b> increased DAG accumulation and sensitized myotubes to palmitate-induced insulin resistance. While co-incubation of palmitate with <b>etomoxir</b> increased NF-κB transactivation, co-incubation with amidepsine did not, indicating that DAG accumulation is associated with insulin resistance but not with NF-κB activation. Furthermore, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the NF-κB pathway could not prevent palmitate-induced insulin resistance.

The objective was to elucidate components involved in FA metabolism in CC during oocyte maturation. Twenty-seven genes related to lipogenesis, lipolysis, FA transport and FAO were chosen from comparative transcriptome analysis of bovine CC before and after maturation in vivo. Using real time PCR, 22 were significantly up-regulated {{at different times of}} in vitro maturation (IVM) in relation to oocyte meiosis progression from germinal vesicle (GV) breakdown to metaphase-II. Proteins FA synthase, acetyl-Co-A carboxylase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase CPT 1, perilipin 2 and FA binding protein FABP 3 were detected by western blot and immunolocalized to CC and oocyte cytoplasm, with FABP 3 concentrated around oocyte chromatin. By mass spectrometry, CC lipid profiling was shown to be different before and after IVM. FAO inhibitors <b>etomoxir</b> and mildronate dose-dependently decreased oocyte maturation rate in vitro. In terms of viability, cumulus enclosed oocytes were more sensitive to <b>etomoxir</b> than denuded oocytes.

Lipid metabolism is crucial for sustaining proper reproductive function. Alteration of lipid metabolism impacts follicular development and affects oocyte developmental competence. Indeed, non-esterified fatty acids are able to decrease granulosa cell (GC) proliferation and affect estradiol synthesis, thus potentially affecting follicular growth and viability. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of lipid metabolism on bovine GCs, through the use of the lipid metabolism inhibitors <b>etomoxir,</b> an inhibitor of fatty acid (FA) oxidation through inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT 1), and C 75, an inhibitor of FA synthesis through inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FAS).

Both inhibitors significantly reduced AMPK and ACC phosphorylation. <b>Etomoxir</b> also affected the AKT signalling pathway. Combined, these data suggest that both FA oxidation and synthesis are important for the bovine GCs to express a proliferative and steroidogenic phenotype and, thus, for sustaining follicular growth. Despite these findings, it is important to note that the changes caused by the inhibitors of FA metabolism on GCs in vitro are globally mild, suggesting that lipid metabolism is not as critical in GCs as was observed in the oocyte-cumulus complex.

Homogenate oxalate-facilitated SR Ca 2 + uptake rate g wet wt− 1 was reduced (P< 0. 05) by 29. 9 ± 1. 8 % irrespective of phospholamban phosphorylation (in the presence of catalytic subunit of protein kinase A) and inhibition of SR Ca 2 + release channel by ruthenium red.

SR Ca 2 + uptake rate was inversely correlated (P< 0. 05) with left ventricular weight but was not affected by the occurrence of pulmonary congestion.

Moreover, the impact of these inhibitors is exacerbated in the absence of exogenous glucose, which is otherwise dispensable for infection. In contrast to glucose, glutamine is essential for productive viral infection, providing intermediates that sustain the TCA cycle (anaplerosis). Cumulatively, these data suggest that productive infection requires the mitochondrial β-oxidation of palmitate which drives the TCA cycle and energy production. Additionally, infection causes a significant rise in the cellular oxygen consumption rate (ATP synthesis) that is ablated by <b>etomoxir.</b> The biochemical progression of the vaccinia life cycle is not impaired in the presence of TOFA, C 75, or <b>etomoxir,</b> although the levels of viral DNA and proteins synthesized are somewhat diminished. However, by reversibly arresting infections at the onset of morphogenesis, and then monitoring virus production after release of the block, we determined that virion assembly is highly sensitive to TOFA and C 75. Electron microscopic analysis of cells released into C 75 revealed fragmented aggregates of viroplasm which failed to be enclosed by developing virion membranes. Taken together, these data indicate that vaccinia infection, and in particular virion assembly, relies on the synthesis and mitochondrial import of fatty acids, where their β-oxidation drives robust ATP production...|$|E
40|$|Fatty acids {{can stimulate}} the {{secretory}} activity of insulin-producing beta-cells. At elevated concentrations, {{they can also}} be toxic to isolated beta-cells. This toxicity varies inversely with the cellular ability to accumulate neutral lipids in the cytoplasm. To further examine whether cytoprotection can be achieved by decreasing cytoplasmic levels of free acyl moieties, we investigated whether palmitate toxicity is also lowered by stimulating its beta-oxidation. Lower rates of palmitate-induced beta-cell death were measured in the presence of L-carnitine as well as after addition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) agonists, conditions leading to increased palmitate oxidation. In contrast, inhibition of mitochondrial beta-oxidation by <b>etomoxir</b> increased palmitate toxicity. A combination of PPAR alpha and retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists acted synergistically and led to complete protection; this was associated with enhanced expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation, lipid metabolism, and peroxisome proliferation. PPAR alpha-RXR protection was abolished by the carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 inhibitor <b>etomoxir.</b> These observations indicate that PPAR alpha and RXR regulate beta-cell susceptibility to long-chain fatty acid toxicity by increasing the rates of beta-oxidation and by involving peroxisomes in fatty acid metabolism. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition {{of brain}} carnitinepalmitoyl-transferase- 1 (CPT- 1) is {{reported}} to decrease food intake and body weight in rats. Yet, the fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor and CPT- 1 stimulator C 75 produces hypophagia and weight loss when given to rodents intracerebroventricularly (i. c. v.). Thus, roles and relative contributions of altered brain CPT- 1 activity and fatty acid oxidation in these phenomena remain unclarified. We administered compounds that target FAS or CPT- 1 to mice by single i. c. v. bolus, and examined acute and prolonged effects on feeding and body weight. C 75 decreased food intake rapidly and potently at all doses (1 - 56 mol), and dose dependently inhibited intake on day 1. Dose dependent weight loss on day 1 persisted through four days of postinjection monitoring. The FAS inhibitor cerulenin produced dose dependent (560 mol) hypophagia for one day, weight loss for two days, and weight regain to vehicle control by day 3. The CPT- 1 inhibitor <b>etomoxir</b> (32, 320 mol) did not alter overall day 1 feeding. However, <b>etomoxir</b> attenuated the hypophagia produced by C 75, indicating that CPT- 1 stimulation is important for C 75 ’s effect. A novel compound, C 89 b, was characterized i...|$|E
40|$|FSP 27 (CIDEC in humans) is {{a protein}} {{associated}} with lipid droplets that downregulates the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) rate {{when it is}} overexpressed. However, {{little is known about}} its physiological role in liver. Here, we show that fasting regulates liver expression of Fsp 27 in a time-dependent manner. Thus, during the initial stages of fasting a maximal induction of 800 -fold was achieved, while during the later phase of fasting, Fsp 27 expression decreased. The early response to fasting can be explained by a canonical PKA-CREB-CRTC 2 signaling pathway since: i) CIDEC expression was induced by forskolin, ii) Fsp 27 promoter activity was increased by CREB, and iii) Fsp 27 expression was upregulated in the liver of Sirt 1 knockout animals. Interestingly, pharmacological (<b>etomoxir)</b> or genetic (Hmgcs 2 interference) inhibition of the FAO rate increases the in vivo expression of Fsp 27 during fasting. Similarly, CIDEC expression was upregulated in HepG 2 cells by either <b>etomoxir</b> or HMGCS 2 interference. Our data indicate that there is a kinetic mechanism of auto-regulation between short- and long-term fasting, by which free fatty acids delivered to the liver during early fasting are accumulated/exported by FSP 27 /CIDEC, while over longer periods of fasting they are degraded in the mitochondria through the carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) system...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} view is {{that cancer}} cells predominately produce ATP by glycolysis, rather than by oxidation of energy-providing substrates. Mitochondrial uncoupling — the continuing reduction of oxygen without ATP synthesis — has recently been shown in leukemia cells to circumvent the ability of oxygen to inhibit glycolysis, and may promote the metabolic preference for glycolysis by shifting from pyruvate oxidation to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Here we have demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of FAO with <b>etomoxir</b> or ranolazine inhibited proliferation and sensitized human leukemia cells — cultured alone or on bone marrow stromal cells — to apoptosis induction by ABT- 737, a molecule that releases proapoptotic Bcl- 2 proteins such as Bak from antiapoptotic family members. Likewise, treatment with the fatty acid synthase/lipolysis inhibitor orlistat also sensitized leukemia cells to ABT- 737, which supports the notion that fatty acids promote cell survival. Mechanistically, we generated evidence suggesting that FAO regulates the activity of Bak-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition. Importantly, <b>etomoxir</b> decreased the number of quiescent leukemia progenitor cells in approximately 50 % of primary human acute myeloid leukemia samples and, when combined with either ABT- 737 or cytosine arabinoside, provided substantial therapeutic benefit in a murine model of leukemia. The results support the concept of FAO inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy in hematological malignancies...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition {{of energy}} {{production}} {{as a strategy}} for potentiation of anticancer chemotherapy was investigated using 1 glycolysis in-hibitor and 1 fatty acid b-oxidation inhibitor— 2 -deoxyglucose and <b>etomoxir,</b> respectively, both known to be clinically well tolerated. Eighteen anticancer drugs were screened for potentiation by these inhibitors. 2 -deoxyglucose potentiated acute apoptosis (24 hr) induced mainly by some, but not all, genotoxic drugs, whereas eto-moxir had effect only on cisplatin. By contrast, <b>etomoxir</b> did potentiate the overall, 48 hr effects of some genotoxic drugs, and was in addition more efficient than deoxyglucose in potentiating the overall effects of several non-genotoxic drugs. Both types of potentiation were largely lost {{in the absence of}} p 53. Because cis-platin was potentiated by both energy inhibitors in both types of assay, it was investigated at additional concentrations and over longer time. Both energy inhibitors strongly potentiated non-apo-ptotic concentrations of cisplatin in p 53 -wildtype as well as in p 53 -deficient, cisplatin-resistant HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells. Reduced ATP levels correlated with, but were not sole determi-nants, the antiproliferative effects. We conclude that the long-term effects of cisplatin potentiation are important and either p 53 -independent or improved by a lack of p 53. We also conclude that although the potentiated drugs as yet have no obvious mecha-nistic factor in common, the strategy holds promise with genotoxic as well non-genotoxic anticancer drugs...|$|E
40|$|In mammals, the Tribbles family {{includes}} widely expressed serine-threonine kinase-like proteins (TRIB 1, TRIB 2 and TRIB 3) {{that are}} involved in multiple biological processes including cell proliferation and fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Our recent studies highlighted the importance of FA metabolism in cumulus cells (CC) during oocyte maturation in vertebrates and reported a higher TRIB 1 expression in CC surrounding in vivo mature oocytes as compared to immature ooocytes in mice and cows. The objective was to investigate Tribbles expression patterns in bovine CC during in vitro maturation (IVM) and to examine their roles in the cumulus-oocyte complex. Tribbles gene expression was analyzed in bovine and murine CC using quantitative RT-PCR. Proteins were detected using Western blot and intracellular localization was assessed by immunofluorescence. Bovine COCs were treated with <b>etomoxir,</b> an inhibitor of FA oxidation (FAO) which blocks CPT 1 activity, during 6 h and 18 h IVM. Oocyte meiotic stage was assessed and expression of Tribbles and lipid metabolism genes was quantified in CC. TRIB 1 and TRIB 3 were more strongly expressed whereas TRIB 2 was less expressed in CC surrounding the oocytes from preovulatory follicles than in CC of immature ones. In CC, Tribbles were located in the cytoplasm and nucleus; in mitotic cells TRIB 2 and TRIB 3 were detected in the spindle. In the oocyte, Tribbles proteins were detected in the ooplasm; also TRIB 2 and TRIB 3 were more accumulated in the germinal vesicle. In bovine CC, expression of TRIB 1 and TRIB 3 was transiently increased at a time preceding oocyte meiosis resumption in vitro. Treatment with <b>etomoxir</b> (150 μM) during IVM resulted in a significant reduction of oocyte maturation rate and decreased MAPK 3 / 1 phosphorylation in the oocytes. In CC, 18 h IVM of <b>etomoxir</b> treatment significantly increased expression of TRIB 1, TRIB 3, CPTA 1 (enzyme regulating FA entry in mitochondria for FAO) and CD 36 (thrombospondin receptor involved in FA transport). Under the same conditions, expression of TRIB 2 and ACACA (Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase involved in FA synthesis) decreased in CC. All considered, Tribbles family members may be involved in cell proliferation and in FAO signaling in CC and participate in oocyte meiotic resumption regulation...|$|E
40|$|We tested {{effects of}} {{long-term}} exposure of pancreatic islets to {{free fatty acids}} (FFA) in vitro on B cell function. Islets isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to palmitate (0. 125 or 0. 25 mM), oleate (0. 125 mM), or octanoate (2. 0 mM) during culture. Insulin responses were subsequently tested {{in the absence of}} FFA. After a 48 -h exposure to FFA, insulin secretion during basal glucose (3. 3 mM) was several-fold increased. However, during stimulation with 27 mM glucose, secretion was inhibited by 30 - 50 % and proinsulin biosynthesis by 30 - 40 %. Total protein synthesis was similarly affected. Conversely, previous palmitate did not impair alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (5 mM) -induced insulin release. Induction and reversibility of the inhibitory effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion required between 6 and 24 h. Addition of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitor <b>etomoxir</b> (1 microM) partially reversed (by > 50 %) FFA-associated decrease in secretory as well as proinsulin biosynthetic responses to 27 mM glucose. The inhibitory effect of previous palmitate was similar when co-culture was performed with 5. 5, 11, or 27 mM glucose. Exposure to palmitate or oleate reduced the production of 14 CO 2 from D-[U- 14 C]glucose, and of 14 CO 2 from D-[3, 4 - 14 C]-glucose, both effects being reversed by <b>etomoxir.</b> Conclusions: long-term exposure to FFA inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion and biosynthesis probably through a glucose fatty acid cycle...|$|E
40|$|We {{have devised}} a {{technique}} for monitoring cytoplasmic ATP continuously in single hepatocytes. Single isolated rat hepatocytes were injected with the ATP-dependent luminescent protein firefly luciferase, and then superfused with 45 microM luciferin in air-equilibrated medium. Signals of approx. 10 - 200 photoelectron counts per second could be recorded from individual healthy cells {{for up to}} 3 h. The response of the luminescent signal to chemical hypoxia (2 - 5 mM CN- and 5 - 10 mM 2 -deoxyglucose) was monitored. We found a great cell-to-cell variability in {{the time course of}} the ATP decline in response to CN-, 2 -deoxyglucose or to their combination; the time for the signal to fall to 10 % of the original (corresponding to approx. 100 microM ATP) ranged from approx. 20 to 75 min. This resistance of the cytoplasmic ATP concentration to depletion after blockade of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis could be abolished by pretreatment of the cells with <b>etomoxir,</b> which blocks mitochondrial beta-oxidation. <b>Etomoxir</b> alone had no effect on the luciferase signal, but etomoxir-pre-treated cells showed a prompt fall in the luciferase signal starting within 1 - 2 min of application of cyanide and 2 -deoxyglucose and falling to 10 % of the original signal in approx. 6 - 10 min. The technique allows cytoplasmic ATP changes to be monitored in single hepatocytes at concentrations of 1 mM or lower, but more precise calibration of the signal will require correction for the effects of cytoplasmic pH changes...|$|E
40|$|Incubation of rat brown adipocytes with {{noradrenaline}} in {{the presence}} of insulin and palmitate caused a decrease in the rate of triacylglycerol synthesis as measured by [U- 14 C]glucose incorporation into acylglycerol glycerol. Concomitantly, the ratio of [1 - 14 C]palmitate oxidized to CO 2 to that esterified was increased. This alteration in the rate of triacylglycerol synthesis by noradrenaline was not observed when fatty acid oxidation was inhibited by <b>etomoxir.</b> Noradrenaline did not cause any acute inactivation of enzymes of the triacylglycerol-synthesis pathway. It is suggested that the decrease in triacylglycerol synthesis seen with noradrenaline is secondary to activation of fatty acid oxidation...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} {{demonstrated a}} marked inhibitory effect of high physiological concentrations of {{free fatty acids}} (FFAs) on insulin binding, degradation, and action in isolated rat hepatocytes. To elucidate the mechanism, male rats were treated for 3 days with saline (control) or <b>etomoxir</b> (ethyl 2 -[6 -(p-chlorophenoxy) hexyl]-glycidate), a prodrug, which in vivo is converted to a specific competitive inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, and thus, lipid oxidation. Oleic acid (0. 4 mM) reduced both 125 l-labeled insulin binding and insulin-stimulated [14 C]aminoisobutyric acid transport- 4 0 % in cells from control animals. However, this FFA concentration was without effect in cells from etomoxir-treated animals. <b>Etomoxir</b> increased EC 50 for the inhibitory effect of oleic acid on insulin binding approximately threefold. The data indicate that the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids may be important for their inhibitory effect on insulin binding and action in isolated rat hepatocytes.

The reason for this difference is unclear but has been attributed to the adipose tissue, particularly an increased free-fatty acid (FFA) release (1, 3, 4).

40|$|Variations in plasma {{fatty acid}} (FA) {{concentrations}} are detected by FA sensing neurons in specific brain {{areas such as}} the hypothalamus. These neurons play a physiological role in the control of food intake and the regulation of hepatic glucose production. Le Foll et al. previously showed in vitro that at least 50 % of the FA sensing in ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) neurons is attributable to the interaction of long chain FA with FA translocase/CD 36 (CD 36). The present work assessed whether in vivo effects of hypothalamic FA sensing might be partly mediated by CD 36 or intracellular events such as acylCoA synthesis or b-oxidation. To that end, a catheter was implanted in the carotid artery toward the brain in male Wistar rats. After 1 wk recovery, animals were food-deprived for 5 h, then 10 min infusions of triglyceride emulsion, Intralipid +/ 2 heparin (IL, ILH, respectively) or saline/heparin (SH) were carried out and food intake was assessed over the next 5 h. Experimental groups included: 1) Rats previously injected in ventromedian nucleus (VMN) with shRNA against CD 36 or scrambled RNA; 2) <b>Etomoxir</b> (CPT 1 inhibitor) or saline co-infused with ILH/SH; and 3) Triacsin C (acylCoA synthase inhibitor) or saline co-infused with ILH/SH. ILH significantly lowered food intake during refeeding compared to SH (p, 0. 001). Five hours after refeeding, <b>etomoxir</b> did not affect this inhibitory effect of ILH on food intake while VMN CD 36 depletion totally prevented it. Triacsin C also prevented ILH effects on food intake. In conclusion, the effect of FA to inhibit food intake i...|$|E
