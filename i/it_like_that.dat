[...] He used the phrase [...] "city upon a hill" [...] (derived from the Bible's Sermon on the Mount) to characterize the colonists' endeavour as part of a special pact with God to create a holy community. [...] He encouraged the colonists to [...] "bear one another's burdens" [...] and to view themselves as a [...] "Company of Christ, bound together by Love." [...] He told the colonists to be stricter in their religious conformance than even the Church of England, and to make it their objective to establish a model state.

Following the match Pirlo spoke of his eloquent penalty, stating, [...] "At the moment I saw the goalkeeper making strange movements, so I waited for him to move and hit <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>that...</b> It was easier for me to chip it at that stage.

500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule.

[...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E

[...] At this point, the band had ten songs and were trying to condense them into five, then planning to write five more. Westfall said the band completed the final [...] "few songs when we were back home with Tom (Denney) and Chad (Gilbert)." [...] On the pace of writing, McKinnon said: [...] "It seems like a really fast thing that has happened but we've been constantly working on it the entire time." [...] On the songs themselves, he said: [...] "the pop-punk stuff has a darker edge to it. I wrote <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> it's still pop-punk but with a darker edge". The album was influenced by Finch's What It Is to Burn (2002). The album [...] "came together song by song" [...] as McKinnon mentioned, with the band coming up with 15–16 song ideas. McKinnon stated in an {{interview with}} Rocksound that there's songs [...] "that didn't make this record that we're saving." [...] There is a track on the album that was previously written for Homesick.|$|E

2500|$|Although Sebastian {{released}} the retrospective album Twenty Ten in 2010, Armageddon {{is his first}} studio album since Like <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>That,</b> an album of original soul music, was released in October 2009. [...] Armageddon, while mainly pop with some R songs, still shows the soul influences that Like <b>it</b> <b>Like</b> <b>That</b> did {{on many of the}} songs. Sebastian has said he grew up listening to old school soul music from artists like Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, and Stevie Wonder, and they had always been his strongest musical influences. He said early in his career he was steered away from soul music, advised it wouldn't sell in Australia. After he released The Memphis Album, a cover album of Memphis soul classics he recorded with members the MGs including Steve Cropper, he realised there was a market, and he felt he could now do the style of music he had always wanted to.|$|E
2500|$|Like <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>That</b> is {{an album}} of {{original}} soul music influenced by Sebastian's previous album, The Memphis Album, which was a covers album of Memphis soul songs recorded with members of The MGs including Steve Cropper in Memphis in 2007. Sebastian and Cropper remained friends, and Sebastian made several songwriting trips to Nashville in mid-2008, staying with the Croppers on these trips. Sebastian {{said in an interview}} with The Age in October 2009, [...] "The most comfortable I've ever felt in the studio was during The Memphis Album. And the success of that prompted me to make a record like this one." [...] Five of the songs on Like <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>That</b> were co-written with the album's producer David Ryan Harris, four were written entirely by Sebastian himself, and three were co-written with other writers. He later said, [...] "I wrote the music on this album based on how I feel when I listen to the Otis Reddings and the Wilson Picketts of the world. I'll put that music on and it always just lifts me and makes me feel great." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe said: [...] "Sometimes {{it takes}} four records, with a detour into [...] "concepts" [...] covers {{territory}} to find where you fit. Sebastian has found his niche with Like <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>That,</b> which expertly balances {{the line between}} radio friendly pop and classic soul". Paul Cashmere from Undercover wrote: [...] "By covering the classics on The Memphis Album Guy Sebastian discovered Guy Sebastian. [...] If The Memphis Album was Guy's initiation into becoming a Soul Man then Like <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> <b>That</b> is the graduation." [...] In an interview {{for the release of}} his seventh album Armageddon, Sebastian spoke of how much The Memphis Album still influences his music: [...] "I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me. Artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and Sam Cooke. Being entrenched in that sort of environment really caused me to go 'You know what dude. Do what you want to do. Do what comes natural to you'. [...] From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing." ...|$|E
