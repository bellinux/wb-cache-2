We present two examples of descriptive parameters for sentences with orage and courage on the one hand, with words expressing the idea of AIM on the other hand. We think this way of describing sentences and discourse can be useful in the organization of learning data and activities in language teaching. Gross Gaston, Vivès Robert.

These caches {{must be kept}} in-sync, so that modern multi-threaded software can safely make use of multiple cores. Keeping these various caches in sync is done with a cache coherence protocol, implemented in hardware using state machines. One of the challenges when developing cache coherence protocols is the validation whether it is functioning correctly. To do this efficiently {{it is important to}} be able to analyse parts of the cache coherence protocol separately, together with for instance the communication infrastructure that is used between the various caches.

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} the association between dimensional personality traits from the Five-Factor Model (FFM) and treatment outcome in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Methods: Six hundred forty-nine outpatients with MDD participated in a randomised double-blind longitudinal study for 6 months. Patients received a combination of medication and psychotherapy; they were randomised to medication condition (tianeptine or fluoxetine), and non-randomly assigned to psychotherapy condition (supportive, cognitive-behavioural, or psychodynamic). The Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale {{was used to assess}} depression severity. The Systeme de <b>Description</b> <b>en</b> Cinq Dimensions was used to assess the personality domains of the FFM. Results: Group comparisons revealed that patients who responded to both medication and psychotherapy had lower Neuroticism (t= 4. 22,p <. 01), and higher Extraversion (t= 4. 01,p <. 01) and Openness to Experience scores (t= 3. 57,p <. 01) compared to nonresponders. Regression analyses, which controlled for shared variance among the five personality domains, indicated that Neuroticism (chi(2) = 4. 06, p=. 04) and Conscientiousness (chi(2) = 8. 98, p <. 01) were significantly and uniquely associated with response. The two-way interactions between Neuroticism x Extraversion (chi(2) = 4. 49, p=. 03) and Extraversion x Conscientiousness (chi(2) = 5. 91, p=. 01) were also associated with response. These results were mostly replicated across the treatment-completer and intent-to-treat samples. Conclusions: Dimensional personality traits predict response for individuals with MDD. Limitations: This study did not examine facet-level traits, patient pre-morbid personality and functioning, and additional patient characteristics. Results may not be generalizable to severely depressed or treatment refractory patients...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} topic of descriptions in conversation: a relatively unexplored area of investigation apart from {{a small number of}} studies within the field of conversation analysis (Mondada 1998, 1999). However, whereas previous studies focus on the description as a social activity, enhancing the conversational facet, the present work has as a premise to put emphasis on the description as a textual phenomenon developed by the speakers without neglecting the conversational context. In that respect, Adam’s textual model of the description (Adam & Petitjean 1989, Adam 1992, Adam 2005 and Adam 2011), with its focus on the constitutive operations of a description, provides a useful analytical tool. In order to achieve the goal of contributing to the identification and the analysis of the description in conversation, this dissertation proposes the use of a textual-conversational interface. Three conversations between native speakers of French are studied. In these conversations, descriptions are identified through a double inductive-deductive process, where the analyst’s intuitive judgement is combined with the application of the criteria provided by Adam’s model in order to recognize a descriptive organization. The subsequent analysis combines tools and concepts derived from the two theories in the interface. The analysis is limited to descriptions containing at least three descriptive operations. With regards to the identification of the description, the present work highlights a possible variation in the articulation of the theme (thème-titre) as progressive, multiple or absent. The present study thus suggests that the accumulation of descriptive operations be a more reliable way of identifying a description than the explicit presence of a distinctive theme. The study further examines the delimitations of the description in the conversation. Three possible constituents are identified: preface, description proper and abandon. However, whereas all descriptions contain a description proper, the preface and the abandon are sometimes missing. The dissertation also tests the relevance of the textual category of action description (description d’actions) in the conversational context. The results show that this kind of descriptions exists in conversation but differs from its written homologue in that it manifests levels of subordination. The analysis of the influence of epistemic access on the elaboration of the description reveals different patterns. When knowledge about the theme is not shared affiliation and alignment vary greatly. However two distinct scenarios are observed when knowledge is shared: (a) one speaker takes the main responsibility by producing the majority of the utterances and of the descriptive operations or (b) the speakers share the responsibility by producing an equal number of utterances. The latter scenario is more frequent in the analysed material. Lastly, through the interface, the present study identifies previously unattested descriptive organizations, which are detectable when knowledge is shared and speakers share the responsibility för the description (scenario b). Preliminary results highlight collaborative elaborations of descriptions; such collaborations are observed within one single description (description dialogale), between two descriptions (<b>description</b> <b>en</b> écho) and in a series of several descriptions (archipel descriptif). The final chapter contains a discussion regarding the theoretical foundation of the textual-conversational interface and possible areas of methodological and theoretical contributions made by this dissertation, such as the navigation between macro and micro levels of analysis and the testing of the validity of the model of description. A new structure of the description is suggested: a spider’s web. This metaphor expresses, better than Adam’s tree does, the way the description manifests in the conversation {{and the fact that it}} withstands even if the theme of the description is absent...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the total}} Lagrangian kinematical description, a {{discontinuous}} Galerkin (DG) discretization of the gas dynamics equations is developed for two-dimensional fluid flows on general unstructured grids. Contrary to the updated Lagrangian formulation, which refers to the current moving configuration of the flow, the total Lagrangian formulation refers to the reference fixed configuration, which is usually the initial one. In this framework, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of the kinematical and the physical variables are related {{by means of the}} Piola transformation. Here, we describe a cell-centered high-order DG discretization of the physical conservation laws. The geometrical conservation law, which governs the time evolution of the deformation gradient, is solved by means of a finite element discretization. This approach allows to satisfy exactly the Piola compatibility condition. Regarding the DG approach, it relies on the use of a polynomial space approximation which is spanned by a Taylor basis. The main advantage in using this type of basis relies on its adaptability regardless the shape of the cell. The numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces are computed employing a node-based solver which can be viewed as an approximate Riemann solver. We present numerical results to illustrate the robustness and the accuracy up to third-order of our DG method. First, we show its ability to accurately capture geometrical features of a flow region employing curvilinear grids. Second, we demonstrate the dramatic improvement in symmetry preservation for radial flows.

40|$|The {{international}} archival community {{relies on}} the existence of standards as the means to both reliably interchange information and to promote its accessibility. Departing from current standards for the description of archival entities and authority records, namely ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF), the work described herein establishes a means to make semantic interoperability possible for archival descriptions under ISAD(G) {{in the context of the}} Semantic Web. For the purpose of this work, semantic interoperability is understood as the use of explicit semantics to facilitate archival descriptions integration with the main objective of fostering the automated or semi-automated use of the information. This paper introduces a mapping of ISAD(G) archival descriptions to an ontology written in a Web-oriented ontology language, as the main artefact to promote semantic interoperability in archival descriptions. It has been achieved through the introduction of a common ground for the definition of concepts, based on the use of shared definitions from in widely-used upper ontologies. The final aim is to provide advanced services and access facilities which can serve as improved access points in archival <b>description.</b> Como <b>en</b> otras disciplinas científicas, en la archivística resulta de gran importancia la existencia de estándares, tanto para facilitar el intercambio de información entre entidades como para normalizar el acceso a dicha información.

40|$|Workflow-based {{computing}} {{has become}} a dominant paradigm to design and execute scientific applications. After the initial breakthrough of now standard workflow management sys- tems, several approaches have recently proposed to decentralise the coordination of the execution. In particular, shared space-based coordination {{has been shown to}} provide appropriate building blocks for such a decentralised execution. Uncertainty is also still a major concern in scientific workflows. The ability to adapt the workflow, change its shape and switch for alternate scenarios on-the-fly is still missing in workflow management systems. In this paper, based on the shared space model, we firstly devise a programmatic way to specify such adaptive workflows. We use a reactive, rule-based programming model to modify the workflow description by changing its asso- ciated direct acyclic graph on-the-fly without needing to stop and restart the execution from the beginning. Secondly, we present the GinFlow middleware, a resilient decentralised workflow execu- tion manager implementing these concepts. Through a set of deployments of adaptive workflows of different characteristics, we discuss the GinFlow performance and resilience and show the limited overhead of the adaptiveness mechanism, making it a promising decentralised adaptive workflow execution manager. Les workflows sont devenus une manière dominante de mettre au point et d’exécuter des applications scientifiques. Après l’apparition des premiers gestionnaires de workflows, différentes approches ont eu pour but de decentraliser leur exécution.

40|$|Christian Pelras This article {{results from}} an {{investigation}} {{about the origins}} of the first book ever published in the West {{in the last quarter of}} the XVIIth century about South Sulawesi, then a place quite out-of-the-way except for a handful of Dutch traders and perhaps a few Portuguese smugglers as well as for very occasional stranded travellers. In any case, none of these could possibly have provided the wealth of detailed and accurate details which the book is teeming with and which can only have been reported by somebody well acquainted with the Makassar language and society (although with a shallow historical knowledge). From research about the author, Nicolas Gervaise, a French priest of the Company of the «Missions-Étrangères», whose family background, individual character, and life story might provide fantastic materials for a talented biographer, it appears that, although he did travel to the East, this was in quality of prospective pupil at the French Catholic Seminary of Ayuthia, and that he never travelled beyond the Kingdom of Siam from where he was sent back home in 1685 by his superiors. On his return he set to write a Natural and Political History of the Kingdom of Siam, in which he displays the usual prejudice over, and no particular knowledge of, the cultures of the Muslim peoples such as the Malays, the Cham and the Makassar then living in Ayuthia. Probably at the time the latter book was sent to press, Nicolas Gervaise was appointed the private tutor of two young Makassar princes called Daéng Ruru and Daéng Tulolo (aged 14 and 13 years) who had arrived in Paris in September 1687. They appear to have been the sole survivors of a rebellion which their father Karaéng Mangallé had led the previous year against the Siamese King Phra Narai. Taken on the battlefield with their arms in hand they were however, due to their young age, not put to death but confided to the representative of the French East India Company who sent them to the French King Louis XIV for their education. As Gervaise published his Historical description of the Makassar kingdom a few months only after having been put in charge of the two youths, they seem to have been his main informants, although there is some evidence that some supplementary information may have had another origin. Of the subsequent life story of these so-called « Indian » princes with French- Makassar names (Louis-Pierre Daén Rourou de Macassar and Louis-Dauphin Daén Toulolo de Macassar), much still remains to be brought to light. From what is already known, one can point to the fact that they were raised in the best college of their time in Paris together with the flower of the French society, that they received all their life long an allowance directly taken from the French King's civil list, and that they were later admitted in the most prestigious French Naval Academy with the best titled French nobility, thus showing their full acceptance as aristocrats among others aristocrats, without apparently suffering the slightest trace of any racial prejudice.

40|$|The {{shoreline}} {{is defined}} as the contact line between the land and sea surface. Due to the dynamic nature of water levels at the coastal boundary, such as waves and tides, the shoreline position incessantly changes in time. The shoreline variability and coastal trends have been the main object of several researches and it is the main target of this thesis. The continuous changing of shoreline positi on depends on several causes: that due to the hydrodynamic (e. g. waves, tsunami, tides, sea level rise, storm surge) and geomorphological change (e. g. barrier island formation, spit development). Consequently, the exact understanding of shoreline dynamic is important {{for a wide range of}} coastal studies such as: a) management and planning of coastal zones, b) hazard mapping, c) defining the exact boundary between state and private owned areas and d) for conceptual or predictive modelling of coastal morphodynamics (erosion- accretion analysis). Moreover, the location of the shoreline can provide information about shoreline changes due to man-made structures(groins, breakwaters, harbors, ecc.) and about beaches dynamic (shape and volume). The aforementioned elements are useful to quantify rates of change in time. For all these reasons the shoreline position is the most common morphologic indicator of coastal ar eas. Usually, the shoreline is positioned by means of aerial images interpretation and then the evolution in time is obtained by a time se ries images analysis. However, the shoreline position extracted from aerial images only represents the wet/dry line that describes the instantaneous land-water boundary at the instant of the acquisition without providing any information concerning to the “normal” or “average” conditions. In this thesis a novel multidisciplinary method which allows the estimation of the shoreline position by means of remotely sensed images, considering the effects of waves and tides, has been proposed. The application of this method involves several techniques used in other disciplines which were int egrated in order to trace the shoreline. The key steps of the proposed method involve the topographic-geomorphic and hydraulic studies. Even if the geological and the geomorphological survey were mainly descriptive, they are functional to the hydraulic study. The understanding of the geomorphological characteristics and the surface water level fluctuations (waves and tides), provides a greater level of accuracy for shoreline positioning. In fact the dynamic nature of the shoreline suggests that this water-land boundary cannot be defined as a single line but it has to be positioned within a strip. The method has been applied to a Mediterranean beach located in the western Sicily. This beach is geomorphologically in equilibrium as demonstrated by the geomorphological study and by the physical description of the submerged and emerged beach. Physical characteristics <b>description</b> has be <b>en</b> completed with the size and composition of sediments analysis. Moreover, the beach profiles and their average slopes were also obtained. The hydraulic study was divided into four steps: 1) wave and tide data collection, 2) identification of “ordinary” sea storm and tides fluctuation, 3) propagation of waves from offshore to nearshore and 4) run-up computation. In order to take into account the wave effects on the shoreline position during one y ear, the concept of “ordinary” sea storm was used. As defined by the Italian law the shoreline (“lido” in Italian), is the beach zone in contact whit the sea and covered by water during an “ordinary” sea storm. In this study 1 year return period was considered as representative of “ordinary” conditions (as reported in the Italian juridical definition - Corte di Cassazione, Sez., Un., 02 / 05 / 1962, n. 849). In order to evaluate the parameters of a “ordinary” sea storm, a statistic analysis of extreme events has been performed. This analysis was carried out using the concept of “equivalent triangular storm” (e. t. s.). The e. t. s. results were compared with the application of directional and omni-directional Wei bull probability density functions on the wave data. Both analyses produced similar results and they gave the significant wave height for each return period considered. Once the significant wave heights and the associated return periods for each wind sector were known, a propagation model(SWAN - Simulating Waves Nearshore), was used to calculate height and period changes of a wave propagating from offshore to near shore. The outputs obtained were used for the run-up calculation. To calculate the r un-up two different approaches were used: an empirical formula and a Boussinesq fully non linear numerical model with a new lagrangian shoreline boundary condition. Finally in order to identify the shoreline position, the sea level fluctuations due to astrono mical influences have to be taken into account. For this reason a tide analysis was performed using tide observations collected during last decade. Once known the wave and tidal fluctuations a strip of uncertainty around the aerial image detected shoreline has been defined. The beach strip determined using the “one year return period ordinary sea storm concept” suggests that this area belongs more to the sea than to the land. Further analyses have to be carried out in order to take also into account the sediment transport, currents and morphological deformation (bathymetry) in time...|$|R
