25|$|A {{kilogram}} of uranium-235 (U-235) converted via nuclear processes releases {{approximately three}} million times {{more energy than}} a kilogram of coal burned conventionally (7.2×1013 <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of uranium-235 versus 2.4×107 <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of coal).|$|E
25|$|The gray (Gy), {{which has}} units of <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> (J/kg), is the SI unit of absorbed dose, {{and is the}} amount of {{radiation}} required to deposit 1 joule of energy in 1 kilogram of any kind of matter.|$|E

5000|$|The {{specific}} enthalpy of {{a uniform}} system {{is defined as}} h = [...] where m is {{the mass of the}} system. The SI unit for specific enthalpy is <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram.</b> It can be expressed in other specific quantities by h = u + pv, where u is the specific internal energy, p is the pressure, and v is specific volume, which is equal to , where ρ is the density.|$|R
50|$|The SI unit of kerma is {{the gray}} (Gy) (or <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram),</b> {{the same as}} the unit of absorbed dose. However, kerma dose is {{different}} from absorbed dose, according to the energies involved, partially because ionization energy is not accounted for. While roughly equal at low energies, absorbed dose is much lower than kerma at higher energies, because some energy escapes from the absorbing volume in the form of bremsstrahlung (X-rays) or fast-moving electrons.|$|R
5000|$|The SI {{unit for}} {{specific}} energy is the <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> (J/kg). Other units {{still in use}} in some contexts are the kilocalorie per gram (Cal/g or kcal/g), mostly in food-related topics, watt hours <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> {{in the field of}} batteries, and the Imperial unit BTU per pound (BTU/lb), in some engineering and applied technical fields. The gray and sievert are specialized measures for specific energy absorbed by body tissues in the form of radiation. Specific strength has the same units as specific energy, and is related to the maximum specific energy of rotation an object can have without flying apart due to centrifugal force. The following table shows the factors for converting to J/kg: ...|$|R
25|$|If heat {{capacity}} is measured for a well defined amount of substance, the specific heat {{is the measure}} of the heat required to increase the temperature of such a unit quantity by one unit of temperature. For example, to raise the temperature of water by one kelvin (equal to one degree Celsius) requires 4186 <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> (J/kg).|$|E

2500|$|Potential is {{expressed}} as gravity times distance, m2·s−2. [...] Travelling one metre {{in the direction}} of a gravity vector of strength 1 m·s−2 will increase your potential by 1 m2·s−2. Again employing G as a multipier, the units can be changed to <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of attracted mass.|$|E
50|$|The Energy {{content of}} biofuel is a {{description}} of the potential energy contained in a given biofuel, measured per unit mass of that fuel, as specific energy, or per unit of volume of the fuel, as energy density. A biofuel is a fuel, produced from living organisms. Biofuels include bioethanol, an alcohol made by fermentation—often used as a gasoline additive, and biodiesel, which is usually used as a diesel additive. Specific energy is energy per unit mass, which is used to describe the energy content of a fuel, expressed in SI units as <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> (J/kg) or equivalent units. Energy density is the amount of energy stored in a fuel per unit volume, expressed in SI units as <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> litre (J/L) or equivalent units.|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} quantity is the {{absorbed dose}} (D), which {{is defined as}} the mean energy imparted ionising radiation (dE) per unit mass (dm) of material (D = dE/dm) The SI unit of absorbed dose is the gray (Gy) defined as one <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram.</b> Absorbed dose, as a point measurement, is suitable for describing localised (i.e. partial organ) exposures such as tumour dose in radiotherapy. It may be used to estimate stochastic risk provided the amount and type of tissue involved is stated. Localised diagnostic dose levels are typically in the 0-50 mGy range. At a dose of 1 milligray (mGy) of photon radiation, each cell nucleus is crossed by an average of 1 liberated electron track.|$|R
50|$|An {{equivalent}} {{statement of}} the Dulong-Petit law in modern terms is that, regardless {{of the nature of}} the substance, the specific heat capacity c of a solid element (measured in <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> kelvin <b>per</b> <b>kilogram)</b> is equal to 3R/M, where R is the gas constant (measured in <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> kelvin per mole) and M is the molar mass (measured in <b>kilogram</b> <b>per</b> mole). Thus, the heat capacity per mole of many elements is 3R.|$|R
2500|$|Nanoconcrete {{is created}} by high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water. To ensure the mixing is {{thorough}} enough to create nano-concrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30 - 600 watts per kilogram of the mix. [...] This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific energy expended upon the mix of at least 5000 <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of the mix. A plasticizer or a superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete mixer. In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses {{on the surface of}} cement particles. This intense mixing serves to divide the cement particles into extremely fine nanometer scale sizes, which provides for extremely thorough mixing. [...] This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) colloid creation.|$|E

5000|$|The CIPM {{also says}} that [...] "in order to avoid any risk of {{confusion}} between the absorbed dose D and the dose equivalent H, the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> for the unit of absorbed dose D and the name sievert instead of <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> for the unit of dose equivalent H".|$|E
5000|$|The unit {{of actual}} {{exposure}} is the röntgen, defined in ionisations per unit volume of air. All ionisation based instruments (including geiger counters and ionisation chambers) measure exposure. However, effects {{depend on the}} energy per unit mass, not the exposure measured in air. A deposit of 1 <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> has the unit of 1 gray (Gy). For 1 MeV energy gamma rays, an exposure of 1 röntgen in air produces a dose of about 0.01 gray (1 centigray, cGy) in water or surface tissue. Because of shielding by the tissue surrounding the bones, the bone marrow only receives about 0.67 cGy when the air exposure is 1 röntgen and the surface skin dose is 1 cGy. Some lower values reported {{for the amount of}} radiation that would kill 50% of personnel (the [...] ) refer to bone marrow dose, which is only 67% of the air dose.|$|R

Absorbed dose: {{the amount of energy}} deposited by ionizing radiation in a unit mass of tissue. It is expressed in units of <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> (J/kg), and called “gray ” (Gy). For more information, see “Primer on Radiation Measurement ” {{at the end of this}} document. Activity (radioactivity) : the rate of decay of radioactive material expressed as the number of atoms breaking down per second measured in units called becquerels or curies. Acute exposure: an exposure to radiation that occurred in a matter of minutes rather than in longer, continuing exposure over a period of time. See also chronic exposure, exposure, fractionated exposure. Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) : a serious illness caused by receiving a dose greater than 50 rads of penetrating radiation to the body in a short time (usually minutes). The earliest symptoms are nausea, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea. Hair loss, bleeding, swelling of the mouth and throat, and general loss of energy may follow. If the exposure has been approximately 1, 000 rads or more, death may occur within 2 – 4 weeks. For more information, see CDC’s fact sheet “Acute Radiation Syndrome ” a...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{looks into}} the effects removing recyclable materials has on the calorific value (CV) of municipal solid waste (MSW) feedstock, {{which is due to}} be incinerated (combustion) within an energy from waste (EfW) facility. The removal of individual recyclable materials as well as overall mixed recyclables was considered. The increase of recycling was considered in particular quantities which are in-line with the government targets of 50 % recycling by 2020 and 70 % recycling by 2030. A hypothetical 90 % recycling was also considered following this trend. It was found that the removal of materials from the MSW stream with little energy (such as food and garden waste) allows for a higher CV (MJ/kg, mega <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram)</b> within the remaining MSW. Alternatively the removal of materials such as plastic which have a higher CV, could cause a reduction in the overall CV of the remaining waste. Overall, if recycling is increased equally across all materials based on the current recycling rates, then the CV is predicted to decrease within the remaining waste in the MSW stream, but not by a substantial amount (less than 1. 2 % change with 70 % recycling). Results also showed that increasing recycling by these amounts decrease the mass of the remaining MSW by 4. 95 % (50 % recycling), 19. 09 % (70 %) and 33. 23 % (90 %) respectively. Financial and environmental factors also considered indicate that increasing recycling is the best overall option for waste disposal. For the portion of waste that cannot feasibly be recycled, EfW (combustion) is currently a more beneficial option than landfill...|$|R

25|$|The {{fundamental}} principle of radiosurgery {{is that of}} selective ionization of tissue, by means of high-energy beams of radiation. Ionization is the production of ions and free radicals which are usually deleterious to the cells. These ions and radicals, which may be formed from {{the water in the}} cell or biological materials, can produce irreparable damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in the cell's death. Thus, biological inactivation is carried out in a volume of tissue to be treated, with a precise destructive effect. The radiation dose is usually measured in grays (one gray (Gy) is the absorption of one <b>joule</b> of energy <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of mass). A unit that attempts to take into account both the different organs that are irradiated and the type of radiation is the sievert, a unit that describes both the amount of energy deposited and the biological effectiveness.|$|R
