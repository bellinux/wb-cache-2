5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> man {{is made from}} the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's going to stop. <b>It</b> <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> at any point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{annotation}} of {{the stone}} is in a church inventory from 1829, and <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the stone was illegible. Ljungström documented in 1861 {{that it was in}} the rock fence with the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, it was still in the same spot. Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove the stone from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found the stone raised in the cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Churchill {{has been}} active since at least 1984 as the co-director of the Denver-based American Indian Movement of Colorado, now an {{autonomous}} chapter of the American Indian Movement. In 1993, he and other local AIM leaders, including Russell Means, Glenn T. Morris, Robert Robideau, and David Hill, broke with the national AIM leadership, including Dennis Banks and the brothers Vernon and Clyde Bellecourt, claiming that all AIM chapters are autonomous. The AIM Grand Governing Council is based in Minneapolis and retains {{the name of the}} national group. <b>It</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the schism arose when Means, Churchill, Glenn T. Morris and others openly supported the Miskito Indian group Misurasata, who were allied with the anti-revolutionary, CIA-backed Contras.|$|E
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. <b>It</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> a successful scientific explanation must deduce {{the occurrence of}} the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} myths {{regarding}} {{the construction of}} the Faidherbe Bridge which are present even today and are depicted in some tourist guides. The construction of the bridge is attributed to Gustave Eiffel. In general <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the metallic parts of the bridge represents a gift from the French government and that the parts were originally designed for the King Carol I Bridge over the Danube River in Romania. Other sources say that the metallic parts were intended for a bridge in Austria–Hungary over the Danube River in Vienna or Budapest. Finally another myth regarding the beams of the bridge says that the parts were intended for an unspecified site but the vessel transporting mysteriously sunk and the authorities in Senegal took advantage of this situation and built a local bridge.|$|E

5|$|While {{exploring}} the mansion, Jennifer searches for Mary's true intentions. Depending on choices {{made by the}} player, Jennifer will either discover Simon Barrows trapped in a jail cell, or her father's corpse. If the latter happens, Jennifer will find his death letter that tells of his account concerning Mary Barrows and her twins, Bobby and Dan. <b>It</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he was trapped there for three days, until his death on November 10, 1986. Jennifer then visits a small church. If the player has collected all the necessary items and clues, then she gains access to the underground catacombs of the mansion. Jennifer sees a cloaked figure walking ahead of her; this is Mary. If Lotte {{did not need to}} rescue Jennifer from the jail cell, she can be found dying at an altar, and tells Jennifer about the switches in the clock tower. Otherwise, she rescues Jennifer from the jail cell, but is shot by Mary.|$|E
