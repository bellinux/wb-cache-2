After one text, Darryl tells Andy {{that he is}} one bad text {{away from}} being blocked, but Andy wagers that he is one good text from a high five, to which Darryl agrees. Darryl then gets a text from Andy telling {{him to come to}} the parking lot, where there are pigeons eating an <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>cone.</b> Darryl laughs and gives Andy a high five.|$|E
5|$|While at {{the food}} court in the mall, Phineas accidentally drops his <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>cone</b> on bully Buford's pants, causing the whole food court to laugh at Buford. Enraged, he {{challenges}} Phineas to a fight right there, but boxing champion Evander Holyfield arrives and convinces them to instead fight in an organized thumb wrestling match later that day, which Buford accepts. Despite being cautioned by Phineas's friends Baljeet and Isabella, Holyfield trains Phineas through simple tasks, including punching a chain of sausages and playing Dance Dance Revolution.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>cone</b> with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures {{for this}} section of the park, as well as some smaller works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management decided they liked it enough for it to be a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, Boo Boo's Buggys, an <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>cone,</b> and for a popcorn counter.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} cake factory, {{where he is}} trapped in a vat of cake mix. His nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, appears and explains that today is his birthday. All throughout his life, his parents never showed up to his birthday parties (even his own birth); now, he plans on using a hypnotic device to force everyone to celebrate his birthday. He then rides off with the invention on a flying machine. Perry escapes from the mix and follows after him. In the air, Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight and the machine is activated, but while trying to get Perry {{to let go of}} the wall of the flying machine he accidentally makes the machine malfunction, causing the people below to still not want to celebrate his birthday. Doofenshmirtz, defeated, drops the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>cone</b> he is eating in the fight and it falls to the ground below.|$|E

As he falls dead, Gaga calls 9-1-1 and declares that she just killed her boyfriend. The police arrive at the mansion and arrest Gaga who, wearing a tall <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>cone</b> corkscrew wig, walks to the police car as the paparazzi surround her once again. Images flash by, with newspapers proclaiming her innocence and that Gaga {{is back in the}} spotlight and has regained her fame.

The character stirred Caniff's imagination, and he hired Ilona Massey to pose for him. Caniff designed Pipper the Piper after John Kennedy and Miss Mizzou after Marilyn Monroe.|$|E

25|$|Colloquially, its {{pattern of}} stars has been likened to a kite or <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>cone.</b> However, depictions of Boötes have varied historically. Aratus {{described}} him circling the north pole, herding the two bears. Later ancient Greek depictions, described by Ptolemy, have him holding {{the reins of}} his hunting dogs (Canes Venatici) in his left hand, with a spear, club, or staff in his right hand. After Hevelius introduced Mons Maenalus in 1681, Boötes was often depicted standing on the Peloponnese mountain. By 1801, when Johann Bode published his Uranographia, Boötes had acquired a sickle, which was also held in his left hand.|$|E

25|$|Ice cream soda {{was invented}} in the 1870s, adding to ice cream's popularity. The {{invention}} of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, {{although there is no}} conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The ice cream sundae originated in the late 19th century. Several men claimed to have created the first sundae, but there is no conclusive evidence to support any of their stories. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent blue laws, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include Buffalo, Two Rivers, Ithaca, and Evanston. Both the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>cone</b> and banana split became popular in the early 20th century.|$|E

500|$|Finally, the big match commences and Phineas is vigorously {{beaten by}} Buford in each round. When {{the final round}} begins, Buford overpowers Phineas and pulls him up through the air.

500|$|An {{issue of}} a {{religious}} nature arose in 2005 in the United Kingdom when Burger King introduced a new prepackaged ice cream product; the label of the product included a silhouette of the ice cream that when rotated on its side bore a resemblance to the Islamic inscription for God, Allah (الله). When a British Muslim named Rashad Akhtar, {{a resident of the}} community of High Wycombe, was presented with the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>cone</b> in a Park Royal Burger King restaurant, he noticed the resemblance and became angered at what he felt was an offense to the Islamic faith. After being informed of the likeness, the local Islamic group Muslim Council of Britain pointed out the issue of the possible interpretation to Burger King and its relevance to Shariah, the Muslim version of canon law which governs the lives of members of the Islamic faith and carries the same weight as civil law in their belief structure. The company responded by voluntarily recalling the product and reissuing it with a new label. The Muslim Council praised the company for its [...] "sensitive and prompt action" [...] in resolving the matter; however, Akhtar was not satisfied with the company's withdrawal of the product.|$|E
