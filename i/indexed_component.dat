The features are stored and <b>indexed</b> <b>component</b> wise. For each dimension we retrieve only those objects close the query point and then apply a local distance function to this subset. Thus we can dramatically reduce the amount of data looked at. We have evaluated these distance measures within a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) framework to determine the trade-off between the percentage of the data retrieved and the precision. Our results show that up to 90 % of the data can be ignored whilst maintaining, and in some cases improving, retrieval performance. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the implications}} of landowners’ option values in land allocation and derives policy recommendations for payments for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). Given that REDD will not represent a permanent change in the cumulative flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, payment scheme design is motivated {{by the need to}} secure forest carbon sinks over time (the ‘permanence criterion’) while remaining relatively cost-effective. Alternative payment schemes, combining fixed and variable components, are considered in a framework with two competing land uses, forest and agriculture. Cost-effectiveness depends on the dependency structure between the returns from the <b>indexed</b> <b>component</b> of the payment and the returns from the alternative land use, the relative volatility level of the underlying returns, and the relative combination of fixed and variable payments. After developing the general model, it is is applied to REDD policy scenarios in Parana State, Brazil...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of <b>index</b> <b>components</b> of Zisu Fang preparations and additionally analysis the anti-dementia drug system characteristics. Methods: A PK-PD-drug interaction (DI) method {{was applied to}} determine the characteristics of <b>index</b> <b>components</b> of Zisu Fang preparations in vivo. Results: In the PK study, maximum plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration–time curve, and mean residence time of <b>index</b> <b>components</b> of Zisu Fang preparations {{were higher in the}} memory-deficit model group than in the control group. This suggested that the <b>index</b> <b>components</b> of Zisu Fang preparations had an affinity for the state of dementia in this model. In the PD study, at the peak time points of anti-dementia efficacy (0. 17  h and 1  h), the plasma concentrations of <b>index</b> <b>components</b> of Zisu Fang preparations reached the first or second largest plasma concentration peak or were close to the plasma concentration peak, and showed positive correlation between these two peaks, indicating that the <b>index</b> <b>components</b> of Zisu Fang synergistically exerted an anti-dementia effect. According to the association analysis of PK-PD-DI, baicalin, rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid B, matrine, and tanshinone IIA were the main active ingredients of the anti-dementia drug system of Zisu Fang preparations in vivo, but were only efficacious against dementia when all five components were present at a specific concentration and proportion. Conclusions: Based on the PK and PD correlation analysis, baicalin, rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid B, matrine, and tanshinone IIA are the main active ingredients of Zisu Fang preparations with regard to its anti-dementia effects, and represent the basic characteristics of drug system: natures, synergy, and affinity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractShenfu Injection (SFI) is a {{well-defined}} Chinese herbal formulation that is obtained from red ginseng and processed aconite root. The main active constituents in SFI are ginsenosides and aconitum alkaloids.

40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} whether {{differences in the}} amounts of effective <b>index</b> <b>components</b> in Jakyak-Gamcho decoctions derived via extraction with either water or ethanol were associated with differential spasmolytic effectiveness. Methods. The amounts of effective <b>index</b> <b>components</b> (paeoniflorin, benzoic acid, glycyrrhizin, and isoliquiritin) contained in water-extracted Jakyak-Gamcho decoction and 70 % ethanol-extracted Jakyak-Gamcho decoction were compared by high-performance liquid chromatography. Muscle cramp reduction rates were compared between the two decoctions by comparing the degrees of muscle contraction, measured as the tension developed during electrical stimulation, before and 1 and 2 [*]h after injection in rats. Results. The relative amounts of effective <b>index</b> <b>components</b> were, on average, about 43 % higher in the 70 % ethanol-extracted decoction than in the water-extracted decoction. Two hours after injection, 0. 25 [*]g/kg of 70 % ethanol-extracted decoction produced a significantly greater spasmolytic effect than 0. 25 [*]g/kg of water-extracted Jakyak-Gamcho decoction or distilled water (both p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Differences in the amounts of effective <b>index</b> <b>components</b> resulting {{from the use of}} different extractants were associated with differences in spasmolytic effectiveness. Hence, it may be worthwhile to investigate alternative extraction methods in terms of extraction efficiency and in vivo effectiveness for various herbal medicines in the future...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} {{whether the number of}} partitions of <b>index</b> <b>components</b> and the use of specific weights for each component influence the diagnostic accuracy of a composite index. Simulation studies were conducted in order to compare the sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of indices constructed using equal number of components but different number of partitions for all components. Moreover, the odds ratio obtained from the univariate logistic regression model for each component was proposed as potential weight. The current simulation results showed that the sensitivity, specificity and AUC of an index increase as the number of partitions of components increases. However, the rate that the diagnostic accuracy increases is reduced as the number of partitions increases. In addition, {{it was found that the}} diagnostic accuracy of the weighted index developed using the proposed weights is higher compared with that of the corresponding un-weighted index. The use of large-scale <b>index</b> <b>components</b> and the use of effect size measures (i. e. odds ratios, ORs) of <b>index</b> <b>components</b> as potential weights are proposed in order to obtain indices with high diagnostic accuracy for a particular binary outcome. weights, indices, specificity, AUC, simulations, application,...|$|R

As another example, the Wilshire 4500 and Wilshire 5000 indices have five versions each: full capitalization total return, full capitalization price, float-adjusted total return, float-adjusted price, and equal weight.

When looking for a component, the main concern of users is the functionality of the desired component; implementation details are secondary.

On the other hand, over a longer horizon, an increase in volatility is observed despite a decline in trading volume. Our results suggest that Hong Kong government intervention stabilises the market only in the short run through a reduction in free float in the market.

Methods : The Oral Health Status Index (OHSI) was used on a probability sample of adults, aged 18 – 93 years, living in the Detroit tricounty area. Data were collected on 509 subjects via in-home dental examinations. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were {{used to compare the}} OHSI and its components, including decayed, missing, and replaced teeth, free ends, and moderate and severe periodontal disease measures. Results : The mean OHSI score for subjects was 77. 3 (se= 1. 83) with a range of - 8. 0 to 100. 0. In regression analyses, OHSI scores were positively correlated with subjects' education level, self-rated oral health scores, and frequency of dental checkups and negatively correlated with age, nonwhite race, and smoking. Of the <b>index</b> <b>components,</b> missing teeth performed well as an indicator of oral health status. Missing teeth were positively correlated with age, nonwhite race, and smoking and negatively correlated with education level, self-rated oral health, and use of Medicaid. About 53 percent of variance in OHSI scores was explained by the multivariate models, compared to 46 percent for missing teeth. Conclusions : Choosing an indicator of oral health status likely will depend upon the characteristics of the population to be studied. As a composite measure of oral health status, the OHSI performed acceptably; however, missing teeth, an <b>index</b> <b>component,</b> also worked well.
