5|$|Some non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are {{not found in}} proteins. Examples include 2-aminoisobutyric acid and the {{neurotransmitter}} <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid.</b> Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids– for example, ornithine and citrulline occur in the urea cycle, part of amino acid catabolism (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid beta alanine (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), a component of coenzyme A.|$|E
5|$|The two neurotransmitters {{that are}} used most widely in the {{vertebrate}} brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters {{can be found in}} nearly every part of the brain. Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.|$|E
5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Two other neurotransmitters, orexin and <b>gamma-Aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA), seem {{to promote}} wakefulness, {{diminish}} during deep sleep, and inhibit paradoxical sleep.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines do {{not have}} any effect on the levels of GABA in the brain. Clonazepam has no effect on GABA levels and has no effect on <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> transaminase. Clonazepam does, however, affect {{glutamate}} decarboxylase activity. It differs from other anticonvulsant drugs it was compared to in a study.|$|E
25|$|Brown rice may be {{soaked in}} warm water for 20 hours to stimulate germination. This process, called germinated brown rice (GBR), {{activates}} enzymes and enhances amino acids including <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> to improve the nutritional value of brown rice. This method {{is a result of}} research carried out for the United Nations International Year of Rice.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone (brand names Zimovane and Imovane) is a nonbenzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} agent used in {{the treatment}} of insomnia. Zopiclone is molecularly distinct from benzodiazepine drugs and is classed as a cyclopyrrolone. However, zopiclone increases the normal transmission of the neurotransmitter <b>gamma-Aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> in the central nervous system, via modulating benzodiazepine receptors {{in the same way that}} benzodiazepine drugs do.|$|E
25|$|Medications that {{impede the}} release of {{excitatory}} neurotransmitters {{have been used to}} control or prevent spasms. Treatment with intrathecal baclofen, a <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA) agonist, decreases muscle tone and has been shown to decrease the frequency of muscle spasms in ADCP patients. Tetrabenazine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of Huntington's disease, {{has been shown to be}} effective treating chorea.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{mechanism}} of action of valproate is not fully understood, traditionally, its anticonvulsant effect {{has been attributed to}} the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels and increased brain levels of <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA). The GABAergic effect is also believed to contribute towards the anti-manic properties of valproate. In animals, sodium valproate raises cerebral and cerebellar levels of the inhibitory synaptic neurotransmitter, GABA, possibly by inhibiting GABA degradative enzymes, such as GABA transaminase, succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and by inhibiting the re-uptake of GABA by neuronal cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurochemistry}} {{of vertigo}} includes six primary neurotransmitters {{that have been}} identified between the three-neuron arc that drives the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central vestibular neurons, and may modulate synaptic transmission in all three neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. <b>Gamma-Aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA) {{is thought to be}} inhibitory for the commissures of the medial vestibular nucleus, the connections between the cerebellar Purkinje cells, and the lateral vestibular nucleus, and the vertical VOR.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{dystonia}} {{is suspected}} when the dystonia {{is the only}} sign {{and there is no}} identifiable cause or structural abnormality in the central nervous system. It is suspected to be caused by a pathology of the central nervous system, likely originating in those parts of the brain concerned with motor function, such as the basal ganglia, and the GABA (<b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid)</b> producing Purkinje neurons. The precise cause of primary dystonia is unknown. In many cases it may involve some genetic predisposition towards the disorder combined with environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{sleepiness}} and trouble with coordination. Serious side effects are rare. They include suicide, decreased breathing, {{and an increased}} risk of seizures if used too frequently in those with epilepsy. Occasionally excitement or agitation may occur. Long term use can result in tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms on dose reduction. Abrupt stopping after long-term use can be potentially dangerous. After stopping, cognitive problems may persist for six months or longer. It is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Its mechanism of action is by increasing the effect of the neurotransmitter <b>gamma-Aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA).|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} {{speculate that}} abnormalities or {{deficiencies in the}} receptors for certain neurotransmitters may contribute to some forms of myoclonus. Receptors {{that appear to be}} related to myoclonus include those for two important inhibitory neurotransmitters: serotonin, which constricts blood vessels and brings on sleep, and <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA), which helps the brain maintain muscle control. Other receptors with links to myoclonus include those for benzodiazepines, drugs that induce sleep, and for glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is important for the control of motor and sensory functions in the spinal cord. More {{research is needed to determine}} how these receptor abnormalities cause or contribute to myoclonus.|$|E
25|$|Spastic {{cerebral}} palsy, or {{cerebral palsy}} where spasticity (muscle tightness) is the exclusive or almost exclusive impairment present, {{is by far}} the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, occurring in upwards of 70% of all cases. People with this type of CP are hypertonic and have what is essentially a neuromuscular mobility impairment (rather than hypotonia or paralysis) stemming from an upper motor neuron lesion in the brain as well as the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex. This damage impairs the ability of some nerve receptors in the spine to receive <b>gamma-Aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> properly, leading to hypertonia in the muscles signaled by those damaged nerves.|$|E
25|$|The neuroadaptive {{processes}} {{involved in}} tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal mechanisms implicate both the GABAergic and the glutamatergic systems. <b>Gamma-Aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system; roughly one-quarter to one-third of synapses use GABA. GABA mediates the influx of chloride ions through ligand-gated chloride channels called GABAA receptors. When chloride enters the nerve cell, the cell membrane potential hyperpolarizes thereby inhibiting depolarization, or reduction in the firing rate of the post-synaptic nerve cell. Benzodiazepine potentiates the action of GABA, by binding a site between the α and γ subunits of the 5-subunit receptor thereby increasing {{the frequency of the}} GABA-gated chloride channel opening in the presence of GABA.|$|E
25|$|The {{tetanus toxin}} {{initially}} binds to peripheral nerve terminals. It is transported within the axon and across synaptic junctions {{until it reaches}} the central nervous system. There it becomes rapidly fixed to gangliosides at the presynaptic inhibitory motor nerve endings, and is taken up into the axon by endocytosis. The effect of the toxin is to block the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA) across the synaptic cleft, which is required to check the nervous impulse. If nervous impulses cannot be checked by normal inhibitory mechanisms, the generalized muscular spasms characteristic of tetanus are produced. The toxin appears to act by selective cleavage of a protein component of synaptic vesicles, synaptobrevinII, and this prevents the release of neurotransmitters by the cells.|$|E
25|$|Ventromedial {{nucleus of}} the {{hypothalamus}} (VMN) has long been considered as a sexually dimorphic nucleus. It is an important region for regulating the sexual responses in female rodents. The neurons within VMN have significant estrogen-dependent functional and structural plasticity. The synaptic organization of the VMN is sexually dimorphic. Females have more dendrite chemical synapses within VMN while males have more somatic synapses within that region. In addition, the size of postsynaptic densities of axospinous and axosomatic synapses is sexually dimorphic, with males having larger density than females. Estrogen {{plays an important role}} in modulating the sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity of VMN. Estradiol levels are high on proestrus rats and return to low levels on diestrus rats. The volume of cell bodies within VMN in proestrus rats and male rats is larger than diestrus rats. Also, proestrus rats have significantly higher synapse density in VMN than diestrus rats. Moreover, <b>Gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> plays a role in VMN development such as sexual differentiation.|$|E
25|$|GHB is {{a central}} nervous system {{depressant}} used as an intoxicant, although it produces a stimulant effect at lower doses due to its action on the GHB receptor. It has many street names, including G, Liquid G, Liquid X, Liquid E, Georgia Home Boy, Juice, Mils, and Fantasy. Its effects have been described anecdotally as comparable with ethanol (alcohol) and MDMA use, such as euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced libido and empathogenic states. At higher doses, GHB may induce nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, agitation, visual disturbances, depressed breathing, amnesia, unconsciousness, and death. When death is associated with GHB, it is sometimes in conjunction with other drugs, such as alcohol or benzodiazepine which influence the same neurotransmitter (<b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> GABA). The effects of GHB can last from 1.5 to 4 hours, or even longer if large doses have been consumed. Consuming GHB with alcohol is dangerous as it can lead to respiratory arrest and vomiting in combination with unrouseable sleep, a potentially lethal combination.|$|E
25|$|Patients with SPS {{generally}} have high amounts of high {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} antibody titers. About 80 percent of SPS patients have GAD antibodies, compared with about {{one percent of the}} general population. The overwhelming majority of people who have GAD antibodies do not contract SPS, indicating that systematic synthesis of the antibody is not the sole cause of SPS. GAD, a presynaptic autoantigen, is generally thought to {{play a key role in}} the condition, but exact details of the way that autoantibodies affect SPS patients are not known. Most SPS patients with high-titer GAD antibodies also have antibodies that inhibit GABA-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP). Autoantibodies against amphiphysin and gephyrin are also sometimes found in SPS patients. The antibodies appear to interact with antigens in the brain neurons and the spinal cord synapses, causing a functional blockade with <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid.</b> This leads to GABA impairment, which probably causes the stiffness and spasms that characterizes SPS. There are low GABA levels in the motor cortexes of SPS patients.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine is a phenyltriazine, {{making it}} {{chemically}} distinct from other approved anticonvulsants. It enhances {{the action of}} <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA), the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS; which consists of the brain and spinal cord). Lamotrigine may also inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels thereby suppressing the release of glutamate and aspartate, two of the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the CNS. It is generally accepted {{to be a member of}} the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs, but it could have additional actions since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its sigma receptor activity. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side-effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasises its unique properties. Lamotrigine is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver.|$|E
25|$|SGCs {{role as a}} {{regulator}} of neuronal microenvironment {{is further}} characterized by its electrical properties which {{are very similar to}} those of astrocytes. Astrocytes have a well studied and defined role in controlling the microenvironment within the brain, therefore researchers are investigating any homologous role of SGCs within the sympathetic ganglia. An established mode of controlling the microenvironment in sensory ganglia is the uptake of substances by specialized transporters which carry neurotransmitters into cells when coupled with Na+ and Cl−. Transporters for glutamate and <b>gamma-Aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA) have been found in SGCs. They appear to be actively engaged in the control of the composition of the extracellular space of the ganglia. The enzyme glutamine synthetase, which catalyzes the conversion of glutamate into glutamine, is found in large amounts in SGCs. Additionally, SGCs contain the glutamate related enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase, and thus can supply the neurons not only with glutamine, but also with malate and lactate.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{account for}} 8% to 12% of dried green coffee beans. A {{majority}} of the proteins are of the 11-S storage kind (alpha – component of 32 kDa, beta – component of 22 kDa), {{most of which are}} degraded to free amino acids during maturation of green coffee beans. Further, 11-S storage proteins are degraded to their individual amino acids under roasting temperature, thus are an additional source of bitter components due to generation of Maillard reaction products. High temperature and oxygen concentration and low pH degrade 11-S storage proteins of green coffee beans to low-molecular-weight peptides and amino acids. The degradation is accelerated in the presence of organic acids such as chlorogenic acids and their derivatives. Other proteins include enzymes, such as catalase and polyphenol oxidase, which are important for the maturation of green coffee beans. Mature coffee contains free amino acids (4.0mg amino acid/g robusta coffee and up to 4.5mg amino acid/g arabica coffee). In Coffea arabica, alanine is the amino acid with the highest concentration, i.e. 1.2mg/g, followed by asparagine of 0.66mg/g, whereas in C. robusta, alanine is present at a concentration of 0.8mg/g and asparagine at 0.36mg/g. The free hydrophobic amino acids in fresh green coffee beans contribute to the unpleasant taste, making it impossible to prepare a desirable beverage with such compounds. In fresh green coffee from Peru, these concentrations have been determined as: isoleucine 81mg/kg, leucine 100mg/kg, valine 93mg/kg, tyrosine 81mg/kg, phenylalanine 133mg/kg. The concentration of <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (a neurotransmitter) has been determined between 143mg/kg and 703mg/kg in green coffee beans from Tanzania. Roasted coffee beans do not contain any free amino acids; the amino acids in green coffee beans are degraded under roasting temperature to Maillard products (reaction products between the aldehyde group of sugar and the alpha-amino group of the amino acids). Further, diketopiperazines, e.g. cyclo(proline-proline), cyclo(proline-leucine), and cyclo(proline-isoleucine), are generated from the corresponding amino acids, and are the major source of the bitter taste of roasted coffee. The bitter flavor of diketopiperazines is perceptible at around 20mg/liter of water. The content of diketopiperazines in espresso is about 20 to 30mg, which is responsible for its bitterness.|$|E
500|$|Benzodiazepines {{enhance the}} effect of the {{neurotransmitter}} <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA) at the GABAA receptor, resulting in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause [...] anterograde amnesia and dissociation. These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety, insomnia, agitation, seizures, muscle spasms, alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures. Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short-, intermediate-, or long-acting. Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.|$|E
500|$|GABA {{controls}} the excitability of neurons by binding to the GABAA receptor. The GABAA receptor is a protein complex {{located in the}} synapses of neurons. All GABAA receptors contain an ion channel that conducts chloride ions across neuronal cell membranes and two binding sites for the neurotransmitter <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA), while a subset of GABAA receptor complexes also contain a single binding site for benzodiazepines. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex does not alter binding of GABA. Unlike other positive allosteric modulators that increases ligand binding, benzodiazepine binding acts as a positive allosteric modulator by increasing the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane when GABA is already bound to its receptor. [...] This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between resting potential and threshold potential is increased and firing is less likely.|$|E
2500|$|Vigabatrin is an {{irreversible}} mechanism-based inhibitor of <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> aminotransferase (GABA-AT), {{the enzyme}} {{responsible for the}} catabolism of GABA, which increases the level of GABA in the brain. Vigabatrin is a racemic compound, and its -enantiomer is pharmacologically active., ...|$|E
2500|$|Hatsuga genmai (...) is {{brown rice}} {{that has been}} soaked in heated water until germinated. It {{is also known as}} GABA rice, as the {{germination}} process greatly increases its [...] <b>gamma-Aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> content. It has a softer texture than ordinary brown rice and a pleasant fragrance. [...] It is sold in Japanese supermarkets, {{but it can also be}} made at home. [...] Some high-end rice cookers have a GABA rice setting to automate the process.|$|E
2500|$|Diazepam is a long-acting [...] "{{classical}}" [...] benzodiazepine. Other classical benzodiazepines include chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam, flurazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. Diazepam has anticonvulsant properties. Diazepam has {{no effect}} on GABA levels and no effect on glutamate decarboxylase activity, but has a slight effect on <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> transaminase activity. It differs from some other anticonvulsive drugs with which it was compared. Benzodiazepines act via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive calcium uptake in rat nerve cell preparations.|$|E
2500|$|Temazepam is a white, {{crystalline}} substance, very {{slightly soluble}} in water, and sparingly soluble in alcohol. Its main pharmacological action {{is to increase the}} effect of the neurotransmitter <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA) at the GABAA receptor. This causes sedation, motor impairment, ataxia, anxiolysis, an anticonvulsant effect, muscle relaxation, and a reinforcing effect. [...] As a medication before surgery, temazepam decreased cortisol in elderly patients. [...] In rats, it triggered the release of vasopressin into paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and decreased the release of ACTH under stress.|$|E
2500|$|Benzodiazepines bind to a {{specific}} benzodiazepine receptor, thereby enhancing {{the effect of the}} neurotransmitter <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA) and causing CNS depression. In overdose situations this pharmacological effect is extended leading to a more severe CNS depression and potentially coma [...] or cardiac arrest. [...] Benzodiazepine-overdose-related coma may be characterised by an alpha pattern with the central somatosensory conduction time (CCT) after median nerve stimulation being prolonged and the N20 to be dispersed. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials demonstrate delayed interpeak latencies (IPLs) I-III, III-V and I-V. Toxic overdoses of benzodiazepines therefore cause prolonged CCT and IPLs.|$|E
2500|$|Acute alcohol {{intoxication}} through excessive doses {{in general}} causes short- or long-term health effects. NMDA receptors start to become unresponsive, slowing {{areas of the}} brain for which they are responsible. Contributing to this effect is the activity that alcohol induces in the <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GABA) system. The GABA system is known to inhibit activity in the brain. [...] GABA could also be responsible for the memory impairment that many people experience. It has been asserted that GABA signals interfere with the registration and consolidation stages of memory formation. As the GABA system is found in the hippocampus (among other areas in the CNS), which is thought to play a large role in memory formation, this is thought to be possible.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{study was}} {{conducted}} concerning an effect by the mothers of the flesh fly population. [...] There is a maternal effect that operates in S. bullata that can prevent pupal diapause when reared under short day conditions. It was determined that certain environmental stressors or chemical treatments on the mother, such as extreme temperature shocks, food deprivation and reducing maternal size, were ineffective in altering the diapause-suppressant. However, there were several chemical agents that proved effective. <b>Gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> octopamine and pilocarpine all countered the maternal affect and permitted the expression of diapause in the flesh fly progeny. [...] The ability to express diapause is an important consideration for forensic entomologists as diapause allows the pupae to become metabollically [...] "dormant" [...] until environmental conditions improve; this would significantly affect pupal time estimations and subsequent post-mortem interval estimations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} tetanus are caused when tetanus toxin blocks inhibitory impulses, by {{interfering with the}} release of neurotransmitters, including glycine and <b>gamma-aminobutyric</b> <b>acid.</b> These inhibitory neurotransmitters inhibit the alpha motor neurons. With diminished inhibition, the resting firing rate of the alpha motor neuron increases, producing rigidity, unopposed muscle contraction and spasm. Characteristic features are risus sardonicus (a rigid smile), trismus (commonly known as [...] "lock-jaw"), and opisthotonus (rigid, arched back). Seizures may occur, and the autonomic nervous system may also be affected. Tetanospasmin appears to prevent the release of neurotransmitters by selectively cleaving a component of synaptic vesicles called synaptobrevin II. Loss of inhibition also affects preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the lateral gray matter of the spinal cord and produces sympathetic hyperactivity and high circulating catecholamine levels. Hypertension and tachycardia alternating with hypotension and bradycardia may develop.|$|E
