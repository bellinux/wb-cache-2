25|$|On {{the evening}} of Good Friday, Dante is {{following}} Virgil but hesitates; Virgil explains <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been sent by Beatrice, the symbol of Divine Love. Beatrice has been sent with prayers from the Virgin Mary (symbolic of compassion) and of Saint Lucia (symbolic of illuminating Grace). Rachel, symbolic of the contemplative life, also appears in the heavenly scene recounted by Virgil. The two of them then begin their journey to the underworld.|$|E
25|$|On December 16, 2010, a redditor named Matt {{posted a}} link {{describing}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> donated a kidney, and included a JustGive link to encourage users to give {{donations to the}} American Cancer Society. After an initially positive reaction, Reddit users began to become suspicious of Matt's intentions, and suggested that he was keeping the donations for himself. Users telephoned his home and he received death threats. Matt eventually proved that he was genuine by uploading his doctor's records.|$|E
25|$|By March 2012, Quintel was {{directing}} {{a crew of}} about 35 to develop each episode of Regular Show, which takes about nine months to go from idea to final product. Quintel has most recently worked for Cartoon Network Studios in Burbank, California developing episodes for Regular Show and provided his real voice to the 23-year-old blue jay Regular Show character Mordecai. In commenting on his voice acting, Quintel noted <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> an easy-going nature and never yells in real life, {{so he had to}} learn how to yell as the Mordecai character.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pickwick {{proceeded}} {{to pour into}} the horror-stricken ear of Mr. Nupkins, an abridged account of all Mr. Jingle's atrocities. <b>He</b> related <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> first met him; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> eloped with Miss Wardle; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cheerfully resigned the lady for a pecuniary consideration; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> entrapped himself into a lady's boarding-school at midnight; and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> (Mr. Pickwick) now felt it his duty to expose his assumption of his present name and rank.|$|R
60|$|Lisle {{explained}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> found a plant which was, as he knew, {{used for}} that purpose; and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> extracted the colouring matter from it.|$|R

25|$|Though he {{has managed}} to remain clean and sober for {{extended}} periods in recent years, Osbourne has frequently commented on his former wild lifestyle, puzzled at <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> survived 40years of drug and alcohol abuse. Upon being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Osbourne spent the next three months locked in his hotel room taking vast amounts of alcohol and other drugs all day, every day. He claims that he would certainly have died if his future wife Sharon had not offered to manage him as a solo artist.|$|E
25|$|He is {{the uncle}} of Ondine and also Lord of the Mediterranean Sea. He tries to warn Ondine {{that what she}} intends to do with Palemon goes against what is {{expected}} of her. When she chooses not to listen to his advice, he creates the conditions for a shipwreck where she is returned to the sea. When Ondine once again finds Palemon and realises <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> betrayed her, Tirrenio exacts a terrible revenge with his fellow Undines by causing death and destruction for all Palemon's guests.|$|E
25|$|Margaret {{finds the}} bustling, smoky town of Milton harsh and strange, {{and she is}} upset by its poverty. Mr. Hale (in reduced {{financial}} circumstances) works as a tutor; one of his pupils is the wealthy and influential manufacturer John Thornton, master of Marlborough Mills. From the outset, Margaret and Thornton {{are at odds with}} each other; she sees him as coarse and unfeeling, and he sees her as haughty. He is attracted to her beauty and self-assurance, and she begins to admire <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> risen from poverty.|$|E
60|$|The policeman, with {{becoming}} humility, related <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{taken the}} charge; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; {{and how that}} was all he knew about it.|$|R
60|$|While {{he spoke}} {{he thought of}} that hot madness which had driven him in pursuit of Mildred. <b>He</b> remembered <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> chafed against it and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> felt the {{degradation}} of it.|$|R
50|$|When Academy members {{complained about}} the anachronisms in the letters, Vrain-Lucas had to forge more letters to explain away his earlier mistakes. Debate {{continued}} on to 1868 {{and the next year}} he was arrested for forgery. In the following trial Chasles <b>had</b> to testify <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been duped, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> purchased large numbers of other forged letters and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> paid total of 140,000-150,000 francs for them.|$|R
25|$|Hareton Earnshaw: The son of Hindley and Frances, {{raised at}} first by Nelly but soon by Heathcliff. Nelly works to instill {{a sense of}} pride in the Earnshaw {{heritage}} (even though Hareton will not inherit Earnshaw property, because Hindley has mortgaged it to Heathcliff). Heathcliff, in contrast, teaches him vulgarities, as a way of avenging himself on Hindley. Hareton speaks with an accent similar to Joseph's, and occupies a position similar to a servant at Wuthering Heights, unaware <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been done out of his inheritance. In appearance he reminds Heathcliff of his aunt, Catherine.|$|E
500|$|... "A {{month before}} I start shooting, I sit with my director, try to {{understand}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> visualised the character {{on the screen and}} take notes. Then I start working on the most basic thing— the look. It's very important that the physical appearance of the character gets decided because if I look the character, it makes it all the more believable. Once that is achieved, I go into the finer nuances of what the girl is like, her background. And then from there [...] I have to get the accent right".|$|E
500|$|An {{issue here}} is the {{ambiguity}} of the word congressus ("met"). It often refers to meeting in a conventional combat but can have reference to other types of meetings too. A similar ambiguity appears in Seneca [...] and in [...] Ausonius' 19th epitaph, narrated by Troilus himself. The dead prince tells <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been dragged by his horses after falling in unequal battle with Achilles. A reference in the epitaph comparing Troilus' death to Hector's suggests that Troilus dies later than in the traditional narrative, something that, according to Boitani, also happens in Virgil.|$|E
60|$|Then came news <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{got into}} the Humber; how Earl Edwin and his Northumbrians had driven him out; and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> went off to Scotland to meet Harold of Norway; and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> put his hands between Harold's, and become his man.|$|R
60|$|George then {{explained}} exactly <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{stood with}} regard to money, saying <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> put himself {{into the hands of}} Mr. Neversaye Die, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> taken chambers in the Middle Temple, and how a volume of Blackstone was already lying open in his dingy sitting-room.|$|R
60|$|Desmond then related <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{caused the}} piles of barrels to be opened out, {{so that he could}} examine those next to the wall as well as those in front; and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{similarly}} examined the other stores.|$|R
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the song serve as a {{confession}} in which Harrison details <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> lost his way. Author Ian Inglis describes [...] "Simply Shady" [...] as an autobiographical account of a musician [...] "who succumbs to the temptations of 'sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll' that are stereotypically linked with the mythology of rock". Leng likens the track to contemporary work by Neil Young, particularly [...] "Yonder Stands the Sinner", adding that Harrison arrives at [...] "the same impasse" [...] as the Canadian singer: [...] "decadence, dependency, and despair".|$|E
500|$|A {{man named}} Dalton Russell sits in an {{unidentified}} cell and narrates {{a story of}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> committed the perfect robbery. In New York, masked robbers, dressed as painters and using variants of the name [...] "Steve" [...] as aliases, seize control of a Manhattan bank and take the patrons and employees hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms, forcing them to don painters clothes identical to their own. The robbers rotate the hostages among various rooms and occasionally insert themselves covertly into the groups. They also take turns working on an unspecified project involving demolishing the floor {{in one of the}} bank's storage rooms.|$|E
500|$|On September 27, American Pharoah {{was made}} the 1–2 {{favorite}} for the Grade I FrontRunner Stakes over {{eight and a}} half furlongs at Santa Anita Park. As in his previous race, he was immediately sent to the front by Espinoza and stayed there, pulling away from his rivals in the straight to win by three and a quarter lengths over Calculator, with Texas Red a length and a half away in third. After the race, Espinoza explained how the colt moved: [...] "All the way he was on a high cruising speed. He has such a long stride. He moves really nice and is light on his feet." [...] Baffert said, [...] "I can't believe his demeanor, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> changed since his first out. He's so professional. He's really mentally there." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>he</b> told Antony <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{found that}} wretched man {{lying in the}} street fifteen years before, having lost then nearly every member save his tongue, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> taken him home to his cell, nursed him, bathed him, physicked him, fed him; and how the man had {{returned}} him nothing save slanders, curses, and insults; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> insisted on having meat, and had had it; and on going out in public, and had company brought to him; and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> at last demanded to be put down again whence <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been taken, always cursing and slandering. And now Eulogius could bear the man no longer, and was minded to take him at his word.|$|R
60|$|He recounted, therefore, that Mr. Bentley <b>had</b> failed; and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{before that}} given {{much of his}} estate away in charity, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been unable to keep his pew in St. John's, and had retired {{to the house in}} Dalton Street.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{told her}} the whole story,--how Gilmore had seen the men, and had come up to him; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone out and had a tussle with one man, whom <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> as <b>he</b> thought, hurt; and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> then caught another, while the third escaped.|$|R
500|$|The Islamic {{concept of}} Taqwa {{is closely related}} to conscience. In the Qur’ān verses 2:197 & 22:37 Taqwa refers to [...] "right conduct" [...] or [...] "piety", [...] "guarding of oneself" [...] or [...] "guarding against evil". Qur’ān verse 47:17 says that God is the {{ultimate}} source of the believer's taqwā which is not simply the product of individual will but requires inspiration from God. In Qur’ān verses 91:7–8, God the Almighty talks about <b>how</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> perfected the soul, the conscience and has taught it the wrong (fujūr) and right (taqwā). Hence, the awareness of vice and virtue is inherent in the soul, allowing it to be tested fairly in the life of this world and tried, held accountable on the day of judgment for responsibilities to God and all humans.|$|E
500|$|... « Toccata »: In this introduction, we are {{introduced}} to the narrator, and discover <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> ended up in France after the war. He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. He closes the introduction by saying, [...] "I live, I do what can be done, it's the same for everyone, I am a man like other men, I am a man like you. I tell you I am just like you!" ...|$|E
500|$|Captured by a Kazon vessel soon thereafter, Chakotay learns from Kar that Kazon {{earn their}} titles through conquest or death, {{and he has}} robbed Kar of that {{opportunity}} by saving him. [...] The vessel's commander Razik (Patrick Kilpatrick) speaks with Chakotay, explaining his disservice to Kar and that the young Kazon is scheduled for execution. [...] When later presented with a weapon to kill Kar as a lesson to other Kazon youth, Chakotay instead holds Razik hostage {{in exchange for his}} shuttle. [...] Kar, seeing no future or opportunities with the Ogla, flees with Chakotay. [...] Unable to elude the Kazon, Chakotay beams himself and Kar to a nearby Class-M moon, a Kazon training ground. [...] Kar, having eschewed an opportunity to kill Chakotay in his sleep, later explains <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no options open to him and admits that Chakotay may be his only friend now.|$|E
60|$|Midway in {{his story}} of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> arrived {{in that part}} of the country, and at the point in his {{narrative}} where he described his own ambush and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fled to the bank, Smoke was interrupted by the indignant Shunk Wilson.|$|R
5|$|A {{narrative}} pattern follows, whereby Cet {{demands a}} challenge, an Ulster warrior rises, and the Ulaid cry out {{the name of}} the challenger; Cet then proceeds to shame that warrior by recounting one of his deeds against him, as above. Cet shames the challenger Óengus son of Lam Gabuid, by recounting <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cut off Lam Gabuid's hands in battle; he shames Éogan son of Durthacht, the king of Fermag, by recounting <b>how</b> <b>he</b> put out his eye in a cattle-raid; he reminds Muinremur son of Gerrgend <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> taken his son's head as a trophy not six days earlier; Mend son of Salchad, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cut off his father's foot; Celtchair son of Uthecar, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> castrated him with his spear; and even Conchobar's son Cúscraid Mend Machae, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> pierced his neck with a spear during Cúscraid's first feat of arms, in ignominious circumstances which led to the abandonment a third of Cúscraid's retinue in a cowardly retreat. In each case, the challenging warriors are compelled to retake their seats in shame.|$|R
60|$|Slone became {{convinced}} that, whether young Creech was half crazy or not, {{he knew his}} father's horses were doomed, and that the boat at the ferry had been cut adrift. Slone could not understand why he was convinced, but he was. Finally Creech told <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone {{down to the river}} only a day before; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> found the flood still raging, but much lower; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> worked round the cliffs and had pulled up the rope cables to find they had been cut.|$|R
500|$|After a Neomorph {{attacks and}} decapitates Covenant {{security}} officer Rosenthal, David approaches it and pacifies it {{by attempting to}} communicate. The ship's captain, Christopher Oram, kills the Neomorph, upsetting David. Held at gunpoint by Oram, David shows him <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been utilizing the mutagen to try and engineer the [...] "perfect organism", with the Neomorphs {{being one of the}} outcomes. David leads Oram to a room filled with Alien eggs, where Oram is attacked and impregnated by a Facehugger by forcing its ovipositor down his throat. David watches as Oram awakens a short time later and dies as the first Alien Xenomorph bursts out of his chest. Having discovered the dissected and mutilated corpse of Shaw, Walter confronts David, stating that he knows that David killed her, along with the Engineers. Walter rejects David's offer to join him, prompting David to impale him through the neck with his flute, apparently terminating him.|$|E
500|$|Laming's {{appointment}} was controversial {{as he had}} been director of Hertfordshire county council's social services department in 1990, a department which was strongly criticised for its handling of a child abuse case, and which had the Local Government Ombudsman making a finding of 'maladministration with injustice' against them in 1995. The father of the child in the case said of Laming's appointment, [...] "I don't see <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the qualifications or experience to be able to lead an investigation into another borough which has been failing to protect a child in exactly the same manner that his own authority failed to protect a child in 1990". Liberal Democrat spokesman Paul Burstow said, [...] "the findings of the ombudsman in the Hertfordshire case must give rise to questions about Lord Laming's appointment to head this inquiry"; and Conservative Party spokesman Liam Fox said, [...] "I think the government maybe should have thought twice about this and maybe, even yet, they will think again". The Department for Health, however, said that they were [...] "fully confident that he is the right person to conduct the inquiry".|$|E

60|$|All January {{had passed}} by. That thirtieth of January {{had come and}} gone which was to have made Linda Tressel a bride, and Linda was still Linda Tressel. But her {{troubles}} were not therefore over, and Peter Steinmarc was once again her suitor. It may be remembered <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> reviled her in her aunt's presence, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> reminded her of her indiscretion, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> then rejected her; but, nevertheless, {{in the first week of}} February he was again her suitor.|$|R
60|$|The old chief related that {{fifteen years}} after that battle {{he went to the}} Kanawha {{settlement}} to see the Big Chief, Gen. George Washington, who was travelling on the Kanawha. He told Gen. Washington <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fought in the battle of Braddock's Fields; <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> shot and killed Gen.

60|$|It is {{said that}} joy never kills. Certainly it {{failed to do so}} on this occasion. Dobri soon {{recovered}} consciousness, and then, little by little, with many a pause for breath, and in tones that were woefully unlike to those of the bold, lion-like scout of former days, <b>he</b> told <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fainted and fallen on the breast of his master, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lain all night on the battle-field among the dead and dying, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been stripped and left for dead by the ruffian followers of the camp, and <b>how</b> at last <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been found and rescued by one of the ambulance-wagons of the Red Cross.|$|R
