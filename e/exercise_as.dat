He was keen to <b>exercise</b> <b>as</b> soon as he could during his rehabilitation. He tried several sports, including wheelchair tennis, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball, following his accident in an attempt to find one that made him feel able-bodied. He drove dune buggies and tried kayaking, and in 2007 was learning how to para-glide.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{versatile}} hunting dog, used {{for its ability}} to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any one type of terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy {{is considered to be a}} quiet breed, but requires a great deal of <b>exercise</b> <b>as</b> it has a high level of stamina. It loves to play, and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship. It is especially good with children.|$|E
5|$|Four Eurofighter Typhoon {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} the station from RAF Coningsby on 2 May 2012 {{to take part in}} a security <b>exercise</b> <b>as</b> part of preparations for the 2012 Summer Olympics. During the Games, the aircraft were deployed to the station to provide air superiority protection for London, in conjunction with other security measures by the British Armed Forces. Westland Sea King helicopters of the Royal Navy were also deployed to the station. The presence of the aircraft during the Olympics became the first time fighter aircraft had been stationed at RAF Northolt since the Second World War. The Typhoons and Sea Kings left Northolt on 16 August following the conclusion of the Olympics.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} the Hazard Team {{conducting}} a holodeck training exercise {{set on a}} Borg ship; however, the team fails the <b>exercise</b> <b>as</b> most get captured by the Borg, and Munro accidentally destroys the ship while trying to rescue them. Following the termination of the exercise, Voyager is attacked by an unidentified ship. Voyager manages to destroy the ship, but takes heavy damage in the battle. The hostile ship explodes, emitting a shockwave that teleports the now–crippled Voyager to an unknown location, surrounded by derelict ships. As the Voyager crew attempts repairs, the ship is boarded by scavengers, who steal some of Voyagers cargo supplies before being driven off. In an effort to establish where Voyager is, the Hazard Team is sent to a derelict ship where power is still functioning to download the derelict's database. The mission goes awry when aliens begin transporting in and attacking the team; however, the aliens, identifying themselves as Etherians, eventually manage {{to communicate with the}} team, and the ordeal is waved off as a misunderstanding, allowing the Hazard Team to access the Etherian database.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, adult Greyhounds {{do not need}} {{extended}} periods of daily <b>exercise,</b> <b>as</b> they are bred for sprinting rather than endurance. Greyhound puppies {{that have not been}} taught how to utilize their energy, however, can be hyperactive and destructive if not given an outlet, and therefore require more experienced handlers.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone {{increases}} {{body weight}} (and increases appetite). The form that this weight gain will take depends on diet and <b>exercise</b> <b>as</b> well as genetic factors. Since testosterone has anabolic effects, gain of lean muscle mass {{will be easier}} than it previously was for transgender men. Moderate amounts of exercise will cause greater gains and will ameliorate some of the adverse effects of testosterone.|$|E

25|$|During Aspin's {{term the}} U.S. was {{concerned}} that Communist North Korea might have underway a nuclear weapons development program. This gave way to alarm when that country refused to allow full inspection of nuclear sites. In November 1993 North Korea demanded that the United States and South Korea cancel a planned joint training <b>exercise</b> <b>as</b> a precondition during discussions on the nuclear issue. Aspin rejected this demand and announced that the United States would suspend plans to withdraw its troops gradually from the peninsula.|$|E
25|$|Like people, fancy mice {{can become}} obese if they overeat {{and do not}} get enough {{physical}} activity. This can lead to them developing life-threatening cardiovascular disorders and diabetes as well as arthritis. Activity aids such as tubes and wheels are great for ensuring mice get enough <b>exercise,</b> <b>as</b> well as mental stimulation. Mice also love to climb, and a wire cage with horizontal bars is perfect for this. A mouse set loose for exercise should be carefully observed, as they tend to scurry into a hiding spot and {{can be difficult to}} retrieve.|$|E

25|$|Returning to Fort George {{proved to}} be an even more perilous <b>exercise,</b> <b>as</b> the hostility Fraser and his crew {{encountered}} from the aboriginal communities near the mouth of the river spread upstream. The ongoing hostility and threats to the lives of the Europeans resulted in a near mutiny by Fraser's crew, who wanted to escape overland. Quelling the revolt, Fraser and his men continued north upstream from present-day Yale, arriving in Fort George on August 6, 1808. The journey upstream took thirty-seven days. In total it took Fraser and his crew two-and-a-half months to travel from Fort George to Musqueam and back.|$|E
25|$|The year 1962 {{saw more}} {{rigorous}} mine warfare training for Hummingbird, with amphibious operations at Onslow {{and in the}} Caribbean. The versatile ship also {{took part in a}} search for a downed Air Force plane off Delaware 1 June, before departing for Panama City, Florida, to take part in mine experiments. September included a third NATO minesweeping <b>exercise.</b> <b>As</b> American naval power quarantined Cuba in October, Hummingbird stood ready in case larger operations were necessary, and in early 1963, took part in patrols off Cuba. From 1963 to 1967, the veteran minesweeper continued her training and readiness operations, a vital part of America's fighting power on the seas.|$|E
25|$|However, Operation Tracer in Gibraltar {{was never}} activated. In May 1943 Allied armies {{completed}} {{the capture of}} North Africa, and on 17 August they drove the last Axis forces out of Sicily, rendering the threat to Gibraltar negligible. On 24 August 1943, the Director of Naval Intelligence sent a highly classified, one-time pad message in which he ordered one last wireless communications <b>exercise,</b> <b>as</b> well as blocking up of the chambers and distribution of the provisions that had been stored there. The manual for Operation Tracer is at the Naval Intelligence Division, #1001107/42. It elaborates on the selection of personnel, as well as heating, lighting, and sanitation. In addition, it has a dozen appendices on food, clothing, utensils, tools, equipment, furniture, cooking, stationery, games, library, sundries, medical stores, and surgical instruments. The manual also discusses the challenges encountered in constructing the covert facility.|$|E

With a {{score of}} 93.631 points, Uchimura won {{by a margin of}} 3.101 points, roughly the same margin that separated 2nd and 14th place. Not only is he the first male gymnast to win three all-around titles, but he is also the first gymnast, male or female, to win three consecutive all-around titles. During the all around final, Uchimura recorded the highest score on four of the six events: floor exercise, still rings, parallel bars, and pommel horse (he tied for the highest score on pommel horse). Uchimura also qualified for five of the six individual apparatus finals (all except vault). He won his first world championship event gold medal on floor <b>exercise</b> <b>as</b> well as a bronze medal on high bar and the silver medal with the Japanese team.|$|E
25|$|Recruits are to {{be taught}} the art of {{throwing}} stones both with the hand and sling. The inhabitants of the Balearic Islands {{are said to have}} been the inventors of slings, and to have managed them with surprising dexterity, owing to the manner of bringing up their children. The children were not allowed to have their food by their mothers till they had first struck it with their sling. Soldiers, notwithstanding their defensive armour, are often more annoyed by the round stones from the sling than by all the arrows of the enemy. Stones kill without mangling the body, and the contusion is mortal without loss of blood. It is universally known the ancients employed slingers in all their engagements. There is the greater reason for instructing all troops, without exception, in this <b>exercise,</b> <b>as</b> the sling cannot be reckoned any encumbrance, and often is of the greatest service, especially when they are obliged to engage in stony places, to defend a mountain or an eminence, or to repulse an enemy at the attack of a castle or city.|$|E
25|$|Patronage of {{the churches}} on most of these estates, {{potentially}} a lucrative right, went to Darras. The rectory of Sidbury was in his gift and he {{is known to have}} made presentations to it. On 16 June 1386 Darras authorised an exchange of clergy, by which the local priest went to St Katherine's chapel in Hereford Cathedral and the former cathedral chaplain, Philip Kentles, became rector of Sidbury. St Katherine's chapel served the Bishop's Palace, so this exchange must have been of importance to John Gilbert, presumably earning Darras a modicum of episcopal favour. In April 1392 Darras appointed a successor after Philip's death. At Neenton too Darras held and used the advowson, presenting Roger Murimore as incumbent of the church in November 1399. Linley's church was a chapel of Holy Trinity Church in Much Wenlock, which was in the hands of Wenlock Priory, the feudal overlord, leaving Darras with no control. However, while he had effective control of Ribbesford, the advowson must have been his to <b>exercise,</b> <b>as</b> it went with the manor. In the case of Rock, however, the principal manor in the parish was not Rock itself but Alton, and the advowson of the church went with it: although there had been challenges from the Ribbesford family, the advowson was held by the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in Normandy during the 14th century.|$|E

5000|$|Hao Huang {{believes}} that [...] "Hanon, Schmitt or Czerny have been useful for beginning pianists, affording variety {{as an alternative}} to endless practicing of scales and arpeggios" [...] but warns against [...] "the idea of technical <b>exercises</b> <b>as</b> panacea":There is nothing more dulling than hours spent mindlessly going over finger patterns. This does not prepare you to be either a pianist or a musician. Too often, teachers assign technical <b>exercises</b> <b>as</b> a shortcut to technical mastery. It is easier to assign pages from an exercise book than to analyze and break down the physical elements in a specific difficult passage of music... Dorothy Taubman is one of the well known pedagogues who campaigns against technical exercises, asserting that they do far more damage than good. Certainly, indiscriminate practicing of exercises can damage a pianist just as forcing repetition of a difficult piece. In my mind, the question should not be whether or not to use technical <b>exercises,</b> <b>as</b> much as how to think physically at the piano.|$|R
