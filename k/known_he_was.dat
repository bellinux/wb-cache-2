5|$|Neither {{the year}} nor {{the date of}} Stigand's birth is <b>known.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> born in East Anglia, {{possibly}} in Norwich, to an apparently prosperous family of mixed English and Scandinavian ancestry, as is shown {{by the fact that}} Stigand's name was Norse but his brother's was English. His brother Æthelmær, also a cleric, later succeeded Stigand as bishop of Elmham. His sister held land in Norwich, but her given name is unrecorded.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{came back}} to West Point in July 1937 as an {{instructor}} in the Department of Natural and Experimental Philosophy, as the Science Department was then <b>known.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> promoted to captain on 9 July 1938. From May to August 1939, he attended the Air Corps Tactical School, after which he returned to West Point as an assistant professor. While there he built a wind tunnel, and wrote a book, entitled Preliminary Airplane Design, {{which was published in}} 1941.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{took off}} this night from RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire to patrol north of London. When the {{direction}} of the raid was <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ordered to proceed to the East Midlands. GCI vectored Cunningham and his temporary radar operator John Phillipson—a former ground radar operator—onto an enemy aircraft, but the crew were forced much further westward. Search lights attracted their attention and Phillipson was able to make a contact and guide him. Soon visual confirmation was made. A tell-tale sign of an aircraft was a blank patch of sky surrounded by a cluster of stars. Keeping in the enemy's blind spot, he flew below it and adjusted his speed to match the German pilot. After closing the range as much as he dared, he fired with all four cannons and the Junkers Ju 88 exploded upon hitting the ground near Wittering, Cambridgeshire at 00:35. Cunningham's victim, 3./KG 54 Ju 88 flown by Unteroffizier Kaspar Sondermeister, was not claimed as destroyed. However, after interrogation of the two German survivors who affirmed the circumstances, Cunningham was granted the victory.|$|E

25|$|Compared to the {{previous}} year, the 2007 season saw no changes in the coaching staff. However, like the season before, Bob Stoops's name was mentioned as a possibility for some coaching vacancies, but he made it <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> committed to Oklahoma.|$|E
25|$|Sir Donald Bradman (hereinafter to {{be named}} Bradman or The Don), must be called the most masterful and {{prolific}} maker of runs the game has so far <b>known.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was,</b> in short, a great batsman.

25|$|It was at {{this time}} Bellamy {{received}} his nickname. The other men in his billet were introducing themselves and he became embarrassed, thinking that he might suffer some ragging if it was <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> called Lionel so he gave his name as Bill {{and for the rest}} of his life he was (quite happily) known as Bill Bellamy.|$|E

25|$|His funds {{exhausted}} {{and unable to}} pay just a single debt, James Greenleaf was sentenced to serve time in the Philadelphia Debtors' Prison. Although the exact date that he entered debtor's prison in 1797 is not <b>known,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> definitely incarcerated by October 18, 1797. His debt was eventually discharged, and he was released on August 30, 1798 (having served less than a year).|$|E

25|$|In 1992, during Romário's {{successful}} {{season at}} PSV Eindhoven, {{he was called}} up to the national team for a friendly match against Germany on 16 December 1992 in Porto Alegre– Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira left Romário as a reserve, after which he expressed his dissatisfaction, saying {{he would not have}} come over from Netherlands if he had <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not going to play. These declarations caused Parreira to ban Romário from the Brazilian team.|$|E

25|$|Dina Matos and McGreevey {{separated}} {{after he}} {{revealed that he}} was homosexual, and in late 2005 McGreevey and Australian-American executive Mark O'Donnell began a relationship. The two lived in Plainfield, New Jersey. On March 14, 2007, the Associated Press reported that McGreevey was seeking custody of Jacqueline and filing for child support. Matos demanded $600,000 plus alimony. The divorce trial started on May 6, 2008. On August 8, the divorce was granted. McGreevey received joint custody and pays child support.

25|$|Aspin {{served as}} an adviser to Clinton on defense matters during the 1992 presidential campaign. Given Clinton's lack of {{military}} experience, appointment of a prominent and respected defense expert to head The Pentagon seemed desirable. Because of his leadership position in the House, Aspin's views on defense issues were well <b>known.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> skeptical about the Strategic Defense Initiative, and favored a smaller Navy, a cut in U.S. troops in Europe, and further reduction of military personnel strength. These positions, along with the assumption that Aspin would work toward a substantial cut in the Defense budget, worried the military. Defense industry leaders applauded Aspin's selection because he favored maintaining a viable defense industrial base. Although questioned extensively, Aspin won easy confirmation in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1922, Van Cise made it well <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going on a long fishing {{vacation}} to the Rocky Mountains, signaling to the gang members that the heat was off their operation. While the con men plied their trade openly {{on the streets of}} Denver, Van Cise and his assistants plotted a huge roundup that required a willing victim to help catch the gang in the act. With incredible good fortune, J. Frank Norfleet showed up in Denver at precisely this moment. Norfleet was a Texas rancher who had previously been scammed twice by other gangs and was on a nationwide manhunt to bring the men who swindled him to justice. Entering the lobby of the Brown Palace Hotel, Norfleet was hooked by unwitting gang members who saw him as an easy mark, and the plan was set in motion.|$|E
25|$|Jones' batting {{style is}} not known, {{however it is}} <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a right-arm fast bowler who played for several top cricket clubs in the Liverpool area in the 1870s and 1880s, {{including}} Sefton Park, Sefton, and Huyton. He was selected to play what would be his only first-class cricket match in 1889 when picked for the Liverpool and District cricket team against Yorkshire at Aigburth. In a match which Yorkshire won by an innings and 41 runs, Jones scored 13 runs in Liverpool and District first-innings, before being dismissed stumped by David Hunter off the bowling of Bobby Peel. In Yorkshire's first-innings he took 4 wickets from his 40 overs, conceding 71 runs. His wickets included the England Test cricketer Lord Hawke. In the Liverpool and District second-innings he was last man out, dismissed stumped by Hunter off the bowling of Saul Wade for 3.|$|E

25|$|On August 9, 2015, {{the anniversary}} of Brown's shooting, Tyrone Harris Jr., age 18, was shot by four plain-clothed police {{officers}} during a gunfight between looters (see above). He was hospitalized in critical condition. Police charged him with four counts of first-degree assault on law enforcement, five counts of armed criminal action, and one count of discharging a firearm at a motor vehicle. Harris was held on a $250,000 cash-only bond. According to Harris' father, {{he graduated from the}} same high school as Brown and was a close friend of his. Two days after the shooting, police released surveillance video of Harris firing a gun at an unmarked police car. Harris was out on bond for felony charges related to the theft of a vehicle and a gun {{at the time of the}} incident. Despite video evidence, Harris' father denied that his son had a gun. Others in Ferguson said that Harris might not have <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> firing at an unmarked police car.|$|E
500|$|His {{performance}} {{earned him}} another Best Actor Academy Award nomination, 17 {{years after his}} first. Reviews were strong, and the film {{is considered one of}} the best of his later career. In Day, he found a co-star with whom he could build a rapport, such as he had had with Blondell at the start of his career. Day herself was full of praise for Cagney, stating that he was [...] "the most professional actor I've ever <b>known.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> always 'real'. I simply forgot we were making a picture. His eyes would actually fill up when we were working on a tender scene. And you never needed drops to make your eyes shine when Jimmy was on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|At Kawakita's trial, {{presided over}} by U.S. District Judge William C. Mathes, the defense conceded that Kawakita had acted abusively toward American POWs, but argued that his actions were {{relatively}} minor, and that in any event, they could not constitute treason against the United States because Kawakita was not a U.S. citizen at the time, having lost his U.S. citizenship when he confirmed his Japanese nationality in 1943. [...] The prosecution argued that Kawakita had <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still a U.S. citizen and still owed allegiance to the country of his birth—citing the statements he had made to consular officials when applying for a new passport as evidence {{that he had never}} intended to give up his U.S. citizenship.|$|E
