5|$|Brannan used <b>his</b> <b>press</b> to {{establish}} the California Star as the first newspaper in San Francisco, which released its first formal issue on January 9, 1847. It was the second paper in California, following The Californian founded in Monterey and first published on August 15, 1846. The two joined to become The Daily Alta California in 1848 after Brannan sold the paper to a colleague.|$|E
5|$|Batista {{had come}} under {{increasing}} pressure by 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with <b>his</b> <b>press</b> censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity to call a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Gable {{was flown}} to Las Vegas after {{learning}} of the tragedy to claim the bodies of his wife, mother-in-law, and Winkler, who aside from being <b>his</b> <b>press</b> agent, had been a close friend. Lombard's funeral was held on January 21 at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. She was interred beside her mother {{under the name of}} Carole Lombard Gable. Despite remarrying twice following her death, Gable chose to be interred beside Lombard when he died in 1960.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of [...] Kerensky's troops raided Stalin's press {{headquarters}} and smashed <b>his</b> printing <b>presses.</b> While he worked to restore <b>his</b> <b>presses,</b> Stalin missed a Central Committee meeting where assignments for the coup were being issued. Stalin instead spent the afternoon briefing Bolshevik delegates and passing communications to and from Lenin, who was in hiding.|$|R

5|$|The British press {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} Arsenal were fortunate to win; Wenger himself admitted so in <b>his</b> <b>press</b> conference afterwards. A television audience of over 480million worldwide watched the final; in the United Kingdom, {{coverage of the}} match peaked at 12.8million, making it the highest-rated game in Cup history since the 1996 final. The departures of captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane before the year end, coupled with the changing objectives of both clubs, meant the 2005 final is considered as the natural end point in the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United under Ferguson and Wenger.|$|E
5|$|The generals sent Thảo to Fort Leavenworth in the United States for {{six months}} to learn {{conventional}} warfare tactics. He also spent a month in England before returning to Vietnam. By this time, Minh's junta had been replaced in a 1964 January coup by Khánh. It is suspected {{that one of the}} generals' motives for deploying Thảo overseas was his continual involvement in plotting. Khánh appointed Thảo as <b>his</b> <b>press</b> officer as well as an unofficial political adviser.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that same}} year, Khánh became {{involved}} in a power struggle with his deputy Khiêm as well as Minh, who had been retained as the titular head of state. Thảo {{was a close friend}} of Khiêm, so when Khánh prevailed in the power struggle, Khánh despatched Khiêm to Washington as the ambassador with Thảo was <b>his</b> <b>press</b> attaché. In August 1964, Khánh's leadership became increasingly troubled after he tried to augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency. This only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling for an end to military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future, which encouraged more groups to demand changes, and Khánh demoted certain Catholic pro-Diệm supporters. On 13 September, a Catholic-dominated group led by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức, both of whom had been demoted, moved troops into Saigon but then withdrew after it became obvious they did not have the numbers to remove Khánh. Khiêm and Thảo were implicated in helping to plot Phát and Đức's attempted putsch; both were sent abroad by Khánh.|$|E

50|$|Elijah P. Lovejoy was an {{abolitionist}} in the 1830s, {{running a}} newspaper called the St Louis Observer, in Missouri, a slave state. Slavery advocates attacked and destroyed <b>his</b> <b>presses</b> {{a number of}} times, driving him to move across the river to Alton, IL in 1837, where he renamed it the Alton Observer. Although Illinois was a free state, in November 1837, <b>his</b> <b>presses</b> were attacked for {{what would have been}} the fourth time. He and some supporters were in the warehouse where they were stored, and as the building was stormed, the attackers apparently began firing guns. Lovejoy and his men returned fire, but in the conflict Lovejoy was killed.|$|R
50|$|He {{published}} {{his own and}} others' works, printed on <b>his</b> hand <b>press,</b> or in mimeographed editions through <b>his</b> Renegade <b>Press</b> and Seven Flowers <b>Press.</b> <b>His</b> intense awareness of the gritty and burgeoning art scene of Cleveland, which included drugs and sex, and his need to express this scene which he felt a way of attaining enlightenment, meant {{that he was not}} welcome in the political environment.|$|R
5|$|Willkie's {{condition}} only worsened as {{the weeks}} went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, but on the trip he was stricken with another heart attack. Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed on. When he arrived in New York, Willkie was in great pain and <b>his</b> <b>press</b> secretary called an ambulance {{to take him to}} Lenox Hill Hospital. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, An American Program, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014, a {{reporter}} who covered the Zhang visit sued police over an alleged infringement of press freedom. He claimed to be there covering the protest and did not take part, but was still barred from recording the scene after showing <b>his</b> <b>press</b> credentials.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 2013, Hassan Rouhani won {{the presidential}} {{election}} in Iran, with a total number of 36,704,156 ballots cast; Rouhani won 18,613,329 votes. In <b>his</b> <b>press</b> conference one day after election day, Rouhani reiterated his promise to recalibrate Iran's relations with the world.|$|E
50|$|Pierre Ballancourt, a linotypist who {{published}} newspapers and tracts for the FI, put Aubrion {{in contact with}} his former employer, Ferdinand Wellens, a printer who would put <b>his</b> <b>presses</b> at the FI's disposal. As luck had it, Wellens was also a resistance sympathiser who already published for the FI. Wellens provided the use {{not only of the}} necessary paper, his workshops and linotypists, but also <b>his</b> <b>presses,</b> all for the price of one Franc per copy. At this point the 5,000 copies were no longer a dream; it was decided to print 50,000, of which 5,000 would be distributed using standard routes. The others would be sold underground for 10 Francs each with proceeds going towards financing the FI.|$|R
50|$|McCune used <b>his</b> <b>presses</b> {{to print}} various hand-made {{publications}} and broadsheets. Although he enjoyed printing, {{he wrote in}} one letter that when he printed 100 copies of a single broadsheet (as he did for the Roxburghe Club), he found it exceedingly tedious.|$|R

25|$|Dwyer's deep {{mistrust of}} {{outgoing}} Republican Governor Thornburgh was {{spelled out in}} detail in <b>his</b> <b>press</b> conference statement. The timing of Dwyer's press conference and suicide meant that Thornburgh was not empowered to appoint a Treasurer to replace him. Instead, this fell to Thornburgh's successor, Democrat Bob Casey, who had taken office on January 20, 1987.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 1837, in Boston's Faneuil Hall, Phillips' {{leadership}} and oratory established his preeminence within the abolitionist movement. Bostonians gathered at Faneuil Hall to discuss Elijah P. Lovejoy's murder by a mob outside his abolitionist printing press in Alton, Illinois on November 7. Lovejoy died defending himself and <b>his</b> <b>press</b> from pro-slavery rioters who {{set fire to}} a warehouse storing <b>his</b> <b>press</b> and shot Lovejoy as he stepped outside to tip a ladder {{being used by the}} mob. His death engendered a national controversy between abolitionists and anti-abolitionists. At Faneuil Hall, Massachusetts attorney general James T. Austin defended the anti-abolitionist mob, comparing their actions to 1776 patriots who fought against the British. Deeply disgusted, Phillips spontaneously rebutted, praising Lovejoy’s actions as a defense of liberty. Inspired by Phillips’ eloquence and conviction, Garrison entered a partnership with him that came to define the beginning of the 1840s abolitionist movement.|$|E
25|$|At <b>his</b> <b>press</b> conference Sharpton {{said that}} any violent act toward {{a woman is}} inexcusable but {{he felt that the}} accused youths were being treated unfairly because they were black. Sharpton contrasted the {{treatment}} of the suspects, who remain in jail, with white suspects involved in a gang rape—which he claimed was equivalent to the Dunbar Village attack—who were released after posting bond.|$|E

50|$|Hoe and Lloyd {{formed a}} {{collaboration}} that lasted a lifetime (Hoe died {{four years before}} Lloyd). Hoe constantly made improvements, e.g. by amending <b>his</b> original rotary <b>press</b> specification 175 times before it was superseded. Lloyd’s exact requirements were invaluable in guiding Hoe’s work, and Lloyd tested new features. He upgraded <b>his</b> <b>presses</b> as Hoe developed anything useful. His last purchase in 1887 was of eight presses each capable of printing 24,000 newspapers an hour.|$|R

25|$|On {{the same}} day, Dwyer asked <b>his</b> <b>press</b> {{secretary}} Horshock and deputy press secretary Gregory Penny {{to set up}} a news conference for the next day without telling them what he was to discuss. Horshock arranged the press conference for 10:30a.m. EST the next day, January 22. The press secretary called dozens of reporters asking them to attend, and told them he did not know its subject.|$|E
25|$|In 1814 Murray {{patented}} {{a hydraulic}} press for baling cloth, {{in which the}} upper and lower tables approached each other simultaneously. He improved upon the hydraulic presses invented by Joseph Bramah, and in 1825 designed a huge press for testing chain cables. <b>His</b> <b>press,</b> built for the Navy Board, was 34ft long and could exert a force of 1,000 tons. The press was completed just before Murray's death.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1996, Hanover {{appeared}} at few public events. There {{were reports that}} Hanover was aware of her husband's personal conduct as early as 1995. On Father's Day Giuliani had told reporters that he was returning to Gracie Mansion to play ball with Andrew, but instead went to City Hall, to a basement suite with <b>his</b> <b>press</b> secretary. Three hours later Hanover went to City Hall to confront Giuliani, but a mayor's aide prevented her from entering the suite.|$|E
25|$|A {{goldsmith}} (like Gutenberg) {{designed and}} implemented an Arabic-script movable-type printing-press in the Middle East. The Greek Orthodox monk Abd Allah Zakhir {{set up an}} Arabic language printing press using movable type at the monastery of Saint John at the town of Dhour El Shuwayr in Mount Lebanon, the first homemade press in Lebanon using Arabic script. He personally cut the type molds and did {{the founding of the}} typeface. The first book came off <b>his</b> <b>press</b> in 1734; this press continued in use until 1899.|$|E
