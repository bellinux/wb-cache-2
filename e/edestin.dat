The results of such measurements with <b>edestin</b> (1) and gelatin (2) were interpreted as indicating that the protein exhibited a definite maximal combining capacity for each of the ions of the acid, combining with considerably more hydrogen ion than chloride ion. In arriving at this conclusion it was assumed that the mean activity coefficient of the hydrogen and chloride ions was not affected by the presence of the protein, except for the small decrease in ionic strength due to the combination of part of the protein with both ions. Similar measurements with casein have not hitherto been submitted for publication because no way could be found to interpret them {{on the basis of these}} assumptions. It is now possible to interpret these data, as well as the experiments with <b>edestin</b> and gelatin, by assuming that none of the proteins combines at all with chloride ion, that each protein has a definite maximal combining capacity for hydrogen ion, and that the mean activity coefficient of the ions of hydrochloric acid is decreased by the presence of the protein in such a way that its logarithm is a linear function of the protein concentration.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for isolating a crystalline protein of high tryptic activity from beef pancreas. The protein has constant proteolytic activity and optical activity {{under various conditions}} and no indication of further fractionation could be obtained. The loss in activity corresponds to the decrease in native protein when the protein is denatured by heat, digested by pepsin, or hydrolyzed in dilute alkali. The enzyme digests casein, gelatin, <b>edestin,</b> and denatured hemoglobin, but not native hemoglobin. It accelerates the coagulation of blood but has {{little effect on the}} clotting of milk. It digests peptone prepared by the action of pepsin on casein, <b>edestin</b> or gelatin. The extent of the digestion of gelatin caused by this enzyme is the same as that caused by crystalline pepsin and is approximately equivalent to tripling the number of carboxyl groups present in the solution.

40|$|Extracts of autolyzed {{pancreas}} contain carboxypeptidase {{which even}} {{in the presence of}} formaldehyde can digest chloracetyl-tyrosine and peptic digest of <b>edestin.</b> Part I ~ described the isolation of this carboxypeptidase in crystalline form. If fresh pancreas is extracted with cold salt solution, the extract does not attack a formalized peptic digest of <b>edestin.</b> On standing at 37 °C., however, the extract slowly becomes active. The activation is enormously hastened by the addition of trypsin. Thus, fresh pancreas contains not active carboxypeptidase (CP) but an inactive precursor, pro-carboxypeptidase (PCP). The nature of this precursor is not known. It may be a protein which is different from carboxypeptidase. It may be carboxypeptidase combined with an inhibitor. Pro-carboxypeptidase can be partially purified by fractionation with ammonium sulfate. Most of the pro-carboxypeptidase in the extract is precipitated by 0. 35 saturated ammonium sulfate but not by 0. 2 saturated ammonium sulfate. The protein can be freed of ammonium sulfate by predpitation by ferric chloride or by dialysis under carefully controlled conditions. The pro-carboxypeptidase in the partially purified preparation, like the pro-carbpxypeptidase in the crude pancreatic extract, is activated by trypsin. Partially purified pro-carboxypeptidase contains trypsinogen, which trypsin can convert into trypsin. The activation of impure pro-carboxypeptidase by trypsin, therefore, is partially due to the added trypsin and partially due to trypsin formed from the trypsinogen present. Until pro-carboxypeptidase is prepared free from trypsinogen, experiments on the kinetics of activation of pro-carboxypeptidase by trypsin are of dubious significance...|$|E
40|$|From {{the results}} of these tests it is clear that both Halicystis and Valonia have a high degree of {{tolerance}} for animal peptone, and a very high degree of tolerance for animal proteose and for egg albumen. The products of bacterial growths fostered by these proteins have a deleterious effect upon both species of algae; but, if it were possible to prevent bacterial growth entirely {{and at the same time}} supply proper food, it is probable that Halicystis and Valonia would show normal growth indefinitely in the presence of these three colloids. This is not true where exposure is made to yeast nucleic acid dissolved in sea water containing 0. 00093 gm. per cc. of NaOH. Valonia is markedly less tolerant of this medium (perhaps of NaOH rather than the colloid used) than Halicystis. Such differential effects, however, reach a high point in the case of the solutions of diphtheria toxin and of <b>edestin.</b> Halicystis has a very high tolerance for diphtheria toxin, and Valonia a very low tolerance. In the case of <b>edestin,</b> the relationship is reversed. Here Halicystis has a very low tolerance, and Valonia a very high tolerance. In fact, it may be said that diphtheria toxin has no appreciable effect upon Halicystis, and <b>edestin</b> a very slight effect upon Valonia; while diphtheria toxin is extremely toxic to Valonia, and <b>edestin</b> is extremely toxic to Halicystis. We can offer no suggestions, at present, as to the way in which these effects are produced. It is probable that the very thin protoplasmic layer of these species, which is certainly no thicker than 8 µ, is sufficient to obstruct the passage of proteins having large molecules, like egg albumen, with a degree of efficiency that is extraordinary. In the tests we have reported, areas of from 20 sq. cm. to 40 sq. cm. have been submitted to the action of a relatively high concentration of egg albumen for several days without permitting the passage of sufficient amounts to give definable tests either with Spiegler's or with Tanret's method,— presumably less than 1 part in 250, 000. In the tests of the proteins having much smaller molecules (though the size may not be the explanation), there is some probability that the membranes exhibit a little permeability. The peptone and the proteose of animal origin, or biuret-positive substances derived from them, apparently pass the protoplasmic membranes occasionally in quantities sufficient to give biuret tests. The most probable case of protein passage, however, was that of the proteose of the scarlet runner bean, where specific detection of less than 1 part per 80, 000 was possible. In this instance the proteose appeared to pass membranes that were healthy and were functioning normally. But since the cells of the algae had to be destroyed in making the tests, one cannot maintain this point. All one can say is that protein passage was indicated in carefully examined cells of both species, where no breaks in the protoplasmic membrane were discernible, and where samples of the treated cells behaved normally after treatment...|$|E

40|$|Barley endoproteolytic enzymes are {{important}} to germination because they hydrolyze endosperm storage proteins to provide precursors for new protein synthesis. We recently developed an electrophoretic method utilizing gel-incorporated protein substrates to study the endoproteinases of 4 -d-germinated barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Morex) grain. This work extends those findings to determine the temporal pattern of {{the appearance of the}} endoproteinases during germination, the sensitivities of the proteinases to class-specific proteinase inhibitors, and where, in germinating caryopses, the proteinases reside. Six endoproteinase activity bands (representing a minimum of seven enzymes) were present in 5 -d-germinated barley grain extracts subjected to electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels at pH 8. 8. The activities of two of the enzyme bands (“neutral” proteinases) increased as the pH was increased from 3. 8 to 6. 5. The activities of the remaining four (“acidic”) bands diminished abruptly as the pH increased above 4. 7. Two proteinase bands hydrolyzed gelatin but not <b>edestin,</b> four of the proteinases hydrolyzed both gelatin and <b>edestin</b> at nearly the same rates, and one enzyme degraded only <b>edestin.</b> One neutral endoproteinase was sensitive to diisopropyl fluorophosphate inhibition, and the other was not inhibited by any of inhibitors tested. Four of acidic enzymes were cysteine proteinases [inhibited by trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4 -guanidino) butane and N-ethylmaleimide]; the other was an aspartic acid endoproteinase (sensitive to pepstatin). Only the aspartic proteinase was detected in either ungerminated or steeped barley grain. During the germination (malting) process, the aspartic endoproteinase activity decreased until the second day of germination and then increased until germination day 5. The first endoproteinase(s) induced during germination was a neutral enzyme that showed activity on the 1 st day of the germination phase after steeping. Most of the endoproteinases became active on the 2 nd or 3 rd germination day, but one cysteine proteinase was not detected until the 5 th day. Acid cysteine proteinases were present in the aleurone, scutellum, and endosperm tissues but not in shoots and roots. The aleurone layer and endosperm contained almost exclusively band B 1 neutral proteinases, whereas the scutellum, shoots, and roots contained both B 1 and B 2 bands. This work shows that germinating barley contains a complex set of proteinases whose expression is temporally and spatially controlled. But, at the same time, it also shows that this electrophoretic method for separating and studying individual enzymes of this complex will allow us to more readily characterize and purify them...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the estimation of}} carboxypeptidase, CP, by formol titration, with chloracetyl tyrosine or a peptic digest of <b>edestin</b> as substrate. To estimate the inactive precursor of carboxypeptidase, pro-carboxypeptidase [PCP], the precursor is activated with trypsin and the resulting carboxypeptidase is estimated. Peptic digests have not hitherto been used as substrates of carboxypeptidase because they are digested not only by carboxypeptidase but also by other proteolytic enzymes of the pancreas. I have found, however, that carboxypeptidase activity is not stopped by formaldehyde and that the digestion of a peptic digest by a crude pancreatic extract is due entirely to the carboxypeptidase in the extract, if the digestion is {{carried out in the}} presence of formaldehyde. If a crude extract of pancreas and a given solution of crystalline carboxypeptidase have the same activity as measured with chloracetyl-tyrosine, they likewise have the same activity as measured with a formolized peptic digest of <b>edestin.</b> The peptic digest is much cheaper than chloracetyl-tyrosine, which is important when many thousands of analyses have to be made. Furthermore, the peptic digest is stable at the pH used for estimation, whereas a fresh chioracetyl-tyrosine substrate solution has to be made every day.

The permeability is greatest near the isoelectric point of the protein; with increasing concentration of either acid or alkali it decreases, passes through a minimum, and then increases. These variations with pH are qualitatively in accord with the assumption that they are due to swelling of the gelatin in the pores of the membrane, the effects of pH being similar to those observed by Loeb on the swelling of gelatin granules.

40|$|Pepsin, {{like other}} enzymes, is removed {{more or less}} {{completely}} from solution by various insoluble substances. Dauwe (1) showed that insoluble proteins were particularly efficient in this respect. These results were confirmed by Abderhalden and coworkers (2). The writer found (3) that the quantity of pepsin removed by insoluble proteins depended largely upon the pH of the solution and that under certain conditions {{the ratio of the}} enzyme in the precipitate to that in the solution was the same as the chloride ion ratio. This result suggested that the pepsin was a negative ion and was distributed like any other ion in accordance with the Donnan equilibrium (4). In the acid range, however, between pH 2. 0 and 5. 0 the results were anomalous {{from this point of view}} since much more pepsin was absorbed than would be expected from the Donnan equilibrium. It has recently been found by Dyckerhoff and Tewes (5) and by Waldschmidt-Leitz and Kofr~nyi (6) that crystalline proteins such as <b>edestin</b> or melon globulin also possess the property of absorbing pepsin from pepsin solutions, and Waldschmidt-Leitz considers that the crystalline foreign protein removes the active group from the pepsin protein. If this explanation were correct a convenient means would be at hand to separate the active group of pepsin from the proteinpepsin molecule, since the foreign protein (<b>edestin</b> or melon globulin) is rapidly and completely digested by pepsin and since there is little or no loss in activity during peptic digestion. It would only be necessary, therefore, to allow the complex of foreign protein and pepsin to digest until all the protein had been destroyed and the active pepsin must then be found in solution free from protein.

Upon a diet of 18 per cent of either <b>edestin</b> or casein the growth of rats was inhibited, but resumed when phosphate was added. They cite this as an example of Liebig's law of the minimum. Their experiments antedated the discovery of vitamin D; but the diets contained 18 per cent of butter and therefore must have included considerable vitamin. The contrary has been reported by Bethke, Steenbock and Nelson (3) who state 1 that "with casein as the protein, fed at a level of 18 per cent of the ration, the phosphorus cannot be sufficiently reduced to cause nutritive failure. Even with lower levels of cod liver oil intake, increase of phosphate does not lead to increased growth. " It is well known that the calcium and phosphorus metabolism are inter dependent. An increase in the calcium may cause a relative insufficiency of the phosphorus. Examination of the calcium and phosphorus content of the diets given in Table I shows that the phosphorus of the diet of Bethke, Steenbock and Nelson lies between that of the <b>edestin</b> and casein diets of Osborne and Mendel and that the calcium is essentially the same.

Arginine contributes to the titration curve in much smaller amount than is found on hydrolysis.

The existence of an erepsin-like enzyme in certain bacteria was clearly indicated in the experiments of the writers (1916) which have been conducted on nitrogen utilization in Witte's peptone. The peptolytic enzyme elaborated by the Coli-typhi-paratyphi group and by other gelatin-non-liquefying organisms studied is decidedly weak, and differs further from erepsin of the animal body by its inability to attack casein. At least two weeks were required in the earlier tests to bring about a noticeable reduction in the amount of biuret-giving substances in Witte'...|$|E
40|$|An {{account of}} {{previous}} work on cathepsin {{may be found}} in the monograph of Pozzi (1935). In the hemoglobin method for the estimation of protelnase, denatured hemoglobin is digested and the digestion products not precipitable by trichloracefic acid are estimated colorimetrically. Hemoglobin, unlike commercial casein, <b>edestin,</b> and gelatin, is a reproducible substrate, Only the very first stages of digestion are measured by the tfichloracetic acid method, for only a small amount of digestion is needed to make hemoglobin not precipitable by trichloracetic acid. Thus, only true proteinase is estimated by the hemoglobin method. Almost all the estimations of proteinase recorded in the literature have been made with substrates that are not reproducible. As a result, the values of proteinase activity obtained in different laboratories, or in the same laboratory with different batches of substrate, are not quantitatively comparable. Furthermore, most of the values of proteinase activity recorded, in particular those obtained by the Willst~tter school, were obtained by methods which estimate not proteinase activity alone but the activity of proteinase plus other proteolytic enzymes. As a result, the values obtained by different investigators are not even qualitatively comparable. The hemoglobin-trichloracetic acid method estimates proteinase alone, yields reproducible results, and has now been applied to the four known types of proteinase, pepsin (Anson and Mirsky (1932 - 33)), trypsin (Anson and Mirsky (1933 - 34)), papain (Anson (1936 - 37)), and cathepsin. It would seem desirable that if some other method is used, either independent evidence be given that the method estimates proteinas...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} papers (1) we described-a {{method for}} {{the measurement of}} pepsin in gastric juice and reported the results of determinations made at frequent intervals before and after stimulation of the stomach secretions by histamine. It was shown that the concentration of pepsin falls after stimulation although the total output of ferment is increased {{at the height of}} secretion. It was also pointed out that the curve of pepsin concentration closely parallels that of nitrogen con-centration. Finally, a few cases of anacidity were reported in which, however, pepsin was still demonstrable. In the previous communication the general range of pepsin output was indicated but not enough cases had been studied to set actual standards. The present paper deals with an analysis of a larger series of observations and with the diagnostic implications derived therefrom. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty determinations were made on thirty-six hospital patients. Of these, twenty-one showed no evidence of disease of the stomach and were essentially normal people, five had duodenal ulcer, one had gastric ulcer, five had cancer of the stomach, two had pernicious anemia, one had sprue and two had anacidity for which no explanation was found. The determinations were made by the method previously described (2) on samples of gastric juice collected over ten-minute periods after histamine stimulation. The results are recorded in terms of milligrams of <b>edestin</b> digested by 1 cc. of gastric juice. RESULTS Chart 1 shows the shape of the curves of pepsin concentration and of total output of pepsin per ten-minute period after histamine stimula- 10...|$|E
40|$|With {{the growing}} {{importance}} of ketene in protein chemistry in view, {{this study was}} undertaken {{in an attempt to}} correlate the action of this reagent on some simple well known proteins, with that which is known about the action of the ketene on amino acids. It was thought that such a study might lead to a method of classifying proteins on a basis of reactivity. It later developed that the study of these fundamental correlations cast serious doubt on the conclusions reached by the workers in protein chemistry mentioned previously. A description has been given of the construction of a satisfactory ketene generator, with modifications that make for greater convenience in utilization of ketene as an acetylating agent. A method for obtaining zein in neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions has been devised, which should be of considerable value in further work with this protein. Representative proteins, i. e., crystalline egg albumin, <b>edestin,</b> gelatin, casein, and zein, have been treated with ketene under different conditions of pH, and a description of the resulting products have been given. It has been shown that available specific colorimetric reagents for tyrosine such as Millon’s reagent and the Folin’s phenol reagent are of no value for differentiating the free and the acetylated phenolic hydroxyl group in this molecule. The rate of acetylation of the α-amino group of glycine in alkaline solution has been known to be at least twice the rate of acetylation in acid solution. Experimental proof has been given for the relation of this to the Zwitterian equilibrium by treatment of solutions containing the ammonium ion with ketene. Both the phenolic hydroxyl of tyrosine and the 2, 5 diketopiperazine molecule {{have been shown to be}} unaffected by ketene in acid solution. A criticism of Herriott’s analytical methods in his work on treatment of pepsin with ketene has been made. Advisor: W. E. Militze...|$|E
