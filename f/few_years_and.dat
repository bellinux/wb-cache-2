The marriage ended after a <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> Nakakura left the family in 1937. Ueshiba later designated his son Kisshomaru as the heir to his martial art.|$|E
5|$|The current Romanian {{reconnaissance}} battalions (the 313th, the 317th and the 528th) {{are also}} considered special forces units, and were {{formed in the}} 1960s during the communist regime. After the revolution, the units suffered {{from a lack of}} funds which resulted in the temporary disbandment of the 313th Battalion. However, their equipment was completely overhauled in the past <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> the combat readiness and capabilities have regained full strength.|$|E

5|$|Benedict Arnold then {{applied to}} {{accompany}} General Carleton, {{who was going}} to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere. Other attempts all failed to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company over the next <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism.|$|E

5|$|The case {{began when}} the {{investigation}} of an automobile accident during Mateen Cleaves's 1996 recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the Wolverine basketball program {{dating back to the}} 1980s. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated over the next <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> by 1999 some were called before a federal grand jury. Four eventual professional basketball playersChris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullockwere discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin, but eventually confessed to taking loans from Martin. He was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by the National Basketball Association after performing public service.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the freeway opened in 1963, east of I-805. The {{extension}} of the freeway west to I-5 was delayed in order {{to coincide with the}} construction of the flood channel for the Sweetwater River. While construction started in 1984, a court stopped the process for a <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> this portion was not complete until 1992. The final section of freeway, which was upgraded from an expressway, opened in 2007, to coincide with the extension of SR125 south to Otay Mesa.|$|E

5|$|The {{other two}} ships, Strassburg and Stralsund, {{remained}} with the High Seas Fleet {{for the duration}} of their careers. They saw action at the major engagements, including Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank, though neither ship was present at Jutland. Both ships survived the war; Strassburg was surrendered to Italy and renamed Taranto. She served through World War II and was sunk by Allied bombers in 1944. Stralsund became the French Mulhouse, though she served for only a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> was withdrawn from service by 1925 and scrapped a decade later.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the true}} events, {{military}} historian David A. Graff opines that logistical concerns played the {{major role in}} Dou's decision to stay at Banzhu, as his huge army was utterly dependent on proximity to the Yellow River and its canal network for its supplies. In addition, the heterogeneous nature of the Xia army, containing as it did the forces of various rebel leaders Dou had defeated over the past <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> whose loyalty was doubtful, prevented Dou from dividing his army and sending various detachments on independent missions.|$|E

5|$|All four ships saw major action {{during the}} war. Augsburg fired the first {{shots of the}} war against Russia on 2 August. Mainz and Cöln were sunk at the Battle of Heligoland Bight {{in the first month}} of the war. Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and scored the first hits of the engagement. Both Kolberg and Augsburg participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, and Operation Albion in October 1917. After the end of the war, Kolberg was seized by France as a war prize and {{commissioned}} into the French Navy as Colmar; she served for only a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> was scrapped in 1929. Augsburg was surrendered to Japan, which broke her up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Although not a {{director}} or significant shareholder {{of the new}} company, Pearson continued to promote the project over the next <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> use his influence to help the company raise the £1 million of capital needed {{for the construction of}} the line. He issued a pamphlet, A twenty minutes letter to the citizens of London, in favour of the Metropolitan Railway and City Station, encouraging investment and he even persuaded the City of London to invest on the basis that the railway would alleviate the City's congestion problems. Once the railway was in operation, the City sold its shares at a profit. By 1860, the funds had been collected and the final route decided. Work on the railway started; taking less than three years to excavate through some of the worst slums of Victorian London and under some of the busiest streets.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was the {{favourite}} {{throughout the}} leadership campaign. At the convention in Ottawa in December, {{he refused to}} abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the proposer or seconder of his candidacy, and instead selected an Easterner (from New Brunswick) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination. With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents, Diefenbaker felt that having a Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support. Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot, and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory. Other Diefenbaker opponents, such as those who had urged Smith to run, believed that the 61-year-old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker, who would serve a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> then step down in favour of a younger man, and that the upcoming election would be lost to the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} that Benchley was filming various short films, he also began working at The New Yorker, which had started in February 1925 {{under the control of}} Benchley's friend Harold Ross. While Benchley, along with many of his Algonquin acquaintances, was wary of getting {{involved}} with another publication for various reasons, he completed some freelance work for The New Yorker over the first <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> was later invited to be newspaper critic. Benchley initially wrote the column under the pseudonym Guy Fawkes (the lead conspirator in the English Gunpowder Plot), and the column was well received. Benchley tackled issues ranging from careless reporting to European fascism, and the publication flourished. He was invited to be theatre critic for The New Yorker in 1929, leaving Life, and contributions from Woollcott and Parker became regular features in the magazine. The New Yorker published an average of forty-eight Benchley columns per year during the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Executives from Endemol, the {{production}} company for Big Brother worldwide, defended the format which is transmitted in 41 territories and noted the season {{premiere of the}} 11th season in America won its timeslot with year-to-year growth. Other comparisons noted was the finale of ninth season of Italy's Grande Fratello pulled 7.9 million viewers with a 36% audience share and how in Argentina the show has been rested for a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> returns with stronger ratings. Paul Jonson, global head of marketing and brand partnerships for Endemol Group, noted that using audience averages {{to figure out how}} the show performs wouldn't work since the audience builds up until the finale. Jonson also noted that the series continued to rate very well when compared to the timeslot average for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|Field {{research}} {{carried out}} by ethnologists such as Stefan Ehrentraut shows that {{only a minority of}} Vietnamese children attend public schools, with figures varying across different provinces. In Kampong Chhnang and Siem Reap where the Vietnamese live along the river banks, enrolment into public schools fare below 10%, whereas in other provinces such as Kampot and Kratie the proportion are higher. As the majority of Vietnamese do not carry citizenship papers, they were unable to enrol their children into public schools. For those who send their children to schools, most of them only attend school for a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> seldom complete Grade 12 as Vietnamese parents were unable to afford school fees. Vietnamese students also faced difficulties in academic work, as classes are taught exclusively in the Khmer language, and Vietnamese children that grew up speaking Vietnamese at home have limited competency in Khmer. In some Vietnamese communities based in the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers, there are private schools that are run by Vietnamese community associations and Christian organisations. The private schools cater the teaching of the Vietnamese language, and are mostly attended by children of impoverished families.|$|E
