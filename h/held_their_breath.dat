60|$|Mrs. Gorman, {{tall and}} bony, {{advanced}} and stood over Mr. Todd. Strong men <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then as all <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath,</b> from Franko there spouted an eruption, {{which seemed}} to plant all Mardi in the foreground.|$|E
60|$|Those who {{happened}} to be standing in the room <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath,</b> for in that menacing, steady glare they recognized battle.|$|E
60|$|They both <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths.</b> From {{somewhere along}} the road behind came a faint sound like the beating of an engine.|$|R
60|$|They cut away, and the Rose, {{released}} from the strain, shook her feathers on the wave-crest like a freed sea-gull, while all men <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Now men <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths,</b> {{waiting to}} see this fool led away to die by torture of the ant-heap or some other dreadful doom. But the prince only answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{the smiling}} courtiers near them [...] On a sudden were still as death; [...] And, subtly-stricken, the people [...] Hearkened and <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> ...|$|E
60|$|After this {{there was}} silence for a while. Caligula still sat staring with wide-open eyes before him, whilst the slaves <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath,</b> staring fascinated on that terrible whip, lying {{momentarily}} forgotten.|$|E
60|$|The two men <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath,</b> keeping well in {{the shadow}} of the orange grove. They had reached the road, and in the {{distance}} they could hear the sound of approaching voices.|$|E
60|$|Unfolding {{the stained}} document, Randolph Rover bent {{closer to the}} table lamp that he might read the more easily. As for the boys, they fairly <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths,</b> that no spoken word might escape them.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the flags}} fell, men <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> in suspense. Few knew the victor, so close {{had been the}} struggle. But a {{flourish}} of the trumpets soon commanded attention, and then a herald proclaimed that-- ...|$|R
60|$|Jim {{the horse}} had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood {{straight}} up with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> in suspense. But no; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, {{and came to}} a stop at last.|$|R
6000|$|They {{approached}} me; {{just then}} there was a sound outside; a sound of voices and trampling hoofs; the robbers <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> and listened; the sounds came slowly nearer and nearer; then came a shout-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is brighter!" [...] {{cried the}} people {{clustering}} in the streets. But {{in the dim}} observatories the watchers <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> and peered at one another. [...] "It is nearer!" [...] they said. [...] "Nearer!" ...|$|E
60|$|A curious sound went {{round the}} room--a gasp, hardly a cry--and all those present <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath,</b> silent, {{appalled at the}} terrible tragedy {{expressed}} by these two young men standing face to face {{on the brink of}} a deathly and almost blasphemous conflict.|$|E
60|$|They <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> {{and watched}} his face. Kenneth flushed red {{as he held}} the {{receiver}} to his ear, and then grew white. He turned around to the expectant group and Beth knew from the sparkle in his eyes what had happened.|$|R
60|$|The doctor motioned him to silence, and Joe Harris and Mr. Brown <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> nervously {{as he made}} an examination. For {{ten minutes}} he prodded and puzzled over the insensible form in the bed; {{then he turned to}} the couple at the door.|$|R
60|$|When {{the boat}} carried Dot and Tot beyond the rocky arch {{that led to}} the Fourth and most {{important}} Valley of Merry-land, the children <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> in suspense; for here lived the Queen of all this wonderful country, and they had no idea what she was like.|$|R
60|$|The boys <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath,</b> {{when there}} was a sharp {{cracking}} of musketry, the man with the torch fell prostrate, and several cries arose from the column. The watchers on the roof of Gubbins' house had been quick to discern their enemy.|$|E
6000|$|The princess moved uneasily {{when she}} was first laid upon the bed of straw, and the boys {{literally}} <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> in suspense, fearing she would awaken; but, after a few moments, the child lay quietly, and Plums said, {{in a tone of}} satisfaction: ...|$|E
60|$|Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, {{looking down}} from the top of a tall tree, <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath.</b> Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and his cousin, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, looking down from another tree, <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath.</b> Unc' Billy Possum, {{sticking}} his head out from a hollow tree, held his breath. Bobby Coon, looking through a hole in a hollow stump in which he was hiding, held his breath. Reddy Fox, lying flat down behind a heap of brush, held his breath. Peter Rabbit, sitting bolt upright under a thick hemlock branch, with eyes and ears wide open, held his breath. And all the other little people who happened to be where they could see did the same thing.|$|E
60|$|He hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and {{the girl}} came out. Fagin drew him behind a small {{partition}} which was curtained off, and they <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> as she passed within {{a few feet of}} their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.|$|R
6000|$|This {{made the}} guests more excited than before, for {{they did not}} know what he was saying [...] "ha!" [...] about; and they <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> when the King put his thumb and finger into the box and drew out a little wooden man about as big as my finger. He wore a blue jacket and a red cap and held a little brass horn in his hand.|$|R
60|$|But {{what was}} that behind her? Her shadow against the white wall of the house. Not so. Another figure, cloaked likewise, but taller far, was {{following}} on her steps. It was a man's. They {{could see that he}} wore a broad sombrero. It could not be Don Guzman, for he was at sea. Who then? Here was a mystery; perhaps a tragedy. And both brothers <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths,</b> while Amyas felt whether his sword was loose in the sheath.|$|R
60|$|The {{excitement}} and nervous expectation of the Eskimos had been worked up considerably by these preparations, {{so that they}} not only retired to a safe distance, {{but some of them}} even took refuge behind the igloes, and all <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> while their guest took aim.|$|E
60|$|Both <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> and listened. There was a {{sound like}} the faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom {{answered}} it, and leading Becky by the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little nearer.|$|E
60|$|Every {{incident}} {{of the fight}} could {{be seen from the}} British position on the hill, and the troops almost <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> with excitement as the British lines clashed against the head of the French column, and a loud shout of triumph burst out spontaneously as the French broke and fled.|$|E
60|$|Man and beast {{went down}} together, {{and where they}} sank, the {{moonlight}} shone on a great swirling eddy, while all <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths,</b> and Ayacanora cowered down {{into the bottom of}} the canoe, her proud spirit utterly broken, for the first time, by the terror of that great need, and by a bitter loss. For in the struggle, the holy trumpet, companion of all her wanderings, had fallen from her bosom; and her fond hope of bringing magic prosperity to her English friends had sunk with it to the bottom of the stream.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody <b>’eld</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> {{that evening}} in the school room when Mrs. Pawlett got up on the {{platform}} and took {{a slip of paper}} from one of the judges. She stood a moment waiting for silence, and then ’eld up her ’and to stop what she thought was clapping at the back, but which was two or three wimmen who ’ad ’ad to take their crying babies out trying to quiet ’em in the porch. Then Mrs. Pawlett put ’er glasses on her nose and just read out, short and sweet, that the prize of three sovereigns and a metal teapot for the best-kept cottage garden ’ad been won by Mr. Robert Pretty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Had {{you asked}} me that {{question}} a short time since," [...] replied Hollingsworth, after a pause, during which, it seemed to me, even the birch-trees <b>held</b> <b>their</b> whispering <b>breath,</b> [...] "I should have told you--'No!' My feelings for Priscilla differed little from those of an elder brother, watching tenderly over the gentle sister whom God has given him to protect." ...|$|R
60|$|The people <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath,</b> {{for they}} thought: 'Surely {{the boy is}} bewitched and throws away his life, for the {{crocodiles}} will eat him!' Then suddenly the ground trembled, and the pool, heaving and swirling, became red with blood, and presently the boy rising to the surface swam on shore.|$|E
60|$|At the end, she {{gathered}} herself together for one supreme effort, and hurled at him an insult so bitter with scorn so sharp with insight into {{his career and}} character, so heavy with prophetic curse, that strong men drew and <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> while it passed over them, and women hid their faces and shivered.|$|E
6000|$|Steps approached; both buried {{themselves}} in their books; both <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breath</b> and felt their hearts flutter as they never had done before at the step of mortal man. The door opened; neither looked up, yet each was conscious of mingled disappointment and relief when the major said, in a grave tone, [...] "Girls, I've something to tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|A breathless instant followed, for all {{on board}} the two ships thought they must now inevitably come foul of each other, and this the more so, because the Montauk took the impulse of the sea {{just as it was}} lost to the Foam, and seemed on the point of {{plunging}} directly into the stern of the latter. Even the seamen clenched the ropes around them convulsively, and the boldest <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> for a time. The [...] "p-o-r-t, hard a port, and be d---d to you!" [...] of Captain Truck; and the [...] "S-t-a-r-b-o-a-r-d, starboard hard!" [...] of the Englishman, were both distinctly audible to all in the two ships; for this was a moment in which seamen can speak louder than the tempest. The affrighted vessels seemed to recede together, and they shot asunder in diverging lines, the Foam leading. All further attempts at a communication were instantly useless; the corvette being half a mile ahead in a quarter of an hour, rolling her yardarms nearly to the water.|$|R
60|$|The {{boarders}} cheered heartily, {{and leaped}} into the rigging. The Coquette readily and rapidly yielded {{to the power of}} her rudder. First inclining to the light, and then sweeping up towards the wind again, in another instant she was close upon the chase. The irons were thrown, the men once more shouted, and all on board <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> in expectation of the crash of the meeting hulls. At that moment of high excitement, the woman's face rose a short distance in the air, seemed to smile in derision of their attempt, and suddenly disappeared. The ship passed steadily ahead, while no noise but the sullen wash of the waters was audible. The boarding-irons were heard falling heavily into the sea; and the Coquette rapidly overrun the spot where the light had been seen, without sustaining any shock. Though the clouds lifted a little, and the eye might embrace a circuit of a few hundred feet, there certainly was nothing to be seen, within its range, but the unquiet element, and the stately cruiser of Queen Anne floating on its bosom.|$|R
60|$|That night, in {{the cabin}} under the cliffs, Old Tomah had to rehearse again all the wolf lore learned in sixty years of hunting: how, {{fortunately}} for the deer, these enormous wolves had never been abundant and were now very rare, a few having been shot, and more poisoned in the starving times, and the rest having vanished, mysteriously as wolves do, for some unknown reason. Bears, which are easily trapped and shot and whose skins are worth each a month's wages to the fishermen, still hold their own and even increase on the great island; while the wolves, once more numerous, are slowly vanishing, though they are never hunted, and not even Old Tomah himself could set a trap cunningly enough to catch one. The old hunter told, while Mooka and Noel <b>held</b> <b>their</b> <b>breaths</b> and drew closer to the light, how once, {{when he made his}} camp alone under a cliff on the lake shore, seven huge wolves, white as the snow, came racing swift and silent over the ice straight at the fire which he had barely time to kindle; how he shot two, and the others, seizing the fish he had just caught through the ice for his own supper, vanished over the bank; and he could not say even now whether they meant him harm or no. Again, as he talked and the grim old face lighted up at the memory, they saw him crouched with his sledge-dogs by a blazing fire all the long winter night, and around him in the darkness blazing points of light, the eyes of wolves flashing back the firelight, and gaunt white forms flitting about like shadows, drawing nearer and nearer with ever-growing boldness till they seized his largest dog--though the brute lay so near the fire that his hair singed--and whisked it away with an appalling outcry. And still again, when Tomah was lost three days in the interior, they saw him wandering with his pack over endless barrens and through gloomy spruce woods, and near him all the time a young wolf that followed his steps quietly, with half-friendly interest, and came no nearer day or night.|$|R
