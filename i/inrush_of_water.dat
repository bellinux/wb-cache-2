2500|$|Lieutenant Frederick Woods, the torpedo officer, {{opened the}} test cocks on the tubes. Unfortunately, the test cock on tube number 5 {{was blocked by}} some enamel paint so no water flowed out even though the bow cap was open.

This combined with a confusing layout of the bow cap indicators — they were arranged in a vertical line with 5 at the bottom (2,1,4,3,6, and then 5) and the [...] "Shut" [...] position for tube 5 on the dial was the mirror image of tube 6 above it — led to the inner door of the tube being opened. The <b>inrush</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> caused the bow of the submarine to sink to the seabed [...] below the surface.

2500|$|A team of divers {{investigated}} Vandal in August 2003, {{looking for}} an explanation for her mysterious sinking. [...] They found a large section (about 4ft) of the stern was missing and the aft engine room escape hatch was closed, but the forward escape hatch was open. [...] In addition, the mooring lines were neatly stowed around both amidships and stern bollards, and the forward hydroplanes were in their stowed position. [...] It is therefore likely that Vandal was on the surface when the incident occurred. [...] The area that Vandal lies in is known as area [...] "Quebec", and was used by submarines performing log calibrations over a [...] "measured mile." [...] So {{it is possible that}} log calibration work was being carried out, and although there are other explanations, this might suggest why she only travelled two miles [...] (4km) in one-and-a-half hours. Maintenance of the log on a submarine can be very hazardous as raising it for inspection can potentially breach the pressure hull and cause a serious flood. In the case of HMS Untamed (which sank three months after Vandal) incorrect procedure whilst carrying out log maintenance was the main contributing factor to the boat and her entire crew being lost. [...] Had the hull been breached, whilst the forward escape hatch was open, the <b>inrush</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> could have overwhelmed the submarine. [...] The starboard propeller blades were found to be worn down at their tips, indicating that either the propellers were turning (perhaps full astern) as Vandal hit the seabed, or whilst she was on the seabed in an attempt to drive her off the bottom.|$|E

2500|$|At {{seven o'clock}} {{on the morning}} of 29 August work on the hull was carried out and Royal George was heeled over by rolling the ship's {{starboard}} guns into the centreline of the ship. This caused the ship to tilt over in the water to port. [...] Further, the loading {{of a large number of}} casks of rum on the now-low port side created additional and, it turned out, unstable weight. The ship was heeled over too far, passing her centre of gravity. Realising that the ship was settling in the water, the ship's carpenter informed the lieutenant of the watch, Monin Hollingbery, and asked him to beat the drum to signal to the men to right the ship. [...] The officer refused. [...] As the situation worsened, the carpenter implored the officer a second time. [...] A second time he was refused. [...] The carpenter then took his concern directly to the ship's captain, who agreed with him and gave the order to move the guns back into position. [...] By this time, however, the ship had already taken on too much water through its port-side gun ports, and the drum was never sounded. [...] The ship tilted heavily to port, causing a sudden <b>inrush</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and a burst of air out the starboard side. The barge along the port side which had been unloading the rum was caught in the masts as the ship turned, briefly delaying the sinking, but losing most of her crew. Royal George quickly filled up with water and sank, taking with her around 900 people, including up to 300 women and 60 children who were visiting the ship in harbour. 255 people were saved, including eleven women and one child. Some escaped by running up the rigging, while others were picked up by boats from other vessels. Kempenfelt was writing in his cabin when the ship sank; the cabin doors had jammed because of the ship's heeling and he perished. Waghorn was injured and thrown into the water, but he was rescued.

Had we bidden {{farewell}} forever to the sunlight and life, or were there before us dangers even greater than those which we now faced? I tried to keep my mind from vain imagining by calling everything which I observed to the eager ears below. I was the eyes of the whole company, and I did my best not to fail them. We had advanced a hundred yards, perhaps, when our first danger confronted us. Just ahead was a sharp right-angle turn in the tunnel. I could see the river's flotsam hurtling against the rocky wall upon the left as it was driven on by the mighty current, and I feared for the safety of the U-33 in making so sharp a turn under such adverse conditions; but there was nothing for it but to try. I didn't warn my fellows of the danger--it could have but caused them useless apprehension, for if we were to be smashed against the rocky wall, no power on earth could avert the quick end that would come to us. I gave the command full speed ahead and went charging toward the menace. I was forced to approach the dangerous left-hand wall in order to make the turn, and I depended upon the power of the motors to carry us through the surging waters in safety. Well, we made it; but it was a narrow squeak. As we swung around, the full force of the current caught us and drove the stern against the rocks; there was a thud which sent a tremor through the whole craft, and then a moment of nasty grinding as the steel hull scraped the rock wall. I expected momentarily the <b>inrush</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> that would seal our doom; but presently from below came the welcome word that all was well.|$|R

In order to control the water capsule, the treatment scheme composed by full-face curtain grouting in left tunnel and decompression by drainage in right tunnel was made, and the composite and controlling grouting methods were proposed. The composite and controlling grouting technology was applied in the treatment. It was composed by grouting parameters selection, grouting material and technology optimization by means of numerical simulation, model experiment and SEM microscopic experiment. By means of the grouting effect examination methods including P-Q-t curve, examination holes, surrounding rock deformation monitoring and excavation, the water capsule was proved to be treated successfully.

Then, indeed, he leaped right out, spurred on to new miracles of bodily vigour by this new shape of danger. The <b>inrush</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> when the lighter heeled over unsealed his lips. His shriek, [...] "Save me!" [...] was the first distinct warning of the collision for the people on board the steamer. Next moment the wire shroud parted, and the released anchor swept over the lighter's forecastle. It came against the breast of Senor Hirsch, who simply seized hold of it, without in the least knowing what it was, but curling his arms and legs upon the part above the fluke with an invincible, unreasonable tenacity. The lighter yawed off wide, and the steamer, moving on, carried him away, clinging hard, and shouting for help. It was some time, however, after the steamer had stopped that his position was discovered. His sustained yelping for help seemed to come from somebody swimming in the water. At last a couple of men went over the bows and hauled him on board. He was carried straight off to Sotillo on the bridge. His examination confirmed the impression that some craft had been run over and sunk, but it was impracticable on such a dark night to look for the positive proof of floating wreckage. Sotillo was more anxious than ever now to enter the harbour without loss of time; the idea that he had destroyed the principal object of his expedition was too intolerable to be accepted. This feeling made the story he had heard appear the more incredible. Senor Hirsch, after being beaten a little for telling lies, was thrust into the chartroom. But he was beaten only a little.

40|$|For any {{industry}} {{to be successful}} it is to identify the Hazards to assess the associated risks and to bring the risks to tolerable level. Mining activity because of {{the very nature of}} the operation, complexity of the systems, procedures and methods always involves some amount of hazards. Hazard identification and risk analysis is carried for identification of undesirable events that can leads to a hazard, the analysis of hazard mechanism by which this undesirable event could occur and usually the estimation of extent, magnitude and likelihood of harmful effects. It is widely accepted within industry in general that the various techniques of risk assessment contribute greatly toward improvements in the safety of complex operations and equipment. Hazard identification and risk analysis involves identification of undesirable events that leads to a hazard, the analysis of hazard mechanism by which this undesirable event could occur and usually the estimation of extent, magnitude and likelihood of harmful effects. The objective of hazards and risk analysis is to identify and analyze hazards, the event sequences leading to hazards and the risk of hazardous events. Many techniques ranging from simple qualitative methods to advanced quantitative methods are available to help identify and analyze hazards. The use of multiple hazard analysis techniques is recommended because each has its own purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. As the part of the project work, hazard identification and risk analysis was carried out for an iron ore mine and a coal mine and the hazards were identified and risk analysis was carried out. The different activities were divided in to high, medium and low depending upon their consequences and likelihood. The high risks activities have been marked in red colour are un-acceptance and must be reduced. The risks which are marked in yellow colour are tolerable but efforts must be made to reduce risk without expenditure that is grossly disproportionate to the benefit gained. The risks which are marked in green have the risk level so low that it is not required for taking actions to reduce its magnitude any further. For the iron ore mine the high risk activities which were recorded were related to face stability and the person blasting the shots. In the coal mine there was problem of fly rocks, iv roads were not proper for haulage purpose, inappropriate use of personal protective equipment and <b>inrushes</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> into the mine causing inundation. Hazard identification and risk assessment can be used to establish priorities so that the most dangerous situations are addressed first and those least likely to occur and least likely to cause major problems can be considered later.

40|$|The hydroacoustic nuclear {{explosion}} monitoring regime, like it's {{counterpart in}} seismic monitoring, requires ground truth calibration. Model predictions of traveltimes, blockages, reflections, diffractions, and waveform envelopes {{need to be}} verified with ground truth experiments, particularly in the high latitudes where models often fail. Although pressure detonated explosives are a simple, reliable, and flexible method to generate an impulsive hydroacoustic calibration source at a desired depth; safety procedures, specialized training, and local regulations often preclude their use. This leaves few alternatives since airgun and other seismic marine sources are designed for use only at shallow depths and hence do not effectively couple into the SOFAR channel, a necessary requirement for long range propagation. Imploding spheres could be an effective source at mid-ocean depths and below but development of a method to reliably break such spheres has been elusive. We designed and tested a prototype system to initiate catastrophic glass sphere failure at a prescribed depth. The system firmly holds a glass sphere in contact with a piston-ram assembly. The end cap on the cylinder confining the piston and opposing the ram has a rupture disk sealed to it. The rupture disk is calibrated to fail within 5 % of the calibrated failure pressure, 1000 psi in our tests. Failure of the rupture disk results in a sudden <b>inrush</b> <b>of</b> high pressure <b>water</b> into the air-filled piston chamber, driving the piston [...] and attached ram [...] towards the glass sphere. The spherecracker was first tested on Benthos Corp. flotation spheres. The spherecracker mechanism successfully punched {{a hole in the}} Benthos sphere at the nominal pressure of 1000 psi or at about 700 meters depth in each of four tests. Despite the violent <b>inrush</b> <b>of</b> high pressure <b>water</b> the spheres did not otherwise fail. We concluded that the Benthos spheres were too thick-walled to be used as an imploding source at nominal SOFAR channel depths (500 meters- 1200 meters in mid-latitudes). A much thinner walled sphere, a special order modification of a standard 22 liter laboratory boiling flask made by the Kontes Glass Company, was also tested and found to fail in the desired manner, i. e. catastrophically. A test off the coast of California successfully initiated implosion of a Kontes sphere at 685 meters depth. The recorded signal showed a peak pressure slightly larger than that from 1 lb of high explosive detonated at the same depth. The signal spectra showed relatively broad band higher frequency energy with little signal below about 50 Hz and a broad peak in the amplitude spectra between about 200 and 800 Hz, similar to that from an explosive source detonated at the same depth. Although additional testing and development is needed, an imploding sphere source for hydroacoustic calibrations appears viable. Since the source spectra frequencies are generally higher than the frequency band used for nuclear explosion monitoring, low frequency signals (1 - 50 Hz) will be absent from the implosion source spectra. Calibration will have to be accomplished with frequencies above 50 Hz unless larger spheres, multiple spheres, or shallower implosion depths are used...|$|R
