5000|$|Reviews for {{the album}} were {{generally}} mixed, negative, or average. Some critics dismissed the album {{because they felt}} that although the band attempted {{to distance themselves from}} bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam in terms of their sound, they ultimately failed at creating a sound of their own. For example, Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne stated that some of the songs on the album could have easily been on the record Nirvana never made (due to <b>Kurt</b> <b>Cobains</b> suicide). Andy Gill from The Independent also stated that portions of the album are very reminiscent of Nirvana, citing songs such as [...] "Swallowed" [...] and [...] "Bonedriven" [...] as irresistible reminders of Nirvana. Rolling Stones Matt Diehl criticized the album {{at the time of its}} release, giving the album two out of five stars. However, Razorblade Suitcase was not criticized by all critics. Select magazine gave the effort three out of five stars.|$|R

Despite releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana {{has come to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} most influential and important alternative bands in history. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop is tied closely to Soundgarden, since Sub Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman funded Soundgarden's early releases, and the band's success led {{to the expansion of}} Sub Pop as a serious record label. Nirvana frontman <b>Kurt</b> <b>Cobain</b> was a fan of Soundgarden's music, and reportedly Soundgarden's involvement with Sub Pop influenced Cobain to sign Nirvana with the label.

5000|$|Greg Prato of AllMusic {{called the}} song [...] "one {{of the few}} bright spots" [...] of the summer of 1994 when [...] "the world was still reeling from Nirvana leader <b>Kurt</b> <b>Cobains</b> suicide the {{previous}} April". He said, [...] "The song had a psychedelic edge to it (especially evident in the verses guitar part), as the composition shifted between sedate melodicism and gargantuan guitar riffs. The lyrics were classic Chris Cornell—lines didnt exactly make sense on paper but did within the song." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said, [...] "The Beatles techniques—fuzz-toned low chords, legato lead-guitar hooks and lumpy Ringo Starr-style drumming...are linked to Lennon-style melody in Black Hole Sun." [...] J.D. Considine of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "With its yearning, Lennonesque melody and watery, Harrisonstyle guitar, Black Hole Sun is a wonderful exercise in Beatleisms; trouble is, its {{not a very good}} song, offering more in the way of mood and atmosphere than melodic direction." [...] Ann Powers of Blender proclaimed that [...] "Cornells fixation with the Beatles pays off with the hit single Black Hole Sun [...] ". The solo for [...] "Black Hole Sun", performed by Thayil, was ranked number 63 on Guitar Worlds list of the [...] "100 Greatest Guitar Solos", and number 56 on Total Guitars list of the [...] "100 Hottest Guitar Solos". The song was included on VH1s countdown of the [...] "100 Greatest Songs of the 90s" [...] at number 25. It was also included on VH1s countdown of the [...] "100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs" [...] at number 77.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by reviewers, who appreciated the {{improvements in the}} accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list {{was considered to be}} too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of <b>Kurt</b> <b>Cobain</b> to perform in any other song within the game.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5s track list {{contains}} 85 {{songs by}} 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with {{works in the}} game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and <b>Kurt</b> <b>Cobain.</b> Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available.

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{revealed}} through hard rock/heavy metal magazine Metal Hammer that the title for their third album would be Five Serpent's Teeth {{to be released}} 26 September 2011 in Europe and 18 October 2011 in North America through Earache Records. On 6 June, the band posted a new song, titled [...] "Eternal Empire", on their YouTube channel. On 12 September 2011 the album's first single/music video, [...] "Cult", was released. The video saw a different, more modern approach. In September/October 2011 the band {{set out on a}} 15-date headline tour of the UK with label-mates Savage Messiah (band) as support. The band were then asked by Kerrang! Magazine to cover a Nirvana song for Neverminds 20th Anniversary Tribute Issue. Evile covered the track [...] "Lounge Act". Ol Drake commented:When we got the offer, all I could see was fun to be had, and what an honor it was to be included. I was a big fan of Nirvana when I was a young teen, so it's an extra honor in that way for me. I wondered what we could do to the track to make it our own, so we approached it like we would one of our own songs. That bass riff is brilliant and I wanted to make it more a core element of the track guitar-wise and just metal it up in general. I wanted to respect the approach of the song but also alter <b>Kurt's</b> <b>Cobain</b> chord approach to a style more suited to EVILE, and that's a chug-athon! ...|$|R
50|$|Cobain's parents both {{found new}} {{partners}} after the divorce. Although {{his father had}} promised not to remarry, after meeting Jenny Westeby, he did, to <b>Kurt's</b> dismay. <b>Cobain,</b> his father, Westeby, and her two children, Mindy and James, {{moved into a new}} household together. Cobain liked Westeby at first, as she gave him the maternal attention he desired. In January 1979, Westeby gave birth to a boy, Chad Cobain. This new family, which Cobain insisted was not his real one, was {{in stark contrast to the}} attention Cobain was used to receiving as an only boy, and he soon began to express resentment toward his stepmother. Cobain's mother began dating a man who was abusive. Cobain witnessed the domestic violence inflicted upon her, with one incident resulting in her being hospitalized with a broken arm. Wendy steadfastly refused to press charges, remaining completely committed to the relationship.|$|R
5|$|Her most {{documented}} {{romantic relationship}} was with <b>Kurt</b> <b>Cobain.</b> It is uncertain {{when they first}} met, and there are varying accounts of how they came to know one another. Journalist Michael Azerrad states that the two met in 1989 at the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, Oregon, though Cobain biographer Charles Cross has claimed the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in passing that he looked like Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum. According to Love, she first met him at a Dharma Bums show in Portland, while Love's bandmate Eric Erlandson stated that both he and Love were formally introduced to Cobain {{in a parking lot}} after a Butthole Surfers concert at the Hollywood Palladium on May 17, 1991. Sometime in late 1991, Love and Cobain became reacquainted through Jennifer Finch, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was fired}} from the band later that year due to musical differences, via a fax from {{keyboard}} player Roddy Bottum; and Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance {{was brought in to}} record their next album. However, Spruance left the band before the subsequent tour, and was replaced by the band's keyboard roadie, Dean Menta. Reasons given for the change differ—the band claim Spruance was unwilling to commit to a long touring schedule in support of the album, whilst Spruance claims he was never meant to be a permanent member in the first place. Roddy Bottum also claims to have been mostly absent during this period, owing to the deaths of his father and <b>Kurt</b> <b>Cobain,</b> whose wife Courtney Love was a close friend of his and one of the temporary lead singers of the band before Chuck Mosely joined. Bottum's absence led to the album being written largely without keyboards. Around the recording of the album in 1994, Mike Patton also got married to Italian woman Cristina Zuccatosta.|$|E
