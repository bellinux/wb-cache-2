" The chapter is organized around an increasingly complex view of the demand conditions facing a physician, beginning with the most simple conception associated with demand and supply, and building through monopolistic competition models with complete information, and finally models with asymmetric information. Institutional features such as insurance, price regulation, managed care networks and noncontractible elements of quality of care are incorporated in turn. The review reveals three mechanisms physicians may use to <b>influence</b> <b>quantity</b> of care provided to patients: quantity setting of a nonretradable service, influencing demand by setting {{the level of a}} noncontractible input ("quality"), and, in an asymmetric-information context, taking an action to influence patient preferences.

This study investigated how depression affects MBC stress reactivity, including autonomic (ANS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. METHOD: Forty-five nondepressed and 45 depressed patients with MBC underwent a modified Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) while affect, cardiovascular, respiratory, and cortisol responses were measured. RESULTS: At study entry, depressed compared with nondepressed patients had significantly lower log cortisol waking rise levels (p =. 005) but no other HPA differences. Positive affect (p =. 025) and high-frequency heart-rate variability (lnHF) (p =. 002) were significantly lower at TSST baseline in depressed patients. In response to the TSST, depressed patients reported significantly lower positive (p =. 050) and greater negative affect (p =. 037) and had significantly reduced lnHF (p =. 031). In secondary analyses, at TSST baseline both low-frequency (lnLF) (p =. 002) and very-low-frequency (lnVLF) (p =. 0001) heart rate variability were significantly lower in the depressed group. In secondary analyses during the TSST, those who were depressed had significantly lower lnVLF (p =. 008) and did not increase aortic impedance reactivity as much as did the nondepressed during the stressor (p =. 005). CONCLUSION: Depression in patients with MBC was associated with alterations in autonomic regulation, particularly reductions in respiratory sinus arrhythmia, a measure of cardiac vagal control, at baseline and during the TSST. In addition, depression was associated with blunted HPA response to awakening. Both MBC groups had relative cortisol hyporesponsiveness to acute stress...|$|E

These same programs also influence {{the parameters of}} estimated supply functions, and in particular, affect the acreage response to market price. Price-quantity observations generated under such policies do not readily reveal the underlying parameters of marginal cost functions which are the structural acreage response parameters invariant to the policy instruments that are in place {{during the period from}} which the data are generated. In this article we develop and apply an approach that uses detailed information about farm program incentives and constraints to identify underlying structural acreage response parameters when the data reflect behavior under complex government programs. The main argument and our general approach have broad applicability. We illustrate the approach with an application to the important case of rice acreage in the United States. In 1996, and 2002 program rules changed substantially. Structural parameters are needed to assess acreage response to market price under the new policies and to project acreage response under any proposed future policy change. Our empirical analysis indicates that, for U. S. rice, structural acreage response to market price is three to four times larger than acreage response under program features that were in place from 1986 to 1995. Thus, if they were used to represent structural acreage response, estimates that fail to appropriately incorporate the program rules would be biased down by a factor of three to four.

Experimental Procedure: The Germ Plasm Evaluation (GPE) program has been conducted in four cycles. Table 1 shows the mating plan for cycles I, II, III, and IV.

Semen from the same Hereford and Angus bulls has been used throughout to produce control Hereford-Angus (original HAx, sires born 1968 - 70) reciprocal crosses in each cycle. In cycle IV, new samples of Hereford and Angus (current HAx, sires born 1982 - 84) bulls were added to evaluate genetic trends within these breeds.

Influence of laser fusion with additional doping on structure, microhardness, wear resistance for adhesive coatings of Fe–B–Cr–Si system has been studied in the paper. In order {{to solve a problem}} for selection of optimal qualitative and subsequently quantitative composition of a multi-component coating a mathematical modeling method using Scheffe’s simplex lattices has been used in the paper. Similar tendency for measuring micro-structure of all adhesive coatings fused by laser beams has been established in the paper. Increase in beam speed has caused the following microstructure changes: cast equilibrium, dendrite, supersaturated boride, carbide and boride. Response surface models have been found and they provide the possibility to assess <b>influence</b> <b>quantity</b> of laser processing parameters on microhardness of adhesive coatings obtained by laser doping and intensity of their wear under various conditions for all investigated compositions. It has been ascertained that there is no strict correlation between hardness and intensity of coating wear after laser doping used for adhesive coatings. This testifies to the fact that hardening has taken place not only due to an increase of carbide-boride phase, but also due to matrix hardening. In addition, a regression model for coating composition effect on tribological characteristics of the adhesive coatings has revealed that an optimal composition of a multicomponent coating ensuring maximum wear resistance of coatings constitutes B 4 C is 2 / 3 and 1 / 3 TaB. It has been determined that hardening of the adhesive coating after laser doping while using multicomponent coating occurs not only due to increase of carbide-boridnoy phase, but also due to matrix hardening. </p...|$|E
40|$|Flood {{simulation}} models {{that have been}} developed in these decades are mostly influenced by local factors. Building a good flood model begins with determining the amount of rainfall that is influenced by local meteorology; and this model can estimate the rainfall pattern in the next catchment area, in which the runoff will flow to the ocean. However, most of the developed models are not capable of merging the whole hydrologic cycle, where the models should incorporate rainfall models with meteorological parameters. This step is very important as to first, project the amount of rainfall in a particular catchment area, considering the overall hydrologic model and second, to identify the areas with flood risks, considering the tidal effect. In order to fix the shortcoming, this study introduces a rainfall model that has been developed using selected rainfall parameters with the aim to recognize rainfall depth in a catchment area. In order to examine its ability, the rainfall model will be integrated with selected hydrologic models after the development phase. The result will <b>influence</b> <b>quantity</b> of flood in the catchment area, if a flood simulation model that considers every factor in hydrologic cycle were to be developed. This study proposes a rainfall model that utilizes the amount of rainfall, temperature, humidity and pressure records taken from selected stations in Peninsular Malaysia and they are analyzed using SPSS multiple regression model. The analysis shows that the selected meteorological parameters influence the rainfall development. As a result, the rainfall model developed for Senai proves that it can be used in Kota Tinggi catchment area within the limit boundaries, as the two stations are close from one another. Then, the amounts of rainfall at the Senai and Kota Tinggi stations are compared and the calibration analysis shows that the proposed rainfall model can be used in both areas. Kota Tinggi, Johor is chosen as the study area because of its flood records in 2006 and 2007. The amount of rainfall collected from selected stations in Kota Tinggi catchment has been processed using hydrologic model, HEC-HMS to identify the ability of Kota Tinggi as a catchment area in order to accommodate a huge amount of runoff that can cause flooding. During calibration process, the tests demonstrate that the simulation data and the data from previous floods are almost similar. This result suggests that the damaging floods in 2006 and 2007 were caused by Sungai Johor’s incapability to accommodate the increased amount of rainfall and tidal effect at that time. In addition, flood inundation model is then developed for Kota Tinggi’s catchment area, which includes Sungai Johor and the lowland areas in Kota Tinggi, using InfoWork RS and SURF 7. The flood inundation model integrated with hydrologic and rainfall models produce data that resembles the data collected during flooding. In conclusion, the calibration analysis and validation for each suggested model show that the combination of rainfall, hydrologic and {{simulation models}} enhance the overall result and could be developed using selected parameters for each catchment area of interest...|$|E
40|$|Concern over {{flooding}} along {{rivers in}} the Prairie Pothole Region has stimulated {{interest in developing}} spatially distributed hydrologic models to simulate the effects of wet¬land water storage on peak river flows. Such models require spatial data on the storage volume and interception area of existing and restorable wetlands in the watershed of interest. In most cases, information on these model inputs is lacking because resolution of existing topographic maps is inadequate to estimate volume and areas of existing and restorable wetlands. Consequently, most studies have relied on wetland area to volume or interception area relationships to estimate wetland basin storage characteristics by using available surface area data obtained as a product from remotely sensed data (e. g., National Wetlands Inventory). Though application of areal input data to estimate volume and interception areas is widely used, {{a drawback is that}} there is little information available to provide guidance regarding the application, limita¬tions, and biases associated with such approaches. Another limitation of previous modeling efforts is that water stored by wetlands within a watershed is treated as a simple lump storage component that is filled prior to routing overflow to a pour point or gaging station. This approach does not account for dynamic wetland processes that influence water stored in prairie wetlands. Further, most models have not considered the influence of human-induced hydrologic changes, such as land use, that greatly <b>influence</b> <b>quantity</b> of surface water inputs and, ultimately, the rate that a wetland basin fills and spills. The goals of this study were to (1) develop and improve methodologies for estimating and spatially depicting wet-land storage volumes and interceptions areas and (2) develop models and approaches for estimating/simulating the water storage capacity of potentially restorable and existing wetlands under various restoration, land use, and climatic scenarios. To address these goals, we developed models and approaches to spatially represent storage volumes and interception areas of existing and potentially restorable wetlands in the upper Mustinka subbasin within Grant County, Minn. We then developed and applied a model to simulate wetland water storage increases that would result from restoring 25 and 50 percent of the farmed and drained wetlands in the upper Mustinka subbasin. The model simulations were performed during the growing season (May–October) for relatively wet (1993; 0. 67 m of precipitation) and dry (1987; 0. 32 m of precipitation) years. Results from the simulations indicated that the 25 percent restoration scenario would increase water storage by 27 – 32 percent and that a 50 percent scenario would increase storage by 53 – 63 percent. Additionally, we estimated that wetlands in the subbasin have potential to store 11. 57 – 20. 98 percent of the total precipitation that fell over the entire subbasin area (52, 758 ha). Our simulation results indicated that there is considerable potential to enhance water storage in the subbasin; however, evaluation and calibration of the model is necessary before simulation results can be applied to management and planning decisions. In this report we present guidance for the development and application of models (e. g., surface area-volume predictive models, hydrology simulation model) to simulate wetland water storage to provide a basis from which to understand and predict the effects of natural or human-induced hydrologic alterations. In developing these approaches, we tried to use simple and widely available input data to simulate wetland hydrology and predict wetland water storage for a specific precipitation event or a series of events. Further, the hydrol¬ogy simulation model accounted for land use and soil type, which influence surface water inputs to wetlands. Although information presented in this report is specific to the Mustinka subbasin, the approaches and methods developed should be applicable to other regions in the Prairie Pothole Region...|$|E

40|$|Characteristics of the empirically {{developed}} Rockwell {{hardness test}} {{make it difficult}} to determine measurement uncertainty using methods based on mathematical models describing the relationship between the measurand and the <b>influence</b> <b>quantities.</b> An empirical approach to determining Rockwell hardness uncertainty has been developed, which provides a method based on the familiar procedures and practices of Rockwell hardness testing laboratories. The approach views the hardness machine and indenter as a single measuring device, and considers uncertainties associated with the machine repeatability and the usage of the machine over time with varying environmental conditions and with different operators. The approach also considers the measurement bias of the Rockwell hardness machine as compared to reference standards. 1...|$|R
