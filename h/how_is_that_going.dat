Discussing Tim's reason behind his actions, Duttine said: [...] "She was getting a bit judgmental about Tim’s opinion of Maddie, and she wasn’t very sympathetic about Maddie’s situation with Ben. Plus, she was being a bit snobby about his window cleaning job. She lost her sense of humour, and I think when Tim tried to lighten the mood, it didn’t go down very well. He just thought she was being too much of a nightmare and bailed out. For Tim, it’s all about having an easy life and not wanting too much conflict or confrontation." [...] They quickly reunited and when Sally spots Tim in a jewellers, she jumps to the conclusion he is going to propose. This makes Tim consider proposing to Sally. Talking to Lynn Connolly of Unreality TV, Duttine said: [...] "He goes in there to buy Faye a watch, but then Sally jumps to the conclusion that he’s going to propose to her. He then goes to buy a ring with the intention of proposing to Sally because he feels it’s what she wants, not because he wants it. So I guess he does love her, and he’s putting her first and trying to please her." [...] Duttine continued to say how after Tim proposes, they discuss their relationship and realise neither of them want to get married, before revealing he [...] "un-proposes" [...] to Sally in the Rovers Return Inn. Duttine said he thought this was [...] "sweet". Duttine also went on to say how he felt Tim and Sally were a [...] "good, fun couple". In May 2015, Duttine and Dynevor discussed Tim and Sally's relationship with Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on ITV daytime programme, This Morning, with Dynevor saying how she initially thought Tim and Sally would not go well as a couple: [...] "I was like, 'Tim Metcalfe and Sally Webster - <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>going</b> to work?' but as soon as they put us together and we got the script and starting working together we found things hilariously funny." [...] Duttine commented that Tim is [...] "just pleased to be here and glad somebody will have him." [...] and Dynevor agreed, saying that Sally [...] "feels the same - she’s just glad she has a boyfriend!" ...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{describing}} older persons' experiences of outdoor environments at nursing homes in Sweden {{in terms of}} what factors are important and in what way they are important. Twelve residents and seven next of kin from three nursing homes participated in 16 interviews. Two main themes were identified. The first theme, access to nature and surrounding life, describes the outdoor environment as a means for change and as promoting a feeling of freedom. This theme calls for an inspiring design. The second theme, being comfortable in the outdoor environment, describes <b>how</b> important it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>going</b> outdoors can <b>be</b> something easy and natural, and it calls for a comfortable design. The results are intended to facilitate practical knowledge <b>that</b> <b>is</b> useful to planners, decision-makers and care workers striving to create attractive and useable environments <b>that</b> <b>are</b> part of the daily life of nursing home residents. The themes also exemplify how the outdoor environment at nursing homes can serve as a resource in promoting restoration, a feeling of being at home and positive development late in life.

40|$|This {{essay is}} about the European union freetrade treaty negations with Mercosur. I have in this essay used a {{qualitative}} content analysis, to study from the EU perspective the reasons to why, the EU and Mercosur suspended the free trade treaty negations 2004, and after several years resumed the negotiations again in 2010. The {{purpose of this study}} is to gain a deeper understanding from the EU perspective of why free trade negotiations were suspended and then resumed. In order to achieve a deeper understanding of this event, I have applied neorealism and neoliberalism on the explicit statements and the implied actions, as these theories may provide different explanatory power of implied causes of negotiations. I have come to the conclusion that the theoretical perspectives can indeed explain explicit statements and implicit actions for suspended and resumed negotiations with Mercosur. The implicit reasons for suspended negotiations <b>are</b> among others <b>that</b> the EU has an egoist thinking concerning a free trade treaty. The EU wish to gain more benefits then Mecosur with a free trade treaty, which lead to Mercosur wanted to suspend the negotiations. Another implicit reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the EU <b>was</b> thinking entirely on <b>how</b> much <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to gain in relation mercosur, because of this kind of thinking, the EU probably realized <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to loose on a treaty. The implicit reasons for resumed negotiations are among others <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the EU genuinely wants to collaborate with Mercosur as much as they can with the purpose to gain together as much as possible. Other implicit reason is mutual dependence, which means that the EU needs Mercosur and vice versa to strengthen the global economy, and to give job opportunities and growth on both sides. Another implicit reason to resume the negotiations again <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the EU has grown stronger as an economic block, because of this, the EU has greater advantage of their demands with Mercosur. Further more, this essay surely point out that the EU has a lot of difficulties to come up with an agreement with Mercosur. But hopefully the EU can in the nearest future reach a free trade treaty with Mercosur...|$|R
