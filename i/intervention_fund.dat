40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the diversity within a higher education system and five key factors, namely: the environment, policy <b>intervention,</b> <b>funding,</b> competition and co-operation, and ranking. The exploration is based {{on the extent to which}} higher education systems, particularly those of Australia and New Zealand, have accommodated distinctive forms of higher education institutions characterised by the older traditional university at one extreme, and the newer university of technology at the other. Twelve interdependent propositions on diversity are proposed and discussed. These propositions indicate the ways in which each of the five key factors may influence institutional diversity or convergence. In the majority of circumstances, the convergent tendencies of institutions will predominate unless very specific environmental and economic conditions prevail, and/or specific directed policy is implemented. ...|$|R

40|$|Dissertation (Ed. D., Educational Leadership) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Like {{many states}} in the nation, California has {{struggled}} with preparing more high school graduates to be college- or career-ready for post-secondary opportunities in the 21 st-century. David Conley (2005) indicated that students are college-ready when {{they are able to}} successfully meet the requirements of entry-level college courses. ACT (2006) describes career-ready as being able to enter a job or training program likely to offer both a wage that can support a small family and has the potential for career advancement. While historically high school students have chosen a course of study that either prepares them for college eligibility or a vocation, educators and political and business leaders are now claiming that the skills and knowledge needed for college or a 21 st-century career are virtually the same. This study explored how large, low-performing, California high schools that received Immediate Intervention/Underperforming School Program funds in the early 2000 s prepared high school graduates to be college- or career-ready. This study analyzed the A-G completion rates of 32 schools that received California <b>intervention</b> <b>funds</b> in the early 2000 s and compared the results to 32 similar schools that did not receive <b>intervention</b> <b>funds.</b> The results demonstrated a pattern of increased A-G completion rates for the intervention schools when compared to the 2001 base year and a decrease in A-G completion rates for the comparison schools when compared to the 2001 base year. The intervention schools had {{a significant increase in the}} A-G completion rates when comparing 2005 to 2001. The significant increase was also true for Latino American students in intervention schools in 2005. There were no significant changes for African American students in intervention schools.
