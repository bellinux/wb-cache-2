40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{the nature and}} origin of subsurface sediment mobilization processes in deep marine clay-rich environments. In the studied area of the southern Barbados accretionary prism, new geophysical acquisitions have emphasized the spectacular widespread development of mud volcanoes that are well-developed along ramp anticlines and along sigmoidal rises with trends that are oblique to the axes of the main folds of the accretionary wedge. On some active mud volcanoes, heat-flow measurements show high positive anomalies related to high fluxes of mud transfer. The mobilized solid fraction expelled by the mud volcanoes does not originate from a unique source bed but from various formations pierced by the mud conduits and {{is driven by the}} water phase. The area studied also exhibits trends of structures corresponding to sub-circular massive local uplifts of deformed but well-preserved stratified sediments (turbidites and hemipelagics). No piercing shale diapirs have been encountered in this area. Some of these local uplift structures are complicated by the development of collapses, calderas, and superimposed mud volcanoes. Mud volcanism corresponds fundamentally to fluid <b>displacement</b> (<b>water</b> and gas), whereas massive sedimentary uplift corresponds to large vertical displacements of stratified solid levels but for which the deep cause could be partly the intrusion of mud plugs. Both are dynamic phenomena controlled by the development of overpressure at depth, contributing to sedimentary mobilizations...|$|E

Three {{tests were conducted}} at each of two locations along the fault, each location having a different total <b>displacement.</b> <b>Water</b> was injected in the footwall, hanging wall, and fault core and pressure changes were monitored in isolated intervals in the adjoining wells. Response curves were analyzed using the type curves developed by Hsieh and Neuman, and Theis, in order to evaluate the hydraulic properties of the fault and its associated damage zone. The tests were not quantitatively interpretable. Response curves were a poor match for Hsieh type curves and failed to give a positive definite hydraulic conductivity tensor. Theis analysis showed transmissivity varied over four orders of magnitude. The fault was both a barrier to and a conduit for fluid flow, indicating it was both heterogeneous and anisotropic with regard to flow. No correlation was seen between the fault displacement and the hydraulic properties of the fault. The lack of consistent results indicates a high variability in the hydraulic properties of the fault, possibility resulting from changes in fault core thickness and slip surface density over small distances.

We solve moment equations derived from a stochastic mathematical statement of immiscible nonlinear two-phase flow in heterogeneous reservoirs. Our stochastic approach {{is different from the}} Monte Carlo approach. In the Monte Carlo approach, the prediction uncertainty is obtained through a statistical postprocessing of flow simulations, one for each {{of a large number of}} equiprobable realizations of the reservoir description. We treat permeability as a random space function. In turn, saturation and flow velocity are random fields. We operate in a Lagrangian framework to deal with the transport problem. That is, we transform to a coordinate system attached to streamlines �time, travel time, and transverse displacements�. We retain the normal Eulerian �space and time � framework for the total velocity, which we take to be dominated by the heterogeneity of the reservoir. We derive and solve expressions for the first �mean � and second �variance� moments of the quantities of interest. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to complex flow geometry. Closed outer boundaries and converging/diverging flows due to the presence of sources/sinks require special mathematical and numerical treatments. General expressions for the moments of total velocity, travel time, transverse <b>displacement,</b> <b>water</b> saturation, production rate, and cumulative recovery are presented and analyzed. A detailed comparison of the moment solution approach with high-resolution Monte Carlo simulations for a variety of two-dimensional problems is presented.

40|$|The studied area {{is located}} in the extreme part of Algeria. It is limited to the north by the Mediterranean Sea and the desert in the south. This {{position}} confers a variation of the climatic mode, a Mediterranean climate in the north and arid in the south, resulting in a very important fall of precipitation, ranging from 1200 mm/year in the north, to 300 mm/year in the south. The hydrographic network is very dense; very important wadis (Seybouse, Mellague, Medjerda, Kebir-Are, Kebir-West) cross this area, which implies important contributions (solid and liquid). Water of aquifers is often fed by these rivers. During its <b>displacement</b> <b>water</b> acquires a certain mineralization. The studies carried out showed that this mineralization increased during recent years, thus translating the influence of the climatic factors on water quality. To explain the origin of this salinity we were interested in the climatic variations and particularly in dryness which affected the area in recent years, due to a considerable fall in the infiltrations being translated in the north by an imbalance of the interface of fresh water and salted water, generating a salinity of water. In the south the dryness accelerated water salinity. To highlight this impact several approaches were used: Statistical tool using the PCA, gives an outline on the elements at the origin of observed salinity; STUYFZAND method, based primarily on chlorides, can determine various classes of salinity; and the thermodynamic tool shows the influence of certain minerals on water salinity. The compilation of all the results enables us to conclude that the observed salinity in various zones remains influenced by the dryness...|$|E

Water in varying quantities is always produced along with oil, and has to be separated from the oil. The quantity of “produced water” generally increases substantially with the age of the oil field. Produced water handling tactic depends on the composition of produced water, location, quantity and the availability of resources. This thesis describes practical, economical, technological and environmental aspects of produced water management, an incorporated part of the oilfield development plan. The water can either be injected into the formations or treated. Advantages and disadvantages of different options for produced water minimizing technologies are discussed.

After treatment it, however, still contains traces of oil and chemicals.

40|$|In {{the present}} review, signal-processing {{capabilities}} of the canal lateral line organ imposed by its peripheral architecture are quantified {{in terms of a}} limited set of measurable physical parameters. It is demonstrated that cupulae in the lateral line canal organ can only partly be described as canal fluid velocity detectors. Deviation from velocity detection may result from resonance, and can be characterized by {{the extent to which a}} single dimensionless resonance number, N (r), exceeds 1. This number depends on four physical parameters: it is proportional to cupular size, cupular sliding stiffness and canal fluid density, and inversely proportional to the square of fluid viscosity. Situated in a canal, a cupula may benefit from its resonance by compensating for the limited frequency range of water motion that is efficiently transferred into the lateral line canal. The peripheral transfer of hydrodynamic signals, via canal and cupula, leads to a nearly constant sensitivity to outside water acceleration in a bandwidth that ranges from d. c. to a cut-off frequency of up to several hundreds of Hertz, significantly exceeding the cut-off frequency of the lateral line canal. Threshold values of hydrodynamic detection by the canal lateral line organ are derived in terms of water <b>displacement,</b> <b>water</b> velocity, water acceleration and water pressure gradients and are shown to be close to the detection limits imposed by hair cell mechano-transduction in combination with the physical constraints of peripheral lateral line signal transfer. The notion that the combination of canal- and cupular hydrodynamics effectively provides the lateral line canal organ with a constant sensitivity to water acceleration at low frequencies so that it consequently functions as a low-pass detector of pressure gradients, supports the appropriateness of describing it as a sense organ that "feels at a distance" (Dijkgraaf in Biol Rev 38 : 51 - 105, 1963) ...|$|E
