50|$|There is no {{designated}} type locality for the group. It {{was named}} for exposures in the San Rafael Swell in Emery County, Utah by Gilluly and Reeside in 1928. That same year they divided the group into (ascending): Carmel Formation, Entrada Sandstone (new), Curtis Formation (new), and Summerville Formation (new). Areal extent limits were established by Gregory and Moore in 1931. Smith in 1954 revised and divided the group into Entrada, Todilto, and Thoreau (new) <b>formations</b> <b>in</b> the San Juan Basin. In 1959 another revision, this time by Griggs and Read, divided it into Entrada and Bell Ranch (new) <b>formations</b> <b>in</b> the Palo Duro Basin and Sierra Grande Uplift. The Carmel-Navajo contact was revised by Wright and others in 1962 and the Carmel-Entrada contact was revised by Phoenix in 1963. Thompson and Stokes created an overview and named the Henrieville Sandstone in 1970. The Temple Cap Sandstone was revised and the Page Sandstone added (new) by Peterson and Pipiringos in 1979. A revision by O'Sullivan in 1980 divided the group into Carmel, Entrada, and Wanakah <b>formations</b> <b>in</b> Paradox Basin. O'Sullivan revised the upper contact in 1984. In 1988 Peterson revised earlier work and divided the group into Page, Carmel, and Entrada <b>formations</b> <b>in</b> the Black Mesa Basin; divided it into Page, Carmel, Entrada and Romana (new) <b>formations</b> <b>in</b> the Plateau sedimentary province; and divided it into Page, Carmel, Entrada, Curtis, and Summerville <b>formations</b> <b>in</b> Paradox Basin. Condon in 1989 revised the group in San Juan Basin and divided it into Entrada and Wanakah <b>formations</b> <b>in</b> southeastern area; divided it into Entrada, Wanakah, and Cow Springs <b>formations</b> <b>in</b> south-central area; and divided it into Entrada and Cow Springs Sandstones in southwestern area.|$|R

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of known Tarbosaurus fossils were recovered from the Nemegt <b>Formation</b> <b>in</b> the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of}} the Late Cretaceous about 70 million years ago.

5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems {{are designed to}} be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements.

5|$|Despite these taxonomic changes, Indraloris {{remained}} {{known from}} only two specimens (the holotypes of Indraloris lulli and Sivanasua palaeindica) until 2005. Both of those specimens—an isolated first lower molar (m1) and a mandible (lower jaw) fragment with m1, respectively—come from Haritalyangar in the Nagri <b>Formation.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, however, American paleontologists Lawrence Flynn and Michèle Morgan described five teeth of Indraloris from fossil {{sites in the}} older Kamlial Formation as a second species in the genus, Indraloris kamlialensis. The species was named after the Kamlial <b>Formation.</b> <b>In</b> addition, they suggested that two lower jaw fragments from the Kamlial Formation represented a third, larger species of Indraloris.|$|E
5|$|Deuterium {{was also}} {{detected}} {{in many other}} hydrogen compounds in the comet.
