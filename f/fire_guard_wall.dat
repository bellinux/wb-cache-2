She hides the truth; she hides me, and lets the world believe I am dying of consumption; not a word about insanity, {{and no one knows}} the secret beyond ourselves, but doctor, nurse, and you. This is why I was not sent away, but for a year was shut up in that room yonder where the door is always locked. If you look in, you'll see barred windows, <b>guarded</b> <b>fire,</b> muffled <b>walls,</b> and other sights to chill your blood, when you {{remember}} all those dreadful things were meant for me." ...|$|R

The <b>fire</b> <b>guard</b> would watch the stoves to make sure that the barracks would not catch fire. Since open flames are not generally used to heat sleeping areas any longer, present-day <b>fire</b> <b>guard</b> during Basic Training is more an exercise in discipline than a practical necessity, although if the weather gets cold enough some groups conducting overnight outdoor training will still use a kerosene [...] "pot bellied" [...] stove which must be watched to prevent accidental fires.|$|R

50|$|After {{the start}} of the German {{occupation}} of Poland, the Warsaw <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> was officially nationalized by the Nazis. However, the unit remained largely independent and in December 1939 most of the firefighters joined a newly formed Skała resistance organization, with time incorporated into the Armia Krajowa. Most of the firefighters took part in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, where their experience and commitment proved vital in stiffening the resistance of the besieged city under constant bombardment. On an interesting note, one of the self-propelled pumps of the Warsaw <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> was used as a flamethrower during the heavy fights for the PAST building. The last commander of the Warsaw <b>Fire</b> <b>Guards</b> was Col. Adam Kalinowski. After the war the Allied-backed communist authorities of Poland did not re-create the Guards and instead formed a local branch of the state-owned firefighters unit.|$|R

50|$|The Warsaw Fire Brigade {{was created}} on December 23, 1834, by the Administrative Council of the Kingdom of Poland. It {{was to be}} modeled after a similar {{fire-fighting}} unit created in Saint Petersburg only a year earlier. On February 6 of the following year Lt. Colonel Jan Robosz became the first Fire Chief of <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> in Warsaw. The organization of the unit ended on January 1, 1836, and it began its duty. Initially named <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> in Warsaw (Straż Ogniowa w Warszawie), in 1841 it was renamed to Warsaw <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> (Warszawska Straż Ogniowa). The Guard was entitled with all maintenance duties in the city, including putting down fires and fire prevention, but also cleaning the chimneys and the streets. It was divided onto four departments, each of them responsible for a different borough of Warsaw. In 1851 an additional department was created for the borough of Mirów. In 1864 the Guards received the first steam engine-operated mobile pump, manufactured by a London-based F. Shand, Mason and Co. firm. The following year two additional vehicles arrived, thus making the Warsaw <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> one of the best-equipped fire units in continental Europe. The Guards also assisted {{in a number of}} experiments, among them in the tests of a carbonic acid fire extinguisher in 1869.|$|R

For sufficient lighting purpose, four high masts were fixed in the vicinity of lake. Two colored fountains of 15 feet and one white and fountain of 100 feet, as such total three floating fountains were set up in lake [...] The work of Immersion Ghat with three ramps on South side and <b>guard</b> <b>wall</b> of lake with sand beach on North side was also done in the same phase.|$|R

50|$|The Industrial Civil Defence Service was {{a similar}} {{organisation}} to the Civil Defence Corps, but separate from it. Every {{industrial or commercial}} undertaking which employed two hundred or more people could form a civil defence unit to protect its own property and staff. These units were organised {{in a similar way}} to the Civil Defence Corps, with Headquarters, Warden, Rescue, First Aid and <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> Sections. The <b>Fire</b> <b>Guard</b> Section manned <b>fire</b> points and smaller fire appliances. Each unit had its own control post, and groups of units could form a group control post. Group control posts and control posts in larger factories had the status of warden posts in their own right, whereas smaller units answered to their local Civil Defence Corps warden post.|$|R
