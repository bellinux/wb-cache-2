40|$|Part I of {{this work}} {{answered}} the following fundamental question: Under and only under what (n,k,d) values does proactively choosing the helper nodes improve the storage-bandwidth tradeoff of regenerating codes (RCs) ? A critical component of the achievability results in Part I is a low-complexity helper selection solution, termed the <b>family</b> <b>helper</b> selection (FHS) scheme. In Part I, FHS was proved to be optimal or weakly optimal (depending on the underlying scenario) {{based on the assumption}} that as long as the minimum min-cut value of FHS is no less than the file size, we can always find a distributed storage code that can reconstruct the original file. This work relaxes this assumption by providing an exact-repair code construction that attains the minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) point of FHS, previously calculated/predicted only by the min-cut analysis in Part I. As an outcome, for the MBR points, FHS is indeed optimal or weakly optimal under various scenarios. In addition to closing the loop of the graph-based study in Part I, the proposed construction can also be viewed as a generalization of the existing fractional repetition (FR) codes. FR codes are exact-repair codes that admit the highly-desirable repair-by-transfer property. However, the unique construction of FR codes limits its application to a restricted set of (n,k,d) system parameters. In contrast, our new construction, termed the generalized FR (GFR) codes, can be applied to arbitrary (n,k,d) values. Our GFR codes retain most of the practical benefits of FR codes, i. e., being exact-repair and being almost repairable-by-transfer.

40|$|Regenerating codes (RCs) can {{significantly}} reduce the repair-bandwidth of distributed storage networks. Initially, the analysis of RCs {{was based on the}} assumption that during the repair process, the newcomer does not distinguish (among all surviving nodes) which nodes to access, i. e., the newcomer is oblivious to the set of helpers being used. Such a scheme is termed the blind helper selection (BHS) scheme. Nonetheless, it is intuitive in practice that the newcomer should choose to access only those "good" helpers. In this two-part paper, a new characterization of the effect of choosing the helper nodes in terms of the storage-bandwidth tradeoff is given. Specifically, the answer to the following fundamental question is provided: Under what condition does proactively choosing the helper nodes improve the storage-bandwidth tradeoff? Through a graph-based analysis, this Part I paper answers this question by providing a necessary and sufficient condition under which optimally choosing good helpers strictly improves the storage-bandwidth tradeoff. A low-complexity helper selection solution, termed the <b>family</b> <b>helper</b> selection (FHS) scheme, is proposed and the corresponding storage/repair-bandwidth curve is characterized. This Part I paper also proves that under some design parameters, the FHS scheme is indeed optimal among all helper selection schemes. In the Part II paper, an explicit construction of an exact-repair code is proposed that achieves the minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) point of the FHS scheme. The new exact-repair code can be viewed as a generalization of the existing fractional repetition code.

40|$|In Southern European countries, much of women's work lies out of {{the realm}} of 'wage labour' in forms of work which include {{agricultural}} labour in family farms, homeworking, unpaid domestic and caring labour, <b>family</b> <b>helpers,</b> and/or informal work in tourism, industry, or personal services. The importance of these forms of work is very likely to increase and several regions in Southern Europe present 'ideal conditions' for their proliferation. The bulk of women's work cannot be adequately grasped by looking exclusively at employment categories of economic and statistical surveys. These relegate to 'nonwork' many forms of women's labour in society. The authors discuss these 'other' forms of labour, focusing mainly on three issues: (a) the meaning and content of work for women in Southern Europe; (b) the connotations associated with terms such as 'atypical', 'irregular', 'informal', and so on, usually used to describe such activities and forms of work; (c) the effects of women's overrepresentation in such forms of work on gender divisions and on their own work prospects. ...|$|R
40|$|Regenerating codes (RCs) are ingeniously {{designed}} {{codes that}} mitigate the repair-bandwidth problem of erasure codes (ECs) in distributed storage networks. The key features of RCs are: functional repair and partial information-exchange (β 3 ̆c α). Locally repairable codes (LRCs), {{on the other}} hand, were proposed recently to address the disk I/O overhead problem of distributed storage codes. LRCs are designed with a (usually small d 3 ̆c k) bounded number of helper nodes participating in repair. Most existing LRCs assume exact-repair and allow full exchange of the stored data (β = α) from the helper nodes. This means that they lack {{the features of the}} original RCs that may further reduce the repair-bandwidth. Motivated by the significant bandwidth reduction of RCs over ECs, in this thesis, the concept of “locally repairable regenerating codes (LRRCs) ” is introduced that simultaneously admits all three features: local repairability, partial information-exchange, and functional repair, and significant bandwidth reduction is observed. ^ Under the setting of LRRCs, this thesis answers the following fundamental question: under what condition does proactively choosing the helper nodes improve the storage-bandwidth tradeoff? Through a graph-based analysis, this thesis answers this question by providing a necessary and sufficient condition under which optimally choosing good helpers strictly improves the storage-bandwidth tradeoff. A low-complexity helper selection solution, termed the <b>family</b> <b>helper</b> selection (FHS) scheme, is proposed and the corresponding storage-bandwidth tradeoff is characterized. Moreover, an explicit construction of an exact-repair code is proposed that achieves the minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) point of the FHS scheme. The new exact-repair code {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of the existing fractional repetition codes. ^ Furthermore, one important issue that needs to be addressed by any code with local repair (including both LRCs and LRRCs) is that sometimes designated helper nodes may be temporarily unavailable, the result of multiple failures, degraded reads, or other network dynamics. This thesis extends its study of LRRCs to the scenario of node unavailability and proves, for the first time in the literature, that all existing methods of helper selection can sometimes be strictly repair-bandwidth suboptimal. For some scenarios, it is necessary to combine LRRCs with a new helper selection method, termed dynamic helper selection, to achieve optimal repair-bandwidth. ...|$|E

Though the Labour Force Survey, {{the main source of}} labour statistics, includes information on workforce above the age of 10 years, no study on {{the nature and extent of}} child labour between 10 – 14 years of age is available. Accordingly, this study, based on micro data of three labour force surveys from 1990 - 91 to 1992 - 93, has been carried out to fill this gap. The study indicates that the quantum of child labour age cohort of 10 – 14 years grew from 1. 8 million in 1990 - 91 to 2 million in 1992 - 93. The growth of girl workers is higher as compared to boys.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} aims {{to explore}} the supply and demand side determinant of child labour at macro, meso and micro level. At macro level it explores the effect of globalization (defined as openness to trade and inflow of foreign direct investment) and credit market imperfections on child labour. At meso level it explores the effect of labour market conditions on child labour. As the above two levels of analysis are mainly concerned with the demand for child labour, the micro level analysis explores the supply side determinant of child labour. At micro level this dissertation explores the effect of intrahousehold distribution of power on child related outcome. Specifically it explores the effect of mother’s decision making power on her child’s labour and schooling. The macro level analysis is based on cross country regression framework while meso and micro level analysis {{is based on the}} data from Pakistan. At macro level, this dissertation points out that trade openness and FDI inflow raise the standard of living in an economy thereby reducing child labour incidence. As the channel through which trade could affect child labour is by increasing income of the poor, credit market imperfection shows insignificant effect. At meso level, this dissertation points out that high adult wages in an area increase demand for child labour while presence of adult unemployed proportion in an area reduces demand for child labour. However, presence of unemployed adult in a house increases supply of child labour. Exports, on one hand, reduce supply of child labour by affecting the income of poor at macro level while on the other hand at meso level, subcontracting of production process to small informal sector increases demand for child labour. The informal sector being unprotected by law employs a high proportion of child labour. At micro level mother’s decision making power significantly decreases child labour supply and increases child schooling. The effect is significant in case of girls but not in case of boys. This study also shows that whether children work for generating income or as <b>family</b> <b>helpers,</b> mothers are equally concerned for their welfare.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{examines}} {{the difference between}} permanent and transitory residence {{in a nursing home}} with special emphasis {{on the extent to which}} the risk of a long nursing home stay is reduced by the availability of informal help in the community. DATA SOURCE. Secondary data were used, taken from the National Long-Term Care Surveys of 1982 and 1984. The 1982 NLTCS samples disabled elderly living in the community. For these community dwellers, the 1984 NLTCS provides information on continued residence in the community and on their nursing home episodes between 1982 and 1984. METHOD OF ANALYSIS. The analysis is based on estimates from a multinomial logit regression with three explicit categories: persons with at least one long nursing home stay (n = 292), persons with only short stays (n = 227), and persons who died without ever having had a nursing home stay (n = 945). The implicit category: persons living in the community in 1984 without having had any nursing home stay (n = 3, 368). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. This study demonstrates the systematic differences in the personal characteristics that predict the risk of long stays from those that predict short stays in a nursing home. Controlling for limitations in physical and cognitive functioning, the regression analysis shows that indicators of informal help in the community have a statistically significant and relatively large effect on the risk of long stays; but the effects of these indicators on the risk of short stays is numerically smaller and not statistically significant. Specifically, when the burden of caregiving is shared by a spouse and children, the risk of a long stay in a nursing home is reduced by 9. 3 percentage points; in contrast, the risk is increased by 18 percentage points for childless elders who are living alone and by 45. 8 percentage points for elders living with adults other than a spouse or children. CONCLUSION. The relatively strong effects of <b>family</b> <b>helpers</b> and living arrangements on the risk of long nursing home stays confirm the hypothesis that, after controlling for the effects of physical and cognitive functioning, adequate help in the community reduces the risk of permanent nursing home residence. But help in the community has no effect on the risk of short nursing home episodes because these episodes are likely to be extensions of acute hospital care. The findings provide essential information for designing a long-term care program because they suggest the magnitudes of the effects that such a program can have on reducing the risk of permanent nursing home residence...|$|R

40|$|Pakistan’s {{economy is}} facing the lowest female {{participation}} rates compared to the developed and other South Asian economies. Accordingly, there is an acute need for in-depth analysis {{of the role of}} women in Pakistan’s labour market. The thesis consists of three essays covering three important issues in the labour market of Pakistan. The first essay provides a comprehensive profile of labour market states of working and not working females and compares it with the male counterparts. The working and not-working groups are further enumerated into four categories each. Once these states had been defined, the demand and supply factors have been identified to capture the effect on the individual’s decision about labour market participation. Since, the dependent variable is discrete having four possible outcomes which are categorical, a Multinomial logit model is applied first by taking working states of females as the dependent variable against the explanatory variables and then considering not working states as an outcome. The same procedure is repeated for males. Given that the MNL model relies on the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) two tests of IIA Hausman-Mcfadden (HM) test and the Small-Hsiao (SH) test have been performed. The main findings show that age has a positive and significant impact on all the states of working males and females in labour market with the exception of men as unpaid <b>family</b> <b>helpers.</b> For females being married, having more than 2 children, ownership of the house, residence within a joint family or belonging to an urban area, reduces the likelihood to participate in the paid employment. Conversely, for married men, or those who own a house or live in an urban area there exists a higher probability to be involved in paid employment. Education has a significant higher probability for females to participate in all the working states of employment. The second essay explores the gender wage gap. A counterfactual decomposition approach of Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) is applied that divides the wage differential into explained and unexplained components. As the wage structure is mainly influenced by working individuals which might make a selective group leading to biased and inconsistent results. Therefore, the estimates from probit regression equations estimating the probability of paid employment are used to construct the Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR) to correct the selection bias in the monthly wage equations. Number of infants and children (aged 5 or below and 6 to 10) serve as main instruments to identify the selection equation. The empirical findings suggest the existence of the gender wage gap in Pakistan. Individual’s age, level of education, sectors, occupations and regions are the key determinants.

40|$|Purpose — The {{emergence}} of “interorganizational marketing” as {{a hot topic}} leads to one key question: can interorganizational governance mechanisms (socialization, incentives, and monitoring) offered by marketing theory be applied to China, an emerging economy characterized by the Chinese guanxi relationship? This paper finds {{that the answer is}} “yes” and develops a theoretical model to show such interactions. Design/methodology/approach — The paper applies interorganizational strategies to interpersonal relationships. Guanxi was categorized into three categories – <b>family</b> members, <b>helpers</b> and business partners – which meet each of the three governance mechanisms (in addition to favoring exchange as a special and typical Chinese governance mechanism) in the model. Findings — Through ex-post role activation, the paper argues that guanxi is a dynamic balance {{and the ways in which}} various governance mechanisms can set roles will lead to the roles either changing (reinforcement or dilution) or switching (helper to business partner, and vice versa). It seems futile to implement external governance mechanisms on family ties (the main category of guanxi) that have been firmly rooted in Chinese culture. On the other hand, applying the four mentioned governance mechanisms could reinforce, maintain, or dilute helper and business partner roles, or even make it possible to switch from one to another.

40|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) {{replicates}} its DNA {{exclusively by}} a leading-strand DNA replication mechanism and requires coinfection with a helper virus, such as adenovirus, {{to achieve a}} productive infection. In previous work, we described an in vitro AAV replication assay that required the AAV terminal repeats (the origins for DNA replication), the AAV Rep protein (the origin binding protein), and an adenovirus-infected crude extract. Fractionation of these crude extracts identified replication factor C (RFC), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and polymerase δ as cellular enzymes that were essential for AAV DNA replication in vitro. Here we identify the remaining factor that is necessary as the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, a cellular helicase complex that {{is believed to be}} the replicative helicase for eukaryotic chromosomes. Thus, polymerase δ, RFC, PCNA, and the MCM complex, along with the virally encoded Rep protein, constitute the minimal protein complexes required to reconstitute efficient AAV DNA replication in vitro. Interfering RNAs targeted to MCM and polymerase δ inhibited AAV DNA replication in vivo, suggesting that one or more components of the MCM complex and polymerase δ play an essential role in AAV DNA replication in vivo as well as in vitro. Our reconstituted in vitro DNA replication system is consistent with the current genetic information about AAV DNA replication. The use of highly conserved cellular replication enzymes may explain why AAV is capable of productive infection in a wide variety of species with several different <b>families</b> of <b>helper</b> viruses...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin 9 {{secreting}} TH 9 {{cells have}} been proposed as the latest addition to the <b>family</b> of T <b>helper</b> cell subsets. While {{a growing body of}} evidence from animal models points to important roles for these cells in allergic inflammation of the lung, autoinflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, and tumor immunity, their role in skin immunity and skin immunopathology remains poorly defined. Interestingly, studies of T helper cells from healthy humans suggest that TH 9 cells are predominantly skin-homing and skin-resident and that they are involved in protection against extracellular pathogens. Thus, TH 9 cells have entered the stage as potential mediators of cutaneous pathology. However, under which conditions and by which mechanisms these cells contribute to skin immunity and disease still has to be investigated. Here, we review our current understanding of TH 9 cells as skin-tropic T helper cells and their involvement in skin pathology. Further, we discuss open questions with regard to the intricate nature of interleukin 9 producing T helper cells...|$|R
40|$|This is the authors’ final, {{accepted}} and refereed manuscript to the articlePurpose — The emergence of “interorganizational marketing” as {{a hot topic}} leads to one key question: can interorganizational governance mechanisms (socialization, incentives, and monitoring) offered by marketing theory be applied to China, an emerging economy characterized by the Chinese guanxi relationship? This paper finds {{that the answer is}} “yes” and develops a theoretical model to show such interactions. Design/methodology/approach — The paper applies interorganizational strategies to interpersonal relationships. Guanxi was categorized into three categories – <b>family</b> members, <b>helpers</b> and business partners – which meet each of the three governance mechanisms (in addition to favoring exchange as a special and typical Chinese governance mechanism) in the model. Findings — Through ex-post role activation, the paper argues that guanxi is a dynamic balance {{and the ways in which}} various governance mechanisms can set roles will lead to the roles either changing (reinforcement or dilution) or switching (helper to business partner, and vice versa). It seems futile to implement external governance mechanisms on family ties (the main category of guanxi) that have been firmly rooted in Chinese culture. On the other hand, applying the four mentioned governance mechanisms could reinforce, maintain, or dilute helper and business partner roles, or even make it possible to switch from one to another. Originality/value — The paper proposes a new concept regarding relationship marketing, namely the application of governance mechanisms to interpersonal relationships, which provides people doing business in China with a new perspective for reference...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Chinese {{tradition}} of filial piety, which prioritized family-based {{care for the}} elderly, is transitioning and elders can no longer necessarily rely on their children. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify community support for the elderly, and analyze the factors that affect which model of old-age care elderly people dwelling in communities prefer. Methods We used the database “Health and Social Support of Elderly Population in Community”. Questionnaires were issued in 2013, covering 3 districts in Beijing. A group of 1036 people over 60  years in age were included in the study. The respondents’ profile variables were organized in Andersen’s Model and community healthcare resource factors were added. A multinomial logistic model was applied to analyze the factors associated with the desired aging care models. Results Cohabiting with children and relying on care from family was still the primary desired aging care model for seniors (78  %), followed by living in institutions (14. 8  %) and living at home independently while relying on community resources (7. 2  %). The regression result indicated that predisposing, enabling and community factors were significantly associated with the aging care model preference. Specifically, compared with those who preferred to cohabit with children, those having higher education, fewer available <b>family</b> and friend <b>helpers,</b> and shorter distance to healthcare center were more likely to prefer to live independently and rely on community support. And compared with choosing to live in institutions, those having fewer available <b>family</b> and friend <b>helpers</b> and those living alone were more likely to prefer to live independently and rely on community. Need factors (health and disability condition) were not significantly associated with desired aging care models, indicating that desired aging care models were passive choices resulted from the balancing of family and social caring resources. Conclusions In Beijing, China, aging care arrangement preference is the result of balancing family care resources, economic and social status, and the accessibility of community resources. Community facilities and services supporting elderly were found to be insufficient. For China’s future health system, efforts should be made to improve community capacity to provide integrated services to senior citizens...|$|R
