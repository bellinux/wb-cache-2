40|$|Materials {{of steam}} water cycles can suffer from {{corrosion}} induced by halide anions in feedwater. <b>Organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in feedwater can be degraded and release halide anions under high temperature and pressure. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to be able to measure the <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> concentration. Existing measurements including Adsorbable <b>Organic</b> <b>Halogens</b> and Gas Chromatography are either not convenient, affordable, accurate or reproducible enough at these very low concentrations, meaning a new method should be developed. In this research the option of destroying the organic compounds to release the halide anions and measure them with ion chromatography was studied. The question is, which {{is the best way to}} destroy the organic compounds and release the halides anions. Six <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> model <b>compounds</b> were tested: aliphatic and aromatic fluorine, chlorine and bromine containing compounds. Two main methods were studied: UV/vacuumUV (VUV) photolysis and wet chemical oxidation with K 2 S 2 O 8. There are three phases in the research: 1. Study different UV lamps and oxidants on the target compounds and find the optimal combinations. 2. Try different dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8 and find an optimum. 3. Test halide release of target compounds in power plant conditions. In the experiments, three kinds of lamps were applied: VUV, low pressure (LP) lamp and medium pressure (MP) lamp. H 2 O 2 and TiO 2 were used as a catalyst. Last but not least, wet chemical oxidation was tested, with varying dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8. The experiments were executed with both single compounds and mixed compounds. The results show that the organic fluorine is the hardest to degrade while organic bromine is the easiest. Aromatic compounds are easier to degrade than aliphatic compounds. This happens not only in AOP process, but also in power plant conditions. The recovery of bromide and chloride in most methods could reach 95 % while aliphatic fluorine could only reach at most 70 %. It can be concluded that MP/H 2 O 2 is the most effective method for degradation of <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds</b> since it requires less time for the reaction to be completed, but wet chemical oxidation also showed high recoveries for all halide anions. The advantage of wet chemical oxidation is simple equipment and universality. The method with the lowest degradation rate and recovery is UV/TiO 2.

Here, both the biological and photochemical production mechanisms are considered in a biogeochemical module that is coupled to a one-dimensional water column model for the eastern tropical Atlantic. The model is able to reproduce observed subsurface maxima of CH 3 I concentrations.

The system may be virtually configured with any desired chemical mechanism using a modified version of SPACK (Simplified Preprocessor for Atmospheric Chemical Kinetics). For initial and boundary conditions, the system is able to be nudged by large scale atmospheric-chemistry models analysis using a Newtonian relaxation scheme. Currently the system is able to assimilate MOCAGE (Meteo-France global chemistry model) fields.

EOX {{provides}} information on how halides can be extracted using a solvent while TOX provides information about the total organic halide content in the sample. This value {{can be used to}} estimate Basic oxygen demand (BOD) or chemical oxygen demand (COD), a key factor in estimating the required oxygen to burn the organic compounds to estimate the percentage of AOX’s and <b>Extractable</b> <b>organic</b> halides.|$|R
40|$|<b>Extractable</b> <b>organic</b> matter (EOM) {{fractions}} {{have been}} used to assess the capacity of soils to supply nitrogen (N), but their role in N mineralization and their potential to improve agricultural fertilizer management are still under debate. This paper shows evidence that the relationship between EOM and soil N supply is an indirect relationship reflecting the soils’ organic matter content. Data from 59 published experiments were re-analyzed using multivariate PLS modelling. Nitrogen mineralization was primarily related to the size of total and <b>extractable</b> <b>organic</b> matter fractions whereas variables reflecting soil texture and organic matter quality were less important. All EOM fractions reflected the soil organic matter content of the soil rather than a specific bioavailable fraction. There is strong need for research that explores the biochemical basis for relationships among total <b>organic</b> matter, <b>extractable</b> <b>organic</b> matter and soil N mineralization using mechanistic approaches...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{and discusses}} {{the research and}} {{results of the investigation}} of biosorptive removal of <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> from a Kraft mill wastewater. Wastewater from a lagoon treating Kraft mill wastewater was placed in contact with returned activated sludge (RAS) collected from a Tucson wastewater treatment plant. Removal of <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> was quantified as the difference in total <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> (TOX) level between samples containing wastewater and biomass and samples containing wastewater alone. Two molecular weight distributions were analyzed: total molecular weight and < 1000 molecular weight. Total organic carbon (TOC) levels for the total molecular weight fractions were monitored. The effects of pH, temperature, biomass viability and contact time on biosorptive capabilities were examined. Implications concerning lagoon operation are discussed. Improvements for future research in this area are included in this report...|$|R
30|$|The {{discussion}} about the determination of indicative or key parameters is an old one; which criteria should be chosen, however, is questionable. Conceivable would be, for example, selection according to functional group, the concentration that occurs in the environment, or the toxicity of each substance (which, however, with only few exceptions has not been assessed). In the meantime national and international research groups, as well as DIN, {{are working on the}} development of methods for the determination of cumulative parameters, e.g. similar to the AOX (Adsorbed <b>Organic</b> <b>Halogen)</b> method. In this sense, the EOF method (<b>Extractable</b> <b>Organic</b> Fluorine) aims at the cumulative determination of PFC in solid samples such as soil or sediments. The AOF method (Adsorbed Organic Fluorine), on the other hand, is used to detect organic fluorine compounds as cumulative parameters in aqueous samples. At present, it would appear that both EOF and AOF offer the possibility of establishing a cumulative parameter “total organic fluorine”. The question remains, however, how to evaluate the measurements obtained by these methods. For the environmental sector 5 there are, with only one exception, 6 no permissible limits or reference values for individual PFC or for cumulative parameters.|$|R
40|$|The brown {{macroalga}} Saccharina latissima (Linnaeus) C. E. Lane, C. Mayes, Druehl & G. W. Saunders (formerly Laminaria saccharina [L. ] Lamouroux) {{was exposed}} to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in the mW UV-A and mW UV-B range in the laboratory for up to 28 days. The release rates of volatile organohalogens, such as chloroform, bromoform, dibromomethane and methyl iodide, were determined. From these rates, the total emission of reactive <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> was calculated. The results revealed that exposure to UVR significantly affected the emission of reactive <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> by the macroalga under investigation. An increase in the release of reactive organic iodine was observed for the algal species. In contrast, for reactive organic bromine and reactive organic chlorine, a decrease in emission by the macroalga was observed. Apparently, the potential for increased levels of UVR resulting from further ongoing destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer may increase the importance of marine macroalgae in atmospheric reactions involving <b>organic</b> <b>halogens.</b> Original Publication: Frank Laturnus, Teresia Svensson and Christian Wiencke, Release of reactive <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> by the brown macroalga Saccharina latissima after exposure to ultraviolet radiation, 2010, Polar Research, (29), 3, 379 - 384.
