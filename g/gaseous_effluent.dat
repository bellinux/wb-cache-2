The initial fuel packages were either cooking oil or a single sofa; these were burned both alone, and in furnished surroundings. Experiments were performed at different ventilation conditions. Qualitative Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis found VOC/SVOC releases in the developing stages of the fires, and benzo(a) pyrene – the most carcinogenic PAH – was found in at least one sampling interval in the majority of fires. A number of phosphorus fire retardants were detected, in both the <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluent</b> and particulates, from fires where the initial fuel source was a sofa.

40|$|Background: Food-processing <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluents</b> {{are rich}} in {{flavoured}} volatile organic compounds (FVOCs). The discharge of these FVOCs is unwanted as they {{can contribute to the}} environmental olfactive pollution. Scope and approach: Their recovery would then enable their valuation through the strengthening of the organoleptic properties of the finished products or their use in other products, as well as reducing the pollution linked to their discharge. However, {{there are only a few}} documents in the literature concerning food aromas recovery from <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluents.</b> This paper reviews the used or potential technologies for the recovery of aromas from <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluents</b> in the food-processing industry. Key findings and conclusions: The technologies that are already applied in the food processing industry for aroma recovery from <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluents</b> are the vapour permeation and the condensation. The adsorption and the absorption are technologies used for scrubbing volatile organic compounds, which can be potentially used for gaseous aroma recovery. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Adsorption is the {{attraction}} of gas molecules {{to the surface of}} an activated solid. There are two classifications of adsorption: physical and chemical. At ordinary temperatures, adsorption is usually caused by molecular forces rather than by the formation of chemical bonds. In this type of adsorption, called physical adsorption, very little heat is evolved. If a chemical reaction takes place between the gas and the solid surface, the process is known as chemisorption. In chemisorption the reaction between surface and gas molecules occurs in a stoichiometric manner, and heat is liberated during the reaction. Chemisorption is used in the removal of UF 6 and HF from <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluent</b> streams. It is also used to remove oil mist from vacuum pumps operating upstream of <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluent</b> ventilation systems. Adsorbent materials are placed on stationary beds in chemical traps downstream of the various cold traps. These materials capture HF and the trace amounts of UF 6 that escape desublimation during feed purification or during venting of residual UF 6 contained in hoses and/or piping that is bled down before disconnection. The chemical traps are placed in series downstream of the cold traps in the exhaust streams to the GEVS and may include one or more of a series of two different types of chemical traps. Th...|$|E

Particles of cellulose ([similar] 300 μm) were directly impinged upon the hot, catalytic bed of Rh–Ce/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst on 1. 3 mm α-Al 2 O 3 spheres in the presence of O 2, N 2, and steam in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 500 – 1100 °C. Complete conversion to gases was observed for all experimental parameters including N 2 /O 2, S/C, the total flow rate of cellulose, and the fuel-to-oxygen ratio (C/O).

40|$|International audienceComposite {{materials}} {{are more and}} more used every day. In order to further enhance their attractive mechanical and physico chemical performances, the last generation of these materials largely makes use of nanomaterials. Various nanofillers are eligible for such a purpose, the best ones depending on the associated matrices. One favorite field of application of these nanomaterials is fire retardancy and fire behavior of nanocomposites. In the context of the ANR research project NanoFeu, various technical analyses have been performed [1]. One focuses on the characterization of the dispersion of nanofillers in the matrix; another deals with the characterization of the fire behavior of samples including the study of the composition of the <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluents,</b> the characterization of the emitted soot [2]. A third part of the work focused on molecular modeling of observed phenomena within the matrices. This paper focuses mainly on the combustion of nanocomposite samples under various ventilation conditions. Tests have been performed with the Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA). Samples are based on poly(methyl methacrylate); various nanofillers were used: carbon nanotubes, alumina and silica. Efficiency of fillers is compared to the classical ammonium polyphosphate in equal proportions.
