Four new code systems were packaged and added to the collection, an existing code package was extended with an additional <b>hardware</b> <b>version,</b> an existing <b>code</b> package was replaced with a newer version, and two existing code packages were updated or corrected. Three changes resulted from foreign contributions. CCC- 200 D/MCNP 3 A new personal computer version of this general purpose Monte Carlo neutron and gamma-ray transport code system was provided by Experimental and Mathematical Physics Consultants (EPMC), Gaithersburg, Maryland. This version, designated CCC- 200 D/MCNP 3, is based on the CCC- 200 C package contributed by EPMC. This new release was implemented on a DTK 80386 PC with an 80387 coprocessor both 20 MHz, an 8 Mbyte memory (4 Mbyte used as virtual disk), and a 128 Mbyte hard disk in four partitions (C through F). It runs under MS DOS 3. 3. The Lahey FORTRAN Compiler F 77 L-EM/ 32, Version 3. 00 was used.

40|$|The {{intended}} goal {{within the}} scope of this master´s thesis is to get acquainted with the product of EMONA INSTRUMENTS Company. There are two main concepts: the software version TutorTIMS – Advanced and the <b>hardware</b> <b>version</b> TIMS- 301. Both concepts were bought into the laboratory, where the following subjects are being lectured: “Access and transport networks” and “Telecommunication network services”. Three laboratory exercises were prepared for both software <b>version</b> and <b>hardware</b> <b>version.</b> Both versions are modular and all designed exercises support independent and creative approach of students. All exercises also consist of standard parts, which are the description of the exercise and exemplary protocol solution. The first exercise is called “amplitude modulation” and is designed as an introductory exercise. Next are a couple of exercises which are designed to be performed on one workplace at the same time. The first of them is focused on practical verification of facts from amplitude shift keying, the second one focuses on link codes. This couple of exercises is the best choice, considering the <b>hardware</b> <b>version</b> of TIMS- 301 and at the present time available modules in the lab. Software version is not limited in such way, but it was required to allow performing all of prepared exercises on both versions. Lastly there is a comparison between the software and <b>hardware</b> <b>version</b> and several options for hardware TIMS optimization...|$|R

30|$|Typically, {{not all the}} {{constraints}} are active at the same time, making λ a sparse vector.

30|$|In this {{research}} work, we design and develop two hardware versions: the register-based <b>hardware</b> <b>version</b> 1 (HW_v 1) and the on-chip BRAM-based <b>hardware</b> <b>version</b> 2 (HW_v 2). With HW_v 1, a customized and parallel processing architecture is introduced {{to perform the}} matrix computations in parallel by mostly utilizing registers to store the data/results. By employing a parallel processing architecture, we anticipate an enhancement of the speedup of the overall MPC algorithm. With HW_v 2, an optimized architecture is introduced to address certain issues that have arisen with HW_v 1. By employing on-chip BRAMs to store the data/results, we expect a reduction in overall area, since the registers and the associated interconnects (in HW_v 1) typically occupy large space on chip. Conversely, the existing on-chip BRAMs are dual-port; hence, these could potentially hinder parallel processing of computations.|$|R
