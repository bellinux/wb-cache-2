50|$|In {{its basic}} form, the ionocraft {{is able to}} produce forces great enough to lift about a gram of payload per watt, so its use is {{restricted}} to a tethered model.

Further study in <b>electrohydrodynamics,</b> however, show that different classes and construction methods of EHD thrusters and hybrid technology (mixture with lighter-than-air techniques), can achieve much higher payload or thrust-to-power ratios than those achieved with the simple lifter design. Practical limits can be worked out using well defined theory and calculations., Thus, a fully autonomous EHD thruster is theoretically possible.|$|E

Its use for propulsion was given serious thought by Major Alexander Prokofieff de Seversky who contributed much to its basic physics and construction variations in 1960.

40|$|<b>Electrohydrodynamics</b> (EHD) {{deals with}} the fluid motion induced by an {{electric}} field. This phenomenon originally developed in physical science, and engineering is currently experiencing a renaissance in microfluidics. Investigations by Taylor on Gilbert 2 ̆ 7 s theory proposed in 1600 have evolved to include multiple contributions including the promising effects arising from electric field interactions with cells and particles to influence their behaviour on electrode surfaces. Theoretical modelling of electric fields in microsystems {{and the ability to}} determine shear forces have certainly reached an advanced state. The ability to deftly manipulate microscopic fluid flow in bulk fluid and at solid/liquid interfaces has enabled the controlled assembly, coagulation, or removal of microstructures, nanostructures, cells, and molecules on surfaces. Furthermore, the ability of <b>electrohydrodynamics</b> to generate fluid flow using surface shear forces generated within nanometers from the surface and their application in bioassays has led to recent advancements in biomolecule, vesicle and cellular detection across different length scales. With the integration of Alternating Current <b>Electrohydrodynamics</b> (AC-EHD) in cellular and molecular assays proving to be highly fruitful, challenges still remain with respect to understanding the discrepancies between each of the associated ac-induced fluid flow phenomena, extending their utility towards clinical diagnostic development, and utilising them in tandem as a standard tool for disease monitoring. In this regard, this article will review the history of <b>electrohydrodynamics,</b> followed by some of the recent developments in the field including a new dimension of <b>electrohydrodynamics</b> that {{deals with the}} utilization of surface shear forces for the manipulation of biological cells or molecules on electrode surfaces. Recent advances and challenges in the use of electrohydrodynamic forces such as dielectrophoresis and ac electrosmosis for the detection of biological analytes are also reviewed.

Challenges and future directions are discussed from the perspective of both fundamental understanding and potential applications of these nanoscaled shear forces in diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrons}} and phonons in metal films after ultra-short pulse laser heating are in highly non-equilibrium states not only between the electron sub-system and the phonon sub-system but also within the electron sub-system. An <b>electrohydrodynamics</b> model {{consisting of the}} balance equations of electron density, energy density of electrons, and energy density of phonons {{is derived from the}} coupled non-equilibrium electron and phonon Boltzmann transport equations to study the nonlinear transport phenomena, such as the electron density fluctuation and the transient electrical current in metal films, after ultra-short pulse laser heating. The time-dependent temperature distributions is calculated by the coupled electron and phonon Boltzmann transport equations, the <b>electrohydrodynamics</b> model derived in this work, and the two-temperature model for different laser pulse durations, film thicknesses, and laser fluences. We find that the two-temperature model overestimates the electron temperature at the frontsurface of the film and underestimates the damage threshold when the nonlinear thermal transport of electrons is important. The <b>electrohydrodynamics</b> model proposedin this work could be a more accurate prediction tool to study the non-equilibrium electron phonon transport process than the two-temperature model and {{it is much easier to}} be solved than the coupled electron and phonon Boltzmann transport equations.
