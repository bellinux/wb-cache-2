Finally, for compact disc release, Start of Track, End of Track, and Indexes are defined for disc navigation. Subsequently, it is rendered either to a physical medium, such as a CD-R or DVD-R, or to computer files, such as a Disc <b>Description</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>DDP)</b> file set or an ISO file. The specific medium varies, depending on the intended release format of the final product.
