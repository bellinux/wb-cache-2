5|$|Comets 42P/Neujmin and 53P/Van Biesbroeck {{appear to}} be {{fragments}} of a parent comet. Numerical integrations <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> both comets had a rather close approach to Jupiter in January 1850, and that, before 1850, the two orbits were nearly identical.|$|E
5|$|Family Daubentoniidae {{contains}} only one surviving species, of the aye-aye. Wide-ranging genetic studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> it {{separated from the}} ancestral lemurs long before any other branch of the modern Lemuriformes.|$|E
5|$|For {{antioxidant}} therapy, studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> reactive oxidative species lead to {{the formation}} of multiple sclerosis lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects.

5|$|Genetic {{recombination}} is {{the process}} by which a strand of DNA is broken and then joined {{to the end of a}} different DNA molecule. This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> recombination has been rampant in the species studied. Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses.|$|E

5|$|Molecular phylogenetics <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> C.cirrhata forms a {{monophyletic}} clade {{with the}} remaining two species of Collybia.

There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{case studies}} of brain damage <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> damage to {{areas of the brain}} (such as the {{anterior}} prefrontal cortex) results in the reduction or elimination of inhibitions, with a corresponding radical change in behaviour.

5|$|Sponges were {{traditionally}} {{distributed in}} three classes: calcareous sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the Homoscleromorpha, a group thought {{to belong to}} the Demospongiae, is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of sponges.|$|E
5|$|Studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> SCSFLS runs in {{families}} {{and it is}} suspected that genetic similarity {{in families}} includes weakness in the dura mater, which leads to SCSFLS.
