5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if <b>it</b> <b>sells</b> its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E
