40|$|Historic film genre serves {{here as a}} model {{example of}} a {{demanding}} film project in contemporary European cinematography. We want to explore the problems of development and financing of historic films. The basis of the research {{is the idea that}} historic films are mostly producer projects because of their commercial potential. The genre of historic film is explained here from two different points of view: Film theory and film history. The concept of <b>European</b> <b>cinematographic</b> <b>work</b> and the ways of financing European co-production films are shortly presented. Further we describe what a producer follows and influences during his work on a historic film. The gained knowledge is then applied on five case studies. Reflections of the film producers form a part of these studies. The result of the research is the statement that the quality and artistic value of a film go across the film genres just as the producer's or the director's approach to a film project do. To shoot arthouse oriented historic films is more risky from the commercial point of view. At the same time only in this way the film will be unique, can survive for decades and can really be successful all over the world...|$|E
