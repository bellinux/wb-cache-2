2500|$|In May 2016, three IMF economists {{published}} {{new research}} findings and criticized {{some of the}} fundamental assumptions of the neoliberal doctrine. They warned that austerity policies could {{do more harm than}} good because of their social costs – increased inequality, which [...] "in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth". Speaking of capital account liberalization, that is unrestricted movement of capital across international borders ("openness") and fiscal consolidation, meaning policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels ("austerity"), they wrote: [...] "Since both openness and austerity are associated with increasing income inequality, this <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> sets up an adverse feedback loop. The increase in inequality engendered by financial openness and austerity might itself undercut growth, the very thing that the neoliberal agenda is intent on boosting. There is now strong evidence that inequality can significantly lower both the level and the durability of growth". [...] Additionally, they recommended actively combating inequality by redistributing wealth via taxes and government spending, noting [...] "the evidence of the economic damage from inequality suggests that policymakers should be more open to redistribution than they are" [...] and [...] "the fear that such policies will themselves necessarily hurt growth is unfounded".|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} 150 years, many economists have assumed public {{subsidies}} {{on higher education}} to have a regressive <b>distributional</b> <b>effect.</b> The German debate on this issue is kept alive by many empirical studies. Most of them confirm the thesis of a p̈erverse distribution of income(̈Milton Friedman). Nevertheless, a methodological analysis of these studies unveils some problems. As the following paper tries to show, the empirical studies on the <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of public higher education funding {{are not able to}} confirm the prima-facia plausibility of the thesis mentioned above. Therefore, an alternative approach to ascertaining the incidence in the long run of public subsidies on higher education seems to be necessary. higher education funding, tax incidence, redistribution of income...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} on the <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of public higher education through analysis of a cross-sectional view of West Germany in 1997. In contrast to a widely held hypothesis in economics, our findings do not show evidence for a regressive effect. The use of a net-transfer calculation clearly indicates a progressive <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of the benefits from subsidization at least when viewed in the cross-sectional perspective. The decisive factors are (1) the general social stratification within and among the adjusted income deciles and (2) the incidence of the granted benefits. Complementary to the existing widespread literature in this field, we propose the BCa bootstrap procedure in order to perform statisctical inference. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> {{arising from}} the impact of {{monetary}} policy on bank credits will be different when monetary policy is asymmetric. Methodologically, we use a set of high frequency panel data for Taiwan commercial banks and adopt Arellano and Bond's (1991) generalized method of moments approach to conduct our empirical analysis. First of all, we investigate whether there exist the distributional effects of monetary policy on bank lending behavior which is associated with bank balance sheet characteristics, such as asset size and liquidity strength. In other words, we can show the existence of bank lending channel. Secondly, we examine the differentials of bank credits {{in response to a}} contractionary policy and expansionary policy. We then can prove monetary policy is asymmetric. Lastly, we consider the link between the monetary policy asymmetry and the <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of bank credits. Our empirical results find that the bank lending channel of monetary transmission is operative in Taiwan and that the degree of the asymmetric policy effect depends on the bank balance sheet characteristics. This study not merely contributes to understanding the monetary transmission mechanism in Taiwan, but also provides the reference for policy-making. bank lending channel, monetary policy, <b>distributional</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of Germany's trade {{integration}} with China and Eastern Europe {{and show that}} there are considerable differences between the household level and the individual level impact. The trade shock increased inequality of individual earnings. At the household level, however, about 40 % of this <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> is reduced by a simple insurance effect that occurs if partners within married and unmarried couples are differently affected by the trade shock. The insurance effect is substantial since the trade shock had a large variation across industries and 80 % of individuals within couples are employed in different industries. Our analysis also reveals that many workers who individually benefit from the trade shock turn into 'losers' at the household level {{because they have a}} partner who experiences a strong negative impact.

The confirmation consists of evidence from the linear expenditure system model showing that <b>distributional</b> <b>effects</b> are statistically significant and can displace AR(1) dynamics in the disturbances. The extension is made to the quadratic expenditure system model and an argument is advanced that standard habit formation dynamics may reflect omitted <b>distributional</b> <b>effects.</b> The evidence supports this conjecture.

The <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of offshoring (high-) low-skill-intensive tasks is similar to (unskilled-) skill-biased technology changes, while offshoring medium-skill-intensive tasks induces wage polarization. Offshoring improves cost-efficiency through international task reallocation and puts a downward pressure on all wages through domestic skill-task reallocation. If elasticities of task substitution are low (high), the downward pressure on wages in neighbouring skill segments is low (high) with a net effect of higher (lower) wages and employment...|$|E

Yet, these <b>distributional</b> <b>effects</b> are rarely studied. In France, where fishing rights are not transferable, the quotas are shared between producer cooperatives based on the historical landings of their members. Each cooperative is then responsible for distributing its quotas to its members (i. e. pooling and redistribution). What are the <b>distributional</b> <b>effects</b> of the different quota management systems adopted by cooperatives on quotas and productions? The Bay of Biscay sole fishery is a good case study for investigating this question {{in the context of}} the EU Common Fishery Policy reform and the individualization of quota management by cooperatives as quotas become more constraining. This paper presents comparisons between (i) theoretical allocations by vessel based on historical landings; (ii) theoretical allocations according to cooperative quota management systems; (iii) actual landings observed.
