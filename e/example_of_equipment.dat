A rain-poncho and its thermal liner (or a regular poncho) is an <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> {{that can be}} clothing, bedding, and structural shelter. Ultralight backpackers use typical cold-weather clothes to extend the temperature ranges of their sleepingbags. Then this reasoning can extend to packing a winter coat and snow pants with a bivy bag before adding a two-pound sleeping bag. Adding an insulated pair of socks or down booties would complete the insulation layer.|$|E

This work attempts to quantify these aerodynamic forces on carding machines used in the wool industry. A combination of boundary layer theory, experiments using hot wire anemometry and flow visualisation, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software (Fluent) was used to build up an understanding of aerodynamics in the example of wool carding machines. The theoretical and experimental work progressed along the following topics to determine each effect on carding machine aerodynamics: rough surfaces, centrifugal forces, three-dimensional edge effects, and interactions between rotating cylinders.

40|$|Summary. The {{process of}} {{separation}} bulk mixtures {{in the air}} stream is widespread in production associated with the cleaning of grain from impurity. In doing so, in order to effectively use {{the force of gravity}} appropriate cleaning grain in vertical air stream. Quantitative analysis of the separation process considering based on the model of the motion of an isolated particles in the stream. We used law of conservation of impulse {{in the form of the}} second law of Newton. Movement of particles in the air stream develops in conditions of large of number Reynolds. Therefore, the resistance force particles chosen by quadratic depending on its relative speed. Based on the quantitative analysis of the equations of motion of a particle moving on a specific trajectory, determine the critical diameter of the particles.

Examples from each section were modelled using CFD, which was found to accurately simulate theoretical and experimental results in most cases. It could also accurately predict the complex two-dimensional airflow patterns occurring in carding machines. The CFD simulations underestimated the degree of turbulence generated by interactions between rotating cylinders. Three-dimensional effects were overestimated, {{due in part to}} attempting to apply the results of an oversimplified model to a full-scale carding machine. In undertaking this work, it was found the universal velocity distribution equations describing flow over flat plates (for both smooth and rough surfaces) could also be used for flow induced by rotating cylinders by compensating for curvature effects...|$|E

40|$|Frame relay {{networks}} {{reduce the}} cost of transmission lines and equipment and improve network performance and response time. Designed for transmission lines with a low error rate, frame relay networks provide minimal internal checking, and consequently, error detection and recovery is implemented in the attached user systems. The Frame Relay Bearer Service was developed specifically as a data service to handle highvolume, bursty traffic by means of high-speed packet transmission, minimal network delay, and efficient use of network bandwidth. The frame protocol supports the data transfer phase of the Service; the frame relay header and the local management interface are sources of congestion avoidance mechanisms. Current implementations include the StrataCom IPX FastPacket digital networking system, which provides the frame relay network, and Digital's DECNIS 500 / 600 and DEC WANrouter 100 / 500 software for attaching user equipment. Today's communications networks are built using high-speed digital trunks that inherently provide high throughput, minimal delay, and a very low error rate. Such transmission networks supply highly reliable service without the overhead of error control functions. Frame relay is a packet-mode transmission network service that exploits these network characteristics by minimizing the amount of error detection and recovery performed inside the network. This paper explains the nature of the Frame Relay Bearer Service (FRBS) and provides details of the interface defined for attaching user equipment. The implications for higher-layer protocols in the user equipment are also considered. Following this tutorial, the paper introduces some current implementations. As an <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> used to construct a frame relay network, the technology deployed by the StrataCom integrated packet exchange (IPX) FastPacket range of equipment is described. Access to a frame relay network is typically via a router, as is illustrated in the discussion of two Digital products...|$|E

Many of those detectors and scintillation cristals are in use for specific reasons like high count-rate efficiencies for specific type radionuclide (γ,β,α) {{or because of}} detecting specific energies (high vs low energies). Data outcome of different combinations of detectors are often compared to each other without well-defined Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures and comparison of these detector systems. Therefore intermediate precision and reproducibility measurements are highly recommended (Guide for the elaboration of monographs on radiopharmaceutical preparations 2018). Overall, when validation is performed in the correct way these phenomena should not occur.|$|R
