40|$|A <b>diamond</b> <b>wing</b> {{and body}} {{combination}} {{was designed to}} have an area distribution which would result in near optimum zero-lift wave-drag coefficients at a Mach number of 1. 00, and decreasing wave-drag coefficient with increasing Mach number up to near sonic leading-edge conditions for the wing. The airfoil section were computed by varying their shape along with the body radii (blending process) to match the selected area distribution and the given plan form. The exposed wing section had an average maximum thickness of about 3 percent of the local chords, and the maximum thickness of the center-line chord was 5. 49 percent. The wing had an aspect ratio of 2 and a leading-edge sweep of 45 deg. Test data were obtained throughout the Mach number range from 0. 20 to 3. 50 at Reynolds numbers based on the mean aerodynamic chord of roughly 6, 000, 000 to 9, 000, 000. The zero-lift wave-drag coefficients of the diamond model satisfied the design objectives and were equal to the low values for the Mach number 1. 00 equivalent body up to the limit of the transonic tests. From the peak drag coefficient near M = 1. 00 there was a gradual decrease in wave-drag coefficient up to M = 1. 20. Above sonic leading-edge conditions of the wing there was {{a rise in the}} wave-drag coefficient which was attributed in part to the body contouring {{as well as to the}} wing geometry. The diamond model had good lift characteristics, in spite of the prediction from low-aspect-ratio theory that the rear half of the <b>diamond</b> <b>wing</b> would carry little lift. The experimental lift-curve slope obtained at supersonic speeds were equal to or greater than the values predicted by linear theory. Similarly the other basic aerodynamic parameters, aerodynamic center position, and maximum lift-drag ratios were satisfactorily predicted at supersonic speeds...|$|E

40|$|Turbulent Navier-Stokes {{computational}} {{results are}} presented for an advanced <b>diamond</b> <b>wing</b> semispan model at low speed, high-lift conditions. The numerical results are obtained {{in support of a}} wind-tunnel test that was conducted in the National Transonic Facility (NTF) at the NASA Langley Research Center. The model incorporated a generic fuselage and was mounted on the tunnel sidewall using a constant width standoff. The analyses include: (1) the numerical simulation of the NTF empty, tunnel flow characteristics; (2) semispan high-lift model with the standoff in the tunnel environment; (3) semispan high-lift model with the standoff and viscous sidewall in free air; and (4) semispan high-lift model without the standoff in free air. The computations were performed at conditions that correspond to a nominal approach and landing configuration. The wing surface pressure distributions computed for the model in both the tunnel and in free air agreed well with the corresponding experimental data and they both indicated small increments due to the wall interference effects. However, the wall interference effects were found to be more pronounced in the total measured and the computed lift, drag and pitching moment due to standard induced up-flow effects. Although the magnitudes of the computed forces and moment were slightly off compared to the measured data, the increments due the wall interference effects were predicted well. The numerical predictions are also presented on the combined effects of the tunnel sidewall boundary layer and the standoff geometry on the fuselage fore-body pressure distributions and the resulting impact on the overall configuration longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the steady and unsteady aerodynamics of sharp-edged slender wings has been performed. The results show that slender wing theory can be modified to give the potential flow static and dynamic characteristics in incompressible flow. A semiempirical approximation is developed for the vortex-induced loads, and it is shown that the analytic approximation for sharp-edged slender wings gives good prediction of experimentally determined steady and unsteady aerodynamics at M = 0 and M = 1. The predictions are good not only for delta wings but also for so-called arrow and <b>diamond</b> <b>wings.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} effects of delta planform lifting surfaces can be included in a simple manner when determining elastic launch vehicle dynamic characteristics.

40|$|Slender {{sharp-edge}} wings having leading-edge sweep {{angles of}} 74 deg {{have been studied}} at Mach numbers from 0. 60 to 2. 80, at angles of attack from about minus 4 deg to 22 deg, and at angles of sideslip from 0 deg to 5 deg. The wings had delta, arrow, and diamond planforms. The experimental tests {{were made in the}} Langley 8 -foot transonic pressure tunnel and the Langley Unitary Plan wind tunnel test section number 1. The theoretical predictions were made using the theories of NASA TN D- 3767 and NASA TN D- 6243. The results of the study indicated that the lift and drag characteristics as affected by planform and Mach number could be reasonably well predicted for the delta wing in the subsonic and transonic Mach number range. In the supersonic range, the delta and <b>diamond</b> <b>wings</b> were about equally good in the degree of agreement between experiment and theory.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{high angle}} of attack delta wing flow at multiple resolutions of turbulence closure. The work is divided into four studies. The objectives of each study are: (i) to identify the limits of RANS modeling, (ii) explore the challenges of applying the PANS model to the delta wing flow, (iii) identify the appropriate resolution required to capture specific flow features, and (iv) determine the physical differences between sharp and round leading edge separation. The outcomes from each of these studies are as follows. Steady-state RANS modeling is shown to be adequate for low and moderate angles of attack, except in regions near the point of primary vortex separation. At low Reynolds number the vortex structure on the forward portion of the wing is mostly laminar and must be fully resolved by the grid in order to capture the physics in the aft region. Also at low Reynolds numbers, it is shown that lower resolution simulations perform adequately in capturing important integral flow features such as pressure coefficient and {{the locations of the}} vortex separation and attachment lines. High resolution simulations of low Reynolds number flow do resolve more subtle flow features that do not significantly affect the aerodynamic characteristics. The principle advantages of high resolution simulations are most evident at high Reynolds numbers and high angles of attack. The relationship between scale resolution and observed flow features is established. The simulations establish the key flow feature differences between round and sharp leading edge wing at different length scales of motion. Features of interest are the intensity of the vortex structure, the levels of turbulence, surface streamline patterns, and surface pressure coefficient. Differences between the delta and <b>diamond</b> <b>wing</b> shapes are also identified...|$|E
40|$|Computational {{aerodynamic}} {{studies were}} conducted to investigate the centerbody effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of delta wings with sharp leading edges. Vortical flows around IAR 65 ° delta and 55 ° <b>diamond</b> <b>wings</b> were simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Two flow solvers were employed to compute steady inviscid flows over with and without centerbody configurations of the two wings. These two solvers are an IAR in-house code, FJ 3 SOLV, and the CFD-FASTRAN commercial software. The computed flow solutions of the two solvers have been compared and correlated against the IAR Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) measurements. The major features of the primary vortex were well captured and overall reasonable accuracy was obtained. In accordance with the experimental observations for the flow conditions considered, the CFD computations revealed no major global effects of the centerbody on the surface pressure distributions of the wings. However, CFD-FASTRAN seems to predict a vortex breakdown, which is neither predicted by FJ 3 SOLV nor observed in the wind tunnel for the simulated flow conditions.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} on a generic wing-cone transatmospheric vehicle at Mach numbers form 2. 5 to 4. 5. The objectives {{of the study were}} to experimentally define the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle and evaluate several computational aerodynamic prediction methods through comparison with the experimental results. The baseline wing-cone configuration fuselage consisted of a 5 deg half-angle cone forebody, cylindrical midbody, and 9 deg truncated cone afterbody. The 4 -percent-thick <b>diamond</b> airfoil <b>wing</b> had an aspect ratio of 1. Several configuration variables were investigated to provide trade information on canard, wing-position and incidence, vertical tail, and nose bluntness effects. Results of the study show that wing-position and wing-incidence effects on the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics can be significantly influenced by wing-body interference. The use of positive wing incidence to provide favorable forebody orientation for possible inlet performance improvement is accompanied by trim drag and lift-drag ratio penalties. The lateral-directional stability characteristics were strongly influenced by the location of the vertical tails. The higher-order full-potential method provided better estimates of the aerodynamic characteristics than either the linearized supersonic potential method or the tangent-cone/tangent-wedge/shock-expansion on method...|$|R

6000|$|I {{was within}} twenty {{feet of the}} leader, a grey stallion--lord of many brood-mares all deeply {{concerned}} {{for the welfare of}} their fuzzy foals. A cream-coloured beast--I knew him at once for the bad character of the troop--broke back, taking with him some frivolous fillies. I heard the snick of the whips somewhere in the dust, and the fillies came back at a canter, very shocked and indignant. On the heels of the last rode both the stockmen--picturesque ruffians who wanted to know [...] "what in hell" [...] I was doing there, waved their hats, and sped down the slope after their charges. When the noise of the troop had died there came a wonderful silence on all the prairie--that silence, they say, which enters {{into the heart of the}} old-time hunter and trapper and marks him off from the rest of his race. The town disappeared in the darkness, and a very young moon showed herself over a bald-headed, snow-flecked peak. Then the Yellowstone, hidden by the water-willows, lifted up its voice and sang a little song to the mountains, and an old horse that had crept up in the dusk breathed inquiringly on the back of my neck. When I reached the hotel I found all manner of preparation under way for the 4th of July, and a drunken man with a Winchester rifle over his shoulder patrolling the sidewalk. I do not think he wanted any one. He carried the gun as other folk carry walking-sticks. None the less I avoided the direct line of fire and listened to the blasphemies of miners and stockmen till far into the night. In every bar-room lay a copy of the local paper, and every copy impressed it upon the inhabitants of Livingstone that they were the best, finest, bravest, richest, and most progressive town of the most progressive nation under Heaven; even as the Tacoma and Portland papers had belauded their readers. And yet, all my purblind eyes could see was a grubby little hamlet full of men without clean collars and perfectly unable to get through one sentence unadorned by three oaths.
