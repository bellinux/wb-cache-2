40|$|ABSTRACT: We present three {{implementations}} of a fixed-size-packet switch featuring shared buffering, {{virtual circuit}} (VC) flow control, and 3 clock cycle cutthrough latency, for applications in <b>gigabit</b> <b>LAN’s,</b> networks of workstations, multiprocessor networks, and WAN’s. VC-level credit-based flow control {{is essential in}} data communications, to offer full throughput utilization while preventing throughput collapse under heavy, bursty, and hot-spot traffic. We describe in detail the implementation of VC flow control [...] one of few such implementations in hardware. We present an FPGA-based prototype that was built and is now functional, a standard-cell ASIC CMOS single-chip implementation that is currently under fabrication, and a full-custom layout of the pipelined memory shared buffer, which is also under fabrication inside a test chip. VC flow control costs less than 15 % of the switch area in both the FPGA and the ASIC versions. Full-custom yields 4 times less area and 3 times higher speed for the buffer and crossbar, compared to the semi-custom implementation...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{interposed}} request routing in Slice, a new {{storage system}} architecture for high-speed networks incorporating network attached block storage. Slice interposes a request switching filter [...] - called a µproxy [...] - along each client's network {{path to the}} storage service (e. g., in a network adapter or switch). The µproxy intercepts request traffic and distributes it across a server ensemble. We propose request routing schemes for I/O and file service traffic, and explore their effect on service structure. The Slice prototype uses a packet filter µproxy to virtualize the standard Network File System (NFS) protocol, presenting to NFS clients a unified shared file volume with scalable bandwidth and capacity. Experimental results from the industry standard SPECsfs 97 workload demonstrate that the architecture enables construction of powerful network-attached storage services by aggregating cost-effective components on a switched <b>Gigabit</b> Ethernet <b>LAN...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Performance {{of large}} memory {{applications}} degrades rapidly once the system hits the physical memory limit and starts paging to local disk. We present the design, implementation {{and evaluation of}} Distributed Anemone (Adaptive Network Memory Engine) – a lightweight and distributed system that pools together the collective memory resources of multiple machines across a <b>gigabit</b> Ethernet <b>LAN.</b> Anemone treats remote memory as another level in the memory hierarchy between very fast local memory and very slow local disks. Anemone enables applications to access potentially “unlimited ” network memory without any application or operating system modifications. Our kernel-level prototype features fully distributed resource management, low-latency paging, resource discovery, load balancing, soft-state refresh, and support for ’jumbo’ Ethernet frames. Anemone achieves low page-fault latencies of 160 µs average, application speedups of up to 4 times for single process and up to 14 times for multiple concurrent processes, when compared against disk-based paging. ...|$|R

40|$|NFS is the {{dominant}} network file system used to share files between UNIX-derived operating system based hosts. At the onset of this research {{it was found that}} the tested NFS implementations did not achieve data writing throughput across a <b>Gigabit</b> Ethernet <b>LAN</b> commensurate with throughput achieved with the same hosts and network for packet streams generated without NFS. A series of tests were conducted involving variation of many system parameters directed towards identification of the bottleneck responsible for the large throughput ratio between non-NFS and NFS data transfers for high speed networks. Ultimately it was found that processor, disk, and network performance are not the source of low NFS throughput but rather it is caused by an avoidable NFS behavior, the effects of which worsen with increasing network latency.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the indoor experimental results obtained for real-time DL MU-MIMO-OFDM transmission using a RIMC scheme in <b>gigabit</b> wireless <b>LAN</b> systems. In the proposed scheme, the inverse of the auto-correlation matrix {{can be calculated}} in the arrival order of CSI feedback frames from each user in a TDMA manner, resulting in reduced overhead for the transmit beamforming weight computation. In this paper, we evaluated {{the effects of the}} delay spread of the propagation channels and the time variations in three places with different channel characteristics and verified the feasibility of DL MU-MIMO-OFDM for gigabit-per-second transmission in wireless LAN systems. The experiment results showed that real-time DL MU-MIMO transmission of 972 Mbit/s was achieved with zero forcing-based transmit beamforming obtained by the proposed RIMC scheme at the AP and a simple decoder with each single-antenna user. In measuring the transmission rate in actual indoor environments, we found that a total transmission rate of 780 Mbit/s was achieved with six users at a 10 % CDF. The obtained results confirm that DL MU-MIMO-OFDM is a promising technology to enable gigabit-per-second transmission for simple terminals with feasible hardware implementation at the AP.|$|R
