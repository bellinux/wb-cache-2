40|$|International audienceOur study examines, in {{mesenteric}} resistance arteries, possible vasodilation alterations, and {{the role}} of NO and COX-derivates in cirrhosis. Vasodilator response to acetylcholine was analysed in segments from control and cirrhotic rats. The effects of the unspecific COX inhibitor indomethacin, of the specific COX- 1 inhibitor SC- 560 and of the specific COX- 2 inhibitor NS- 398 were analysed in segments from both groups of rats. NO release was measured and eNOS, phosphorylated eNOS (P-eNOS), iNOS, COX- 1 and COX- 2 expressions were also analysed. The effects of TP receptor antagonist SQ 29548, TxA 2 synthesis inhibitor <b>furegrelate,</b> of PGI 2 synthesis inhibitor TCP or of TCP-plus-furegrelate were only determined in segments from cirrhotic rats. Vasodilator response to acetylcholine was higher in segments from cirrhotic rats. Indomethacin, SC- 560 and NS- 398 did not modify vasodilator response in control rats However, indomethacin, NS- 398 and TCP-plus-furegrelate increased, SC- 560 did not modify, and SQ 29548, <b>furegrelate</b> or TCP decreased the vasodilator response to acetylcholine in cirrhotic rats. NO release was higher in cirrhotic rats. <b>Furegrelate</b> decreased, while TCP-plus-furegrelate increased the NO release in segments from cirrhotic rats. eNOS and COX- 1 expression were not modified, while P-eNOS, iNOS and COX- 2 expression were higher in cirrhotic rats. The increased iNOS expression and eNOS activity mediate increases in endothelial NO release. The COX- 2 derivates TxA 2 and PGI 2 act simultaneously, producing a compensatory effect that reduces NO release and may limit hyperdynamic circulation...|$|E
40|$|Changes in glomerular {{thromboxane}} A 2 receptor {{expression and}} ligand binding following immune injury. BackgroundThromboxane (Tx) A 2 {{is a potent}} vasoconstrictor eicosanoid that attains high levels within nephritic glomeruli and mediates a drop in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the course of nephritis, however, GFR recovers despite high intraglomerular TxA 2 levels. We hypothesized that this recovery indicates a reduced responsiveness of the glomerular vasculature to TxA 2, and explored whether changes in TxA 2 receptor protein expression and receptor-ligand binding are underlying mechanisms. MethodsGlomerulonephritis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats using an antibody raised in rabbits against rat particulate glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Changes in Tx receptor levels were assessed in protein lysates of glomeruli on days 3 and 7 after a single intravenous injection of the anti-GBM antibody. Ligand-binding studies were performed {{at the same time}} points using isolated glomeruli and the TxA 2 receptor ligand [3 H]-SQ- 29, 548. GFR was measured as the clearance of endogenous creatinine. ResultsThere was a marked increase in Tx receptor protein in the lysates of nephritic glomeruli on days 3 and 7. In contrast, binding sites (Bmax) of [3 H]–SQ- 29, 548 decreased, indicating that the excess receptor became either inaccessible to its ligand (sequestered) or desensitized. Daily administration of the Tx synthase inhibitor <b>Furegrelate</b> starting prior to injection of anti-GBM antibody prevented the decrease in [3 H]–SQ- 29, 548 binding. <b>Furegrelate</b> treatment starting in an established stage of nephritis had no effect. In these animals, GFR was lower than nephritic controls not treated with <b>Furegrelate.</b> ConclusionsThese observations indicate that in the course of glomerulonephritis, there is a marked increase in glomerular Tx receptor expression. The enhanced intraglomerular TxA 2 synthesis causes either a sequestration or desensitization of its receptor. As a result, access of unbound TxA 2 to efferent arterioles may become facilitated, and constriction of these arterioles may preserve GFR...|$|E
40|$|Indomethacin protects {{permeability}} barrier from focal segmental glomerulosclerosis serum. BackgroundEicosanoids {{are believed}} {{to play a role}} in the pathophysiology of several models of glomerular disease. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin reduces proteinuria in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or other glomerular diseases. We have shown that sera of some patients with FSGS significantly increase glomerular albumin permeability (Palb) in an in vitro assay. MethodsTo determine the role of eicosanoids in the increased Palb caused by the FSGS factor, glomeruli were isolated from normal rats, preincubated with indomethacin, then incubated with FSGS serum or normal serum and Palb was calculated. To study the direct effect of individual eicosanoids on Palb, glomeruli were incubated with prostaglandin E 2, prostaglandin F 2 α or a thromboxane A 2 mimetic, and Palb was calculated. In the final set of experiments, normal glomeruli were preincubated with the thromboxane synthase inhibitor <b>furegrelate,</b> incubated with FSGS serum, and Palb was calculated. ResultsPreincubation of isolated glomeruli with either the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the thromboxane synthase inhibitor <b>furegrelate</b> protected glomeruli from the increase in Palb caused by FSGS serum. Each of the three principal glomerular eicosanoids significantly increased Palb of isolated glomeruli. ConclusionsThese studies implicate a product of the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism as mediating the increased Palb caused by FSGS serum in our in vitro assay and possibly the proteinuria seen in patients with FSGS...|$|E
40|$|Doxorubicin-stimulated whole rat glomeruli and dissociated mesangial and {{resident}} glomerular macrophage cells produced {{the release of}} interleukin (IL) - 1 beta cytokine.

In the presence of WEB 2086 [platelet-activating factor (PAF) -acether antagonist], this activity showed a drastic reduction, without modification after sodium <b>furegrelate</b> (thromboxane synthetase inhibitor) {{was added to the}} cultures. Our results also demonstrate that this IL- 1 beta activity is mainly produced by glomerular-resident macrophage cells. These findings support the important role by both IL- 1 beta and PAF-acether mediator factors, at the cellular level, in the rat model of doxorubicin-induced nephrosis...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (H 2 O 2) {{caused a}} transient contraction in endothelium-intact (E+) and -denuded (E−) mesenteric arteries (MA) from 8 [*]–[*] 10 -month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) in a concentration-dependent manner (10 − 5 [*]M to 10 − 3 [*]M). The contraction to H 2 O 2 in MA (E+ or E−) was greater in SHR than in WKY. Removal of endothelium potentiated the contraction to H 2 O 2 in WKY {{but not in}} SHR. Tachyphylaxis to H 2 O 2 was less prominent in SHR than in WKY. The contraction of aorta to H 2 O 2 (5 × 10 − 4 [*]M), expressed {{as a percentage of}} 80 [*]mM KCl-induced contraction, was approximately half of that found in the MA. A greater contraction was found in E+ but not E− SHR aortic rings. The contraction of MA to H 2 O 2 (5 × 10 − 4 [*]M) was greatly inhibited by SQ 29548 and ICI 192605 (thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) /prostaglandin H 2 receptor antagonists), quinacrine (a phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) inhibitor), indomethacin and diclofenac (cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors), and <b>furegrelate</b> (a TXA 2 synthase inhibitor). Production of thromboxane B 2 induced by H 2 O 2 (5 × 10 − 4 [*]M) was greater in SHR MA than in WKY, and was inhibited by quinacrine, indomethacin and diclofenac, and <b>furegrelate,</b> but not by SQ 29584 and ICI 192605. These results suggested (1) that SHR MA exhibits a higher contraction involving an increased smooth muscle reactivity and less tachyphylaxis to H 2 O 2 than WKY; (2) that a greater production of TXA 2 through activation of PLA 2 -COX-TXA 2 synthase pathway appeared to be responsible for the enhanced contraction in SHR MA.

40|$|Thromboxane synthase (TXSA), {{an enzyme}} of the arachidonic acid metabolism, is {{upregulated}} in human glial tumors and {{is involved in}} glioma progression. Here, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo effects of pharmacological inhibition of TXSA activity on human glioblastoma cells. <b>Furegrelate,</b> a specific inhibitor of TXSA, significantly inhibited tumor growth in an orthotopic glioblastoma model by inducing proapoptotic, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic effects. Inhibition of TXSA induced a proapoptotic disposition of glioma cells and increased the sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea, significantly prolonging the survival time of intracerebral glioma-bearing mice.

40|$|The {{influence}} of diabetes on regulatory mechanisms and specific receptors {{implicated in the}} contractile response of isolated rabbit carotid arteries to endothelin- 1 was examined. Endothelin- 1 induced a concentration-dependent contraction that was greater in arteries from diabetic rabbits than in arteries from control rabbits. Endothelium removal or NG-nitro-L-arginine enhanced contractions in response to endothelin- 1 only in control arteries, without modifying the endothelin- 1 response in diabetic arteries. Indomethacin, <b>furegrelate</b> (thromboxane A 2 inhibitor), or cyclo-(D-Asp-Pro-D-Val-Leu-D-Trp) (BQ- 123; endothelin ETA receptor antagonist) inhibited the contractions in response to endothelin- 1, the inhibition being greater in diabetic arteries than in control arteries. 2, 6 -Dimethylpiperidinecarbonyl-g-methyl-Leu-Nin- (methoxycarbonyl) -D-Trp-D-Nle (BQ- 788; endothelin ETB receptor antagonist) enhanced the contraction elicited by endothelin- 1 in control arteries and displaced to the right the contractile curve for endothelin- 1 in diabetic arteries. In summary, diabetes induces hyperreactivity of the rabbit carotid artery to endothelin- 1 by a mechanism that at least includes: (1) enhanced activity of muscular endothelin ETA receptors; (2) impairment of endothelin ETB receptor-mediated nitric oxide (NO) release; and (3) enhancement of the production of thromboxane A 2...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{analyzed}} {{both the}} effect of long-term portal hypertension on the vasomotor response to acetylcholine in rat aorta, and the mechanism involved in this response. For this purpose, sham-operated and prehepatic portal hypertension rats (triple partial portal vein ligation) were used at 21 months after the surgery. The participation of nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase-derivates in the vasodilator response elicited by acetylcholine, after incubation with Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, indomethacin, SC- 560, NS- 398, tranylcypromine and <b>furegrelate</b> was analyzed. Nitric oxide, thromboxane B 2 and 6 -keto prostaglandin F 1 α releases were measured, and sodium nitroprusside, U- 46619, prostaglandin I 2 and forskolin vasomotor responses were also analyzed. Cyclooxygenase- 1 and cyclooxygenase- 2 expression was also analyzed. The acetylcholine vasodilating response was higher in portal hypertensive rats. Thromboxane A 2 and nitric oxide release and sodium nitroprusside and U- 46619 sensitivity were similar in both groups. Prostaglandin I 2 release was not modified by portal hypertension, but vasodilator responses to this prostanoid and to forskolin were higher in portal hypertensive rats. Cyclooxygenase- 1 and cyclooxygenase- 2 expression remained unmodified by surgery. In conclusion, the increased vasodilation to acetylcholine is maintained in long-term portal hypertension. While the participation of endothelial NO remained unmodified, the COX- 2 derivate PGI 2 does participate through an increased vasodilator response...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of glial tumor cells to migrate and diffusely infiltrate normal brain compromises surgical eradication of the disease. Identification of genes associated with invasion may offer novel strategies for anti-invasive therapies. The gene for TXsyn, an enzyme of the arachidonic acid pathway, {{has been identified}} by differential mRNA display as being overexpressed in a glioma cell line selected for migration. In this study TXsyn mRNA expression {{was found in a}} large panel of glioma cell lines but not in a strain of human astrocytes. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated TXsyn in the parenchyma of glial tumors and in reactive astrocytes, whereas it could not be detected in quiescent astrocytes and oligodendroglia of normal brain. Glioma cell lines showed a wide range of thromboxane B 2 formation, the relative expression of which correlated with migration rates of these cells. Migration was effectively blocked by specific inhibitors of TXsyn, such as <b>furegrelate</b> and dazmegrel. Other TXsyn inhibitors and cyclooxygenase inhibitors were less effective. Treatment with specific inhibitors also resulted in a decrease of intercellular adhesion in glioma cells. These data indicate that TXsyn plays {{a crucial role in the}} signal transduction of migration in glial tumors and may offer a novel strategy for anti-invasive therapies...|$|E
40|$|Vascular {{reactivity}} to the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) was enhanced {{in small}} mesenteric arteries (SMA) from diabetic (db/db) mice under both {{high and low}} in vitro oxygen conditions. Mechanical removal of the endothelium significantly attenuated the enhanced vascular reactivity of SMA from db/db mice. Acute incubation of the SMA with sepiapterin, a precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin, and Nω-nitro L-arginine (L-NA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS), resulted in no {{significant change in the}} enhanced vascular reactivity to PE in db/db mice. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA and protein levels in SMA were not different between db/+ and db/db mice. Acute incubation of SMA with a combination of polyethylene glycol superoxide dismutase and catalase significantly reduced the enhanced contraction to PE in db/db mice. There were higher levels of malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation and basal superoxide as measured by dihydroethidium staining, in SMA from db/db mice compared to db/+ mice. Acute incubation with indomethacin, a nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, SQ 29548, a selective thromboxane receptor antagonist and <b>furegrelate,</b> a thromboxane synthesis inhibitor, significantly attenuated the enhanced contraction to PE in SMA from db/db mice. This study demonstrates that the enhanced contractility of SMA from db/db mice to PE was endothelium dependent and involves elevated reactive oxygen species, cyclooxygenase activity and thromboxane synthesis, but not changes in the eNOS/NO pathway...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{thromboxane}} A 2 (TxA 2) in smoking-associated {{lung cancer}} is poorly understood. This {{study was conducted}} to study the role of TxA 2 in smoking carcinogen 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanone (NNK) -promoted cell survival and growth in human lung cancer cells. We found that NNK increased TxA 2 synthase (TxAS) expression and thromboxane B 2 (TxB 2) generation in cultured lung cancer cells, the result of which was supported by the increased level of TxAS in lung cancer tissues of smokers. Both TxAS-specific inhibitor <b>furegrelate</b> and TxA 2 receptor antagonist SQ 29548 completely blocked NNK-mediated cell survival and growth via inducting apoptosis. TxA 2 receptor agonist U 46619 reconstituted a near-full survival and growth response to NNK when TxAS was inhibited, affirming the role of TxA 2 receptor in NNK-mediated cell survival and growth. Suppression of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) activity by its small interference RNA blocked the effect of NNK. Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) also had a positive role. Altogether, our results have revealed that NNK stimulates TxA 2 synthesis and activates its receptor in lung cancer cells. The increased TxA 2 may then activate CREB through PI 3 K/Akt and extracellular ERK pathways, thereby contributing to the NNK-promoted survival and growth of lung cancer cells. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

As the SK(Ca) component can be inhibited by stimulation of thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) TP receptors and NO {{has the potential}} ability to inhibit thromboxane synthesis, we investigated whether TxA(2) might explain loss of functional input from SK(Ca) during NOS inhibition in cerebral arteries. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rat middle cerebral arteries were mounted in a wire myograph. Endothelium-dependent responses to the PAR 2 agonist, SLIGRL were assessed as simultaneous changes in smooth muscle membrane potential and tension. KEY RESULTS: Responses were obtained {{in the presence of}} L-NAME as appropriate. Inhibition of TP receptors with either ICI 192, 605 or SQ 29, 548, did not affect EDHF mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation, but in their presence neither TRAM- 34 nor apamin (to block IK(Ca) and SK(Ca) respectively) individually affected the EDHF response.

40|$|Mercury is an {{environmental}} pollutant that reduces nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and increases oxidative stress, having a close link with cardiovascular diseases, as carotid atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, {{coronary heart disease}} and hypertension. One of the main sites affected by oxidative stress, which develops atherosclerosis, is the aorta. Under acute exposure to low mercury concentrations reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were only reported for resistance vessels but if low concentrations of mercury also affect conductance arteries it is still unclear. We investigated the acute effects of 6 nM HgCl 2 on endothelial function of aortic rings measuring the reactivity to phenylephrine in rings incubated, or not, with HgCl 2 for 45 min, the protein expression for cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2) and the AT 1 receptor. HgCl 2 increased Rmax and pD 2 to phenylephrine without changing the vasorelaxation induced by acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Endothelial damage abolished the increased reactivity to phenylephrine. The increase of Rmax and pD 2 produced by L-NAME was smaller {{in the presence of}} HgCl 2. Enalapril, losartan, indomethacin, <b>furegrelate,</b> the selective COX- 2 inhibitor NS 398, superoxide dismutase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin reverted HgCl 2 effects on the reactivity to phenylephrine, COX- 2 protein expression was increased, and AT 1 expression reduced.

40|$|The cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX 2) -dependent {{inhibition}} of Leydig cell steroidogenesis has been demonstrated. To understand the mechanism for this effect of COX 2, {{the present study}} examined {{the role of an}} enzyme downstream of COX 2, namely thromboxane A synthase (TBXAS), in steroidogenesis. Inhibition of TBXAS activity with the inhibitor <b>furegrelate</b> induced a concentration-dependent increase in cAMP-induced steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein in MA- 10 mouse Leydig cells. The increase in StAR protein occurred concomitantly with a significant increase in steroid hormone production. Similar results were obtained in StAR promoter activity assays and RT-PCR analyses of StAR mRNA levels, suggesting that {{inhibition of}} TBXAS activity enhanced StAR gene transcription. These observations were corroborated when TBXAS expression was specifically inhibited by RNA interference. Although the RNA interference reduced mRNA levels of TBXAS, it increased StAR mRNA levels, StAR protein, and steroidogenesis. Additional studies indicated that inhibition of TBXAS activity reduced DAX- 1 protein, a repressor in StAR gene transcription. In the absence of cAMP, inhibition of TBXAS activity did not induce a significant increase in steroid hormone and StAR protein. However, addition of a low level of cAMP analogs dramatically increased steroidogenesis. Lastly, inhibition of protein kinase A activity essentially abolished the steroidogenic effect of the TBXAS inhibitor. Thus, the results from the present study suggest that a minimal level of protein kinase A activity is required for the steroidogenic effect of the TBXAS inhibitor and that inhibition of TBXAS activity or its expression increase the steroidogenic sensitivity of MA- 10 mouse Leydig cells to cAMP stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to assess whether cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) activation is involved in the effects of chronic aldosterone treatment on endothelial function of mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Experimental approach: Relaxation to acetylcholine was measured in MRA from both untreated and aldosterone-treated strains. Vasomotor responses to prostacyclin and U 46619 were also analysed. Release of 6 -oxo-prostaglandin (PG) F(1 alpha) and thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) was determined by enzyme immunoassay. COX- 2 protein expression was measured by western blot. Key results: Aldosterone reduced acetylcholine relaxation in MRA from both strains. In MRA from both aldosterone-treated strains the COX- 1 / 2 or COX- 2 inhibitor (indomethacin and NS- 398, respectively), Tx 2 synthesis inhibitor (<b>furegrelate),</b> prostacyclin synthesis inhibitor (tranylcypromine) or Tx 2 /PG 2 receptor antagonist (SQ 29 548), but not COX- 1 inhibitor SC- 560, increased acetylcholine relaxation. In untreated rats this response was increased only in SHR. Prostacyclin elicited a biphasic vasomotor response: lower concentrations elicited relaxation, whereas higher concentrations elicited contraction that was reduced by SQ 29 548. Aldosterone increased the acetylcholine-stimulated production of 6 -oxo-PGF(1 alpha) and TxB(2) in MRA from both strains. COX- 2 expression was higher in both strains of rats treated with aldosterone. Conclusions and implications: Chronic treatment with aldosterone impaired endothelial function in MRA under normotensive and hypertensive conditions by increasing COX- 2 -derived prostacyclin and thromboxane A(2). As endothelial dysfunction participates in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular disorders we hypothesize that anti-inflammatory drugs, specifically COX- 2 inhibitors, could ameliorate vascular damage in patients with elevated aldosterone production...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of cyclooxygenase pathway activation following thromboxane-endoperoxide (TP) receptor stimulation was studied in rat mesenteric resistance arteries (n= 6 to 10 per group). We studied isolated, perfused, and pressurized mesenteric resistance arteries (mean internal diameter 214 microm) using an arteriograph, enabling us to study arteries in physiological conditions of flow and pressure. Changes in diameter were continuously recorded, and contractions measured as internal diameter reduction. Release of cyclooxygenase pathway metabolites was also assessed by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) analysis of mesenteric bed perfusions. The thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2) analog U- 46619 (1 micromol/L) induced a significant contraction (108 microm maximal diameter reduction). Inhibition by 3 chemically different cyclooxygenase inhibitors (ie, flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and aspirin) potently reduced the contraction to 27 %, 25 %, and 6 % of control, respectively. The selective cyclooxygenase- 1 inhibitor SC- 58560 inhibited U- 46619 contraction, whereas selective cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibition (SC- 58236) had no effect. Thromboxane synthase inhibition (<b>furegrelate)</b> {{did not affect}} U- 46619 -induced contraction, but it was reduced by cytosolic phospholipase A 2 inhibition. Measurement of cyclooxygenase derivatives produced by the isolated mesenteric bed showed that PGE 2 was produced after TxA 2 -receptor stimulation with U- 46619. Exogenous prostaglandin E 2 (in {{the presence of the}} TxA 2 receptor antagonist SQ 29 548) and U- 46619 contracted mesenteric arteries with a similar potency (EC 50 : 0. 30 and 0. 48 micromol/L, respectively). This study provides the first evidence that TxA 2 -receptor-dependent contraction in a resistant artery involved cyclooxygenase stimulation and, at least in part, a PGE 2 formation. This mechanism of TxA 2 -dependent contraction in resistant arteries might be of importance in the understanding of diseases affecting resistant arteries and involving TxA 2, such as hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin II has a {{key role}} in the control of {{resistance}} artery tone and local blood flow. Angiotensin II possesses 2 main receptors. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor is well known and is involved in the vasoconstrictor and growth properties of angiotensin II, the role of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT 2 R) remains much less understood. Although AT 2 R stimulation induces vasodilatation in normotensive rats, it induces vasoconstriction in pathological conditions involving oxidative stress and cyclooxygenase 2 expression. Thus, we studied the influence of cyclooxygenase 2 on AT 2 R-dependent tone in diabetes mellitus. Mesenteric resistance arteries were isolated from Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and lean Zucker rats and studied using in vitro using wire myography. In ZDF rats, AT 2 R-induced dilation was lower than in lean rats (11 % versus 21 % dilation). Dilation in ZDF rats returned to the control (lean rats) level after acute superoxide reduction (Tempol and apocynin), cyclooxygenase 2 inhibition (NS 398), or thromboxane A(2) synthesis inhibition (<b>furegrelate).</b> Cyclooxygenase 2 expression and superoxide production were significantly increased in ZDF rat arteries compared with arteries of lean rats. After chronic treatment with Tempol, AT 2 R-dependent dilation was equivalent in ZDF and lean rats. Chronic treatment of ZDF rats with NS 398 also restored AT 2 R-dependent dilation to the control (lean rats) level. Plasma thromboxane B(2) (thromboxane A(2) metabolite), initially high in ZDF rats, was decreased by chronic Tempol and by chronic NS 398 to the level found in lean Zucker rats. Thus, in type 2 diabetic rats, superoxide and thromboxane A(2) reduced AT 2 R-induced dilation. These findings are important to take into consideration when choosing vasoactive drugs for diabetic patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCadmium is an {{environmental}} pollutant that is closely linked with cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. Moreover, cadmium can induce {{an increase in}} oxidative stress. One of the main sites affected by oxidative stress is the aorta, which consequently develops atherosclerosis. However, there are few reports demonstrating aortic effects induced by small concentrations of cadmium {{that are similar to}} those found in the blood resulting from occupational exposure. Furthermore, several studies have reported on chronic cadmium exposure, and the results of these studies may have been influenced by the secondary effects induced by this metal, such as hypertension. Therefore, we investigated the effects of acute cadmium exposure on the vascular reactivity to phenylephrine of aortic rings isolated from male Wistar rats. Cadmium increased phenylephrine reactivity without changing the vasorelaxation induced by acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Endothelial damage or incubation with L-NAME shifted the phenylephrine concentration–response curves leftward in arteries incubated with or without cadmium, but the curves were shifted to a lesser degree after cadmium incubation. Enalapril, losartan, the nonselective COX inhibitor indomethacin, the TXA(2) synthase inhibitor <b>furegrelate,</b> the selective COX- 2 inhibitor NS 398, the TP receptor antagonist SQ 29. 548, the EP 1 receptor antagonist SC 19. 220, superoxide dismutase, and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin partially reverted the cadmium-induced effects on the reactivity to phenylephrine. Cadmium exposure increased vasoconstrictor activity by reducing NO bioavailability owing to the increased production of ROS by NADPH oxidase. The results of the tested cadmium concentration, which is below the reference values, suggest that acute cadmium exposure may induce vascular injury through endothelial oxidative stress. These data contribute to the evidence indicating that cadmium is a high risk to public health...|$|E

Endothelium removal {{did not affect the}} biphasic response. 7, 7 -Dimethyl-(5 Z, 8 Z) -eicosadienoic acid, diclofenac, <b>furegrelate,</b> or SQ 29548 greatly inhibited the contraction but did not affect the relaxation. 17 -Octadecynoic acid, eicosatriynoic acid, ICI 198615, SQ 22536, or ODQ did not inhibit the biphasic response. KCl at 40 mM inhibited the relaxation response to H 2 O 2 by 98 ± 24 %. 4 -Aminopyridine (4 -AP) inhibited while tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA), charybdotoxin, or glibenclamide attenuated the relaxation response. A combination of 4 -AP, TEA and glibenclamide mimicked the effects of 40 mM KCl. Iberiotoxin, apamin, or barium chloride did not inhibit the relaxation response. H 2 O 2 at 1 mM hyperpolarized membrane potential and reversibly augmented K+ current in smooth muscle cells of mesenteric artery. These effects of H 2 O 2 were attenuated significantly by 4 -AP. In summary, in PHE-precontracted rat mesenteric artery: (1) the response to H 2 O 2 shifted qualitatively from contraction to a biphasic response as H 2 O 2 increased to 0. 3 mM or higher; (2) the relaxation response is caused by the activation of K+ channels, with voltage-dependent K+ channels playing a primary role; and the contraction is likely to be mediated by thromboxane A 2; (3) the K+ channel activation by H 2 O 2 is independent of phospholipase A 2, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase, adenylate or guanylate cyclase...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to characterize the antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of BM- 573 [N-tert-butyl-N'-[2 -(4 '-methylphenylamino) - 5 -nitrobenzenesulfonyl] urea], an original combined thromboxane receptor antagonist and thromboxane synthase inhibitor in rats, and to determine its effects on mice bleeding time. Intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of 5 mg/kg BM- 573 to rats inhibited U- 46619 (9, 11 -dideoxy- 9, 11 -methanoepoxy-prostaglandin F- 2) -induced washed platelet aggregation 30 min and 1, 2, and 4 h after drug administration with a maximum antiplatelet effect observed after 1 and 2 h. In a rat model of thrombosis induced by ferric chloride application on the abdominal aorta, BM- 573 significantly reduced the thrombus weight by 92. 53, 80. 20, 64. 75, and 18. 21 % at doses of 5, 2, 0. 5, and 0. 2 mg/kg, respectively. Time to occlusion of abdominal aorta in the BM- 573 -treated group (41. 50 +/- 5. 21 min) was significantly prolonged compared with the vehicle-treated rats (16. 16 +/- 0. 79 min). Like <b>furegrelate,</b> seratrodast, and acetylsalicylic acid, BM- 573 {{did not affect the}} tail bleeding time induced by tail transection in mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, BM- 573, a close derivative of the loop diuretic torasemide, failed to induce a significant increase in diuresis in rat and did not produce a decrease in blood glucose concentration as observed with the sulfonylurea glibenclamide. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the nitrobenzenic sulfonylurea BM- 573, an original combined thromboxane receptor antagonist and thromboxane synthase inhibitor, is a potent antithrombotic agent that does not affect bleeding time. Moreover, BM- 573 lost the diuretic property of torasemide and has no impact on glycemia. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the mechanisms involved in the increased 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) vasoconstriction observed in rat middle cerebral arteries exposed in vitro to lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 μg ml− 1) for 1 – 5 h. Functional, immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis and superoxide anion measurements by ethidium fluorescence were performed. LPS exposure increased 5 -HT (10 μM) vasoconstriction only during the first 4 h. In contrast to control tissue, indomethacin (10 μM), the COX- 2 inhibitor NS 398 (10 μM), the TXA 2 /PGH 2 receptor antagonist SQ 29, 548 (1 μM) and the TXA 2 synthase inhibitor <b>furegrelate</b> (1 μM) reduced 5 -HT contraction of LPS-treated arteries from hour one. The iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (0. 1 mM) increased 5 -HT contraction from hour three of LPS incubation. The superoxide anion scavenger superoxide dismutase (SOD, 100 U ml− 1) and the H 2 O 2 scavenger catalase (1000 U ml− 1), {{as well as the}} respective inhibitors of NAD(P) H oxidase and xanthine oxidase, apocynin (0. 3 mM) and allopurinol (0. 3 mM), reduced 5 -HT contraction after LPS incubation. LPS induced an increase in superoxide anion levels that was abolished by PEG-SOD. Subthreshold concentrations of the TXA 2 analogue U 46619, xanthine/xanthine oxidase and H 2 O 2 potentiated, whereas those of sodium nitroprusside inhibited, the 5 -HT contraction. COX- 2 expression was increased at 1 and 5 h of LPS incubation, while that of iNOS, Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD was only increased after 5 h. All the three vascular layers expressed COX- 2 and Cu/Zn-SOD. iNOS expression was detected in the endothelium and adventitia after LPS. In conclusion, increased production of TXA 2 from COX- 2, superoxide anion and H 2 O 2 enhanced vasoconstriction to 5 -HT during the first few hours of LPS exposure; iNOS and SOD expression counteracted that increase at 5 h. These changes can contribute to the disturbance of cerebral blood flow in endotoxic shock...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to endothelium-derived relaxing factor and hyperpolarizing factor, vascular endothelium also modulates smooth muscle tone by releasing endothelium-derived contracting factor(s) (EDCF), but {{the identity of}} EDCF remains obscure. We studied here the involvement of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in endothelium-dependent contraction (EDC) of rat renal artery to acetylcholine (ACh). ACh (10 − 6, 10 − 5, and 10 − 4 [*]M) induced a transient contraction of rat renal artery with intact endothelium in a concentration-related manner, {{but not in the}} artery with endothelium removed. In phenylephrine-precontracted renal arteries, ACh induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation response at lower concentrations (10 − 8 – 10 − 6 [*]M), and a relaxation followed by a contraction at higher concentrations (10 − 5 [*]M). Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase by Nω-nitro-L-arginine (10 − 4 [*]M) enhanced the EDC to ACh. Catalase (1000 [*]U[*]ml− 1) reduced the EDC to ACh. H 2 O 2 (10 − 6, 10 − 5, and 10 − 4 [*]M) induced a similar transient contraction of the renal arteries as ACh, but in an endothelium-independent manner. Inhibition of NAD(P) H oxidase and cyclooxygenase by diphenylliodonium chloride and diclofenac greatly attenuated ACh-induced EDC, while inhibition of xanthine oxidase (allopurinol) and cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase (17 -octadecynoic acid) did not affect the contraction. Antagonist of thromboxane A 2 and prostaglandin H 2 receptors (SQ 29548) and thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitor (<b>furegrelate)</b> attenuated the contraction to ACh and to H 2 O 2. In isolated endothelial cells, ACh (10 − 5 [*]M) induced a transient H 2 O 2 production detected with a fluorescence dye sensitive to H 2 O 2 (2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate). The peak concentration of H 2 O 2 was 5. 1 × 10 − 4 [*]M at 3 [*]min and was prevented by catalase. Taken together, these results show that ACh triggers H 2 O 2 production through NAD(P) H oxidase activation in the endothelial cells, and that ACh and H 2 O 2 share the same signaling pathway in causing smooth muscle contraction. Therefore, H 2 O 2 is most likely the EDCF in rat renal artery in response to ACh stimulation...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of contractile prostanoids in hyper-reactivity of pulmonary arteries to vasoconstrictors, in a mice model of hypoxic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were exposed or not to hypobaric hypoxia (0. 5 atm) for 21 days. Extrapulmonary arteries were removed and used for evaluation of vasomotor responses (using wire myograph), for expression and localisation of cyclooxygenases and thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) -synthase (by western blotting and immunofluoresnce) and for release of vasoactive prostanoids (by ELISA). In pulmonary arteries from hypoxic mice (but not in those from normoxic mice), arachidonic acid (30 μM) induced a contractile effect, that was converted into relaxation {{in the presence of}} SQ 29548 (0. 5 μM), a thromboxane receptor (TP) antagonist. In these arteries, contraction to phenylephrine (3 μM) was enhanced about 1. 8 fold increase compared to controls, in both endothelium-intact and denuded preparations. This hyper-reactivity to phenylephrine was diminished by SQ 29548, by the selective COX- 2 inhibitor NS 398 (1 μM), but not by the phospholipase A 2 inhibitor AACOCF 3 (30 μM), the COX- 1 inhibitor SC 560 (0. 1 μM) or the TXA 2 -synthase inhibitor <b>furegrelate</b> (100 μM). None of these agents affected contraction to phenylephrine in pulmonary arteries from normoxic mice. Expression of COX- 1, which was found in all layers of pulmonary arteries, was decreased by chronic hypoxia as well as expression of TXA 2 -synthase. COX- 2 expression was restricted to the medial layer of pulmonary arteries. Hypoxia decreased the release of TXA 2 and the release of PGI 2 from pulmonary arteries, while it increased the release of 8 -iso-PGF 2 α (an isoprostane derivative that is a marker of oxidative stress). NS 398 abolished hypoxia-induced elevation of 8 -iso-PGF 2 α release from pulmonary arteries. Finally, 8 -iso-PGF 2 α induced a contractile effect in pulmonary arteries, which was blunted by SQ 29548. Moreover, 8 -iso-PGF 2 α markedly potentiated contraction to phenylephrine. These data show that following chronic hypoxia, pulmonary arteries exhibited alterations in arachidonic acid pathway, and hyper-responsiveness to phenylephrine. The latter is likely mediated by COX- 2 -dependent production of 8 -iso-PGF 2 α, which in turn activates TP receptor. Such mechanisms probably contribute to elevation in pulmonary arterial resistance in hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} {{the effect of}} hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) on the synthesis of prostaglandins in rat skeletal muscle arterioles and platelets. Male Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups: (1) control rats, with plasma Hcy levels of 6. 5 +/- 0. 5 micromol/L (n= 50) and (2) rats with HHcy, induced by daily intake of 1 g/kg body weight methionine in the drinking water for 4 weeks (plasma Hcy levels were 20. 6 +/- 3. 0 micromol/L, P< 0. 01 versus controls; n= 50). Arterioles (diameter approximately 130 micrometer) were isolated from the gracilis muscle, cannulated, and pressurized (at 80 mm Hg), and changes in their diameters were followed by video microscopy. Constrictions to bradykinin (BK; 10 (- 10) to 10 (- 7) mol/L) were significantly greater in HHcy than in control rat arterioles (at 10 (- 9) mol/L BK, changes were 11 +/- 3 % in control and 41 +/- 9 % in HHcy rats). The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 (- 5) mol/L), the prostaglandin H(2) /thromboxane A(2) (PGH(2) /TxA(2)) receptor antagonist SQ 29, 548 (10 (- 6) mol/L), or the TxA(2) synthase inhibitor <b>furegrelate</b> (5 x 10 (- 6) mol/L) significantly decreased constrictions to BK in both groups but more so in HHcy arterioles, thus eliminating the difference between responses of HHcy and control arterioles. Constrictions to U 46619 (a TxA(2) analogue) were significantly greater in HHcy than in control arterioles (at 10 (- 8) mol/L U 46619, values for controls were 33 +/- 2 % and 54 +/- 3 % for HHcy). Endothelium removal or indomethacin treatment attenuated constrictions to U 46619 in HHcy arterioles and eliminated the difference in responses. Also, aggregation of platelets from HHcy rats to collagen and ADP was significantly enhanced compared with controls (with 5 microgram/mL collagen: controls, 23 +/- 5 %; HHcy, 49 +/- 5 %; with 10 (- 7) mol/L ADP: controls, 25 +/- 3 %; HHcy, 35 +/- 3 %). Indomethacin or SQ 29, 548 caused greater inhibition of aggregation of HHcy platelets compared with controls, thereby eliminating {{the differences between the}} 2 groups. Thus, HHcy enhances TxA(2) synthesis both in the arteriolar endothelium and platelets. By promoting vascular constriction and platelet aggregation simultaneously, these alterations are likely to contribute to the atherothrombotic vascular diseases described in HHcy...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} cyclooxygenase- 1 (COX- 1) versus COX- 2 to vascular biosynthesis of prostacyclin (PGI_(2)) and thromboxane (TxA_(2)) {{and the role}} of estrogen in the regulation of COX function were studied in the thoracic aorta of age-matched 14 - 16 week old female (F) and male (M) Sprague Dawley rats. We hypothesized that COX- 1 and COX- 2 contribute differentially to the synthesis of PGI_(2) and TxA_(2) in the presence of estrogen. Ovary intact (Int-F), ovariectomized (OvX-F) and OvX+estrogen-replaced (OvX+ER-F) rats were studied. Rats were sacrificed 14 days post-op, and 3 mm aortic rings were incubated in Krebs-Henseleit-bicarbonate buffer (KHB), containing either vehicle (basal), vasopressin (VP, 10 ^(- 6) M), VP+SC- 560 (SC, selective COX- 1 inhibitor, 10 ^(- 7) M), or VP+NS- 398 (NS, selective COX- 2 inhibitor, 10 ^(- 5) M). The KHB was analyzed by specific radioimmunoassays (RIA) for 6 -keto-PGF_(1 ?) (stable metabolite of PGI_(2) and TxB_(2) (stable metabolite of TxA 2). Basal PGI_(2) was similar in M and all F groups (P= 0. 19). VP-stimulated PGI_(2) in M (4, 528 ? 745) and OvX-F (4, 785 ? 773) was reduced similarly by SC and NS (P> 0. 05). Also, VP-stimulated PGI_(2) in Int-F (15, 352 ? 2, 209) and OvX-ER-F (13, 053 ? 3, 086) was reduced significantly by SC and NS (P 0. 05). VP-stimulated TxA_(2) in M (30 ? 4) and OvX-F (31 ? 7) was reduced similarly by SC and NS (P> 0. 05). VP-stimulated TxA_(2) in OvX-ER-F (71 ? 7) was reduced markedly more by NS than by SC (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, these data suggest that: 1) in the absence of estrogen in OvX-F and M, both PGI_(2) and TxA_(2) are derived equally from COX- 1 and COX- 2; and 2) in Int-F and OvX-ER-F, estrogen markedly enhances PGI_(2) and TxA_(2) production, primarily by upregulating COX- 2 function. Furthermore, the mechanism by which TxA_(2) inhibits PGI_(2) synthesis was investigated in M rats. It was hypothesized that TxA_(2) inhibits PGI_(2) through a PKC-mediated nitrosylation on PGI synthase. Aortic rings were prepared and incubated in KHB, containing either vehicle (VP, 10 ^(- 6) M), Calphostin C (CAL; PKC inhibitor, 10 ^(- 6) M), or <b>Furegrelate</b> (FUR; TP receptor antagonist; 50 ?M), Ridogrel (RID; combined TP receptor antagonist and TxS inhibitor; 10 ^(- 5) M), or Dazoxiben (DAZ; 50 ?M). The KHB was analyzed by specific RIA for 6 -keto-PGF_(1 ?) and TxB_(2). TxA_(2) release was significantly attenuated by DAZ, RID, and FUR but was markedly enhanced by CAL 228 % (0. 001 0. 05). However, PGI_(2) release was enhanced 158 % in the presence of DAZ (0. 001 <P< 0. 05). It is possible that Calphostin may inhibit a PKC-mediated homologous desensitization loop to increase TxA_(2) release. DAZ effects clearly show that TxS inhibitors increase PGI_(2) release, however, it is puzzling that Ridogrel did not have the same effect. While TxA_(2) does seem to have a depressing effect of PGI_(2), it is clear that PKC-mediated nitrosylation of PGI synthase is not the mechanism by which TxA_(2) inhibits PGI_(2) release...|$|E
