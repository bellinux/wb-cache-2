50|$|Generally, the {{monohybrid}} cross {{is used to}} determine the dominance relationship between two alleles. The cross begins with the parental (P) generation. One parent is homozygous for one allele, and the other parent is homozygous for the other allele. The offspring make up the first filial (F1) generation. Every member of the F1 generation is heterozygous and the phenotype of the F1 generation expresses the dominant trait. Crossing two members of the F1 generation produces the second filial (<b>F2)</b> <b>generation.</b> Probability theory predicts that three quarters of the <b>F2</b> <b>generation</b> will have the dominant allele's phenotype. And the remaining quarter of the F2s will have the recessive allele's phenotype. This predicted 3:1 phenotypic ratio assumes Mendelian inheritance.|$|E

40|$|Artificially {{aged and}} non-aged seeds of 22 grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) F₁ hybrids and their <b>F₂</b> and F₃ <b>generations</b> were {{evaluated}} for germination salt tolerance. Six of the hybrids, {{along with their}} <b>F₂</b> and F₃ <b>generations,</b> were tested for emergence salt tolerance. Effects of seed production environments on germination salt tolerance were also studied using <b>F₂</b> <b>generations</b> of 12 sorghum hybrids produced under full-season irrigation, limited irrigation, and double-cropping conditions. Germination tests were conducted in a growth chamber, on trays, while the emergence test was conducted in a greenhouse in flats filled with sand. The experiments were conducted under non-saline and saline conditions in randomized complete block designs. Artificial seed aging resulted in significant reductions in germination percentages under both non-saline and saline environments. The overall mean reduction in germination caused by seed aging was {{more than twice as}} much under salinity stress as under the non-stress conditions (48 vs. 17 %), indicating differential effects of salinity on different quality seeds. Entries that appeared to be resistant to seed aging also had higher germination percentages under salinity stress. Seed production environment influenced germination performance in both non-saline and saline environments. The overall mean germination percentages of sorghum seeds produced under three different field environments were significantly different from one another. Significant differences were observed in germination and emergence percentages within F₁, <b>F₂,</b> and F₃ <b>generations.</b> Except for the F₁ entries, however, emergence index differences within the <b>F₂</b> and F₃ <b>generations</b> were not significant. Correlations between germination and emergence percentages in the non-saline and saline treatments were generally nonsignificant. This suggests that germination and emergence responses of sorghum may vary under different salinity levels and different environments...|$|R

50|$|To {{explain his}} results, Mendel {{formulated}} a hypothesis {{that included the}} following: In the organism there {{is a pair of}} factors that controls the appearance of a given characteristic. (They are called genes.) The organism inherits these factors from its parents, one from each. A factor is transmitted from generation to generation as a discrete, unchanging unit. (The r factor in the <b>F2</b> <b>generation</b> passed through the round-seeded F1 generation. In spite of this, the rr seeds in the <b>F2</b> <b>generation</b> were no less wrinkled than those in the P generation.) When the gametes are formed, the factors separate and are distributed as units to each gamete. This statement is often called Mendel's rule of segregation. If an organism has two unlike factors (called alleles) for a characteristic, one may be expressed to the total exclusion of the other (dominant vs recessive).|$|E

50|$|Gene {{regulation}} as {{it relates}} to the HPA axis has been implicated in transgenerational stress effects. Environmental prenatal stress exposure, for example, alters glucocorticoid receptor gene expression, gene function, and future stress response in F1 and <b>F2</b> <b>generations.</b> Maternal care likewise contributes to HPA-related epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic re-programming of gene expression alters stress response in offspring later in life when exposed to decreased maternal care. Inattentive mothering has led to increased levels of gene methyl marks, compared to attentive mothers. Female offspring with low licking-grooming mothers have decreased promoter methylation and increased histone acetylation, leading to increased glucocorticoid receptor expression. Epigenetic modifications as a result of absent maternal care lead to decreased estrogen receptor alpha expression, due to increased methylation at the gene’s promoter.|$|R
5000|$|Many believe {{epigenetic}} {{regulation is}} cleared during the fertilization process, yet more evidence for transgenerational effects (TGEs) are being revealed. These TGEs take place when the epigenetic regulatory patterns are not sufficiently erased during fertilization, possibly due to nutrition levels in previous generations. Later generations {{may be affected}} from caloric and protein restriction, high-fat interventions and endocrine disruption in earlier generations. [...] Differences within the nutritional behavior of the maternal rat are believed to cause malprogramming in the F1 generation and may then be passed to subsequent generations. [...] Maternal rats fed a PR-diet during {{the entire length of}} pregnancy led to metabolic-related problems in the F1 and <b>F2</b> <b>generations,</b> even with normal nutrition during the F1 pregnancy. These effects have also been seen in the F3 generation depending on the length of protein restriction. [...] If protein restriction occurred solely during pregnancy, the F1 and F2 offspring had higher systolic blood pressure and lower nephron numbers, possibly predisposing them to hypertension. Altered glucose utilization was detected in the grand-offspring of maternal rats fed a PR-diet during pregnancy and lactation, potentially resulting in diabetes later on in life ...|$|R
50|$|Also, Frankeston bulls {{are chosen}} to be mated with {{different}} crossed cows f1 because it maintains the levels of hybrid vigor retained in future generations.

5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of F1 hybrids in agriculture is also their drawback. When F1 cultivars {{are used as}} parents, their offspring (<b>F2</b> <b>generation)</b> vary greatly from one another. Some F2s are high in homozygous genes, as found in their grandparents, and these will lack hybrid vigour. From {{the point of view}} of a commercial seed producer who does not wish customers to produce their own seed, this genetic assortment is a desired characteristic.|$|E
50|$|Mendel {{discovered}} that, when {{he crossed}} purebred white flower and purple flower pea plants (the parental or P generation), {{the result was}} not a blend. Rather than being a mix of the two, the offspring (known as the F1 generation) was purple-flowered. When Mendel self-fertilized the F1 generation pea plants, he obtained a purple flower to white flower ratio in the <b>F2</b> <b>generation</b> of 3 to 1. The results of this cross are tabulated in the Punnett square to the right.|$|E
50|$|A true autoflower is {{homozygous}} recessive {{for the day}} neutral genetics. Therefore, most crosses between classical photoperiod/short-day strains and autoflowers produce few or no autoflower progeny in the F1 generation. Regardless {{of whether}} the F1 generation produces autoflowering plants, the higher performing and similar plants need to be recrossed. This <b>F2</b> <b>generation</b> will contain approximately 25% of homozygous recessive plants which are autoflowering. Still the few autoflowers produced are not always stable and may require further stabilization. Further complexities with stabilizing autoflowers has previously led to non autoflowering and low quality strains making it into the market.|$|E
5000|$|In 1936, R.A. Fisher, a {{prominent}} statistician and population geneticist, reconstructed Mendel's experiments, analyzed {{results from the}} <b>F2</b> (second filial) <b>generation</b> and found the ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes (e.g. green versus yellow peas; round versus wrinkled peas) to be implausibly and consistently {{too close to the}} expected ratio of 3 to 1. Fisher asserted that [...] "the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified so as to agree closely with Mendel's expectations," [...] Mendel's alleged observations, according to Fisher, were [...] "abominable", [...] "shocking", and [...] "cooked".|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The single-cross {{and most}} F₂ {{progenies}} of 19 genotypes of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea, Schreb.) {{were used to}} study the breeding behavior of forage yield. Parental genotypes were selected for high self-sterility, high chromogen and high crude protein. These were studied in two groups of nine intermediate and ten late-flowering genotypes. Progenies were grown on the Hyslop Agronomy Farm, Corvallis, Oregon as plants spaced one foot apart with three feet between rows. Ten plants of each cross for each generation were arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. Variables measured were plant width, natural plant height, plant spread, leaf length, total plant height of regrowth tissue, plant density and forage yield. The collected data were converted to plant means. Broad- and narrow-sense estimates of heritability were obtained from expected mean squares according to Griffing's analysis (random model, method four) and compared with estimates of heritability obtained by F₂-single-cross regression. General and specific combining ability effects were observed and the single-cross-F₂ inbreeding depressions were studied. The F₂ families were obtained by the self-pollination of five single-cross plants. General combining ability mean squares averaged from two to nine {{times greater than the}} mean squares for specific combining ability, with the largest difference being 54. 7 times greater. The two populations responded similarly for the variables measured except for total plant height and plant spread. Greater progress from selection could be expected in the late- maturing group with the exception of these two traits. In most cases, single-cross progenies performed better than their corresponding F₂ progenies. The average of all single-crosses differed from the average of all F₂ progenies in 12 of 20 analyses in 1963, but in only 2 of 12 in 1964. The inbreeding characteristic was most pronounced for forage yield. High-performing single-crosses for the traits studied tended to produce high-performing F₂ progenies. Little or no heterosis was expressed and the expression of inbreeding depression appeared to be influenced greatly by the environment. Heritability estimates indicated that most traits could be studied more effectively after the second year of plant establishment. The environmental influence appeared to be less pronounced at that time. Where the coefficient of determination was high between the single-cross and <b>F₂</b> <b>generations,</b> traits were less influenced by the environment and the disparity between the estimates of heritability was less. When used on cross-pollinated polyploid grasses, the method of diallel analysis proposed by Griffing does not appear to remove all environmental influence and thus overestimates heritability. Forage yield in the two populations of tall fescue studied was governed principally by additive gene action. Heterosis expressed was mostly in crosses involving low-performing parents...|$|R
5000|$|Mendel's {{findings}} allowed scientists such as Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane {{to predict}} the expression of traits {{on the basis of}} mathematical probabilities. An important aspect of Mendel's success can be traced to his decision to start his crosses only with plants he demonstrated were true-breeding. He also only measured absolute (binary) characteristics, such as color, shape, and position of the seeds, rather than quantitatively variable characteristics. He expressed his results numerically and subjected them to statistical analysis. His method of data analysis and his large sample size gave credibility to his data. He also had the foresight to follow several successive <b>generations</b> (<b>F2,</b> F3) of pea plants and record their variations. Finally, he performed [...] "test crosses" [...] (backcrossing descendants of the initial hybridization to the initial true-breeding lines) to reveal the presence and proportions of recessive characters. Without his diligence and careful attention to procedure and detail, Mendel's work would have had a much smaller impact on the world of genetics.|$|R
50|$|F1 hybrids {{produce the}} highest and most uniform yields but cost 25 times the cost of open-pollinated seed, leading to only 2% of United States acreage being planted with F1 hybrids. F2 hybrids often produce {{similarly}} to F1 hybrids; however, some F1 hybrids are produced via recessive male sterility to eliminate the need to hand-pollinate, reducing the cost to produce the hybrid, but producing a 25% reduction in yield in the <b>F2</b> <b>generation.</b> Some notable F1 hybrids are 'Mitla', 'Perfecto', 'Tula', 'Grande' (a hot jalapeño), 'Sayula', 'Senorita', and 'Torreon', most of them being developed and marketed by Petoseed, a brand of Seminis.|$|E
50|$|Co-dominance, where allelic {{products}} co-exist in the phenotype, {{is different}} from incomplete dominance, where the quantitative interaction of allele products produces an intermediate phenotype. For example, in co-dominance, a red homozygous flower and a white homozygous flower will produce offspring that have red and white spots. When plants of the F1 generation are self-pollinated, the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the <b>F2</b> <b>generation</b> will be 1:2:1 (Red:Spotted:White).

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Estimates of {{heritability}} {{and associations}} of tiller number, seed number, seed weight, and seed yield were determined in {{two groups of}} tall fescue. Group E was early maturing and had eight parental clones, while group I was intermediate in maturity and had nine parental clones. The parents and five progeny groups {{were included in the}} study: first generation selfed progeny (S₁), open-pollinated progeny, polycross progeny, single-cross progeny, and selfed progeny from the single-crosses (F₂). Each entry consisted of ten plants in a nine foot row, with three feet between rows. The plants were established in the field in October 1962, in a randomized block design with four replications. Data were collected during the summers of 1963, 1964, and 1965. Group E plants had slightly higher seed yields than group I plants. This yield advantage was mainly the result of heavier seeds in group E. The parents and the open-pollinated, polycross, and single-cross progeny were generally highest in performance for all four characteristics, while the S₁ progeny were intermediate and the F₂ progeny were lowest in performance. The open-pollinated and polycross progeny were limited in their usefulness for evaluating breeding material since {{there were no significant differences}} among the open-pollinated progenies in 13 of 24 analyses of variance and there were no significant differences among the polycross progenies in 12 of 24 analyses of variance. Six methods (regression of the S₁ progeny on the parents, two times the regression of the open-pollinated progeny on the parents, two times the regression of the polycross progeny on the parents, regression of the single-cross progeny on the mid-parents, regression of the F₂ progeny on the mid-parents, and mean squares from the diallel analysis) of estimating heritability were compared for both populations. There were large differences in the heritability estimates among years and among methods. Two methods, 2 ([superscript b][subscript OP. P]) and [superscript b][subscript SX. MP'] generally resulted in higher heritability estimates than the other four methods. The "average heritability" (averaged across six methods and three years) for tiller number, seed number, seed weight, and seed yield were. 187,. 371,. 506, and. 193 respectively for group E and. 567,. 417,. 622, and. 374 for group I. The correlation and path-coefficient analysis for groups E and I indicated that tiller number had the largest direct effect in 1963, while seed number was most important in 1964 and both were equally important in 1965. Seed weight had relatively small effects all three years. All indirect effects were minor in both populations. The correlations and the direct and indirect effects for the parent, single-cross and <b>F₂</b> <b>generations</b> were more variable and they were not always in agreement with the direct and indirect effects for the combined data of the parents and five progeny groups. There were large negative indirect effects in the individual generations which were not evident for the combined data of the parents and five progeny groups. Group E could be improved most by breeding for increased seed number while selection for yield would be most worthwhile in group I. However, maximum improvement could be made by combining the attributes of the two populations. The high seed weight of group E could be incorporated into group I and seed number of group E could be increased by crossing plants of group E with plants of group I...|$|R
40|$|Crop {{performance}} {{depends on}} genotype, {{the environment in}} which the crop is grown, and interaction between genotype and environment. A measure of these effects is important in determining adaptation and in recommending crop genotypes to growers. In instances where hybrid seed has been introduced into developing countries, which often traditionally save seed for the next planting, determining the adaptation of genotypes and making accurate recomendations may be difficult. This experiment evaluated 15 commercial hybrid grain sorghums (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), along with their segregating <b>F₂</b> and F₃ <b>generations,</b> for adaptation to variable moisture environments. Grain yield per entry in all tests was the main phenotypic character used to measure adaptation in environments differing in mean moisture stress. Grain yield was also the main characteristic used to observe changes through generations F₁ to F₃. There was an expected decrease in yield with decreased irrigation, and with advanced generations.

40|$|F(1) hybrid {{sterility}} and ``hybrid breakdown'' of <b>F(2)</b> and later <b>generations</b> in rice (Oryza sativa L.) are common and genetically complicated. We used a {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} linkage map and F(4) progeny testing to investigate {{hybrid sterility}} and hybrid breakdown in {{a cross between}} ``widely compatible'' O. sativa ssp. japonica cultivar Lemont from the Southern U. S. and ssp. indica cultivar Teqing from China. Our results implicate different genetic mechanisms in hybrid sterility and hybrid breakdown, respectively. Hybrid sterility appeared to be due to recombination within a number of putative differentiated ``supergenes'' in the rice genome, which may reflect cryptic structural rearrangements. The cytoplasmic genome had a large effect on fertility of both male and female gametes in the F(1) hybrids. There appeared to be a pair of complementary genes that behaved like ``wide compatibility'' genes. This pair of genes and the ``gamete eliminator'' (S(1)) or ``egg killer'' (S- 5) may influence the phenotypic effects of presumed supergenes in hybrids. Hybrid breakdown appeared to be largely due to incompatibilities between indica and japonica alleles at many unlinked epistatic loci in the genome. These proposed mechanisms may partly account for the complicated nature of postreproductive barriers in rice...|$|R
