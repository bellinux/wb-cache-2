[...] "Thinking about going {{back on the road}} is both thrilling and terrifying in equal measure," [...] Manson stated, [...] "...but we've always enjoyed a little pain mixed <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> pleasure." [...] Manson considered that self-reflection helped change the way the group approached touring, and, as a result, [...] "we're playing the best shows of our career." [...] Eric Avery, who performed with the band during their Bleed Like Me tour, rejoined them as the tour bassist. The band played concerts throughout North and South America, Europe, Oceania and Asia.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years after}} Occidents premiere, Pascu {{released}} the album Stângul de a visa ("The Left to Dream"), which was {{less of a}} commercial success and as Pascu noted, was inconsistent with the editorial policies of commercial radio. According to his website, it was not promoted by the mainstream radio stations, and sold most of its copies during live performances. In a 2009 interview, Pascu argued, [...] "Every time I had songs to pitch, [...] would say: 'they're good, but they don't fit <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> policies.' [...] If commercial radio stations were to count, I haven't had put out a record since 1993." [...] He also thanked the file sharing community for circulating copies of his music, even though he lost some royalties. Pascu voiced {{his opposition to the}} singing competitions phenomenon, stating that as a one-time member of the Mamaia Festival jury, he had a [...] "bittersweet" [...] experience of Romanian pop politics.|$|E

2500|$|Digital Spy's Dek Hogan reacted {{positively}} to [...] "Rise of the Cybermen", describing the new Cybermen as [...] "stunning, not only looking fantastic but being genuinely scary {{at the same}} time". He particularly praised how the storyline [...] "ties <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> obsession with upgrading everything" [...] and that Noel Clarke was given more to do. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode a rating of 8.5 out of 10, feeling that it [...] "delivers both in scope and with some great dialogue". Haque was especially positive to {{the return of the}} Cybermen and the focus on Mickey and Rose. Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the two-parter a positive review, highlighting Harper's direction which he felt added imagination and menace to the Cybermen and the parallel universe. However, he felt that Lloyd-Pack's performance was too over-the-top for the current [...] "subtler" [...] incarnation of Doctor Who, which made him come across as [...] "jarringly two-dimensional".|$|E
2500|$|Borzou Daragahi Iraq {{correspondent}} for the Los Angeles Times, {{in an interview with}} PBS, questioned the study based on their earlier research in Iraq, saying, [...] "Well, we think—the Los Angeles Times thinks these numbers are too large, depending on the extensive research we've done. Earlier this year, around June, the report was published at least in June, but the reporting was done over weeks earlier. We went to morgues, cemeteries, hospitals, health officials, and we gathered as many statistics as we could on the actual dead bodies, and the number we came up with around June was about at least 50,000. And that kind of jibed with some of the news report that were out there, the accumulation of news reports, in terms of the numbers killed. The U.N. says that there's about 3,000 a month being killed; that also fits <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> numbers and with morgue numbers. This number of 600,000 or more killed {{since the beginning of the}} war, it's way off our charts." ...|$|E

In March 2017, Harrier said the film was undergoing reshoots, and Evans was set to appear as Steve Rogers / Captain America in an instructional fitness video. Watts was inspired by The President's Fitness Challenge for this, feeling that Captain America would be the obvious version of that for the MCU. He then started brainstorming other public service announcements (PSA) starring Captain America, [...] "about just everything, [...] brushing your teeth. Just anything you could think of, we had poor Captain America do it." [...] Watts said {{that many of the}} additional PSA videos would be featured on the home media of the film. Watts {{confirmed that}} the company Stark creates that leads Toomes on his villainous path in the film is Damage Control, which Watts felt [...] "just fit <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> overall philosophy with the kind of story we wanted to tell" [...] and created a lot of practical questions Watts wanted to use [...] "to drive the story".|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> energy supply, so it's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food. So I believe in supports that will allow us to do that." ...|$|E
