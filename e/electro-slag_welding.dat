40|$|Mechanical {{harmonic}} transmissions {{are relatively}} {{new kind of}} drives having several unusual features. For example, they can provide reduction ratio up to 500 : 1 in one stage, have very small teeth module compared to conventional drives and {{very large number of}} teeth (up to 1000) on a flexible gear. If for conventional drives manufacturing methods are well-developed, fabrication of large size harmonic drives presents a challenge. For example, how to fabricate a thin shell of 1. 7 m in diameter and wall thickness of 30 mm having high precision external teeth at one end and internal splines at the other end? It is so flexible that conventional fabrication methods become unsuitable. In this paper special fabrication methods are discussed {{that can be used for}} manufacturing of large size harmonic drive components. They include <b>electro-slag</b> <b>welding</b> and refining, the use of special expandable devices to locate and hold a flexible gear, welding peripheral parts of disks with wear resistant materials with subsequent machining and others. These fabrication methods proved to be effective and harmonic drives built with the use of these innovative technologies have been installed on heavy metallurgical equipment and successfully tested...|$|E
