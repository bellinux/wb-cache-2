5|$|In its pronouns, E distinguishes for person between first, second, and third; {{in number}} between {{singular}} and plural; and, {{in the case}} of the first-person plural, between inclusive and exclusive we. E does not, however, make distinctions for <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ottawa <b>{{grammatical}}</b> <b>gender</b> classifies nouns {{as either}} animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode {{the gender of}} the grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode {{the gender of the}} grammatical subject, creating a set of four verb subclasses. The distinction between the two genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in gender with the noun they refer to.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} {{of the world}} (including Austronesian languages, many East Asian languages, the Quechuan languages, and the Uralic languages) do not have gender distinctions in personal pronouns, just as most of them lack any system of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> In others, such {{as many of the}} Niger–Congo languages, there is a system of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> (or noun classes), but the divisions are not based on sex. Pronouns in these languages tend to be naturally gender-neutral.|$|E

25|$|Hittite lacks some {{features}} of the other Indo-European languages, such as a distinction between masculine and feminine <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> subjunctive and optative moods, and aspect. Various hypotheses have been formulated to explain these contrasts.|$|E
25|$|The Romance languages, such as Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese and Romanian, {{have more}} overt {{inflection}} than English, especially in verb conjugation. Adjectives, nouns and articles are considerably less inflected than verbs, {{but they still}} have different forms according to number and <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b>|$|E
25|$|Turkic {{languages}} are null-subject languages, have vowel harmony, extensive agglutination {{by means of}} suffixes and postpositions, and lack of grammatical articles, noun classes, and <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Subject–object–verb word order is universal within the family. The root of a word is basically of one, two or three consonants.|$|E

25|$|Turkish {{does not}} have a system of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and {{does not have}} any gender-specific pronouns. The Turkish {{singular}} third-person pronoun o (he/she/it) is completely gender-neutral and can be used to refer to masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns. The plural third-person pronoun onlar (they) is used the same way.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of inanimate {{entities}} {{is often}} {{different from that}} used in sister languages: thus, for example, Portuguese árvore ("tree") and flor ("flower") are feminine, while Spanish árbol and Italian fiore are masculine; Portuguese mar ("sea") and mapa ("map") are masculine, while French mer and mappe are feminine.|$|E
25|$|Nouns are not {{required}} to form a complete Navajo sentence. Besides the extensive information that can be communicated with a verb, Navajo speakers may alternate between the third and fourth person to distinguish between two already specified actors, similarly to how speakers of languages with <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> may repeatedly use pronouns.|$|E

25|$|A major {{difference}} between Novial and Esperanto/Ido concerns noun endings. Jespersen rejected a single vowel to terminate all nouns (-o in Esperanto/Ido), finding it unnatural and potentially confusing. Instead, Novial nouns may end in -o, -a, -e, or -u or -um. These endings may be taken to indicate natural sex according to the custom in Romance languages. Also there is no <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> or requirement for adjectives to agree with nouns.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> {{correlates}} to {{some degree}} with sex, but not perfectly: masculine nouns are usually {{used to refer to}} adult males, feminine nouns for adult females, but diminutives are neuter regardless of referent in both Greek and Germanic. Gender may have had a grammatical function, in that a change of gender within a sentence signaled the end of a noun phrase (a head noun and its agreeing adjectives) and {{the start of a new}} one.|$|E
25|$|Russian {{surnames}} {{are typically}} inclined {{to indicate the}} gender of their bearer, while Korean surnames are not, as the Korean language lacks <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> In the former Soviet countries, many inhabitants, notably the Turkic peoples, had suffixes ov or ova added to their surnames; examples include presidents Nursultan Nazarbayev and Islam Karimov. However, Koryo-saram surnames do not follow this practice. However, they do decline in accordance to case as per the Russian language's rules.|$|E

25|$|The {{definite}} article le is invariable, as in English. Nouns have no <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Plurals {{are formed}} by adding -s, or -es after a final consonant. Personal pronouns take one {{form for the}} subject {{and one for the}} direct object and reflexive. In the third person, the reflexive is always se. Most adverbs are derived regularly from adjectives by adding -mente, or -amente after a -c. An adverb can be formed from any adjective in this way.|$|E
25|$|Standard Dutch uses three genders to {{differentiate}} between natural gender and three when discerning <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> But for most non-Belgian speakers, the masculine and feminine genders have merged to form the common gender (de), while the neuter (het) remains distinct as before. This gender system is {{similar to those of}} most Continental Scandinavian languages. As in English, but to a lesser degree, the inflectional grammar of the language (e.g., adjective and noun endings) has simplified over time.|$|E
25|$|Uyghur {{belongs to}} the Karluk branch of the Turkic {{language}} family, which also includes languages such as Uzbek. Like many other Turkic languages, Uyghur displays vowel harmony and agglutination, lacks noun classes or <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> and is a left-branching language with subject–object–verb word order. More distinctly Uyghur processes include, especially in northern dialects, vowel reduction and umlauting. In addition to influence of other Turkic languages, Uyghur has historically been influenced strongly by Persian and Arabic, and more recently by Mandarin Chinese and Russian.|$|E

25|$|It was {{proposed}} again in 1994, {{with reference to}} the Finnish hän, similarly pronounced, a personal pronoun that is gender-neutral, since Finnish completely lacks <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> In 2009 it was included in Nationalencyklopedin. However, it did not receive widespread recognition until around 2010, when it began to be used in some texts, and provoked some media debates and controversy, but is included since 2015 in Svenska Akademiens ordlista, the most authoritative glossary of the Swedish language, by the Swedish Academy.|$|E
25|$|In other {{languages}} – including most Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic languages – third-person personal pronouns (at least those {{used to refer}} to people) intrinsically distinguish male from female. This feature commonly co-exists with a full system of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> where all nouns are assigned to classes such as masculine, feminine and neuter. However in some languages, such as English, this general system of noun gender has been lost, but gender distinctions are preserved in the third-person pronouns (the singular pronouns only, in the case of English).|$|E
25|$|Characteristic {{features}} of Turkish, such as vowel harmony, agglutination, {{and lack of}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> are universal within the Turkic family. There is also {{a high degree of}} mutual intelligibility among the various Oghuz languages, which include Turkish, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Qashqai, Gagauz, Balkan Gagauz Turkish, and Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar. Although methods of classification vary, the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided equally into two branches: Oghur, the only surviving member of which is Chuvash, and Common Turkic, which includes all other Turkic languages including the Oghuz subbranch.|$|E
