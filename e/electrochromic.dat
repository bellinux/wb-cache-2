25|$|After {{the demise}} of the Ninety-Eight in 1996, Oldsmobile added the Regency to the 1997 and 1998 lineups, which used the same front fenders and chrome grille as the Ninety-Eight sedan but kept the {{standard}} Eighty-Eight body. The Regency featured a long list of standard features including traction control, leather upholstery, dual 6-way power seats with power lumbar and a driver's side memory function, a dual-zone automatic climate control system, and an electronic level control for the rear suspension. A driver's side <b>electrochromic</b> outside mirror was also standard on the Regency, a feature that even Cadillac didn't offer as standard equipment. The interior day/night auto-dimming mirror was linked to the outside mirror and dimmed both with the same intensity at the same time. Some of these options, like the 2-driver memory feature, were not available on the Eighty-Eight Royale or LSS.|$|E
25|$|The AL10 RX's new {{exterior}} styling adopts the L-finesse design language, {{and outer}} features include a rear spoiler which hides {{the rear window}} wiper and radio antenna creating a less cluttered appearance.

For the interior, major standard features include SmartAccess, a keyless entry and start system, <b>electrochromic</b> heated side mirrors, UV reducing exterior glass, Bluetooth, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power 10-way driver and passenger seats, sliding and reclining rear seats and a power rear hatch. The instrument cluster's multi-function display uses an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of a thin film transistor (TFT-LCD) display. New cabin technologies include VoiceBox Technologies conversational speech voice recognition system, {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S., which can recognize general speech commands. The new hard disk drive HDD-based navigation system no longer uses a touchscreen, instead replacing it with Lexus' Remote Touch controller, similar in function to a computer mouse, with haptic feedback.

2500|$|The {{colour change}} {{associated}} with polyaniline in different oxidation states {{can be used}} in sensors and <b>electrochromic</b> devices. Although color is useful, the best method for making a polyaniline sensor is arguably {{to take advantage of the}} dramatic changes in electrical conductivity between the different oxidation states or doping levels. [...] Treatment of emeraldine with acids increases the electrical conductivity by ten orders of magnitude. Undoped polyaniline has a conductivity of [...] S/m, while conductivities of [...] S/m can be achieved by doping to 4% HBr. The same material can be prepared by oxidation of leucoemeraldine.|$|E

2500|$|An area {{of active}} {{research}} on microbial cellulose {{is in the}} area of electronic paper. [...] Currently, plant cellulose is used to produce the bulk of traditional paper, but due to its low purity it must be mixed with other substances such as lignin. [...] However, due to microbial cellulose's higher purity and microfibril structure, it may prove to be an excellent candidate for an electronic paper substrate. [...] Microbial cellulose can be fashioned into sheets approximately 100 micrometers thick, about the thickness of normal paper, by a wet synthesis process. [...] The microbial cellulose produces a sturdy substrate with a microfibril structure that allows the paper to be implanted with dopants. [...] Through the application of solutions to the microbial cellulose paper, conductive dopants and <b>electrochromic</b> dyes can be placed into the microfibril structure. [...] The bistable dyes change from clear to dark upon the application of the appropriate voltages, which when placed in a pixel structure, would allow images to be formed. [...] This technology is still in the research stage and has not yet been scaled to commercial production levels. [...] Further research has been done to apply bacterial cellulose as a substrate in electronic devices with the potential to be used as e-book tablets, e-newspapers, dynamic wall papers, rewritable maps and learning tools. Another possible example of bacterial cellulose use in the electronics industry includes the manufacture of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Grand Cherokee {{was launched}} in 1992 as a 1993 model year vehicle in the luxury SUV segment. The [...] "ZJ" [...] models, manufactured from 1992 to 1998, originally came in three trim levels: base (also known as SE), Laredo, and Limited, subsequent trims were added, included Orvis (95–98), TSI (97–98). The base model included features such as full instrumentation, cloth interior, and a standard five-speed manual transmission, while gaining the moniker [...] "SE" [...] name for the 1994 model year. Power windows and locks were not standard equipment on the base trim. The minimal price tag differential resulted in low consumer demand, and as a result, the low-line model was eventually discontinued. Additional standard features included a driver-side air bag (starting in 96) and four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS). The Laredo was the mid-scale model with standard features that included power windows, power door locks, cruise control, and a leather wrapped steering wheel. Exterior features included medium-grey plastic paneling on the lower body and five-spoke alloy wheels. The Limited was the premium model, featuring body color lower body paneling, and gold exterior accents. The Limited also boasted standard features such as leather seating, heated mirrors, front power seats, a keyless entry system, wood grain interior appliqué, lace style alloy wheels, a driver information center with compass, digitized climate control, and <b>electrochromic</b> rearview mirror, and Jensen brand stereo with multi-band equalizer. By 1996 the option list grew to include heated seats. Standard was the 4.0, with the 5.2 V8 (and 5.9 in 1998) being optional. As with other models. Package groups with the various trim levels included: fog lamps, skid plates, as well as convenience, lighting, luxury, power, security, and trailer towing packages.|$|E

50|$|Electrochromism is the {{phenomenon}} displayed by some materials of reversibly changing colour by using bursts of charge to cause electrochemical redox reactions in <b>electrochromic</b> materials. Various types {{of materials and}} structures {{can be used to}} construct <b>electrochromic</b> devices, depending on the specific applications. Transition metal oxides are a large family of materials possessing various interesting properties in the field of electrochromism. Among them, tungsten oxide (WO3), has been the most extensively studied material, used in the production of <b>electrochromic</b> windows or smart glass and more recently <b>electrochromic</b> displays on paper substrate as anti-counterfeiting systems integrated on packaging. NiO materials have been widely studied as counter electrodes for complementary <b>electrochromic</b> devices, in particular, smart windows. The world leading institutions on NiO efforts include National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Uppsala University. Another example of an <b>electrochromic</b> material is polyaniline which can be formed either by the electrochemical or chemical oxidation of aniline. If an electrode is immersed in hydrochloric acid which contains a small concentration of aniline, then a film of polyaniline can be grown on the electrode. Depending on the oxidation state, polyaniline can either be pale yellow or dark green/black. Other <b>electrochromic</b> materials that have found technological application include the viologens and polyoxotungstates.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electrochromic</b> devices change light {{transmission}} properties {{in response to}} voltage and thus allow control over the amount of light and heat passing through. In <b>electrochromic</b> windows, the <b>electrochromic</b> material changes its opacity: it changes between a transparent and a tinted state. A burst of electricity is required for changing its opacity, but once the change has been effected, no electricity is needed for maintaining the particular shade which has been reached.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} {{coloration}} {{goes back to}} 1704 when Diesbach discovered Prussian blue (hexacyanoferrate), which changes the color from transparent to blue under oxidation of iron. In the 1930s, Kobosew and Nekrassow first noted electrochemical coloration in bulk tungsten oxide. While working at Balzers in Lichtenstein, T. Kraus provided {{a detailed description of}} electrochemical coloration in thin film of tungsten trioxide (WO3) on 30 July 1953. In 1969, S. K. Deb demonstrated <b>electrochromic</b> coloration in WO3 thin films. Deb observed <b>electrochromic</b> color by applying electric field of the order of 104 Vcm−1 across WO3 thin film. In fact, the real birth of the EC technology is usually attributed to S. K. Deb’s seminal paper of 1973, wherein he described the coloration mechanism in WO3.
