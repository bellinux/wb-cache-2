40|$|In this article, I {{identify}} <b>filter</b> configurations {{based on}} <b>filter</b> objects for OO distributed systems. The configurations {{are based on}} the notion of first class <b>filter</b> objects that transparently intercept messages in a client-server object architecture. Transparency primitives for <b>filtering</b> are described and various <b>filter</b> configurations are illustrated using the transparency primitives. The paper identifies six <b>filter</b> configurations, namely Replacer, Router, Repeater, Value Transformer, Message Transformer, and Logger. Each <b>filter</b> configuration is demonstrated through an example implementation template. I also discuss the consequences of <b>filter</b> configurations for design patterns and evolutionary systems. <b>Filtering</b> is a very useful abstraction in distributed systems. <b>Filters</b> are increasingly being recognized as important architectural abstractions. An architectural description of <b>filters</b> appears in the work of Shaw and Garlan. 1 <b>Filter</b> implementations have started appearing in commercial systems. For example, C O R B A 2 implementations such as Orbix 3 provide specific <b>filtering</b> abilities. The COM specification 4 also defines <b>filtering</b> capabilities for COM. Programming language models for <b>filtering</b> include the Composition <b>Filter</b> model 5 and the <b>Filter</b> Object model. 6 Composition <b>Filters</b> describe <b>filter</b> specifications embedded with object descriptions, whereas, <b>Filter</b> Objects are based on an interclass relationship called <b>filter</b> relationship. An IDL-centric design for distributed <b>filter</b> objects based on this interclass <b>filter</b> relationship can be found in“Filter Objects for Distributed Systems. ” 7 Some example applications of <b>filtering</b> systems are security <b>filters,</b> mail <b>filters</b> that <b>filter</b> electronic mails, routers that route requests for load balancing, request loggers that maintain logs of external accesses, and online caches.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} <b>filter</b> {{structures for}} interpolation and decimation {{by a factor}} of two. The structures are derived by using the frequency-response masking approach, in which the overall <b>filter</b> makes use of a periodic model <b>filter,</b> its complementary <b>filter,</b> and two masking <b>filters.</b> The periodic model <b>filters</b> are obtained by replacing each delay element in a model <b>filter</b> with M delay elements in cascade. The model <b>filter</b> is a half-band infinite-impulse response (IIR) <b>filter</b> composed of two all-pass <b>filter</b> in parallel, whereas the masking <b>filters</b> are linear-phase finite-impulse response (FIR) <b>filters.</b> In the final interpolator and decimator structures, the <b>filtering</b> takes place at the lowest of the two sampling rates involved. The corresponding overall <b>filter</b> can be designed by separately optimizing a half-band IIR <b>filter</b> and a linear-phase FIR <b>filter.</b> Both nonlinear-phase and approximately linear-phase <b>filters</b> are considered. One advantage of the proposed <b>filter</b> structures over conventional half-band IIR <b>filter</b> structures is that their maximal sample frequency is M times higher, which may be utilized to increase the speed in an implementation and/or to reduce the power consumption via power supply voltage scaling techniques. In the case of approximately linear-phase <b>filters,</b> the computational complexity can be reduced as well. Several design examples are included demonstrating the properties and advantages of the proposed <b>filter</b> structures.
