5|$|Next, {{the finals}} of The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament were held between Christian Cage and Kaz in a ladder match that lasted 15 minutes and 13 seconds. In a ladder match, an object is <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> {{the ring and}} the first to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the object is the winner. During the match, Cage was legitimately busted open above his eye. Midway through the encounter, the contract fell off the clipboard that <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> the ring, which changed the objective to just grabbing the clipboard to win. Kaz won the contest after causing Cage to fall off the ladder onto Styles and Tomko, who were interfering on Cage's behalf, and then ascending the ladder to grab the clipboard, becoming number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the process.|$|E
5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Hockey Stick Fight with Kip James as Special Guest Referee between 3Live Kru (B.G. James, Konnan, and Ron Killings) and Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young) followed. In this match, {{hockey sticks}} were <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> {{each of the}} {{turnbuckles}} in the ring, with only the legal men allowed to use them. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Killings pinned Young after a top rope leg drop onto a hockey stick that laid across Young's groin to win the match for his team at 10 minutes and 23 seconds. After this bout, Christian Cage made his debut, announcing he wanted to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Coach Scott D'Amore and Bobby Roode came out and offered Cage a spot in Team Canada, which Cage said he would consider.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{entering}} the Ellwood House, guests of Isaac or Perry Ellwood {{would have been}} greeted or formally welcomed {{by members of the}} family. After Perry Ellwood inherited the house in 1910 the entry parlor began to become known as the library. Prominent among the library's features is a carved Italian marble mantle with a large gilt mirror <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> it. The library's bookshelves are cast in a Neo-Italian Renaissance style and constructed of fine mahogany. Presently filling the shelves in the Ellwood House are a large collection of books with Ellwood family nameplates. Near the library window, which is adorned with its original walnut shutters, is an 1890s French statue. The statue was donated to the Ellwood House Association from someone in Sycamore who bequeathed it to the museum.|$|E
5|$|The TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal and {{the debut}} of the X Division TerrorDome were {{promoted}} as featured matches for the Sacrifice undercard. The TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal was announced by Cornette on the April24 episode of Impact!. The rules of the contest involved two stages: a standard battle royal in which competitors fought to eliminate wrestlers by throwing them over the top rope and a ladder match in which the final two wrestles fought to retrieve a contract that had been <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> the ring. An added stipulation to the bout was that the loser's head would be shaved and the winner would earn a TNA Women's Knockout Championship match. On the May8 episode of Impact!, Gail Kim won a Ten-Woman Clippers on a Pole match that granted her immunity from having her head shaven if she lost at the event. During the April24 episode of Impact!, TNA announced plans to introduce a new match type in the near future. The TerrorDome was announced on the May1 episode of Impact!, and the participants were announced on the May8 episode. The participants were Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt.|$|E
5|$|Another rivalry {{leading up}} to the event was between Johnny Nitro and Jeff Hardy. In September 2006, Hardy {{challenged}} Nitro numerous times for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, but failed to win it due to repeated interference by Melina (Melina Perez) (Nitro's then-girlfriend). Hardy finally defeated Nitro to win the title on the October 2 edition of Raw. On the November 6 edition of Raw, Eric Bischoff, the Raw authority figure for the night, scheduled a match between Hardy and Nitro for the title. In the match, Melina interfered and caused Nitro to get disqualified. Due to WWE rules, a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission, as a result, Hardy retained his title. Bischoff then scheduled a No Disqualification match, which Nitro won after interference from Melina. The following week, Hardy and Nitro were scheduled in a Ladder match, a match where the contestant that climbs a ladder and retrieves an item (usually a title belt) <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> the ring is the winner. Hardy won the match and the title. On the November 27 episode of Raw, Nitro and his former tag team partner Joey Mercury, as MNM, accepted The Hardys open challenge for WWE's December pay-per-view, December to Dismember, which the Hardys came out victorious. The Hardys won the match. At Armageddon another one of WWE's December pay-per-views, MNM and The Hardys competed in a Four team Ladder match also involving Dave Taylor and William Regal and WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. London and Kendrick won the match and retained their titles. During the match, Mercury legitimately broke his nose when he was struck in the face with a ladder, when Jeff jumped off the top rope. On the December 18 edition of Raw, Nitro challenged Hardy to a Steel Cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against the edges of the wrestling ring, for the Intercontinental Championship, which Hardy accepted. The match then was scheduled for New Year's Revolution.|$|E

25|$|The Ojibwe crafted the dreamcatcher. They {{believe that}} if one is <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> {{the head of a}} sleeper, it will catch and trap bad dreams, {{preventing}} them from reaching the dreamer. Traditional Ojibwe use dreamcatchers only for children, as they believe that adults should be able to interpret their dreams, good or bad, and use them in their lives.|$|E
25|$|It was {{believed}} that the gift of second sight came from the devil; as protection, a silver coin was {{used to make a}} cross above the palm of a Gypsy fortune-teller, thus dispelling any evil. In Japan, Korea and Indonesia, coins were made tied together to form sword shapes which were thought to terrify, and therefore ward off, evil spirits. They were also <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> the beds of sick people to drive off the malevolent spirits who were responsible for the illness.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the manager of the life preserver manufacturer placed iron bars inside the cork preservers to meet minimum weight requirements at the time. Many of the life preservers had been filled with cheap and less effective granulated cork and brought up to proper weight by the inclusion of the iron weights. Canvas covers, rotted with age, split and scattered the powdered cork. Managers of the company (Nonpareil Cork Works) were indicted but not convicted. The life preservers had been manufactured in 1891 and had <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> the deck, unprotected from the elements, for 13 years.|$|E

25|$|As such, {{he avoided}} any realist scenery or props. Instead, the set, {{designed}} by Sally Jacobs, {{was a simple}} white box, with no ceiling and two doors. In Stratford, black drapes were <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> the box to hide the stage machinery; on tour, Brook decided to remove them, leaving stagehands and lighting technicians visible. The purpose of this was to return the stage to {{the simplicity of the}} Elizabethan theatre, in which there was little scenery and the sense of location was generated by the poet's words. However, this approach was blended with modern elements: the trees of the forest were represented by giant slinky toys, and Titania's bower was a huge red feather.|$|E
25|$|Yorishiro are, however, most {{numerous}} in people's homes. During the New Year's holidays people decorate their entrances with kadomatsu, {{which are}} the yorishiro of the new year's kami. Kamifuda, pieces of paper representing the kami, are <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> the door. There are kami who dwell in the toilet (benjō-gami) and in the well (suijin). The kamado-gami lives in the oven, and its function {{is to protect the}} house from fires. Other common yorishiro are the small altar called kamidana and the butsudan, which is an altar for the dead. (Butsudan were originally meant just for Buddhist worship, but now often contain also spirit tablets called ihai, which are yorishiro used to recall the spirits of one's dead ancestors). In shops one often sees clay cats with a raised paw called maneki-neko or rake-like bamboo objects called kumade supposed to attract good business.|$|E
25|$|McKim's Grand Staircase {{adopted the}} Imperial stair form: a central run {{beginning}} {{on the south}} and rising to a landing on the north, with double runs doubling back to the south as it rises to the second floor. Formal in plan, its relatively narrow opening into the Cross Hall limited visibility of the President, First Lady and their official guests. McKim's Grand Staircase was entered through an arched opening with the first two steps protruding into the Cross Hall. A decorated wrought iron gate on the State Floor was normally kept closed except during state ceremonies. A pair of niches flanked the center run and the first course used a heavy crimson silk cord as a decorative railing. The stair was constructed in Joliet marble and covered in a crimson stair carpet. A lantern similar to one selected by McKim for the Entrance Hall was <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> the landing.|$|E

500|$|Another {{attitude}} {{to the issue}} was shown by Morritt, who wrote to Sir Walter Scott of his [...] "fine painting of Venus' backside", which he <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> his main fireplace, so that [...] "the ladies may avert their downcast eyes without difficulty and connoisseurs steal a glance without drawing the said posterior into the company".|$|E
500|$|The dove of the Holy Spirit hovers {{inside a}} rainbow-hued {{circle of light}} {{directly}} above the Virgin's head. Its placement and size is unusual for art of the period. It is unlike anything found in van der Weyden, and never repeated in Memling's work, but reminiscent of van Eyck's dove in the Ghent Altarpiece's [...] Annunciation panel. Its shape is found in medallions <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> beds at that time, and thus seems {{in keeping with the}} domestic interior.|$|E
500|$|The 31st Tank Brigade reported: [...] "We {{suffered}} {{heavy losses}} in tanks through enemy artillery and aircraft.

[...] The tank brigade also reported: [...] "our own air cover was fully absent until 13:00." [...] The 5th Guards Tank Army reported: [...] "the enemy's aircraft literally <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> our combat formations throughout the entire battle, while our own aircraft, and particularly the fighter aviation, was totally insufficient." ...|$|E

500|$|Pre-renovation Nokomis {{featured}} a hanging sculpture called Wind and Water Chime which <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> a fountain. Classified as a , {{a piece of}} artwork similar to a mobile only not intended to move, Wind and Water Chime consisted of 4,000 individual components, including small brass and phosphorus bronze rectangles strung on [...] of filament lines. The piece was designed and built by Don Celender, a conceptual artist who taught at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The installation was intended to evoke the nearby Minnehaha Falls, which, like Nokomis, was referenced in Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha.|$|E
500|$|As part of Japanese New Year celebrations, people queue to {{ring the}} temple bells 108 times in a {{ceremony}} known as the 108 peals of the bell are intended to purge humanity of the 108 earthly temptations. During the Buddhist Bon Festival, a special type of bonshō called an [...] is rung. This bell is <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> a well, and {{it is believed that}} the sound of the bell resonates down the well into the underworld, to summon the spirits of the dead. At the end of the festival, another bonshō, called an , is rung to send the spirits back and to represent the end of the summer.|$|E
500|$|The street {{along the}} south side of the Mall of America, the former site of Metropolitan Stadium, in Bloomington, Minnesota was named [...] "Killebrew Drive" [...] in his honor. Banners that <b>hung</b> <b>above</b> the Metrodome's outfield upper deck, {{resembling}} baseball cards, showed the retired numbers: Killebrew (3), Rod Carew (29), Tony Oliva (6), Kent Hrbek (14) and Kirby Puckett (34). In 1999, he was ranked 69th on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball's All-Century Team. When the Twins moved into Target Field in 2010, Gate 3 on the southeast (centerfield) side of the stadium was named in his honor. There are also corresponding gates for the team's other retired numbers. Killebrew Canyon at Heavenly Mountain Resort is also named after the baseball star, who skied the outer limits of the resort after his retirement from baseball.|$|E
60|$|For {{some moments}} York held him quietly thus, looking in his face. Afar, {{the stroke of}} a wood-man's axe--a mere phantom of sound--was all that broke the stillness.
