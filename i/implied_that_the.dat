5|$|The 1979 film Escape from Alcatraz {{depicts the}} escape. It stars Clint Eastwood, Fred Ward, and Jack Thibeau as Frank Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin, respectively. Allen West was played by Larry Hankin; his character's name {{was changed to}} Charley Butts. The film <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> escape had been successful.|$|E
5|$|This {{narrative}} for Tommy {{is set in}} {{deep space}} in a small, self-contained biosphere bubble spaceship. Jackman's character in this plot is alone, flying in outer space toward the golden nebula of Xibalba with a large tree and a few personal effects comprising his ship. While traveling, he meditates, performs t'ai chi, grows mushrooms and cuts pieces of bark from the tree for nourishment. He also converses with apparitions of Izzi. It is <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tree within the biosphere also represents Izzi and that Tommy has been transporting it to Xibalba {{with the hope that}} she will be restored to him. Tommy is also shown to have applied extensive, incremental tattooed ring patterns to both of his arms similar to the tattoo of his engagement ring from Izzi in 2006; it is <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tattoos mark the passage of time on his journey in 2500.|$|E

5|$|J Duncan M Derrett, a {{professor}} of Oriental Laws, states that chapter 2.8 of the text discusses three kinds of constitutions and recommends that the king should delegate large responsibilities to their ministers, a system that <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kingdom was virtually ruled through the ministers. The Manasollasa gives a significant role to an astrologer in the council of advisors to the king who would forecast the auspicious time to respond to an attack, which Hartmut Scharfe, {{a professor}} of Indo-European Studies, states proved disastrous during Muslim and foreign invasion of the Deccan peninsula.|$|E
5|$|James E. Rhoads, an {{astronomer}} at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, analyzed the burst and determined {{that it was not}} strongly beamed. Further analysis by Frail and his colleagues indicated that the total energy released by the burst was approximately 5×1050ergs (5×1043J), and Rhoads determined that the total gamma-ray energy was approximately 3×1050erg (3×1043J). This <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Albuera {{had little}} effect on the overall course of the war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most of the blame for the losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on 15 February, {{both the}} British and French forces raised their colours. Dance hoped to persuade Linois that his ships {{included}} some fully armed warships and he therefore ordered the brig Ganges {{and the four}} lead ships to hoist blue ensigns, {{while the rest of}} the convoy raised red ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection. Dance was unknowingly assisted by the information that had reached Linois at Batavia, which claimed that there were 23 merchant ships and the brig in the convoy. Dance had collected six additional ships during his journey, and the identity of these were unknown to the French, who assumed that at least some of the unidentified vessels must be warships, particularly as several vessels had been recently painted at Canton to resemble ships of the line.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner has {{suggested}} that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely read book entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to the {{continent}} from England, Henry sought to secure his French lands and quash any potential rebellion. As a result, in 1154 Henry and Louis agreed a peace treaty, under which Henry bought back the Vernon and the Neuf-Marché from Louis. The treaty appeared shaky, however, and tensions remained—in particular, Henry had not given homage to Louis for his French possessions. In an attempt to improve relations, Henry met with Louis at Paris and Mont-Saint-Michel in 1158, agreeing to betroth Henry's eldest living son, the Young Henry, to Louis's daughter Margaret. The marriage deal would have involved Louis granting the disputed territory of the Vexin to Margaret on her marriage to the Young Henry: while this would ultimately give Henry the lands that he claimed, it also cunningly <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Vexin was Louis's to give away in the first place, in itself a political concession. For a short while, a permanent peace between Henry and Louis looked plausible.|$|E
5|$|The First Prussian Uprising was {{influenced}} by three major events. Firstly, the Teutonic Knights lost the Battle of the Ice on Lake Peipus to Alexander Nevsky in April 1242. Secondly, southern Poland was devastated by a Mongol invasion in 1241; Poland lost the Battle of Legnica and the Teutonic Knights lost {{one of its most}} trusted allies that often supplied troops. Thirdly, Duke Swantopolk II of Pomerania was fighting against the Knights, who supported his brothers' dynastic claims against him. It has been <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new castles of the Knights were competing with his lands over the trade routes along the Vistula River. While some historians embrace the Swantopolk–Prussian alliance without hesitation, others are more careful. They point out that the historical information came from documents written by the Teutonic Knights and must have been ideologically charged to persuade the Pope to declare a crusade not only against the pagan Prussians but also against the Christian duke.|$|E
5|$|There are {{dynamical}} forces {{acting on}} the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the rate of increase of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> present-day rate of increase of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E

5|$|There is {{very strong}} {{evidence}} that comets have previously been fragmented and collided with Jupiter and its satellites. During the Voyager missions to the planet, planetary scientists identified 13 crater chains on Callisto and three on Ganymede, the origin of which was initially a mystery. Crater chains seen on the Moon often radiate from large craters, and {{are thought to be}} caused by secondary impacts of the original ejecta, but the chains on the Jovian moons did not lead back to a larger crater. The impact of SL9 strongly <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chains were due to trains of disrupted cometary fragments crashing into the satellites.|$|E
5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} {{back down to the}} sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal {{proceedings}} in 2001 against Burger King's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter-claim {{that the company had}} violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company to limit the number of new Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.|$|E

5|$|Between 8 and 10 May 1926, regular {{elections}} to the Third Seimas were held. For {{the first time}} since 1920, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, which strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy, did not obtain a majority. The Lithuanian people were disillusioned with this party, as its members had been involved in several financial scandals: Juozas Purickas had been using his diplomatic privileges in Moscow to deal in cocaine and saccharin; Eliziejus Draugelis and Petras Josiukas had purchased cheap low-quality smoked pig fat from Germany instead of buying from Lithuanian farmers; and the Minister of Finance, Vytautas Petrulis, had transferred a large sum of money from the state budget to his personal account. The party's strategies for coping with an economic crisis were perceived as ineffective. An additional tension arose when the Concordat of 1925 between Poland and the Holy See unilaterally recognized Vilnius as an ecclesiastical province of Poland, despite Lithuanian requests to govern Vilnius directly from Rome. Although it was not traditionally a Vatican policy to establish an arrangement of this type, the decision was objected to strongly by many Lithuanians. The decision <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pope had recognized Polish claims to Vilnius, and this created a loss of prestige for the Christian Democrats. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were severed, and they did not improve when Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized Lithuanian ecclesiastical provinces in April 1926 without regard to Lithuanian proposals and demands.|$|E
5|$|Double Fine {{believed}} they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to Brütal Legend after the game's release, and had invested {{a great deal of}} development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled. Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what Brütal Legend contained. The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus. Schafer further noted {{that at the end of}} the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus. Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely be used due to Dio's death.|$|E
5|$|Having ascertained the {{identity}} of the ships Dance signalled for his merchants to form the line of battle, and continued their heading, while the French closed, but made no move to attack. Dance used the delay to gather his ships together so the stronger East Indiamen stood between the French and the weaker country ships. The merchants continued on towards the straits, followed by Linois, who was trying to gauge the strength of the convoy. There were more ships in the convoy than he had expected, and taken in by Dance's manoeuvres and the painted gunports, Linois suspected that several warships were escorting them. He seemed to be confirmed in his suspicions when at dawn on 15 February, both forces raised their colours. Dance ordered the brig Ganges and the four lead ships to hoist Blue Ensigns, {{while the rest of the}} convoy raised Red Ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Peter Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection.|$|E
