40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} combined glimepiride and metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Materials and methods. A multi-centre, open-label, prospective, observational study was conducted. A total of 1200 patients with T 2 DM inadequately controlled with metformin, glimepiride or combination of metformin + glimepiride were enrolled. Change in serum glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial blood glucose (PPG) levels; weight; waist circumference and hypoglycemic episodes were evaluated. Results. Baseline HbA 1 c levels (8. 24 % ± 0. 42 %) were significantly reduced after 12 weeks of treatment (7. 48 % ± 0. 48 %) {{and at the end}} of the study (6. 88 % ± 0. 56 %). Target HbA 1 c levels (≤ 7 %) were achieved in 65. 1 % of patients at the final visit at 24 weeks. FPG and PPG levels decreased by 1. 45 ± 1. 14 mmol/l and 2. 17 ± 1. 27 mmol/l respectively (p < 0. 001). No severe hypoglycemic <b>events</b> were <b>reported.</b> <b>Body</b> mass index reduced by 0. 85 ± 1. 28 kg/m 2 (p < 0. 001). Conclusion. Combined glimepiride and metformin therapy significantly improved long-term glycemic control in patients with T 2 DM during the period of 24 weeks without additional risk of hypoglycemic events or weight gain. </p...|$|R

40|$|While {{surveying}} measured {{weight is}} widely unpractical in national samples, self-reported weight {{is a simple}} and inexpensive method of collecting data. This paper deals with data quality of <b>reported</b> <b>body</b> weight in the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). Previous research shows that data on <b>reported</b> <b>body</b> weight are plagued by systematic misreporting. This bias {{is said to be}} the consequence of the sensitive nature of information on body weight. Numerous studies on survey response suggest that certain modes of data collection are more conducive than others for probing sensitive information. This paper investigates the effect of the anonymity of the interview setting, characteristics of the interviewer and respondents' familiarization with the SOEP, as an indicator of the trust in the relevance and the confidentiality of the survey, as factors that may impinge on <b>reported</b> <b>body</b> weight. Findings of this paper show that refusals of the <b>reported</b> <b>body</b> weight occur infrequently (in less than 1 % of the cases). Moreover, characteristics of interviewers account for only a small fraction of the variance in <b>reported</b> <b>body</b> weight (roughly 1 %). Yet the hypothesis that the absence of an interviewer in self administrated interviews increases <b>reported</b> <b>body</b> weight can be confirmed. This interview effect, however, occurred in men only. On average, male respondents in anonymous interview settings <b>report</b> a <b>body</b> weight which is 1 kg more than they would report in other settings. The repeated participation of respondents in the SOEP increases their <b>reported</b> <b>body</b> weight, a finding which suggests a positive panel effect on respondents' willingness to disclose sensitive information. <b>Reported</b> <b>body</b> weight; Interview effects; Interviewer effects; Respondent behaviour; Survey response; Multilevel modeling...|$|R

30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are application-dependent networks. An application may require general event region information, per-node event region information, or prioritized event information {{in case of}} multiple events. All event flows are subject to congestion in wireless sensor networks. This {{is due to the}} sudden impulse of information flow from a number of event nodes to a single destination. Congestion degrades system throughput and results in energy loss of nodes. In this paper, we present a multievent congestion control protocol (MCCP) for wireless sensor networks. MCCP supports multiple <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> modes, that is, general <b>event</b> <b>reporting,</b> per-node fair <b>event</b> <b>reporting,</b> and prioritized multiple <b>event</b> <b>reporting.</b> MCCP efficiently mitigates congestion and provides output according to selected <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> mode. MCCP uses hop-by-hop packet delivery time and buffer size as the basic metrics for congestion detection. Moreover, we introduce a schedule-based scheme at the transport layer for rate assignment and ordered delivery of event packets to underlying routing layer. This helps to avoid packet collisions and increases the packet delivery ratio even in high densities. Detailed simulation analysis confirms that MCCP decreases packet drops and provides high packet delivery ratio (above 90 %) for multiple <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> modes.|$|R

5000|$|The PRR {{is defined}} as the ratio between the {{frequency}} with which a specific adverse <b>event</b> is <b>reported</b> for the drug of interest (relative to all adverse <b>events</b> <b>reported</b> for the drug) and the frequency with which the same adverse <b>event</b> is <b>reported</b> for all drugs in the comparison group (relative to all adverse events for drugs in the comparison group). For example, suppose that nausea was reported 83 times for a given drug of interest, out of 1356 adverse <b>events</b> <b>reported</b> for the drug. Thus the proportion of adverse events of nausea for this drug is 83/1356 = 0.061. Suppose that we wish to compare the drug of interest to a class of drugs, for which nausea was reported as an adverse event 1489 times, out of 53789 total adverse <b>events</b> <b>reported</b> for drugs in the class. Thus, nausea was reported with proportion 1489 / 53789 = 0.028 for the class of drugs. The PRR in this case is 0.061 / 0.028 = 2.18. This tells us that nausea was reported more than twice as frequently (among all adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports)</b> for the drug of interest compared to drugs in the comparison group.|$|R

40|$|AbstractMost {{healthcare}} {{systems have}} implemented patient safety <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> systems to identify safety hazards. Searching the safety event data to find related patient safety reports and identify trends is challenging given {{the complexity and}} quantity of these reports. Structured data elements selected by the event reporter may be inaccurate and the free-text narrative descriptions are difficult to analyze. In this paper we present and explore methods for utilizing both the unstructured free-text and structured data elements in safety <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> to identify and rank similar events. We evaluate the results of three different free-text search methods, including a unique topic modeling adaptation, and structured element weights, using a patient fall use case. The various search techniques and weight combinations tended to prioritize {{different aspects of the}} <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> leading to different search and ranking results.

40|$|Background/Aim. The {{provision}} of safe healthcare {{is considered a}} priority in European Union (EU) member states. Along with other preventative measures in healthcare, the EU also strives to eliminate the “causes of harm to human health”. The aim of this survey {{was to determine whether}} safety culture, supervisors and communication between co-workers influence the number of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> submitted to the heads of clinical departments and to the management of an institution. Methods. This survey is based on cross-sectional analysis. It was carried out in the largest Slovenian university hospital. We received 235 completed questionnaires. Respondents included professionals in the fields of nursingcare, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and radiological technology. Results. Safety culture influences the number of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> submitted to the head of a clinical department from the organizational point of view. Supervisors and communication between co-workers do not influence the number of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports.</b> Conclusion. It can be concluded that neither supervisors nor the level of communication between co-workers influence the frequency of adverse <b>event</b> <b>reporting,</b> while safety culture does influence it from an organizational point of view. The presumed factors only partly influence the number of submitted adverse <b>event</b> <b>reports,</b> thus other causes of under-reporting must be sought elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Web Services are an XML {{technology}} recently {{viewed as}} capable of being used for network management. A key aspect of WS in this domain is <b>event</b> <b>reporting.</b> WS-based {{research in this area}} has produced a collection of notification specifications, which consider even aspects such as filtering to reduce machine and network resource consumption. Still though, additional aspects need to be addressed if WS <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> is to be used efficiently for network management. This paper borrows an idea in network management that of policy based task delegation and applies {{it in the context of}} WS-based management by using the WS-Notification standard messages, to increase <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> efficiency. More specifically, we are adding functionality to the entity that produces events making it capable of performing a set of tasks apart from simple ones such as collecting and reporting notification data. This functionality allows an entity, such as a manager, capable of delegating tasks of various complexities to an <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> entity where they can be performed dynamically. As a proof of concept that the approach is feasible and increases efficiency we analyze a complex <b>event</b> <b>reporting</b> scenario where task delegation is used. We compare this approach for performance to a plain WS-based event system and also to simple SNMP traps. ...|$|R

The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) has developed a Windows based database called “ASKEN” during later years. In this database more than 12 000 <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> are stored sorted in three categories, category 1, 2 and 3. The database contains events from the start of Oskarshamn 1 in 1972 till present time. All nuclear power plants in Sweden are obliged to report any deficiency in their barriers and/or the defense in depth in obedience to SSMFS 2008 : 1. When a failure is detected or there is reasonable suspicion of a deficiency, the <b>event</b> <b>report</b> should be classified as a deficiency of category - 1, 2 or 3 [1]. The <b>event</b> <b>reports</b> are logged and archived in the register of SSM.
