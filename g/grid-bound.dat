40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} about necessary conditions {{to achieve the objective}} of a high level of consumer protection {{in the context of the}} ongoing internal electricity market taking into account the <b>grid-bound</b> electricity supply, which is characterized by the natural monopoly of regulated networks as well as by competition for the homogeneous product electricity. It evaluates the relationship between effective competition and energy sector-specific consumer protection taking into account the energy-specific regulatory law and examines in detail the regulations of the Directive 2009 / 72 /EC concerning consumer protection under the perspective of enabling the responsible and informed consumer to operate as a self-determined market participant and so shape the market actively towards its completion. After art. 114 TFEU as the existing central norm concerning the alignment of the internal energy market is distinguished from other possible competence rules like the new energy sector-specific competence title of art. 194 TFEU the requirements developed by the ECJ case law concerning art. 114 TFEU from the point of view of the energy sector-specific consumer protection are presented. The thesis clarifies both to what extent in Directive 2009 / 72 /EC codified consumer rights are suitable to achieve [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Having been crafted {{to welcome}} a new {{scientific}} journal, this paper looks forward but requires no special prerequisite. The argument builds on a technical wrinkle (used earlier but explained here fully {{for the first}} time), namely, the author’s <b>grid-bound</b> variant of Brownian motion B(t). While B(t) itself is additive, this variant is a multiplicative recursive process the author calls a ‘‘cartoon. ’’ Reliance on this and related cartoons allows a new perspicuous exposition of the various fractal/multifractal models for the variation of financial prices. These illustrations do not claim to represent reality in its full detail, but suffice to imitate and bring out its principal features, namely, long tailedness, long dependence, and clustering. The goal is to convince the reader that the fractals/multifractals are not an exotic technical nightmare that could be avoided. In fact, the author’s models arose successively as proper, ‘‘natural,’’ and even ‘‘unavoidable’’ generalization of the Brownian motion model of price variation. Considered {{within the context of}} those generalizations, the original Brownian comes out as very special and narrowly constricted, while the fractal/multifractal models come out as nearly as simple and parsimonious as the Brownian. The cartoons are stylized recursive variants of the author’s fractal/multifractal models, which are even more versatile and realistic.

40|$|Energy use {{and supply}} are evident issues to {{consider}} for a sustainable development, where the economic, {{social and environmental}} aspects are all important. In large <b>grid-bound</b> systems, the supply of energy is usually a rather invisible activity and the contacts between household custo-mers and utilities are sometimes only repre-sented through the energy bill. In this thesis, three particular fields are emphasized where these interactions comes into focus: Electricity peak load problems and load manage-ment in households; Energy monitoring and feedback, and; The selling of district heating to households in de-tached house areas. Improved customer relations in these areas can both increase the energy utilities abilities to compete on the markets and to contri-bute to an increased sustainable development within the energy sector. The traditional ways to handle peak load problems in the Swedish electricity system have been to build new power plants and to reinforce the elec-tricity grid. However,there are many reasons why solutions should be sought for on the demand-side. This thesis discusses the issues of load management through technical load control of households’ electric heating systems and electric water heaters, and through indirect load management with different pricing of electricity. The new Swedish law about monthly accurate billing of electricity for household customers has influenced the electricity network owners to install new automatic meter reading (AMR) systems. Hourly metering can give raise to {{a new set of}} data about household electricity use, that can be utilised to provide detailed characteristics of load demand and consumption patterns and serve as a basis for customer segmentation. This information can be useful when developing new energy services, new pricing of electricity, new load management strategies and demand response programs. In this thesis, customer preferences towards feedback on electricity use and different types of billing are investigated and the results from this research can make a contribution to the knowledge of customers’ need and awareness of different kinds of feedback. Conversion of electric heating systems in detached houses to district heating can contribute to solve peak load problems, to lower emissions in the energy system and may constitute a new heat demand needed for new introduction of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants. Effective market strategies are important in order to achieve a high connection rate of household customers to the district-heating grid. Results from two studies in this thesis can contribute to the knowledge of customer preferences, attitudes and decision-making processes that play an important role for the development of more effective marketing strategies for district heating...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – A {{method for}} {{formation}} of a plasma emitter of a ribbon ion beam source, which em-ploys a two-stage electrode system of a glow dis-charge in a single-cusp linear magnetic field, has been proposed and analyzed. Electrons are emitted by a ribbon <b>grid-bounded</b> plasma cathode along magnetic field lines, are accelerated in a bipolar diode between the grid and the anodic plasma, and oscillate between the region of a strong magnetic field at the anode and the bipolar diode. Spatially inhomo-geneous plasma with a uniform distribu-tion of the plasma density maximum over the emis-sion slit is generated in the anodic region. The cur-rent of ions extracted from plasma accounts for 0. 5 – 1 of the plasma cathode emission current. A simple design, high energy efficiency of the emit-ter, a low content of metal ions in the plasma, and the possibility to generate long-length ribbon ion beams having a current equal to hundreds of mil-liAmps and a uniform lengthwise distribution of the current density for a lengths of ~ 1 m make the proposed emitter promising for technological applications. 1...|$|R
