5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she <b>experienced</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
5|$|Sunshine (1999)—a three-hour {{historical}} epic, and an English-language, international co-production—was {{viewed by}} many critics as Szabó’s most ambitious film, and, along with Mephisto, his most important. Hungary’s Jews had figured in either a marginal or coded fashion in several of Szabó’s earlier films, produced during the socialist period when discourse around {{the history of the}} country’s Jews was more circumscribed. In Sunshine, for the first time, Szabó focused explicitly on this aspect of Hungarian history, which he himself had <b>experienced</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child during the Arrow Cross dictatorship. Ralph Fiennes plays three generations in the Sonnenschein family as they experience the trials of twentieth-century Hungarian Jewish history, from the late Austro-Hungarian Empire through the Holocaust to the 1956 Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, the {{voluntary}} system of recruitment proved unable {{to sustain the}} force structure of the AIF, failing to provide sufficient replacements for the heavy casualties it sustained and requiring a number of units to be disbanded {{towards the end of}} the war. In mid-1918 it was decided to allow the men who had enlisted in 1914 to return to Australia for home leave, further exacerbating the manpower shortage experienced by the Australian Corps. Regardless, by the last year of the war the AIF was a long-serving force—even if it was a citizen army and not a professional one like the pre-war British Army—containing 141,557 men with more than two-years service, including, despite the heavy casualties suffered at Gallipoli in 1915 and on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917, 14,653 men who had enlisted in 1914. Battle hardened and <b>experienced</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result, this fact partially explains the important role the AIF subsequently played in the final defeat of the German Army in 1918.|$|E

25|$|Tics are {{described}} as semi-voluntary or unvoluntary, {{because they are not}} strictly involuntary—they may be <b>experienced</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> voluntary response to the unwanted, premonitory urge.

40|$|I conduct {{experiments}} to investigate how episodic knowledge obtained from prior <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> auditor or a manager affects audit committee members' judgment {{in supporting the}} auditor in a disagreement with management. This paper sheds light on the advantage of first-hand accounting-related experience in the important oversight task. It also brings to bear the potential benefit from direct manager <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> claimed by researchers and regulators. I find that the episodic knowledge obtained from prior <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> auditor, especially the experience of having been a diligent auditor, strengthens the degree of auditor support {{of participants in the}} role of an audit committee member. By contrast, the effect of episodic knowledge from first-hand <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> manager on the likelihood of auditor support varies with the manager type. While the episodic knowledge acquired from direct <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aggressive manager augments the level of auditor support, such knowledge attained by prior <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conservative manager has no significant effect.

25|$|These {{factors include}} {{genetics}} and brain dysfunction and are studied by neuroscience. Psychological theories focus on personality traits and mental {{characteristics of the}} offender.

25|$|As an example, {{consider}} two-stage linear programs.

25|$|For example, {{people with}} Tourette {{syndrome}} and related tic disorders make involuntary movements and utterances (called tics) {{despite the fact}} that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or unvoluntary, because they are not strictly involuntary: they may be <b>experienced</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> voluntary response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed. People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{study that}} used virtual reality {{technology}} to study reported déjà vu experiences supported this idea.

When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect—that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively <b>experienced</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe that}} poor and {{vulnerable}} families will fare much better under the Labour Party {{than they would}} under a Cameron-led Conservative Party. Gordon Brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures that will save as many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice.

David Cameron's promise of tax perks for the married, on the other hand, is reminiscent of the Conservative government I <b>experienced</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lone parent. It sends the message that the Conservatives still believe a childless, dual-income, but married couple is more deserving of a financial pat on the head than those struggling, as I once was, to keep their families afloat in difficult times.|$|E

25|$|The muscle {{weakness}} of botulism characteristically {{starts in the}} muscles supplied by the cranial nerves—a group of twelve nerves that control eye movements, the facial muscles and the muscles controlling chewing and swallowing. Double vision, drooping of both eyelids, loss of facial expression and swallowing problems may therefore occur. In addition to affecting the voluntary muscles, it can also cause disruptions in the autonomic nervous system. This is <b>experienced</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dry mouth and throat (due to decreased production of saliva), postural hypotension (decreased blood pressure on standing, with resultant lightheadedness and risk of blackouts), and eventually constipation (due to decreased forward movement of intestinal contents). Some of the toxins (B and E) also precipitate nausea, vomiting, and difficulty with talking. The weakness then spreads to the arms (starting in the shoulders and proceeding to the forearms) and legs (again from the thighs down to the feet).|$|E
25|$|Readers of the Historia Francorum {{must decide}} {{whether this is a}} royal history and whether Gregory was writing to please his patrons. It is likely that one royal Frankish house is more generously treated than others. Gregory was also a Catholic bishop, and his writing reveals views typical of someone in his position. His views on {{perceived}} dangers of Arianism (still strong among the Visigoths) led him to preface the Historia with a detailed expression of his orthodoxy on the nature of Christ. In addition, his ridiculing of pagans and Jews reflected how his works were used to spread the Christian faith. For example, in book 2, chapters 28-31, he describes the pagans as incestuous and weak and then describes the process by which newly converted King Clovis leads a much better life than that of a pagan and is healed of all the conundrums he <b>experienced</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pagan.|$|E
25|$|For humans, {{sexuality}} {{has important}} social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological reproduction. Sexual desire or libido, is <b>experienced</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bodily urge, {{often accompanied by}} strong emotions such as love, ecstasy and jealousy. The significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected {{in a number of}} physical features among them hidden ovulation, the evolution of external scrotum and penis suggesting sperm competition, the absence of an os penis, permanent secondary sexual characteristics and the forming of pair bonds based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other primates that often advertise estrus through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation, plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods. These adaptations indicate that the meaning of sexuality in humans is similar to that found in the bonobo, and that the complex human sexual behavior has a long evolutionary history.|$|E
