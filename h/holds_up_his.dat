500|$|In 2008, Gates {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. [...] The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation. As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a [...] "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a [...] "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about [...] "nothing" [...] (Seinfeld). In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.|$|E
2500|$|McIntyre {{asked what}} they would do if he induced his comrades to {{surrender}}. Kelly stated, [...] "I'll shoot no man if he <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hands", and that he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their guns or horses. McIntyre said that he would induce them to surrender if Kelly kept his word, and added that one of the two had many children. Kelly said, [...] "You can depend on us." [...] Kelly stated that Fitzpatrick was the cause of all this; that his mother and the rest had been unjustly [...] "lagged" [...] at Beechworth. He told McIntyre to leave the police force. McIntyre agreed, saying that he had thought about it for some time due to bad health. Ned asked McIntyre why their search party was carrying so much ammunition. McIntyre replied that it was to shoot kangaroos.|$|E

60|$|This is a Hippocampus, or sea-horse. He is {{a little}} fellow, {{only a few inches}} in length, but he is {{certainly}} a curiosity. With a head and neck very much like those of a horse, he seems to take pleasure in keeping himself in such a position as will enable him to imitate a high mettled charger to the greatest advantage. He curves his neck and <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> head in a manner which few horses adopt, unless they are reined up very tightly. I have seen these little fellows in aquariums, and have always regarded them as the most interesting of fishes.|$|E
