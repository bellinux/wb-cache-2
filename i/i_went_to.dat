5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E

He was careful with his huge fortune, though he had probably about three millions.|$|E

25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me.

25|$|But {{after seven}} months I {{dropped out of}} Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up with}} a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was {{going to take a lot}} more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out.

No one else, he said, would ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.|$|E
25|$|She {{was very}} {{beautiful}} girl, all my girls are beautiful. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> London {{with her in}} 1933.

I wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and she must have thought she was slipping.|$|E
25|$|After {{coming back}} to his grandfather, his family decided to board him to the United States for higher studies. He sailed to San Francisco in July 1912.

In a historical note by Baba Jwala Singh, what mentioned is that when <b>i</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Astoria, Oregon in December 1912 i found Kartar Singh working in a mill factory. Most of the people will say that he studied in the respective college but the college itself did not get any record of enrollment with his name.|$|E

However, I now have no further interest in leading the National Party any further.Three months later, Bjelke-Petersen called on voters at the federal by-election in Groom to support the Liberal candidate instead of the National contestant. Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and turned their backs on traditional conservative policies.|$|E
25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
