50|$|Hervey Bay is {{the whale}} {{watching}} capital of Australia, with <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> migrating {{along the coast}} between April and October every year. Researchers at the Oceania Project conducted a 14-year study which found the bay was an important social hub for <b>humpback</b> <b>whales.</b> Whale number have increased from about 2,000 in 1992, to around 7,000 in 2005.Hervey Bay is the resting place for <b>Humpback</b> <b>whales,</b> Mum's and Calves, {{they come to the}} Bay to rest and build up energy for their long travels back to Antarctica.

40|$|The waters {{surrounding}} Cape Verde comprise {{one of two}} known {{breeding grounds}} for <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> in the North Atlantic. The population remains very small and has apparently failed to recover since the cessation of whaling there. During the breeding seasons of 2011 and 2012, sighting surveys were carried out for <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> off Boa Vista, the easternmost island of the Cape Verde Island archipelago. The distribution and relative abundance of <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> and mother-calf pairs was investigated by plotting effort-corrected sightings using a 2 km 2 grid-square. The study area, a 206 km 2 region from the coastline up to 8 km offshore, covered the western half of Boa Vista where whales have previously been regularly recorded. Following 1, 954 km of search effort, 117 sightings of <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> were made. An encounter rate of 0. 11 whales per km was recorded for both years. It is hoped that these data may assist in implementing conservation measures to protect <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> and the habitat of Baia Sal Rei, {{which appears to be}} the single most important bay for winter breeding, calving and nursing <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> in the eastern North Atlantic...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{high risk}} of predation, {{dolphins}} often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks. Injured or ailing whales may also be attacked and eaten. A group was documented killing an ailing <b>humpback</b> <b>whale</b> (Megaptera novaeangliae) in 2006 near Hawaii. A scavenger, the tiger shark will feed on dead whales, and have been documented doing so alongside great whites.|$|E
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} rorquals, {{members of the}} family Balaenopteridae, which also {{includes}} the <b>humpback</b> <b>whale,</b> the blue whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whales. The family diverged from the other baleen whales in the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene, although it is not known when the members of these families further evolved into their own species.|$|E
5|$|In December 1883, a <b>humpback</b> <b>whale</b> {{appeared}} in the Firth of Tay off the shore of Dundee, at that time Scotland's major whaling port, and attracted much local interest. The whalers normally hunted in the Arctic, but as the whaling boats were in harbour for the winter, some of the whalers decided to hunt this animal in their own waters.|$|E
40|$|Trophic {{levels of}} 1, 105 <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> from six {{geographically}} and isotopically distinct North Pacific feeding groups were calculated using δ 15 N of <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> and regional primary consumers. The overall mean trophic level for North Pacific <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> was 3. 6 ± 0. 02, indicating {{a diet of}} both fish and zooplankton, and, thus, supporting assumptions of <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> as generalist predators. The highest mean trophic level was calculated for the north Gulf of Alaska group (4. 0 ± 0. 03), while the lowest was found for the Russian and the western Aleutian Islands group (3. 3 ± 0. 08). Differences in mean trophic levels suggest that feeding groups differ {{in the proportion of}} fish and zooplankton in their diets...|$|R

5|$|The Tay Whale, {{known locally}} as The Monster, was a <b>humpback</b> <b>whale</b> that swam into the Firth of Tay of eastern Scotland in 1883.

It was towed into Dundee by a showman, John Woods, and exhibited on a train tour of Scotland and England.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. They are believed to exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, in which they sleep {{with half of the}} brain while the other half remains active. This behavior was only documented in toothed whales until footage of a <b>humpback</b> <b>whale</b> sleeping (vertically) was shot in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Whale vocalization {{is likely}} to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the <b>humpback</b> <b>whale,</b> {{communicate}} using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. Humpback whales only have been heard making clicks, while toothed whales use sonar that may generate up to 20,000 watts of sound (+73dBm or +43dBw) and be heard for many miles.|$|E

5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the <b>Humpback</b> <b>Whale.</b> The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center (formerly the Virginia Marine Science Museum) is {{a popular}} {{aquarium}} near the oceanfront that features the 300,000-gallon Norfolk Canyon Aquarium, containing sand tiger, nurse and brown sharks, as well as sting rays and other large open-ocean dwellers. There is also a 70,000-gallon sea turtle aquarium, sea turtle hatchling laboratory, hands-on ocean exploration exhibits, jellyfish and octopus aquariums, and even a life-size model of a <b>humpback</b> <b>whale.</b> Other features include the Owls Creek salt marsh and a nature trail.|$|E
5|$|The {{blue whale}} is usually {{classified}} {{as one of}} eight species in the genus Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, Sibbaldus, {{but this is not}} accepted elsewhere. DNA sequencing analysis indicates that the blue whale is phylogenetically closer to the sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) than to other Balaenoptera species, and closer to the <b>humpback</b> <b>whale</b> (Megaptera) and the gray whale (Eschrichtius) than to the minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis). If further research confirms these relationships, {{it will be necessary to}} reclassify the rorquals.|$|E
30|$|Recently a new {{optimization}} algorithm called whale {{optimization algorithm}} (Mirjalili 2016) {{has been introduced}} to metaheuristic algorithm by Mirjalili and lewis. The whales {{are considered to be}} as highly intelligent animals with motion. The WOA is inspired by the unique hunting behavior of <b>humpback</b> <b>whales.</b> Usually the <b>humpback</b> <b>whales</b> prefer to hunt krills or small fishes which are close to the surface of sea. <b>Humpback</b> <b>whales</b> use a special unique hunting method called bubble net feeding method. In this method they swim around the prey and create a distinctive bubbles along a circle or 9 -shaped path.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1883, a <b>humpback</b> <b>whale</b> {{appeared}} in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to the beach at Stonehaven, near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with a tail 11 feet 4 inches wide. Struthers {{was not able to}} start dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and took it to his yard in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). The two populations, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan {{and the other in}} the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic, are thought to be genetically and physiologically dissimilar. The gray whale is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family. However, DNA analysis by studies, such as the one by Takeshi Sasaki (of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and colleagues, indicates certain rorquals, such as the <b>humpback</b> <b>whale,</b> Megaptera novaeangliae, and the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, are more closely related to the gray whale than they are to some other rorquals, such as the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata.|$|E

5|$|Cetaceans are widespread, but some, as {{with the}} mysticetes, specialise in certain environments. Most mysticetes prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on mammals, such as pinnipeds. Gray whales are {{specialized}} for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate {{every two to three}} years. Calves are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Some whales produce a variety of vocalizations, notably the songs of the <b>humpback</b> <b>whale.</b> Many species, mainly dolphins, are highly sociable, with some pods reaching over a thousand individuals.|$|E
5|$|Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, {{to prevent}} the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds. They will then stay there for {{a matter of months}} until the calf has {{developed}} enough blubber to survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. Until then, the calves will feed on the mother's fatty milk. With the exception of the <b>humpback</b> <b>whale,</b> it is largely unknown when whales migrate. Most will travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to Patagonia and western New Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.|$|E
5|$|Offshore: A third {{population}} of killer whales {{in the northeast}} Pacific was discovered in 1988, when a <b>humpback</b> <b>whale</b> researcher observed them in open water. As their name suggests, they travel far from shore and feed primarily on schooling fish. However, because they have large, scarred and nicked dorsal fins resembling those of mammal-hunting transients, {{it may be that}} they also eat mammals and sharks. They have mostly been encountered off the west coast of Vancouver Island and near Haida Gwaii. Offshores typically congregate in groups of 20–75, with occasional sightings of larger groups of up to 200. Currently, little is known about their habits, but they are genetically distinct from residents and transients. Offshores appear to be smaller than the others, and females are characterized by dorsal fin tips that are continuously rounded.|$|E
