25|$|A {{vacuum cleaner}} uses a partial vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first vacuum cleaner in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} vacuum cleaner, his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional vacuum cleaner which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first vacuum cleaner on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric vacuum cleaner in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized vacuum cleaner in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable vacuum cleaner was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the <b>dust</b> <b>bag.</b>|$|E

The design amasses awards from the Good Housekeeping Institute and was the first cylinder vacuum on the market to be credited with the British Allergy Foundation seal of approval among other organisations. By using the same capacity large <b>dust</b> <b>bag</b> as the X1 Automatic upright, this feature allowed buyers to independently choose between an upright vacuum or a more compact cylinder vacuum.

30|$|Selection of dust {{collector}} depends {{much on the}} dust type, effectiveness, cost, size, maintenance, etc. Beside meeting the requirement of the national work health standard, {{dust collector}}s used in tunneling must {{also be able to}} collect the dust with a diameter between 0.4 and 0.5  μm, workable in an environment with relative humidity of 90  % or above, and occupy a smaller space. Three type of dust collectors meet the above requirements including wet <b>dust</b> collector, <b>bag</b> <b>dust</b> collector, and franklinic dust collector. Compared to the other two types of collectors, the <b>bag</b> <b>dust</b> collector has advantages of high effectiveness, smaller space occupying, higher stability and reliability, lower noise, and easier maintenance.

50|$|Model 63: In 1953, Hoover debuted the 'deluxe' Model 63 for $116.95. It was {{the first}} Hoover to utilize a full wrap around bumper and a {{completely}} disposable <b>dust</b> <b>bag.</b> The cleaner was styled in two-tone baby blue (base) and navy blue (everything except the base). It was an extremely popular model and sold over four million units. The machine was produced from 1953 to 1956. It was sold, in smaller numbers, in the UK, as the model 638. Again, this machine was designed by Henry Dreyfuss.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, SEBO {{replaced}} the C series vacuum with the D1, D2, D3 and D4 series - the largest cylinder vacuum SEBO has ever produced for {{the domestic market}} and specifically designed for large homes. Designed in collaboration with Achim Heine, Professor of product design {{and member of the}} German Design Council, whose timeless design is famous with Braun's small appliances, this innovative new vacuum emanates form and function, led by SEBO's original design knowledge. For example, the circular front, with its patented airbelt bumper, is ideal for negotiating obstacles, houses an easy to remove filter inside, and allows a large capacity 6 litre disposable high filtration <b>dust</b> <b>bag.</b> An extra long 12m cable contributes to an incredible 15.5m cleaning range, twice the cord length that other German brands supply.|$|E
50|$|The first upright {{vacuum cleaner}} was invented in June 1908 by Canton, Ohio {{department}} store janitor and occasional inventor James Murray Spangler (1848-1915). Spangler was an asthmatic, and suspecting the carpet sweeper he was using at work {{was the cause of}} his ailment, he created a basic suction-sweeper by mounting an electric fan motor on a Bissell brand carpet sweeper then adding a soap box and a broom handle. After refining the design and obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper he set about producing it himself, assisted by his son, who helped him assemble the machines, and his daughter, who assembled the <b>dust</b> <b>bags.</b> Production was slow, just two to three machines completed a week.|$|R
50|$|Numatic {{have also}} made many vacuum {{cleaners}} differing from the 2010 range. Many {{of them are not}} sold as 2016. The Henry and Hetty vacuum cleaners have also gone beyond vacuum cleaners. They have since 2010 expanded to desktop cleaners, toys,spray mops, boxes, office file holders and a specially made Airo-Brush head has been made for the Henry. When the Henry vacuum cleaner was first released in 1981, consumer had a sticker placed on the Henry. This meant they had to register to the company for insured life of the vacuum. Accessories include stainless steel tubes, HepaFlo <b>dust</b> <b>bags,</b> an upholstery tool, a crevice tool, a Nuflex threaded hose, a double taper hose/full adapter, a Numatic Airo-Brush Head with rotating bristles(For HenryXtra), a soft dusting brush and an upholstery nozzle with a sliding brush.|$|R
30|$|Rock <b>dust</b> <b>bags</b> are {{extensively}} {{used in some}} {{counties to}} create barriers for stopping explosion propagation. In order to make this explosion mitigation measure effective, the barriers should be properly placed and a certain minimum pressure is required to activate them. Various reports show more failure than successes in using this explosion mitigation measure (Zou and Panawalage 2001). Most failures are attributed to improper location, improper design, poor installation, and inadequate maintenance. If the explosion is too weak to disperse the selves—often {{as a result of}} placing the rock dust barriers closer than 60  m from the ignition point, a failure may occur. In addition, if the pressure front or the flame front moves too fast or is too short, the flame front could have easily passed the barrier locations before the dispersion of inert material is completed (Dixon et al. 1994).|$|R
50|$|The {{hermaphrodite}} {{flowers are}} zygomorphic and threefold. The three 0.8 to 1.2 cm long sepals are fused, white, have fluffy hairs {{and the three}} calyx teeth are unequal. The three bright-yellow petals are fused into a corolla tube up to 3 cm long. The three corolla lobes have a length of 1.0 to 1.5 cm and are triangular with soft-spiny upper ends. While the average corolla lobe {{is larger than the}} two lateral, only the median stamen of the inner circle is fertile. The <b>dust</b> <b>bag</b> is spurred at its base. All other stamens are converted to staminodes. The outer staminodes are shorter than the labellum. The labellum is yellowish, with a yellow ribbon in its center and it is obovate, with a length from 1.2 to 2.0 cm. Three carpels are under a constant, trilobed ovary adherent, which is sparsely hairy. The fruit capsule opens with three compartments.|$|E
5000|$|The K1 and K3 series [...] "compact" [...] {{cylinder}} vacuum {{was launched}} in 2002, designed to offer domestic homes with a smaller version of the C series. Using a four layer filtration 3 litre <b>dust</b> <b>bag,</b> (also with the bag door forming part of {{the underside of the}} machine)and similar Hospital grade filter system developed on the C series, the K series was also awarded with the British Allergy Foundation seal of approval and carried on with the AirBelt Clean Air diffuser design. Unlike the C series, the K series has only 3 swivel castors. The K is designed to be space efficient and smaller than the C series. Initially fitted with an 1800 watt motor to compete in the market with rivals and featured a new 500gram lighter tube and hose system earned design awards for this model. Also equipped with a longer domestic market hose and 6 metres of cable length, the K series remains popular.|$|E
5000|$|A laser guide {{provides}} a precise visual indication {{of where the}} cut will be positioned on the workpiece in the current configuration. Some models provide a single reference line for {{one side of the}} kerf, while others provide two lines to reflect the total kerf width. A blade guard is a cover for the teeth of the cutting blade. Most modern miter saws have self-retracting blade guards, which automatically retract when the saw is lowered onto a workpiece and re-cover the blade when the saw is raised. It is very dangerous to use the saw if these guards are removed or damaged. A <b>dust</b> <b>bag</b> connects directly to the saw, and helps to collect sawdust away from the workpiece during cutting. Optionally, many manufacturers sell adapters to connect an industrial vacuum cleaner in lieu of a bag to capture more of the dust and simplify disposal. Dust removal with these saws is notoriously poor. A safety clamp helps to lock a workpiece into position prior to making a cut. This is an especially important feature when cutting smaller workpieces (eight inches or smaller). The miter table [...] is typically less than 24" [...] in diameter. Typically, the work will need to be supported on the far end to stabilize the piece while cutting.|$|E

50|$|Other {{benefits}} of an eco-house, {{aside from the}} obvious one of having minimal heating costs, are a healthy living environment. The heat recovery system can eliminate dampness and the moulds that are so often a health hazard. The air intake filters prevent dust coming in with the incoming fresh air and the internal vacuum cleaner system extracts dust {{from the house and}} vents it (via the <b>dust</b> collection <b>bag</b> and filter) to the outside, thus no microscopic particles of dust remain in the house.|$|R
40|$|The {{filtration}} efficiency of free-standing dust extractors fitted with filter bags {{of various types}} and challenged with wood dust of various grades has been measured. During each test, the air pressure inside the filter bag, the extractor air flow rate and the concentration of dust penetrating the filter bag were monitored. Needlefelt filter bags allowed a limited quantity of dust, usually at a concentration well below the maximum exposure limit (MEL) of 5 mgm ~ 3, to penetrate when they were clean and improved greatly as they became loaded with <b>dust.</b> Filter <b>bags</b> made from woven cotton let more <b>dust</b> through. Needlefelt <b>bags</b> with specially coated fibres were no more efficient than standard bags but those with a microporous membrane coating were highly efficient. However, an increase in {{filtration efficiency}} during loading was invariably accompanied {{by an increase in}} air pressure inside the filter bag and a drop in extractor air flow, all effects being more marked when fine dust was used. Some of the extractors leaked dust from around loosely fitting filter <b>bags</b> and <b>dust</b> collector <b>bags,</b> or through holes in the fan housing, indicating that not all aspects of design are ideal. Tests carried out on bags that had been used for long periods indicated that air entering the filter bag gives rise to an initial high external dust concentration, though this did not usually persist. Periodic cleaning of the bag is recommended. Vacuum cleaning the inside when the bag is removed from the cleaner almost restores its original condition, but results in the generation of large quantities of airborne dust. The use of a tool that fits inside the bag enables cleaning to be carried out effectively in situ without exposing the operator to significant con...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the level}} of damage an {{infestation}} can result in, much has been done over the years in the effort to manage, reduce, and eliminate the horn fly. Traditional methods were through the use of pour-ons, backrubbers and face powder bags, with products such as Co-Ral which is available as dust for face/horn flies. Self-applicator methods such as <b>dust</b> <b>bags</b> and backrubbers are used mainly for range or pasture herds, and are placed so that the animal cannot avoid coming into contact with it, such as at a gate through which animals pass. More recently, control of the horn fly by using ear tags on cattle has been extremely successful. The ear tags are made of a PVC matrix impregnated with pyrethroid, and can be effective for between 16 and 24 weeks. Originally, the ear tags were developed and used against such pests as ticks and by 1983 50% of cattle had ear tags. Long periods of such dosing resulted in the elimination of 95-99% of susceptible flies, but this strong selective pressure ended up resulting in the development of resistant strains of the flies. To combat this, the use of organophosphates and piperonyl butoxide as a synergist are now recommended to be alternated with pyrethroid to help slow resistance.

40|$|A {{series of}} psychophysical lifting studies was {{conducted}} to establish maximum acceptable weights of lift (MAWL) for three supply items commonly handled in underground coal mines (rock dust bags, ventilation stopping blocks, and crib blocks). Each study utilized 12 subjects, {{all of whom had}} considerable experience working in underground coal mines. Effects of lifting in four postures (standing, stooping under a 1. 5 m ceiling, stooping under a 1. 2 m ceiling, and kneeling) were investigated together with four lifting conditions (combinations of lifting symmetry and lifting height). The frequency of lifting was set at 4 per minute, and the task duration was 15 minutes. Posture significantly affected the MAWL for the rock <b>dust</b> <b>bag</b> (standing MAWL was 7 % greater than restricted postures and kneeling MAWL was 6. 4 % less than stooped); however, posture interacted with lifting conditions for both of the other materials. Physiological costs were found to be significantly greater in the stooped postures compared to kneeling for all materials. Other contrasts (standing versus restricted postures, stooping under 1. 5 m ceiling versus stooping under 1. 2 m ceiling) did not exhibit significantly different levels of energy expenditure. Energy expenditure was significantly affected by vertical lifting height; however, the plane of lifting had little influence on metabolic cost. Recommended acceptable workloads for the three materials are 20. 0 kg for the rock <b>dust</b> <b>bag,</b> 16. 5 kg for the ventilation stopping block, and 14. 7 kg for the crib block.

40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to {{persistent}} organic pollutants (POPs) such as brominated flame retardants (BFRs, specifically polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD)) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs, specifically perfluoroalkane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)). They are used in consumer products found in cars, offices, homes and day care centers. Diet was earlier {{thought to be a}} major human exposure route for legacy POPs, but does not account for body burdens found for many new POPs and indoor exposure from air and dust has been hypothesized as also important. In this thesis, BFRs in air and dust, and PFAAs in dust from different indoor microenvironments in Sweden were analysed, and the results used to estimate human exposure. BFRs and PFAAs were detected in dust from all microenvironments and PBDEs in all air samples. BFR and PFAA exposure occurs mostly in peoples’ homes with toddlers having higher intakes from dust ingestion than adults. Inhalation and dust ingestion play minor roles compared to diet for humans with median exposures, but in worst case scenarios, dust ingestion may be significant for {{a small part of the}} Swedish population. Sampling using home vacuum cleaner <b>bag</b> <b>dust</b> and researcher-collected above floor dust was compared. Correlations were seen for ∑OctaBDE and ∑DecaBDE but not for ∑PentaBDE and HBCD. Higher PBDE concentrations were found in above floor dust but higher HBCD concentrations were found in vacuum cleaner <b>bag</b> <b>dust.</b> BDE- 47 concentrations were correlated between vacuum cleaner <b>bag</b> <b>dust</b> and breast milk, indicating exposure through dust ingestion. Similar concentrations of PBDEs were measured in indoor and outgoing air from day care centers, apartment and office buildings. Indoor air explained 54 - 92 % of ∑PentaBDE and 24 - 86 % of BDE- 209 total emissions to outdoor air in Sweden, supporting the hypothesis that the indoor environment is polluting ambient air via ventilation systems.
