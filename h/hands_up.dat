5|$|Manos Arriba (English: <b>Hands</b> <b>Up)</b> is an {{extended}} play (EP) recorded by Dominican-American singer Chana, released on January 27, 2008, by Patacon Productions. Following the disbandment of Eden's Crush, Chana felt inspired to record and release Spanish-language music independently after she met producer Marthin Chan. She {{had been previously}} approached by executives from Latin music record labels, but sought a career in more alternative genres of music rather than conventional Latin pop.|$|E
5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as {{the worst part of}} the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E

5|$|In 324, Constantine I chose Byzantium {{to be the}} {{new capital}} of the Roman Empire, {{renaming}} it New Rome. Following the death of Theodosius I in 395 and the permanent division of the Roman Empire between his two sons, the city, which would popularly {{come to be known as}} Constantinople, became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. This empire, which would later be branded by historians as the Byzantine Empire, ruled most of the territory of present-day Turkey until the Late Middle Ages; although the eastern regions remained in firm Sasanian <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to the first half of the seventh century. The frequent Byzantine-Sassanid Wars, as part of the centuries long-lasting Roman-Persian Wars, fought between the neighbouring rivalling Byzantines and Sasanians, took place in various parts of present-day Turkey and decided much of the latter's history from the fourth century up to the first half of the seventh century.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of success}} {{exacerbated}} the tensions between the Muslims, leading to the rebellion of the Palermitans in 886 and again in 890, as manifold divisions—between the Arabs and Berbers, between the Sicilians and the Ifriqiyans, and between Palermitans and Arigentans—came to the fore. A full-scale civil war between Arabs and Berbers erupted in 898, and was not ended until Ibrahim II's son Abu'l-Abbas Abdallah captured Palermo in 900. Abdallah also won a string of victories against the Byzantines, until he was recalled to Ifriqiya to replace his father; Ibrahim then came to Sicily {{with a group of}} volunteers, and captured the last major Byzantine stronghold, Taormina, in August 902. Although a few strongholds in the northeast remained unconquered and in Christian <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to the fall of Rometta in 965, the fall of Taormina marked the effective end of Byzantine Sicily, and the consolidation of Muslim control over the island.|$|E
5|$|While the 6th Airborne Division {{were still}} {{fighting}} in Normandy, numerous plans to parachute the 1st Airborne Division into France were formulated, all to no avail. In June and July1944, the plans included Operation Reinforcement, {{which was a}} landing {{to the west of}} St Sauveur-le-Vicomte to support the US 82nd Airborne Division, and Operation Wild Oats to seize Carpiquet airfield in support of the First Canadian Army. There was also Operation Beneficiary, intended to support the American XX Corps in capturing St Malo, and Operation Lucky Strike which had the objective of seizing bridges across the River Seine at Rouen. In Operation Sword Hilt, the division was to isolate the port of Brest and destroy the Morlaix viaduct. Operation <b>Hands</b> <b>Up</b> was intended to support the US Third Army by seizing the Vannes airfield.|$|E

5|$|The {{project began}} after it emerged {{that the three}} IRA members shot in Gibraltar {{were found to be}} unarmed and not in {{possession}} of a bomb. The series' editor, Roger Bolton, dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain, where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team. The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in Belfast. Satisfied by the journalists' findings, Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme; as the British government refused to comment, Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings. The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 (just under two months after the shootings), despite two attempts by Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority postpone the broadcast. Using the eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government's version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme's findings: none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire, but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back, with their <b>hands</b> <b>up,</b> or after falling to the ground. The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton, who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts.|$|E

25|$|Modern boxers can {{sometimes}} be seen tapping their cheeks or foreheads with their fists in order to remind themselves to keep their <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> (which becomes difficult during long bouts). Boxers are taught to push off with their feet {{in order to move}} effectively. Forward motion involves lifting the lead leg and pushing with the rear leg. Rearward motion involves lifting the rear leg and pushing with the lead leg.

25|$|Three weeks later, on 30 April 1864, 200 warriors {{demonstrated}} {{their faith in}} divine protection when they marched on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9km north-west of New Plymouth. The redoubt, on the crown of a hill, was defended by 75 imperial soldiers and two Coehorn mortars. Atiawa Māori viewed {{the construction of the}} outpost on their land as a challenge and formed a war party of the best fighting men from west coast iwi. When they came under fire at close range, they shielded themselves from the fusillade only by holding their right <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> and chanting. As many as a fifth of the Māori force were killed in the assault.|$|E

25|$|Boxing is {{a combat}} form that {{is widely used}} in MMA {{and is one of}} the primary {{striking}} bases for many fighters. Boxing punches account for the vast majority of strikes during the stand up portion of a bout and also account for the largest number of significant strikes, knock downs and KOs in MMA matches. Several aspects of boxing are extremely valuable such as footwork, combinations, and defensive techniques like slips, head movement and stance (including chin protection and keeping <b>hands</b> <b>up)</b> commonly known as the Guard position. Boxing-based fighters have also been shown to throw and land a higher volume of strikes compared to other striking bases at a rate of 3.88 per minute with 9.64 per minute thrown (compared to Muay Thai at 3.46 and 7.50, respectively). Some fighters that are known for using boxing include Cain Velasquez, Nick Diaz, Junior dos Santos, B.J. Penn, Dan Hardy, Shane Carwin and Andrei Arlovski.|$|E
25|$|In Olai's account, {{the battle}} was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen {{on top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.|$|E
25|$|The video {{starts with}} a pink {{telephone}} ringing, where Amuro answers it. The scene pans out, and has Amuro exit her home (which is near a flower bouquet stand) with her friends surprising her on her birthday. After taking selfies, Amuro and two female bake-up dancers dance to the remaining part of the chorus. Amuro runs to a dressing room and picks out a pink mini-dress. Four back-up dancers than look at several other outfits on clothes rackings, and dance to the song. Amuro {{walks out of the}} dressing room in the pink mini-dress, and receives an invitation to her birthday. Two small children (one boy and one girl) walk Amuro into a small room, whilst two back-up dancers hold curtains. The curtains are pulled, and Amuro is seen behind them with balloons. The dancers and extra actors celebrate Amuro's birthday with balloons and confetti as she sings the song. Amuro and the back-up dancers perform during the last chorus, with the camera zooming out; the final scene has everyone putting their <b>hands</b> <b>up,</b> as the locations Amuro visited are circulated around a circle stage.|$|E

At 9:56 am, he attempted to carjack a yellow 1963 Jeep Gladiator on Archwood by shooting at the driver who fled on foot, three blocks east of where Phillips died. He quickly transferred all of his weapons and ammunition from the getaway car, {{but was unable to}} operate the Jeep due to him being unfamiliar with the stick-shift vehicle. As KCBS and KCAL helicopters hovered overhead, a patrol car driven by SWAT officers quickly arrived and stopped {{on the opposite side of}} the truck to where the Chevrolet was stopped. Mătăsăreanu left the truck, took cover behind the original getaway car, and engaged them for two-and-a-half minutes of almost uninterrupted gunfire. Mătăsăreanu's chest armor deflected a double tap from one of the SWAT officers, which briefly winded him before he continued firing. At least one SWAT officer fired his AR-15 below the cars and wounded Mătăsăreanu in his unprotected lower legs; he was soon unable to continue and put his <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> to show surrender.|$|E
