When a predator approaches (either the loon's nest or the loon itself), the common loon sometimes attacks the predator by rushing at it and trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks either at the predator's abdomen or the back of its head or neck.|$|E

5|$|Individual benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{different}} interactions with certain drugs. Depending on their metabolism pathway, benzodiazepines can be divided roughly into two groups. The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through glucuronidation, such as lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam, and, in general, <b>have</b> <b>few</b> drug interactions.|$|E
5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will <b>have</b> <b>few</b> side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (known as imino-Nazarov cyclization reactions) <b>have</b> <b>few</b> instances; {{there is}} one example of a generalized imino-Nazarov cyclization reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov reactions in the literature. Even these tend to suffer from poor stereoselectivity, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over-stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding cyclization.|$|E

The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.|$|E
5|$|All nemerteans move slowly, {{using their}} {{external}} cilia {{to glide on}} surfaces on a trail of slime, while larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans. A few species are scavengers, and a few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs. Some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans <b>have</b> <b>few</b> predators. Two species are sold as fish bait.|$|E

5|$|Anura {{is divided}} into three suborders that are broadly {{accepted}} by the scientific community, but the relationships between some families remain unclear. Future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships. The suborder Archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs. These are Ascaphidae, Bombinatoridae, Discoglossidae and Leiopelmatidae which <b>have</b> <b>few</b> derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages. The six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder Mesobatrachia are the fossorial Megophryidae, Pelobatidae, Pelodytidae, Scaphiopodidae and Rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic Pipidae. These have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders. Neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs, including most common species. Ninety-six percent of the over 5,000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales <b>have</b> <b>few</b> if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E
5|$|Elves <b>have</b> <b>few</b> children, {{as a rule}} (Fëanor and Nerdanel were an exception, conceiving seven sons), {{and there}} are {{relatively}} sizeable intervals between each child (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman). They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their libido wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E

5|$|Fishers <b>have</b> <b>few</b> predators besides humans. They {{have been}} trapped since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand {{that they were}} extirpated from several parts of the United States {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Conservation and {{protection}} measures have allowed the species to rebound, but their current range is still reduced from its historic limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some fur farmers attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt prices fell in the late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid human contact, encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.|$|E
5|$|From a {{husbandry}} {{point of}} view, hyenas are easily kept, as they <b>have</b> <b>few</b> disease problems {{and it is}} not uncommon for captive hyenas to reach 15–20 years of age. Nevertheless, the spotted hyena was historically scantily represented in zoos, and was typically obtained in order to fill empty cages until a more prestigious species could be obtained. In subsequent years, animals considered to be more charismatic were allocated larger and better quality facilities, while hyenas were often relegated to inferior exhibits. In modern times, the species faces spatial competition from more popular animals, especially large canids. Also, many captive individuals have not been closely examined to confirm their sexes, thus resulting in non-breeding pairs often turning out to be same-sexed individuals. As a result, many captive hyena populations are facing extinction.|$|E
5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and <b>have</b> <b>few</b> adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E
