5|$|Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) are {{designated}} by local authorities under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The local authority must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> {{control over the}} site, by owning or leasing it or having {{an agreement with the}} owner. LNRs are sites which have a special local interest either biologically or geologically, and local authorities have a duty to care for them.

25|$|These special coins <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> tender only in Finland, {{unlike the}} normal {{issues of the}} Finnish euro coins, which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> tender in every country of the Eurozone. This means that the {{commemorative}} coins made of gold and silver cannot be used as money in other countries. Furthermore, as their bullion value generally vastly exceeds their face value, these coins are {{not intended to be}} used as means of payment at all—although it remains possible. For this reason, they are usually named Collectors' coins.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{participate}} in this system, a union must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> registration (registro), must have an officially recognized right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements (titularidad), and must periodically re-register its officers and be accepted by the state (toma de nota). This system can be used to hobble independent unions not associated with the CTM or other federations that have established relations with the state, since all three members of these boards often have self-interested reasons for denying or delaying registration to rival unions.|$|E

Prior to this, the treaties explicitly stated that the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom each had their own separate legal personality, but remained silent over whether the European Union itself had one. They did mandate the EU [...] "to assert its identity on the international scene," [...] and permitted the European Union to enter into treaties. Brsakoska-Bazerkoska, and Choutheete and Ndoura argue that the EU <b>had</b> <b>an</b> implicit <b>legal</b> personality prior to the Treaty of Lisbon; the latter treaty also contained an express statement that the EU <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> personality.|$|R

25|$|Historically, {{paternity}} {{of children}} {{born out of}} adultery {{has been seen as}} a major issue. Modern advances such as reliable contraception and paternity testing have changed the situation (in Western countries). Most countries nevertheless <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> presumption that a woman's husband is the father of her children who were born during that marriage. Although this is often merely a rebuttable presumption, many jurisdictions have laws which restrict the possibility of legal rebuttal (for instance by creating a legal time limit during which paternity may be challengedsuch as a certain number of years from the birth of the child). Establishing correct paternity may have major legal implications, for instance in regard to inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, {{the issue}} of the {{development}} of the area's water resources, has been a critical issue in regional conflict and negotiations, initially involving Syria, Jordan and Israel. After the Six Day War, when Israel occupied the Palestinian territories, water use and sanitation have been closely linked to developments in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The water and land resources in the West Bank in particular are considered to constitute the major obstacle to the resolution of conflict in the area. Palestinians claim they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> right to ownership, or claim to use of three water sources in the area:(a)the groundwater reservoir of the Mountain Aquifer, the Gaza Strip Coastal Aquifer and the Jordan River to the amount of 700 MCM/Y, over 50% of natural water resources between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.|$|E

If Armand <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> right to something, this postulates that Theo <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> duty to Armand to uphold that right. Armand is therefore {{the beneficiary of}} the right and Theo is the duty-bearer in respect of the right. The first application issue to confront when considering {{the reach of the}} Bill of Rights is to identify the beneficiaries and the duty-bearers of the rights in the Bill of Rights.|$|R

25|$|Companies {{occupy a}} special place in private law, because they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> {{personality}} separate from those who invest their capital and labour to run the business. The general rules of contract, tort and unjust enrichment operate in the first place against the company as a distinct entity. This differs fundamentally from other forms of business association. A sole trader acquires rights and duties as normal under the general law of obligations. If people carry on business together with a view to profit, they are deemed to have formed a partnership under the Partnership Act 1890 section 1. Like a sole trader, partners will be liable on any contract or tort obligation jointly and severally in shares equal to their monetary contribution, or according to their culpability. Law, accountancy and actuarial firms are commonly organised as partnerships. Since the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, partners can limit the amount they are liable for to their monetary investment in the business, if the partnership owes more money than the enterprise has. Outside these professions, however, the most common method for businesses to limit their liability is by forming a company.|$|E
25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as transplant tourism. The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E
