25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output.

50|$|The 3.2 L Power Stroke is {{an inline}} five-cylinder engine that debuted in the U.S.-spec Transit for model year 2015. The engine is a {{modified}} version of the Ford Duratorq 3.2 L diesel engine that has been adapted to meet emissions in the United States. To aid in economy, emissions, and reduce NVH, it has a high pressure common rail fuel injection system and piezo injectors that can spray up to five different injections per compression event. It has a water cooled EGR system to reduce the temperature of the exhaust gas before being recirculated through the intake. A unique feature to the emissions system is that the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and the DPF have been combined into one singular unit as opposed to the traditional two separate units. Exhaust treatment continues with SCR which is done by the injection of diesel exhaust fluid in the exhaust to reduce NOx. The engine features a variable geometry turbo which allows for <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> tuning on the fly to increase power and fuel economy. The engine also features a variable-flow oil pump to avoid wasting mechanical energy pumping excessive amounts of oil. It has cast aluminum, low friction pistons with oil squirters to keep them cool during heavy-load conditions, a die cast aluminum cam carrier to stiffen up the valve train and reduce NVH, and to increase low end durability, the crankshaft is cast iron and the connecting rods are forged. The block itself is an extra rigid, gray cast iron with a closed deck. The power figures for the 3.2 L Power Stroke are 185 hp at 3,000 rpm and 350 lb-ft at 1,500-2,750 rpm.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explains}} {{the effect of}} various lubricant and engine temperatures on the intake mass air flow, engine noise and lubricant pressure behaviour of a motor-driven spark ignition engine. The lubricant pressure, engine noise and mass air flow changes were recorded under a steady state operating condition with an increased engine speed in which both the volume and temperature of the lubricant remained unchanged for each sets of test. The engine was driven by an electric motor at a wide-open throttle and a constant speed ranging from 500 to 3000 rpm with 500 rpm increment. The lubricant and cooling water were set at 32 °C (unheated) and 90 °C (heated) for each run. In general, {{the pressure of the}} lubricant was found to decrease for either increased engine speed or lubricant temperature. It was found that high lubricant viscosity produced high overall engine friction and resulted to a higher engine noise. Heated lubricant started off with a very low pressure with 0. 996 bar compared to unheated lubricant with 2. 497 bar in 500 rpm. Unheated engine lubricant recorded a peak noise of 107. 2 dB at 1500 rpm before it dropped momentarily before increased linearly beyond this speed.
