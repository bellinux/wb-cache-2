40|$|Induction motors (IMs) are {{commonly}} used in both industrial applications and household appliances. An IM online condition monitoring system is very useful to identify the IM fault at its initial stage, {{in order to prevent}} machinery malfunction, decreased productivity and even catastrophic failures. Although a series of research efforts have been conducted over decades for IM fault diagnosis using various approaches, it still remains a challenging task to accurately diagnose the IM fault due to the complex signal transmission path and environmental noise. The objective of this thesis is to develop a novel intelligent system for more reliable <b>IM</b> <b>health</b> condition monitoring. The developed intelligent monitor consists of two stages: feature extraction and decision-making. In feature extraction, a spectrum synch technique is proposed to extract representative features from collected stator current signals for fault detection in IM systems. The local bands related to <b>IM</b> <b>health</b> conditions are synchronized to enhance fault characteristic features; a central kurtosis method is suggested to extract representative information from the resulting spectrum and to formulate an index for fault diagnosis. In diagnostic pattern classification, an innovative selective boosting technique is proposed to effectively classify representative features into different <b>IM</b> <b>health</b> condition categories. On the other hand, <b>IM</b> <b>health</b> conditions can also be predicted by applying appropriate prognostic schemes. In system state forecasting, two forecasting techniques, a model-based pBoost predictor and a data-driven evolving fuzzy neural predictor, are proposed to forecast future states of the fault indices, which can be employed to further improve the accuracy of <b>IM</b> <b>health</b> condition monitoring. A novel fuzzy inference system is developed to integrate information from both the classifier and the predictor for <b>IM</b> <b>health</b> condition monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques and integrated monitor is verified through simulations and experimental tests corresponding to different IM states such as IMs with broken rotor bars and with the bearing outer race defect. The developed techniques, the selective boosting classifier, pBoost predictor and evolving fuzzy neural predictor, are effective tools that can be employed in a much wider range of applications. In order to select the most reliable technique in each processing module so as to provide a more positive assessment of <b>IM</b> <b>health</b> conditions, some more techniques are also proposed for each processing purpose. A conjugate Levebnerg-Marquardt method and a Laplace particle swarm technique are proposed for model parameter training, whereas a mutated particle filter technique is developed for system state prediction. These strong tools developed in this work could also be applied to fault diagnosis and other applications...|$|R

30|$|To {{tackle the}} {{aforementioned}} problems with IM fault detection using current signals, a harmonic synthesis (HS) technique is proposed {{in this work}} for incipient IM eccentricity fault detection. The contributions of the proposed HS technique lie in the following aspects: 1) a novel synthesis approach is proposed to integrate several fault harmonic series to recognize fault related features; 2) fault indicators are properly derived from local spectra for <b>IM</b> <b>health</b> condition monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed HS technique for IM eccentricity defect detection is verified experimentally under different IM conditions.|$|R

40|$|This study {{measures}} {{the process of}} convergence {{in the state of}} health among the provinces and regions of Spain during 1980 - 2001 in order to analyse the possible influence of the decentralisation of healthcare management to the regions in this period. Sigma and beta convergence models, traditionally employed in macroeconomics, have been used, taking Life Expectancy at Birth (LEB) and Infant Mortality (<b>IM)</b> as <b>health</b> indicators. The analysis was carried out at two territorial levels: provinces and regions. The results reveal that the process of decentralisation either does not affect convergence or leads to divergence in health. Indeed, in the case of IM the so-called change of role scenario seems to have occurred. Thus, certain provinces with initially poor indicators have improved, overtaking those that were originally in a better position. The final result, however, is of greater dispersion than initially.

In 1990, Boyer proposed four interrelated dimensions of scholarship: (1) discovery; (2) integration; (3) application; and (4) teaching. The challenge became the development of criteria and innovative and creative ways to assess community scholarship.

30|$|Intervention Mapping (IM) is {{a helpful}} {{protocol}} for planning behavior change interventions. Most of <b>IM</b> applications target <b>health</b> behavior, but the protocol {{can be applied}} to any situation in which behavior change is desirable. IM was developed in 1998 as a reaction to a lack of comprehensive frameworks for health promotion program planning. IM is characterized by three perspectives: a social ecological approach, participation of all stakeholders, and the use of theories and evidence. IM describes the process of program planning in six steps, with each step comprising several tasks. Completion of all steps creates a blueprint for designing, implementing and evaluating an intervention based on a foundation of theoretical, empirical and practical information. Three highlights are of particular relevance for using IM: identifying the determinants of the target behavior, taking into account the theoretical parameters while applying behavior change methods, and making sure that the intervention is implemented as planned.|$|R
40|$|The University of Michigan School of Public Health Preventive Medicine Residency (UMSPH PMR) Integrative Medicine Program (IMP) was {{developed}} to incorporate integrative medicine (<b>IM),</b> public <b>health,</b> and preventive medicine principles into a comprehensive curriculum for preventive medicine residents and faculty.

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose {{and a high}} risk of micro- and macrovascular complications. Prognosis depends to a substantial degree on self-management, that is, the adoption of practices to stabilize blood glucose and stave off co morbidities. This research set out to compare the narratives of people with good and poor glycaemic control (defined as 3 recent HBAIC readings 10 respectively), and of men and women. Participants (N= 32) were recruited from local diabetes hospital clinics, and interviewed using a biographic-narrative method. Interviews were analysed with the use of dialogical and phenomenological concepts including voice, emotional connection to truth, and time-space elaboration of narrative. As analysis proceeded, the search for differences in the talk of participant 'groups' shifted toward a situational understanding of health practice, as participants elucidated loci of time, space, and social context which made self-management (<b>im)</b> possible. <b>Health</b> psychological notions according to which internal psychological realities play a determining role in human action were thus questioned, and placed into their historical context. Chapter 1 outlines the thesis topic, and presents an argument for a critical health psychology. Chapter 2 presents a metasynthesis of previous qualitative research on type 2 diabetes self-management. Chapter 3 explores methodology, in particular interviewing technique and analytical approach to narrative. Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 present narrative analyses of the different 'groups', with the latter being a case study to explore in detail the changing ways in which self-management intertwines with a lived life. Chapter 8 brings strands of these analyses together, in particular to explore the importance of temporal and spatial disruptions to the experience of self-management throughout the narratives. And chapter 9 offers some tentative answers to the research questions, while discussing the findings in relation to current directions in UK health policy.
