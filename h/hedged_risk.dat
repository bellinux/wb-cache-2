50|$|The core {{activities}} of investment banks {{are subject to}} regulation and monitoring by central banks and other government institutions - {{but it has been}} common practice for investment banks to conduct many of their transactions in ways that do not show up on their conventional balance sheet accounting and so are not visible to regulators or unsophisticated investors. For example, prior to the 2007-2012 financial crisis, investment banks financed mortgages through off-balance sheet (OBS) securitizations (e.g. asset-backed commercial paper programs) and <b>hedged</b> <b>risk</b> through off-balance sheet credit default swaps. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, major investment banks were subject to considerably less stringent regulation than depository banks. In 2008, investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs became bank holding companies, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns were acquired by bank holding companies, and Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, essentially bringing the largest investment banks into the regulated depository sphere.|$|E

One of the most pressing challenges of the past years {{is the emergence of}} alternative investment funds, in particular hedge funds, which masterfully exploit the traditional categories of corporate law, financial derivatives, and risk management. This Article is only concerned with the first of these two forms— negative decoupling. 9 It looks at the various forms of negative riskdecoupling strategies and tries to shed light on their overall desirability. Three distinct theoretical perspectives are used as an analytical framework to examine the vast challenges of risk-decoupling: (1) a classical agency costs approach; (2) an information costs perspective; and (3) a view from corporate finance. This Article argues that shareholders with <b>hedged</b> <b>risk</b> exposure do not correspond to the traditional market expectations of shareholders.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the feeder cattle futures {{contract}} specifications are expected to reduce <b>hedging</b> <b>risk</b> and may result in changes in optimal hedging levels. This study provides an estimate of feeder cattle hedge ratios associated with the new cash-settled feeder cattle futures contract and compares the levels of <b>hedging</b> <b>risk</b> present under the cash settled contract with the physical delivery contract. <b>Hedging</b> <b>risks</b> are compared for several weights of feeder steers and heifers and are analyzed across four market locations.

40|$|IAS 39 {{is going}} to {{significantly}} increase the workload of a corporate treasury. At the very least, all derivatives {{will need to be}} valued regularly and other assets may need to be valued or monitored depending on their classification. Other instruments, such as embedded derivatives and projected transactions that may not have traditionally been within the scope of the corporate treasurer or the treasury system, will also have to be evaluated. Essentially, treasury personnel are going to need far more flexibility in recording and tracking potential and actual exposures than they have in the past. Taking changes in the fair value of derivatives directly to the profit and loss account is highly likely to increase earnings volatility. This is illogical when you consider that these derivatives are hedges that exist primarily to reduce the volatility of actual economic earnings! This {{is one of the reasons}} hedge accounting has been permitted. If a hedge can be assigned to one or more exposures, then the changes in the value of the hedge can be offset against the change in the value of the hedged item and only the residual or ineffective portion will go to profit and loss. However, if a company decides to apply hedge accounting, this may create a whole new burden for the corporate treasury. Initially, testing will have to be done to demonstrate that the hedge is expected to be highly effective. A hedging relationship will also need to be formally designated and documented. The documentation will need to detail the objective and strategy of the hedge, the nature of the <b>hedged</b> <b>risk</b> and the testing method used to demonstrate effectiveness. Testing will have to be done prospectively and retrospectively throughout the life of a hedging relationship. For most corporates, using a system to do the grunt work will naturally be the preferred approach. The first requirement of an IAS 39 compliance system should be to reduce this workload, specifically by automating the tasks o...|$|E

We propose to determine a hedging portfolio by minimizing a proportional cost subject to an upper bound on the hedge risk; this bound is typically slightly larger than the optimal <b>hedge</b> <b>risk</b> achievable without cost consideration. We illustrate that the optimal hedging portfolio obtained by the proposed method is attractive since it consists of fewer instruments with a comparable risk.
