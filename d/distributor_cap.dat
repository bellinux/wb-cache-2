Surrounding the rotor is the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap.</b> The arrangement sequentially directs the output of the secondary winding to the appropriate spark plugs. The high voltage from the coil's secondary (typically 20,000 to 50,000 volts) causes a spark to form across the gap of the spark plug that in turn ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture within the engine. It is the creation of this spark which consumes the energy that was stored in the ignition coil’s magnetic field.|$|E

These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days.

He worked in this role for three months before returning to Chicago.|$|E
50|$|Engines {{that use}} a {{mechanical}} distributor may fail if they run into deep puddles because any water that gets onto the distributor can short out the electric current that should {{go through the}} spark plugs, rerouting it directly {{to the body of}} the vehicle. This in turn causes the engine to stop as the fuel is not ignited in the cylinders. This problem can be fixed by removing the <b>distributor's</b> <b>cap</b> and drying the cap, cam, rotor and the contacts by wiping with tissue paper or a clean rag, by blowing hot air on them, or using a moisture displacement spray e.g. WD-40 or similar. Oil, dirt or other contaminants can cause similar problems, so the distributor should be kept clean inside and outside to ensure reliable operation. Some engines include a rubber o-ring or gasket between the <b>distributor</b> base and <b>cap</b> to help prevent this problem. The gasket is made of a material like Viton or butyl for a tight seal in extreme temperatures and chemical environments. This gasket should not be discarded when replacing the <b>cap.</b> Most <b>distributor</b> <b>caps</b> have the position of the number 1 cylinder's terminal molded into the plastic. By referencing a firing order diagram and knowing the direction the rotor turns, (which can be seen by cranking the engine with the cap off) the spark plug wires can be correctly routed. Most <b>distributor</b> <b>caps</b> are designed so that they cannot be installed in the wrong position. Some older engine designs allow the cap to be installed in the wrong position by 180 degrees, however. The number 1 cylinder position on the cap should be noted before a cap is replaced.|$|R

50|$|A cheaper {{configuration}} on high-speed engines {{with fewer}} than six cylinders is to use an axial-piston distributor pump, consisting of one rotating pump plunger delivering fuel to a valve and line for each cylinder (functionally analogous to points and <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> on an Otto engine).|$|E

5000|$|HEI is characterised by the {{incorporation}} of the ignition coil built into the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> for most applications. The system consists of a control module and a magnetic pickup mounted in the distributor. This eliminates ignition points and the coil wire. The control module basically performs the same function as the breaker points in a points and condenser system.|$|E
5000|$|A {{distributor}} {{consists of}} a rotating arm or [...] inside the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap,</b> {{on top of the}} distributor shaft, but insulated from it and the body of the vehicle (ground). The distributor shaft is driven by a gear on the camshaft on most overhead valve engines, and attached directly to a camshaft on most overhead cam engines. (The distributor shaft may also drive the oil pump.) The metal part of the rotor contacts the high voltage cable from the ignition coil via a spring-loaded carbon brush {{on the underside of the}} <b>distributor</b> <b>cap.</b> The metal part of the rotor arm passes close to (but does not touch) the output contacts which connect via high tension leads to the spark plug of each cylinder. As the rotor spins within the distributor, electric current is able to jump the small gaps created between the rotor arm and the contacts due to the high voltage created by the ignition coil.|$|E

50|$|The <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> has one {{post for}} each cylinder, and in points {{ignition}} systems {{there is a}} central post for the current from the ignition coil coming into the distributor.

Another implementation is the wasted spark system, where a single contact serves two leads, but in that case each lead connects one cylinder. In General Motors high energy ignition (HEI) systems there is no central post and the ignition coil sits on top of the distributor. Some Toyota and Honda engines also have their coil within the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap.</b> On the inside of the cap there is a terminal that corresponds to each post, and the plug terminals are arranged around the circumference of the cap according to the firing order in order to send the secondary voltage to the proper spark plug at the right time.|$|E

Controlled {{by a new}} micro-processor-equipped Single-Board Engine Controller (SBEC, {{also known as the}} ECM, or Engine Control Module), the {{ignition system}} included a distributor mounted {{at the rear of the}} engine. A 36,000-volt ignition coil, usually located at the front right of the engine, provided electrical power to the center of the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap,</b> where a spinning rotor directed the power to each of the individual cylinders' spark plug wires.

MEMS 2J was used on the VVC engine, to control the Variable Valve Control and the distributorless {{ignition}} system, which was used because there were camshaft drive belts at both ends of the engine. With the launch of the Rover 25 and Rover 45 in 1999, MEMS 3 was introduced, with twin coils and sequential injection.|$|E
