500|$|The first step, {{where the}} wort is {{prepared}} by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, {{is known as}} [...] "mashing". Hot water (known as [...] "liquor" [...] in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as [...] "grist") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in {{a process known as}} [...] "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the <b>grain</b> <b>bed</b> itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.|$|E
500|$|The grain used in Grodziskie is malted wheat. [...] During the malting process, {{the wheat}} is dried in kilns that are heated by oak-burning {{furnaces}}. [...] Instead {{of using the}} furnaces to heat air which is then used to dry the wheat, the hot smoke from the kilns is forced directly through the <b>grain</b> <b>bed.</b> [...] The smoke dries the grain, and imparts a light color and an intense, pleasant, smoky flavor. [...] This [...] process {{would not be possible}} in the type of kilns that were more common in the past, that burned coal or coke as fuel because the soot in the smoke would cause the grain to become discolored and contribute undesirable harsh flavors. [...] The exact degree of smokiness that resulted from the oak kilning in historical times is not known. [...] The smoke from the malting process also adds chemical components to the finished product that help preserve it, giving it a long shelf life despite its low alcohol content. [...] One story is told of a box of Grodziskie being found in the 1950s, buried in the sands of North Africa, that was left behind by German soldiers during World War II. [...] The beer was opened and found to be as fresh as the day it was made.

The temperature is usually around [...] A typical floor maltings is a long, single-storey building with a floor that slopes slightly {{from one end of}} the building to the other. Floor maltings began to be phased out in the 1940s in favour of [...] "pneumatic plants". Here, large industrial fans are used to blow air through the germinating <b>grain</b> <b>beds</b> and to pass hot air through the malt being kilned. Like floor maltings, these pneumatic plants are batch processes, but of considerably greater size, typically 100 ton batches compared with 20 ton batches for floor malting.|$|R
50|$|There must be {{a system}} for {{introducing}} sparge water into the lauter tun. Most systems have a ring of spray heads that ensure an even and gentle introduction of the sparge water. The watering system should not beat down on the <b>grain</b> <b>bed</b> and form a channel.|$|E
50|$|A {{good quality}} lauter tun has {{rotating}} rake arms {{with a central}} drive unit. Depending {{on the size of}} the lauter tun, there can be between two and six rake arms. Cutting blades hang from these arms. The blade is usually wavy and has a plough-like foot. Each blade has its own path around the tun and the whole rake assembly can be raised and lowered. Attached to each of these arms is a flap which can be raised and lowered for pushing the spent grains out of the tun. The brewer, or better yet an automated system, can raise and lower the rake arms depending on the turbidity (cloudiness) of the run-off, and the tightness of the <b>grain</b> <b>bed,</b> as measured by the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the <b>grain</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
50|$|The grains are {{infused with}} yet hotter water to rinse more sugars from the mash {{in a process}} known as {{sparging}}. There are two types of sparging. Fly sparging and batch sparging. Fly sparging involves rinsing the <b>grain</b> <b>bed</b> by adding small amounts of hot water to the top while draining equal amounts from the bottom. Batch sparging involves adding all or most of your sparge water at one time to the <b>grain</b> <b>bed</b> and slowly draining it from the bottom. The sparging process will also stop any further enzymatic activity if much hotter water is used; conversely the mash may be heated to around 80 C to end such activity prior to placing it in the lauter-tun, and to prevent cooler grain from lowering the sparge water temperature to a lower than desirable figure.|$|E
40|$|Eolian saltation, the {{transport}} of sand by the wind, involves a variety of physical processes. A fundamental understanding of saltation requires an analysis starting from {{the level of the}} individual sand grain. The complexity of this nonlinear dynamical system compels us to divide the problem into more easily handled decoupled components: the saltating grain-bed impact process, the force of the wind on individual grains, the determination of the wind profile from the spatially averaged force of the moving grains on the air, and the formation of small-scale bedforms: ripples. The impact of a moving sand <b>grain</b> with a <b>bed</b> of sand is studied with two-dimensional dynamical computer simulations and an experiment propelling single grains onto a sand bed. We find that the result of the impact may be described in terms of the rebound of the incident particle and the ejection of <b>bed</b> <b>grains.</b> The <b>bed</b> <b>grain</b> ejections originate from a localized area around the impact point, and at steps in the surface (elevation changes of one grain diameter) which are more widely distributed; these surface steps we term brinks (downstream-facing) and anti-brinks (upstream-facing). A model for steady-state saltation is proposed which incorporates both aerodynamics and the mechanics of the grain-bed impacts, and balances the losses of saltating particles on impact with the bed by gains due to impact generated <b>bed</b> <b>grain</b> ejections. This model does not require data on blowing sand. Results are obtained which qualitatively agree with existing data. Quantitative tests will require new experiments. We argue that grain-bed impacts, not fluid stresses, are the means for entraining grains in steady-state eolian saltation. The development of sand surface topography is viewed as a result of surface grain transport (reptation) driven by the impact of high-energy saltating <b>grains</b> onto the <b>bed.</b> The collision and merger of small collections of sand, proto-ripples, lead to the asymptotic development of uniform ripples from an initially smoothed surface. The limiting wavelength is pictured as being determined by statistical fluctuations in the saltating impact flux and/or the shortening of the saltation shadow zone below the mean reptation length during a collision between two ripples. Field observations of developing ripple cross-sectional shapes confirm these ideas qualitatively, and rough calculations of limiting wavelengths agree with existing data. ...|$|R

It is concluded that whilst the equivalent n and ks values are useful alternatives for sewer and culvert design, the link between roughness parameters and <b>bed</b> <b>grain</b> size for river and coastal purposes should be treated with more caution, particularly because the hydraulic resistance is likely to include not only a skin friction element which depends on the grain size, but also a form drag component...|$|R

50|$|The {{malting process}} {{converts}} raw grain into malt. The malt is mainly used for brewing or whiskey making, {{but can also}} be used to make malt vinegar or malt extract. Various grains are used for malting; the most common are barley, sorghum, wheat and rye. There are a number of different types of equipment that can be used to produce the malt. A traditional floor maltings germinates the grains in a thin layer on a solid floor, and the grain is manually raked and turned to keep the grains loose and aerated. In a modern malt house the process is more automated, and the grain is germinated on a floor that is slotted to allow air to be forced through the <b>grain</b> <b>bed.</b> Large mechanical turners keep the much thicker bed loose with higher productivity and better energy efficiency.|$|E

40|$|High-resolution bathymetry, seismic reflection, and piston {{core data}} from a {{submarine}} channel on the western Niger Delta slope demonstrate that thick, coarse-grained, amalgamated sands in the channel thalweg/axis transition to thin, fine-grained, bedded sands and muds in the channel margin. Radiocarbon ages indicate that axis and margin deposits are coeval. Core data show that <b>bed</b> thickness, <b>grain</b> size, and deposition rate strongly decrease with increasing height above channel thalweg and/or distance from channel centerline. A 5 times decrease in bed thickness and 1 – 2 ψ decrease in grain size are evident over a 20 m elevation change (approximately the elevation difference between axis and margin). A simplified in-channel sedimentation model that solves vertical concentration and velocity profiles of turbidity currents accurately reproduces the vertical trends in <b>grain</b> size and <b>bed</b> thickness shown in the core data set. The close match between data and model suggests that the vertical distribution of <b>grain</b> size and <b>bed</b> thickness shown {{in this study is}} widely applicable and can be used to predict grain size and facies variation in data-poor areas (e. g., subsurface cores). This study emphasizes that facies models for submarine channel deposits should recognize that grain-size and thickness trends within contemporaneous axis-margin packages require a change in elevation above the thalweg. The transition from thick-bedded, amalgamated, coarser-grained sands to thin-bedded, nonamalgamated, finer-grained successions is primarily a reflection of a change in elevation.
