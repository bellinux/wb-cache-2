50|$|Fish curing {{includes}} and of curing fish by drying, salting, smoking, and pickling, or by {{combinations of}} these processes have been employed since ancient times. On sailing vessels fish were usually salted down immediately to prevent spoilage; the swifter boats of today commonly bring in unsalted fish. Modern freezing and canning methods have largely supplanted older methods of preservation. Fish to be cured are usually first cleaned, scaled, and <b>eviscerated.</b> <b>Fish</b> are salted by packing them between layers of salt or by immersion in brine. The fish most extensively salted are cod, herring, mackerel, and haddock. Smoking preserves fish by drying, by deposition of creosote ingredients, and, when the fish are near the source of heat, by heat penetration. Herring and haddock (finnan haddie) are commonly smoked. Kippers are split herring, and bloaters are whole herring, salted and smoked. Sardines, pilchards, and anchovies are small fish of the herring family, often salted and smoked and then preserved in oil. Fish are dried under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, and air velocity. Since the dried product is relatively unappetizing and rehydrating slow, other preservation methods are common.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of weight (W) {{category of the}} rainbow trout on processing yield and chemical composition of the entire <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish</b> and fish fillet was analyzed. A completely randomized design was employed for processing variables (W 1 = 300 to 370 g and W 2 = 371 to 440) coupled to a 2 x 2 factorial scheme for the chemical composition (W 1 and W 2 and forms of presentation: fillet and whole <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish).</b> W 1 showed higher yield for entire <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish</b> (83. 00 %) and head (13. 27 %), but a lower yield for the viscera (17. 00 %), when compared to W 2. We did not affect abdominal muscle yield, fillet with or without skin, skin percentage and residues. There were significant differences between W for moisture (W 1 = 72. 30 % and W 2 = 71. 15 %) and lipids (CP 1 = 7. 96 % and CP 2 = 9. 04 %) rates. Fillet moisture contents (73. 74 %) and crude protein (19. 05 %) were higher (p < 0. 01) than for entire <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish</b> (69. 71 % and 17. 81 %, respectively). Ash (2. 15 %) and lipid (10. 48 %) rates were higher (p < 0. 01) for entire fish when compared to those of fillets (1. 16 % and 6. 52 %, respectively). The slaughter of fish weighing between 300 and 370 g and their fillets are more adequate for the market. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{researches}} were undergone on the Danube scomber, {{species that}} cumulates the natural microbian contamination from the fresh {{water of the}} Danube and from the salty water of the Black Sea. For the <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish,</b> the aerobic putrefaction takes place prioritarily, placed both on the skin surface and on that which was eviscerated. For the whole fish, the putrefaction is conditioned by the aggression of the intestinal bacterial flora. The value of the peroxide index {{and the intensity of}} the Kreiss reaction increase proportionally with the evolution of the rancidity. Between fat hydrolization and oxidation, there is no mutual conditioning, thus, the estimation of the two freshness indices must be made independently one from each other...|$|E
40|$|Microorganisms {{that cause}} human {{diseases}} can contaminate fishes in aquatic environments {{as well as}} during their capture, handling, and transport. The {{purpose of this study}} was to isolate Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella enterica from fishes captured in the Lagoa dos Patos estuary that were eviscerated and cleaned for trade. Thirteen fish landing were analyzed and 65 entire fishes and 65 cleaned fishes were studied to determine the presence of V. parahaemolyticus and S. enterica. Bacterial isolates were compared using rep-PCR. V. parahaemolyticus was isolated from one entire Micropogonias furnieri and two entire Mugil platanus, as well as from three eviscerated M. platanus. S. enterica was isolated from two eviscerated Paralichthys orbignyanus. Identical rep-PCR bands from V. parahaemolyticus were observed in entire and <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fishes</b> from the same discharge, suggesting processing failures that neither eliminated the microorganism from the raw material nor prevented cross-contamination. S. enterica was not isolated from entire fishes, presumably because contamination occurred due to hygiene and sanitary failures. Our results showed that M. furnieri and M. platanus captured in the Lagoa dos Patos estuary may host V. parahaemolyticus and that this microorganism, as with S. enterica, may also persist even after the fish is cleaned. This is the first record of the isolation of V. parahaemolyticus from M. furnieri...|$|R

This paper reveals the incidence, types of micro-organisms and keeping quality of fishes reared in livestock sewage fed ponds without artificial feed. These fishes revealed microbial incidence and keeping quality comparable to other fishes. Initial mesophilic and psychrophilic counts varied from 3. 38 to 5. 56 and 2. 47 to 4. 74. On an average, the counts reduced by about 40 % after evisceration and washing. Whole as well as washed fishes had refrigerated (8 ± 1 °C) life of not more than 4 days.

40|$|Resumo: A conservação da polpa de corvina (Micropogon furníeri) e castanha (Umbrina canosai), em temperatura de - 30 °C, por 150 dias, e os efeitos da adição de trípolifosfato de sódio, cloreto de sódio e acido ascórbico foram estudados através da determinação de quatro testes: bases voláteis totais, valor "TBA", capacidade de retenção de água e "drip". As amostras tratadas com 0, 1 % de acido ascórbico apresentaram menor oxidação, enquanto que as adicionadas de cloreto de sódio a 1 % mostraram maior capacidade de retenção de água e menor perda de água na descongelação. O teor de bases voláteis totais aumentou de forma idêntica para todas as amostras. Foram preparados hambúrgueres da mesma polpa, misturadas com proteína de soja texturizada a 3 / 3 e 4, 2 % em base seca, e com carne bovina moída na relação 1 : 1. Os hambúrgueres preparados com proteína de soja texturizada e polpa de pescado sem carne bovina apresentaram melhores resultados na avaliação sensorial feita por sete degustadores. Concluímos que a polpa de pescado pode ser utilizada tanto como um substituto de parte da carne bovina em produtos como hambúrgueres tradicionais, como na elaboração de um produto só de pescado. A soja texturizada substitui os outros ingredientes normalmente usados para ligar as partículas de carne e manter o produto coeso, quando cozido, bem como apresenta a vantagem de aportar razoável enriquecimento protéico ao produto finalAbstract: The under {{utilization}} of fish catches {{and the increased}} demand for fish as food has lead us to the scarcity of the oceans. The machine separation of flesh from the bones and skin offers {{a new source of}} a good r aw material for new products, that have a good potential for the introduction of fish of species of low or medium commercial value, in institutional food markets. Two species of fish of this type, Corvina (Micropogon furníeri) and castanha(Umbrina canosai) represent about 30 % of the total catch landed in Rio Grande, RS. The flesh of these non very fatty fish is white with red spots. These are processed as frozen fillets, frozen steaks, and as <b>eviscerated</b> and salted <b>fish.</b> The conservation of a fish paste of corvina and castanha, with and without additives, such as 1 % sodium chloride, 0, 1 % sodium tripolyphosphate, and 0, 1 % ascorbic acid were studied during 150 days of storage at - 30 °C. The samples were analyzed by four tests: total volatile basis, TBA test, water holding capacity, and drip. The first show a uniform deterioration of samples. The TBA test indicates that the 0, 1 % ascorbic acid retard the oxidation of the meat. The samples treated with 1 % sodium chloride denoted the best water holding capacity and less drip, than the samples treated with sodium tripolyphosphatet. The fish paste with texturized soy protein added and with and without beef in teh relation fish-beef (1 : 1) was used to prepare a hamburger. The composition of the hamburgers was as follows; fish and beef - 66 and 60 %; texturized soy protein - 3, 3 and 4, 2 %(dry basis); pork fat - 22, 5 %; salt - 1, 5 %. The hamburger was tested by a 7 member panel trained to prove a tradicional beef hamburbuer. The fish made hamburger rated better that those prepared with fish and beef, it seems that fish paste {{can be used as a}} substitute of part of beef in tradicional hamburger or as the unique animal protein source in a new product, apparently with the same acceptability by the consumer...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to improve the safety and shelf life of cooked kembung fish (Rastrelliger sp), a {{traditional}} food called pindang fish. Fresh <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish</b> was fisrt soaked in 2 % NaCl solution for 15 minutes, drained, washed with tap water and drained again. Sodium chloride at 12 % concentration (w/w) was distributed on the whole surface of the fish. Fish was then laid on a wooden basket inside a clay pot, steamed for 30 minutes, and then cooled. Combine method applied to the steamed fish (pindang) was soaking in a mixed culture of Lactobacillus plantarum kik and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris in the ratio of 2 : 1 (v/v) containing 4 % Na-acetate for 2 hrs and after draining, the product was vacuum packed. The result showed that the combine method using mixed culture of lactic acid bacteria containing 4 % Na-acetate could reduce the growth of Staphylococcus aureus by 3 - 6 log units, decrease the TMA (Trimethylamine) content and maintain the organoleptic properties (texture, appearance and odor) of pindang fish during 6 days storage at room temperature. Control treatment without 4 % Na-acetate could only keep the pindang fish for 4 days. Vacuum and nonvacuum packaging did not show any significant difference...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} initial quality of fish on postirradiation (100 krad) {{changes in the}} {{bacterial}} flora of haddock fillets during aerobic storage at 3 C has been investigated, with emphasis on the Pseudomonas and Achromobacter groups. The quality {{was related to the}} length of time the <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish</b> had been stored in ice prior to filleting. Increased numbers of organisms, in particular Pseudomonas putrefaciens, were found initially on fillets cut from older fish. Pseudomonads were reduced by 2 to 3 log orders by irradiation, and achromobacters and gram-positive isolates predominated in the immediate postirradiation flora. Little difference could be detected in either types or relative proportions of organisms occurring during storage of unirradiated fish of different quality. Pseudomonads outgrew achromobacters and dominated the spoilage flora in all cases. After spoilage, however, the growth rate of pseudomonads declined markedly. In irradiated fish, achromobacters predominated throughout storage. In fish of better initial quality, bacterial numbers were 1 to 2 log orders higher at spoilage than in their unirradiated counterparts and in the poorer quality of irradiated samples. The increased number of organisms was accompanied by a radical change in the character of the predominant achromobacters. Pseudomonads were found to increase in numbers during storage of irradiated fish, in particular in poorer quality fish on which they were initially present in higher numbers. Detection of pseudomonads, even when present in high numbers, was found to be limited by the identification techniques normally used...|$|E
40|$|Development of a {{high-speed}} and high-yield water-powered fish evisceration system (FES) to efficiently preprocess small fish and bycatch for producing minced fish meat is described. The {{concept of the}} system is propelling fish in a stream of water through an arrangement of cutting blades and brushes. <b>Eviscerated</b> <b>fish</b> are separated from the viscera and water stream in a dual screen rotary sieve. The FES processed head off fish, weighing 170 – 500 g, at the rate of 300 fish/min when used with an automatic heading machine. Yields of mince produced from walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma; and Pacific whiting, Merluccius productus; processed by the FES ranged between 43 % and 58 %. The maximum yield of minced muscle from fish weighing over 250 g was 52 %, and the yield of 250 g was 58 %. Test results indicated that surimi made from minced meat recovered from fish processed with the FES was comparable in quality to commercial grade surimi from conventional systems. Redesigned for commercial operation in the Faeroe Islands (Denmark), the system effectively processed North Atlantic blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou, with an average weight of 110 g at a constant rate of 500 – 600 fish/min, producing deboned mince feeding a surimi processing line at a rate of 2. 0 t/h. Yields of mince ranged from 55 % to 63 % from round fish.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{was focused}} on the {{possibilities}} of extending the shelf-life of fish products by dipping containing seven commercial additives. ANTIBAK, MIC STAB, Bakont, SEA-F 75, Misocarine LR, SAFE A Plus and AMX liquid. The effectiveness of these substances on the extending of shelf-life was evaluated on the basis of tests of TVC (total viable count), level of fat and protein oxidation, determination of nutritional parameters of muscle, and finaly sensory analysis. Experimental species were 2 important commodities for the Czech aquaculture rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The project was divided into 6 sub-stages. During testing was the initial number of aditives (7) limited by stepwise selection for 2 preparations. Namely Bakont and AMX liquid, which were tested further on trout (filet with skin and scales) and carp (filets with skin without scales) chilled bulk and chilled packaged under vakuum. For trout was studied antimicrobial effect of dipping on <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish</b> with the head with- or without gills. Treated trout fillets in bulk and vakuum-packed showed significantly less abundance of muscle mikroflora. In the case of carp fillets chilled bulk we can not say that the bath had influence on the CMP in meat. However, the combination of dipping and vakuum packaging was singnificantly different between the control and product Bakont. AMX liquid was not applied in this case in sufficient dose or in sufficient time to carp muscle. A positive finding is that the application of the aditives to the product "eviscerated trout with head" it does not matter, whether the gills are left in fish or not. However, in all cases the analysis of the presence of pathogens Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. or Listeria monocytogenes were negative. From the results of sensory analysis can be concluded, that the substances contained in aditives are not reflected in the sensory properties of tested fish...|$|E
40|$|Anchovies are {{traditional}} fish preserves, prepared from fermented fish of the engraulidae family, mainly in European countries. In Brazil, sardines (Sardinella brasiliensis) are an alternative fish for preparing {{these types of}} preserves, provided that the preservation process results in a high quality product. In this research, sardines were prepared for preservation and physicochemical, microbiological and sensory analyses were carried out during the preservation process. Whole or eviscerated sardines, with or without condiments/preservatives and with 20 % of salt (w/w) were used. Sardines were analyzed fresh, and at 1, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days along the preservation process. The use of whole sardines, with or without condiments/preservatives, presented best results, with increased non-proteic nitrogen in the dry matter, higher levels of total volatile bases and higher contents of lactic acid and sodium chloride. The higher acidity observed in the whole sardine treatments resulted in better control of halophylic mesophilic microorganisms, which were kept under 1. 4 x 10 ³ CFU g- 1 in both treatments. Total coliforms and Staphylococcus aureus reached 21 and 3. 0 x 10 ² CFU g- 1, respectively. Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp were not present in the fresh sardines or {{in any of the}} four treatments, indicating that the concentration of salt used was appropriate to maintain the product under adequate microbiological control. Both whole or eviscerated sardines under the conditions of this experiment were appropriate in terms of the microbiological safety of the preserves. Treatments using whole fish, either with or without condiments/preservatives, also presented better sensorial properties such as color, flavor, taste and texture, as compared to the <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish</b> treatments. Whole sardines produced good quality, anchovy-type preserves, which can be used for consumption and marketing purposes. As sardinhas brasileiras podem ser utilizadas para o preparo de pescado fermentado, à semelhança do que é feito com as anchovas na Europa, desde que o processamento permita a obtenção de um produto com qualidade. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi monitorar o processamento de fermentação de sardinhas, Sardinella brasiliensis, utilizando 4 tratamentos, a saber: peixes inteiros e eviscerados, ambos com ou sem condimentos, e 20 % de sal. As sardinhas foram analisadas in natura e nos períodos de 1; 15; 30; 45 e 60 dias de fermentação. O pescado mantido com vísceras apresentou maior facilidade para fermentação e revelou maiores teores de bases voláteis, nitrogênio não protéico e acidez em ácido lático (19, 82 mg 100 g- 1).

Foram realizados quatro experimentos, separados em dois grupos, nÃo eviscerados e eviscerados, cada um com oito amostras perfazendo um total de 32 amostras. A cada trÃs dias era retirado um exemplar de tilÃpia para as anÃlises do experimento: sensorialmente, {{conforme}} a avaliaÃÃo do MÃtodo do Ãndice de Qualidade (MIQ), adaptado Ã tilÃpia do Nilo e microbiologicamente. Na anÃlise sensorial do peixe cru foram avaliados os atributos: aspecto geral, olhos, brÃnquias, textura e musculatura dos peixes, segundo os somatÃrios dos caracteres sensoriais (S. C. S). De cada exemplar foram quantificados os grupos bacterianos: psicrotrÃficos (7 ÂC), psicrÃfilos (23 ÂC), e mesÃfilos (35 ÂC), na superfÃcie e no mÃsculo, pelo mÃtodo de Contagem PadrÃo em Placas (CPP). NÃo houve diferenÃa estatÃstica entre os trÃs grupos bacterianos analisados Ã um nÃvel de significÃncia de 5 % dentro dos mesmos tratamentos e entre os grupos. O tempo de estocagem apresentou alta correlaÃÃo com a contagem dos grupos bacterianos e o aumento do MIQ, tanto para os peixes eviscerados, quanto para os nÃo eviscerados. Foi considerado que o processo de evisceraÃÃo {{no local}} de venda dos peixes nÃo aumentou sua vida Ãtil.

Fish is a food susceptible to deterioration due their intrinsic characteristics, requiring bacterial monitoring in postmortem storage. Thus, the {{objective was to}} quantify mesophilic, psychrotrophic, psychrophilic bacteria in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) during to 21 days of storage under the action of ice at temperature refrigeration. Four experiments were conducted, separated to two groups, gutted and ungutted, with eight samples totaling 32 samples. Every three days was taken a exemplar of tilapia for analyzes of the trial: sensory evaluation according to the Quality Index Method (QIM) adapted to the Nile tilapia and heterotrophic bacterial count of cultivable. In sensory analysis of raw fish attributes were assessed: general appearance, eyes, gills, muscles and texture of the fish, according to the Sensory Characters Sum (S. C. S). To each specimen were quantified bacterial groups: psychrophilic (23 ÂC), psychrotrophic (7 ÂC) and mesophilic (35 ÂC), the surface and the muscle, using the method of standard plate count (SPC). There was no statistical difference between the three bacterial groups analyzed the significance level of 5 % within the same treatments and between groups. The storage time was highly correlated with the counting of bacterial groups and increased QIM for both <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish,</b> and for those not drawn.

40|$|The River Goby Glossogobius callidus (Smith, 1937) is {{a native}} {{abundant}} fish in both freshwater and estuarine habitats in the Cape Fold Ecoregion, yet little information is available on its life-history. This study aims to contribute to knowledge on the age and growth, reproductive biology and the diet and feeding habits of G. callidus in irrigation impoundments. Glossogobius callidus was sampled monthly from August 2013 till March 2015; from the irrigation ponds in the Sundays River Valley, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. To determine sex, gonads were visually assessed under a dissecting microscope to confirm the sex based on {{the shape of the}} urogenital papillae. Fish were then dissected to confirm sex and gonads were categorised into five macroscopic stages which were histologically validated. Microscopic stages of gonadal development were discerned based on nuclear and cytoplasmic characteristics of the oocyte or sperm. Ovaries and sperms were assigned stages based on the most advanced type of oocyte present. In total 2054 fishes ranging in length from 21. 1 mm to 137. 2 mm TL were sampled. The sex ratio (1. 1 males: 1 females) did not differ from unity (x 2 = 0. 027, df = 1, p = 0. 87). Length at 50 % maturity (Lm) was 70 mm TL females and 72 mm TL for males. Spawning season was mid-spring and mid-summer and mean ± S. D absolute fecundity was estimated at 1028. 2 ± 131. 7 ova/fish. Relative fecundity (number of vitellogenic oocytes per gram of <b>eviscerated</b> <b>fish</b> mass) were estimated at 50 ± 18 ova/fish gram. Otoliths from 560 fish were used for ageing. Growth zone deposition rate was validated using edge analysis. As a unimodal periodic regression model best described the temporal proportion of opaque zone deposition on the edge of otoliths over a one-year period, growth zone deposition rate was validated as annual. The oldest female fish was a 4 -year old 84. 4 mm TL fish and the oldest male was a 7 -year old 100. 5 mm TL fish. The length-at-age for the entire population of 560 G. callidus provided von Bertalanffy parameters of Lt = 92 (1 - e - 0. 58 (t + 0. 4)) mm TL for the entire population, Lt = 70 (1 - e - 1. 8 (t + 0. 06)) mm TL for males and Lt = 65 (1 - e - 1. 8 (t + 0. 05)) mm TL for females. Converting length at maturity to age at maturity demonstrated that G. callidus attained maturity at an age of 2 -years. Growth performance described using the phi-prime index showed that G. callidus had lower growth performance compared to the invasive Neogobius melanostomus. Using age structure, natural mortality was estimated at 1. 31 yr- 1 using catch curve analysis. Diet of G. callidus comprised of ten taxonomic groups. Among these, aquatic invertebrates were the most diverse group but while relative contribution of the dietary components varied across all size classes and seasons, the key prey items were consistently found in all size classes. These were Diptera, Hemiptera, Trichoptera, Odonata, Cladocera, Copepoda, Hydracarina, Amphipoda, Crustacea, and Mollusca. While dietary differences were observed between the size classes and throughout the seasons, G. callidus can be regarded as a generalist feeder preying on an array of different species. Given its abundance and diet, I suggest that G. callidus contribute considerably to the invertebrate predation pressure in these artificial aquatic environments in an arid region. In summary, medium fecundity, fast growth, moderate maturity, and a generalist feeding behaviour demonstrate that G. callidus is an equilibrium life strategist. In comparison with other species, the life-history traits of G. callidus from irrigation impoundments resemble those of other freshwater goby species, some of which are global invaders...|$|E
