500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{with his}} female fans in mind, and later stated {{that when he}} wrote the song, {{he knew it would}} be a success: [...] "A {{musician}} knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I knew it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|The Radioactive Man {{character}} {{is based on}} Batman, and several scenes in the episode reference the Batman television series from the 1960s. A Radioactive Man antagonist, The Scoutmaster, is based on actor/comedian Paul Lynde. The scene in the new Radioactive Man film where Radioactive Man and Fallout Boy are captured in Aquaworld is {{a reference to the}} 1995 film Waterworld. The director of the Radioactive Man film says: [...] "That Milhouse is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big,</b> Gabby Hayes big!", in reference to the American actor Gabby Hayes. Moe Szyslak, the bartender of Moe's Tavern, says that he, as a kid, played the part of Smelly on The Little Rascals, until he killed Alfalfa for stealing his schtick. Bill Withers' song [...] "Lean on Me" [...] from 1972 is played {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} for the publication, Hollis explained {{the title of}} the song: [...] "It's called 'Watch n' Learn,' and people will understand what it's about once it comes out. It's a very sexy record, but it's fun. It's [...] great melodies; it's catchy; the beat knocks. It's so many different elements to it." [...] When asked how is he satisfied with Rihanna's vocals and his prediction on the song he further stated: [...] "She definitely murdered it vocally. I was just at the studio last week listening to a mix of it, and man, she killed it. I really feel like, this song, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big.</b> I'm really excited about it." [...] "Watch n' Learn" [...] was recorded at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and at Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg in Paris. The song was mixed by Marcos Tovar. Its vocal production was completed by Kuk Harrell and assisted by TT. and Jennifer Rosales.|$|E
500|$|Some reviews {{were more}} positive. Welch D. Everman, author of Cult Science Fiction Films, {{compared}} {{the relationship between}} West and Nelson to that of Victor Frankenstein and his monster in Mary Shelly's novel Frankenstein (1818). Everman wrote, [...] "This {{is the kind of}} movie we've come to expect from AIP — cheaply made, nasty, and lots of fun". John W. Bowen of the Belleville Intelligencer said he enjoyed the [...] "camp" [...] style of the film, adding, [...] "It's both inexplicable and sad this brain-damaged yet fiercely determined little drive-in bottom feeder never garnered more than a tiny cult following over the years". A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "Films like The Incredible Melting Man are not made to be good; they are made to be scary. For anyone looking to raise goosebumps on their flesh, this one is sufficient to give you your money's worth". Matt Maiellaro, co-creator of the Cartoon Network series Aqua Teen Hunger Force, said the film inspired him to start making films himself, adding, [...] "When I was eight, I watched The Incredible Melting Man and knew that horror movies were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> religion in my life". Z movie director Tim Ritter said he was partially inspired to enter show business by watching a trailer for The Incredible Melting Man at age 9. Ritter said, [...] "I was too young to see the movie, but the trailer really got into my imagination".|$|E

I knew it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>big</b> but this was more than I expected. But I’ve got all my team-mates to settle me down and talk me through things. Being in the village has been the best bit – how big it is, and seeing other athletes, great athletes, walking around. The others have tried to calm me down.” ...|$|E

"To {{go back to}} nationalism, the <b>biggest</b> problem <b>is</b> the Republican mindset, the Reaganite mindset that we are {{all just}} {{individuals}} and let everyone loose to acquire wealth.

5000|$|Strange Days was {{released}} on September 25, 1967 by Elektra Records. Although the album was quite successful, reaching No. 3 in the United States during a sixty-three-week chart stay in November 1967, its impact was attenuated by the enduring success of the band's debut album, which remained in the Top Ten over ten months after its release during a 122-week stay. According to producer Paul Rothchild, [...] "We all {{thought it was the}} best album. Significantly, it was also the one with the weakest sales.
