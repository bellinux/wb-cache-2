This was originally done because the quasi-peak detector was believed to better indicate the subjective annoyance level experienced by a listener hearing <b>impulsive</b> <b>interference</b> to an AM radio station. Over time standards incorporating quasi-peak detectors as the measurement device were extended to frequencies up to 1 GHz, although there may not be any justification beyond previous practice for using the quasi-peak detector to measure interference to signals other than AM radio. The quasi-peak detector parameters to be used for EMC testing vary with frequency [...] Both CISPR and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limit EMI at frequencies above 1 GHz with reference to an average-power detector, rather than quasi-peak detector.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel family of adaptive filtering algorithms {{based on a}} relative logarithmic cost. The new family intrinsically combines the higher and lower order measures of the error into a single continuous update based on the error amount. We introduce important members of this family of algorithms such as the least mean logarithmic square (LMLS) and least logarithmic absolute difference (LLAD) algorithms that improve the convergence performance of the conventional algorithms. However, our approach and analysis are generic such that they cover other well-known cost functions {{as described in the}} paper. The LMLS algorithm achieves comparable convergence performance with the least mean fourth (LMF) algorithm and extends the stability bound on the step size. The LLAD and least mean square (LMS) algorithms demonstrate similar convergence performance in impulse-free noise environments while the LLAD algorithm is robust against <b>impulsive</b> <b>interferences</b> and outperforms the sign algorithm (SA). We analyze the transient, steady state and tracking performance of the introduced algorithms and demonstrate the match of the theoretical analyzes and simulation results. We show the extended stability bound of the LMLS algorithm and analyze the robustness of the LLAD algorithm against <b>impulsive</b> <b>interferences.</b> Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in different scenarios through numerical examples.

40|$|EMW Publishing, USA. International audienceIn most {{existing}} transmitted-reference ultra-wideband (TR-UWB) communication systems, receivers use {{the standard}} Gaussian approximation (SGA) for multiuser interference (MUI). It is an assumption used in most conventional multiuser systems, where the MUI tends to a Gaussian process {{by the central}} limit theorem, and convergence is relatively fast {{with respect to the}} number of users. However, for TR-UWB systems which are developed for short-range applications, we have a small number of active users. In this case, significant performance degradation is found in TR-UWB receivers due to the impreciseness of SGA. In this paper, we show that the Middleton class-A model is a more appropriate statistical model for MUI modeling in TR-UWB systems than the often used SGA. A closed-form expression for the probability density function (PDF) of the TR-UWB system under MUI, Gaussian noise and <b>impulsive</b> alpha-stable <b>interference</b> is developed.

In this context we consider an optimal receiver design and develop an importance sampling approach to perform estimation of the optimal receiver in the presence of convolved stable and Gaussian noises. Such an approximation approach to the optimal receiver is computationally expensive, hence we also develop as comparisons several suboptimal realizations of linear and non-linear receivers, including an approximation approach based on the Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution.
