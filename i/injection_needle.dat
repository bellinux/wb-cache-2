50|$|Depo-Provera is {{the brand}} name for a 150 mg aqueous {{injection}} of DMPA depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. It is applied {{in the form of}} an intramuscular injection. The shot must be injected into the thigh or buttocks or deltoid four times a year (every 11 to 13 weeks) and provides pregnancy protection instantaneously after the first injection. It was approved in the United States by the FDA for contraceptive use on 29 October 1992, and for management of endometriosis-related pain on 25 March 2005. Depo-subQ Provera 104, also manufactured by Pfizer, is a variation of the original Depo Shot that is instead a 104 mg subcutaneous injection. It contains 69 percent of progestin found in the original Depo-Provera shot. This can be injected using a smaller <b>injection</b> <b>needle</b> inserting the hormone just below the skin, instead of into the muscle, in either the abdomen or thigh. This subcutaneous injection claims to reduce the side effects of the progestin while still maintaining all the same benefits of the original Depo shot.|$|E
50|$|Pharmacologic {{injection}} treatments {{can be given}} to cooperative adults under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting, and for some agents, under light general anesthesia. In the former case, {{it is possible to}} bring the <b>injection</b> <b>needle</b> to an optimal location in the desired muscle using EMG guidance as the alert patient looks in diagnostic directions, the needle is advanced until the electromyogram (the electrical signal from an activated skeletal muscle) indicates it is optimally positioned, whereupon the injection is completed. Some agents (e.g., botulinum toxin) can be injected at the insertional end of a muscle under visual guidance, using special forceps and allowed to diffuse posteriorly, whereas others (e.g., bupivacaine) must be distributed throughout the body of the muscle, which requires non-visual guidance. EMG guidance generally provides more effective injections, but is only suitable for alert, cooperative adults. Because injection treatment does not result in the scaring that is often a troublesome consequence of conventional strabismus surgery, if therapeutic goals are not achieved with one injection, additional injections or surgical treatments can readily be given.|$|E

40|$|AIM: In {{this study}} Authors want to {{evaluate}} the static and dynamic flexural behaviour of innovative <b>injection</b> <b>needles</b> for dental anaesthesia comparing to the traditional needles. METHODS: Four kinds of innovative <b>injection</b> <b>needles</b> (Carpule Free Flow-Heraeus Kulzer), different for length and external diameter, have been evaluated {{in comparison with the}} traditional ones (Carpule-Heraeus Kulzer), dimensions being equal except for the internal diameter. Static stiffness tests (10 for each kind of needles, resulting in a totality of 80 tests) and fatigue bending test (10 for each kind of needles, each tested at 3 different bending angles, resulting in a totality of 240 tests) have been conducted following the ISO 9626 norms. The final comparison among the obtained data have been conducted using a one way statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: After stiffness tests the Carpule Free Flow <b>injection</b> <b>needles</b> and the traditional ones showed the same static behaviour, resulting in statistical comparable values of mean deflection at the maximum load allowed by ISO norms tests, whereas the 0. 4 mm external diameter showed a statistically significant difference because the Carpule Free Flow needles achieved lower deflection values. After dynamic bending tests at 20 degrees both needle types showed the same behaviour, whereas at 30 degrees bending the Carpule Free Flow <b>injection</b> <b>needles</b> showed a higher number of breaks comparing to normal type, up to a maximum value of breaks (10 out of 10) for the 0. 4 mm external diameter needles. After 50 degrees fatigue bending tests the Carpule Free Flow needles came to the break point after lower number of cycles than the Carpule needles. CONCLUSION: This study pointed out that, among anaesthesia <b>injection</b> <b>needles,</b> the Carpule Free Flow needles not only showed better clinical characteristics but also a mechanical behaviour, both static and dynamic, statistically similar to traditional ones, according to international standards. After fatigue bending higher than 20 degrees, exclusively made in this research in order to simulate critical or extreme conditions, all analysed Carpule Free Flow needles have been broken after a lower number of cycles. It is concluded that it is recommended not to repeatedly bend this kind of needles at more than 90 degrees. At the end of this study it may be suggested that this kind of needles cannot be repeatedly bended at angles more than 90 degrees...|$|R

40|$|Myofascial pain {{syndrome}} {{is a collection}} of sensoric, motoric, and autonomic symptoms due to myofascial trigger points. This is commonly seen in young age and involves postural muscles; one of those is upper trapezius muscle. Invasive and non-invasive therapies have been used as modalities to treat myofascial pain syndrom. Invasive therapy is superior due to its mechanical mechanism in deactivating trigger points. Different sizes of needles are used in invasive therapy to decrease symptoms. A clinical trial has been conducted in the outpatient clinic of Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung in the period of April–May 2014 with consecutive sampling method. Subjects in group I were given dry needling therapy with 25 G <b>injection</b> <b>needle</b> (0. 50 x 25 mm) and subjects in group II received the therapy using 1 cun accupuncture needle (0. 25 x 25 mm). Seventy four subjects participated in this study.

The comparison of algometer value between the 25 G <b>injection</b> <b>needle</b> therapy group and the 1 cun accupuncture needle therapy group was also not significantly different (p= 0. 134).

However, ESD is a technically demanding and time-consuming procedure. 1 Here, we report a “two-sword fenc-ing ” technique with an <b>injection</b> <b>needle</b> and an ESD knife. A 74 -year-old man presented with a laterally spreading tu-mor (LST), 7 cm in diameter, on the right wall of the rectum, and occupying half of the colonic lumen on colonoscopy. The tumor extended distally to the dentate line. Histological ex-amination of biopsy specimens indicated tubular adenoma. ESD of the rectal LST was carried out using a double-chan-nel endoscope with a multibending system (GIF- 2 TQ 260 M; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Glycerol (Glyceol; Chugai Pharma-ceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) mixed with a small volume of epi-nephrine and indigo carmine dye was injected into the sub-mucosal layer with the <b>injection</b> <b>needle</b> (IFH-SG; Top Corp., Tokyo, Japan).
