5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} {{improvements to the}} river is recorded in a document of 1325 from the <b>Dean</b> <b>and</b> Chapter of Wells Cathedral, where it was proposed to widen the river between Ham Mill and a new mill {{which was to be}} built at Knapp. The <b>Dean</b> <b>and</b> Chapter owned the river as far as Athelney weir, which was presumably a fish weir, as the river was an important source of fish for the local population. Records from 1494 record the intent to build a new mill at North Curry, which was operational in 1504, and caused flooding in 1505, resulting in the Bishop of Winchester having to complain to the <b>Dean</b> <b>and</b> Chapter of Wells. There is also mention of boats using the river at this time, as their use was restricted by the construction of the new mill at Ham.|$|E
