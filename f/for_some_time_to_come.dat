Colonel Washington, although he had no official position {{in the chain of}} command, was able to impose and maintain some order and formed a rear guard, which allowed the remants of the force to disengage.

A 2006 study of salaries in 51 metropolitan areas of the country ranked the Inland Empire second to last, with an average annual wage of $36,924. However, inexpensive land prices and innovative institutional support networks have attracted some small businesses and technology startups into the area.|$|E

25|$|Ellenborough Park is a {{large area}} of parkland in Weston-super-Mare. The land was owned in 1855 by two tenants in common, who sold off parts of the land for the {{building}} of houses, and granted rights to {{the owners of the}} houses to enjoy the parkland which remained. The land was enjoyed <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> until 1955, when Judge Danckwerts delivered his decision on the case which arose. Part of the problem arose out {{of the fact that the}} War Office had taken possession of the land during World War II, and compensation was due to be paid to the owners of the properties built on land surrounding the land which had been occupied during the war under the Compensation Defence Act 1939, section 2 (1).|$|E
500|$|The Spectators {{literary}} reviewer, Anita Brookner, {{based on}} her reading of the novel in the original French, described the book as a [...] "masterly novel...diabolically (and I use the word advisedly) clever.

This tour de force, which not everyone will welcome, outclasses all other fictions and will continue to do so <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> No summary can do it justice." [...] The Observer 's Paris correspondent, Jason Burke, praised the book as an [...] "extraordinary Holocaust novel asks what it is that turns normal people into mass killers," [...] adding that [...] "notwithstanding the controversial subject matter, this is an extraordinarily powerful novel." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{battle was}} {{undoubtedly}} {{a victory for}} the British; four French ships of the line, a fourth-rate and a frigate were destroyed and much of the remainder of the Brest fleet badly damaged and requiring extensive repairs; Océan and Foudroyant were in a particularly poor state. French casualties in the engagement are not known with certainty, but are estimated at 150–200, while British losses were only 13 killed and 30 wounded. Allemand later wrote that most significant damage resulting from the battle was to the morale of the French fleet; he wrote that [...] "the greater part are disheartened; every day I hear them lamenting their situation, and speaking in praise of their enemy." [...] another French commentator told a British officer that the French sailors [...] "had now no security from the English in their harbours, and they expected we should next go into Brest and take out their fleet". [...] No British ships suffered more than minor damage in the two weeks of combat, and the fleet could return to its blockade with the knowledge that the Brest fleet was neutralised <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and confined to Rochefort, although a powerful squadron was still under construction at Rochefort, where the defences had been swiftly repaired. This was the last time during the Napoleonic Wars that a significant French fleet was able to put to sea from the Atlantic ports; historian Richard Woodman describes it as the [...] "biggest scare from a break-out French fleet in the post-Trafalgar period." [...] Without naval support, the French colonies in the Caribbean were isolated, blockaded, invaded and captured shortly afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is strong}} modern {{scholarly}} consensus that Uinniau (thus [...] "Ninian") and Finnian of Moville {{are the same}} person.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that a range of 13,000 to 34,000 preventable premature deaths could be avoided by the reductions in PM2.5 and ozone produced by coal power plants. In 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations calculated that coal particulates pollution cause approximately one million deaths annually across the world, [...] which is approximately one third of all premature deaths related to all air pollution sources.|$|E
2500|$|Primate Visions {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} books to come along in the last twenty years. Historians of science have begun to write more externalist histories, acknowledging the possibilities of a science profoundly integrated with ongoing social agenda. Haraway's history of primatology in the twentieth century sets new standards for this approach, standards that will not be surpassed <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> The book is important to students of science, feminists, historians, and anyone else interested in how the complex systems of race, gender, and science intertwine to produce supposedly objective versions of the [...] "truth." [...] This analysis of primatology is at once a complex, interdisciplinary, and deeply scholarly history and an imaginative, provocative analysis of the working of science in late twentieth-century Euro-America.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these advances, {{there are}} certain skills to which humans will be better suited than {{machines}} <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{and the question is}} how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and {{led to the development of}} new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the [...] "man-robot merger". Some European countries are including robotics in their national programmes and trying to promote a safe and flexible co-operation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) organises annual workshops on the topic [...] "human-robot collaboration".|$|E

2500|$|The good press {{coverage}} gained Munch {{the attention of}} influential patrons Albert Kollman and Max Linde. He described the turn of events in his diary, [...] "After twenty years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany—and a bright door opens up for me." [...] However, despite this positive change, Munch's self-destructive and erratic behavior involved him first with a violent quarrel with another artist, then with an accidental shooting {{in the presence of}} Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. She finally left him and married a younger colleague of Munch. Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings. His paintings Still Life (The Murderess) and The Death of Marat I, done in 1906-7, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after effects.|$|E
2500|$|According to the [...] "baseline" [...] {{forecast}} of federal revenue and spending by the Congressional Budget Office (in its January 2005 Baseline Budget Projections), the budget deficits will decrease {{over the next}} several years. In this projection the deficit will fall to US$368 billion in 2005, US$261 billion in 2007, and US$207 billion in 2009, with a small surplus by 2012. The CBO noted, however, that this projection [...] "omits a significant amount of spending that will occur this year — and possibly <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> — for U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and for other activities related to the global War on Terrorism." [...] The projection also assumes that the Bush tax cuts [...] "will expire as scheduled on December 31, 2010." [...] If, as Bush has urged, the tax cuts were to be extended, then [...] "the budget outlook for 2015 would change from a surplus of US$141 billion to a deficit of US$282 billion." [...] Other economists have disputed this, arguing that the CBO does not use dynamic scoring, to take into account what effect tax cuts would have on the economy.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1914, {{after the}} visits to Nashville and Tuskegee, Shedd {{asked that his}} name be removed his name from {{consideration}} for the position, and sent a ten-page report to Wallace Buttrick at the General Education Board. Shedd's report was a windfall for the Board of Trustees and the General Education Board and provided a professional educator's candid assessment of the challenges awaiting the next President of Fisk. Shedd observed, [...] "The work of Fisk University was begun and has been carried on {{in an atmosphere of}} social ostracism and isolation, and while the white man in Tennessee is as liberal toward his black fellow-citizens as any where in the South, still this liberal spirit has yet amounted to very little. In fact, I am inclined to believe that the colored members of this faculty have a far more normal life than do their white colleagues. While I cannot say the sense of social isolation, which has compelled all the children of the faculty to be sent north for an education, and in some cases has compelled the wives of the professors to live in the North {{for the sake of the}} children has affected the efficiency of the work of [...] the faculty, still this condition must be recorded and deeply regretted." [...] Shedd also met with Tennessee Governor Ben W. Hooper while visiting Fisk. The meeting raised further questions in Shedd's mind, as the Governor expressed doubt [...] "as to whether Fisk could really do for the colored man what Vanderbilt was and is doing for the white" [...] and [...] "doubt as to whether <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> financial support could be gained in the South for the institution." [...] While at Tuskegee, Shedd met and spoke with Robert E. Park, a prominent sociologist who was advisor to Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee. Shedd reported Park's critique of Fisk. Park believed the [...] "fundamental basis for race discrimination, which is part of the Fisk problem, lies in the acceptance by it and for it of lower standards," [...] or, in other words, that [...] "the white, and from him, the colored man has accepted lower standards for the colored man than for the white man." [...] For Park, the remedy was to raise the scholastic standard to the level of the best collegiate institutions of the country. Shedd also reported that Nashville was ready to cooperate with the North in development of Fisk University as a first rate institution, and that fund raising was essential to place Fisk [...] "beyond the necessity of anxiety." [...] Shedd did not disclose specific reasons for removing his name from consideration, but his lengthy report suggests he was [...] "rather staggered with its difficulties and responsibilities" [...] of the President of Fisk.|$|E
