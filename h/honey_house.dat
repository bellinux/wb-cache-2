Further to the west along Tomewin Street, and {{also part of the}} 1989 Kiosk development project, is a stone-faced platform supporting a shade structure and some seating. Beyond these to the west is the <b>Honey</b> <b>House,</b> which has a room where the lorikeet food is prepared; and a large steel-framed aviary (Forest Fringe Aviary, 1990). These structures are not considered to be of significance.|$|E

50|$|The Trust pursued {{an active}} program of site {{development}} through the 1980s {{with the construction}} of a children's playground (1985-86), refurbishment of the Rainforest Aviary as the Rainforest Pool Aviary (1987), and construction of a Sub-Tropical Aviary (1988). In the 1990s a number of new facilities were constructed, including the Sir Walter Campbell Environmental Education centre, a new koala exhibit, the Koala Junction Kiosk, a freshwater crocodile display, a Tasmanian devil enclosure, four new cockatoo aviaries, and Flora Gully (which included rare and endangered species of plants).

40|$|This thesis defined {{historic}} apiary typologies {{and technologies}} including: bee houses and honey houses, bee shelters, stands, and hives. Because {{of a strong}} beekeeping tradition in Philadelphia and its influential role in the advancement of apiculture, this paper researched apiary typologies beginning in Philadelphia and its region. The Rev. L. L. Langstroth, a Philadelphian, experimented with beekeeping methods and technologies, inventing the moveable-frame hive in 1851, which would later make the bee house {{and other forms of}} protection unnecessary. Bee manual authors provided various structural forms to protect the hives, produce valuable honey, and aid the beekeeping process. These vernacular structures were either decorative and playful as an architectural folly in the landscape, or simply utilitarian and unadorned. A bee house and <b>honey</b> <b>house</b> remain intact in Madison, Indiana and stand as rare tangible evidence of the type. Other regions developed their own typologies, but common themes emerged. The typological defining features are; protecting the beehive from weather and temperature fluctuations, providing ample forage, utilizing trees as wind breaks, and locating the apiary near a frequented dwelling. This thesis reveals a once common but now obscure outbuilding type that has largely disappeared from the American cultural landscape and rescued the bee house form from near total obscurity...|$|E
40|$|Several {{archaeological sites}} in the lower Apalachicola River Valley have {{evidence}} of beekeeping {{in the late nineteenth}} to early twentieth centuries. At least two of these are also prehistoric sites (Depot Creek, 8 Gu 56 and Clark Creek, 8 Gu 60), which are Rangia (clam) shell mounds. Both sites are deep in the river swamp, which has the largest stand of tupelo trees in the world. The valley has a long tradition of beekeeping. Apiarists (beekeepers) would bring their bees by boat to remote locations in the swamps during the short tupelo flowering season {{to take advantage of the}} extensive forest. Tupelo honey has been commercially harvested since at least the nineteenth century, and has the reputation for being one of the finest honeys world-wide. It is prized for its light golden amber color and characteristic ability never to granulate, but to remain in a liquid state. Shell mounds in the swamps offered high ground on which to build honey production centers. Such remote locations also were ideal for moonshine stills, with the beekeeping and honey production as a plausible cover operation. A significant amount of historical artifacts was [sic] recovered from both sites to merit further research. A third site, Lower Chipola Apiary (8 Gu 104) is a single component early-to mid- twentieth-century apiary consisting of a standing two-story <b>honey</b> <b>house</b> and scattered beekeeping equipment. Archaeological methods, historical research, and oral histories were used to document beekeeping in the Apalachicola River Valley. Exploration of beekeeping and honey production in this valley during the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries has offered significant data on a once notable industry and way of life in northwest Florida, comparable to other agricultural industries...|$|E

Her aunt is revealed to be Miss Trunchbull, who appears (among other misdeeds) to be withholding her niece's inheritance so that Miss Honey has to live in poverty in a derelict farm cottage. Preparing to avenge Miss Honey, Matilda develops her telekinetic gift through practice at home. Later, during a lesson that Miss Trunchbull is teaching, Matilda telekinetically raises a piece of chalk to the blackboard and writes on it, posing as the spirit of Miss Honey's late father and demanding that Miss Trunchbull hand over Miss <b>Honey's</b> <b>house</b> and wages and leave the region forever. This is soon done, and {{with the approval of}} a new school headteacher, the capable and good-natured Mr Trilby, Matilda herself advances to the highest level of schooling. Rather to her relief, she is no longer capable of telekinesis; this is explained by Miss Honey as the result of using her mind on a more challenging curriculum.|$|R

50|$|As {{the time}} to harvest the {{marijuana}} approaches Grace has a chance encounter with Nicky, whose evasion of her makes her curious. The two finally talk, and Nicky asks Grace to ensure that her boyfriend won't get arrested. Moved by Nicky's plea, Grace tells Matthew that he won't be going to London to find a buyer, and subsequently sneaks off there herself. Grace's efforts to locate a dealer prove unsuccessful, and she ultimately has to be rescued from a police station by Honey after venturing into a seedy pub. At Honey's home, Grace manages to convince the other woman to call her dealer, Vince (Bill Bailey), to try and sell the marijuana.

60|$|Chorlton Road, August 9th.--We {{have changed}} our lodgings since my last date, those at Old Trafford being inconvenient, and the landlady a sharp, {{peremptory}} housewife, better fitted {{to deal with}} her own family than to be complaisant to guests. We are now a little farther from the Exhibition, and not much better off as regards accommodation, but the housekeeper is a pleasant, civil sort of a woman, auspiciously named Mrs. <b>Honey.</b> The <b>house</b> is a specimen of the poorer middle-class dwellings as built nowadays,--narrow staircase, thin walls, and, being constructed for sale, very ill put together indeed,--the floors with wide cracks between the boards, and wide crevices admitting both air and light over the doors, so that the house is full of draughts. The outer walls, it seems to me, are but of one brick in thickness, and the partition walls certainly no thicker; and the movements, and sometimes the voices, of people in the contiguous house are audible to us. The Exhibition has temporarily so raised the value of lodgings here that we have to pay a high price for even such a house as this.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Physical {{factors of}} {{refractive}} index, optical density, viscosity and surface tension demonstrated quantitative change throughout five stages of honey ripening process in indigenous hive honeybee Apis cerana indica. The five stages of nectar to honey transformations include floral nectar (fn), honey crop of foragers (hf), <b>honey</b> crop of <b>house</b> bees (hh), unsealed honey cells (uh) and sealed honey cells (sh). All the four physical factors gradually augmented through successive stages of honey ripening phenomena. The refractive index of floral nectaries and sealed honey cells was 1. 23 and 1. 49 respectively. Similarly, the optical density of house bees and unsealed honey cells was 0. 39 and 0. 54 respectively. Viscosity and surface tension of honey crop of foragers and sealed honey cells were 0. 15 poise, 0. 76 dynes/cms. and 76. 65 poise, 102. 01 dynes/cms. respectively. The {{analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) of viscosity and surface tension in honey formation was significant at P< 0. 01 % levels and refractive index and optical density of honey in ripening process was not significant at P< 0. 01 % levels Key words: Apis cerana indica, honey ripening, physical factors...|$|R
