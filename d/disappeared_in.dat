5|$|The {{next decade}} {{was one of}} mixed successes.

5|$|Western Khmer, {{also called}} Cardamom Khmer or Chanthaburi Khmer, is spoken {{by a very}} small, {{isolated}} population in the Cardamom mountain range extending from western Cambodia into eastern Central Thailand.

5|$|Wholesale funding <b>disappeared</b> <b>in</b> September 2008 {{leading to}} the {{collapse}} of Glitnir, Kaupthing and Landsbanki. Due {{to the size of the}} combined balance sheet of those banks the government of Iceland did not have the means to save those banks. They were put into receivership instead with their boards replaced. Nevertheless, the failed banks were restructured by dividing them into a new and an old bank in order to avoid a credit crunch.|$|E
5|$|At around 19:30, von Spee ordered Dresden and Leipzig {{to launch}} a torpedo attack against the damaged British armored cruisers. Dresden {{increased}} speed to position herself off the British bows, and briefly spotted Glasgow as she was withdrawing, but the British cruiser <b>disappeared</b> <b>in</b> the haze and gathering darkness. Dresden then encountered Leipzig; both ships initially thought the other was hostile. Dresdens crew was loading a torpedo when the two ships confirmed each other's identity. By 22:00, Dresden {{and the other two}} light cruisers were deployed in a line that searched unsuccessfully for the British cruisers. Dresden had emerged from the battle completely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Norman conquest, Dorchester was not a place of great significance; the Normans did build a castle but it has not survived. A priory was also founded, in 1364, though this also has since <b>disappeared.</b> <b>In</b> the later medieval period the town prospered; it became a {{thriving}} commercial and political centre for south Dorset, with a textile trading and manufacturing industry which continued until the 17th century. In {{the time of}} Edward III (1312–1377), the town was governed by bailiffs and burgesses, with the number of burgesses increasing to fifteen by the reign of James I (1566–1625).|$|E

5|$|In 1932 Waugh {{embarked}} on an extended voyage to South America. His decision to absent himself {{may have been a}} reaction to his increasingly complicated emotional life; while his passion for Teresa Jungman remained unrequited, he was involved in various unsatisfactory casual sexual liaisons, and was himself being pursued by the much older Hazel Lavery. The choice of South America was probably influenced by Peter Fleming, the literary editor of The Spectator. Fleming had recently returned from an expedition to Brazil seeking traces of Colonel Percy Fawcett who, in 1925, had <b>disappeared</b> <b>in</b> Brazil while searching for a fabled lost city.|$|E
5|$|Later, at FBI headquarters, Fox Mulder shows Dana Scully a {{photo of}} the missing loggers, telling her that another group of loggers <b>disappeared</b> <b>in</b> the forest in 1934. The two agents head to the forest, where they meet Park Ranger Larry Moore and Steve Humphreys, head of {{security}} for the logging company. While driving through the forest, their truck hits caltrops left in the ground by eco-terrorists, forcing them to walk the rest of the way. Upon arriving at the camp site, Mulder and Scully find the cabins abandoned and the communication equipment destroyed. Searching the forest, they find a corpse encased in a large cocoon hanging from a tree.|$|E
5|$|Nandanar {{entered the}} holy fire {{chanting}} {{the name of}} Shiva and reappeared in a new purified form. He looked like a Brahmin sage, wearing matted hair (characteristic of a Shaiva) and the sacred thread worn by Brahmins across his chest. His body was smeared with sacred ash. The gods showered flowers on the Nayanar from heaven and the Brahmins cheered. With the Brahmins, Nandanar went in the garbhagriha and saw Nataraja. The Nayanar <b>disappeared</b> <b>in</b> the image of Nataraja and became one with Shiva.|$|E

5|$|On 11 June 1928 the {{suburban}} line Potsdam-Stadtbahn-Erkner was fully equipped with DC third rail gear. Five trains {{of the new}} DRG Class ET 165 – the type appropriately named Stadtbahn – went into service, still sharing the track with steam trains. By November 1928 all lines leading toward the Stadtbahn, namely the lines from Kaulsdorf, Spandau and Grünau {{as well as the}} Berlin Ringbahn, were fully electrified. Therefore, suburban services to Spandau could be moved from the long-distance tracks to the local tracks. The last steam trains <b>disappeared</b> <b>in</b> 1929 when the ring became fully operated by electric trains. Half-ring trains operated only as peak time services.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells of a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player dropped his card on the floor and when he bent under the table to retrieve it noticed that the stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor <b>disappeared</b> <b>in</b> a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who <b>disappeared</b> <b>in</b> 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him {{that they did not have}} to dig because somebody already dug the coffin up and scratched the lid up. While they drive off with the body, Abbott inspects a dead tree. The creature is within and it eviscerates Abbott.|$|E
