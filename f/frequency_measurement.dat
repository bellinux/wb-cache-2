40|$|In {{magnetic}} resonance imaging, complex-valued measurements are acquired in time corresponding to spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>measurements</b> in space generally {{placed on a}} Cartesian rectangular grid. These complex-valued measurements are transformed into a measured complex-valued image by an image reconstruction method. The most common image reconstruction method is the inverse Fourier transform. It is known that image voxels are spatially correlated. A property of the inverse Fourier transformation is that uncorrelated spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>measurements</b> yield spatially uncorrelated voxel measurements and vice versa. Spatially correlated voxel measurements result from correlated spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>measurements.</b> This paper describes the resulting correlation structure between voxel measurements when inverse Fourier reconstructing correlated spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>measurements.</b> A real-valued representation for the complex-valued measurements is introduced along with an associated multivariate normal distribution. One potential application of this methodology is {{that there may be}} a correlation structure introduced by the measurement process or adjustments made to the spatial frequencies. This would produce spatially correlated voxel measurements after inverse Fourier transform reconstruction that have artificially inflated spatial correlation. One implication of these results is that one source of spatial correlation between voxels termed connectivity may be attributed to correlated spatial frequencies. The true voxel connectivity may be less than previously thought. This methodology could be utilized to characterize noise correlation in its original form and adjust for it. The exact statistical relationship between spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>measurements</b> and voxel measurements has now been established...|$|R

50|$|An early {{concern was}} related to time and <b>frequency</b> <b>measurement</b> {{instruments}} which had a dead time between measurements.
