The research program used sub-acute toxicological experiment on sexually mature white male rats of WAG population (body mass - 180 - 220 g). The animals were administered with water emulsion of investigated crown-ethers (12 -crown- 4, 15 -crown- 5, and 18 -crown- 6) in 1 / 100 and 1 / 1000 LD 50 daily, {{within 30 days}} perorally. The animals of the control group were given water at the same conditions. On the 30 th day of the experiment the rats of all groups were anesthetized by sodium thiopental (50 mg/kg) and slaughtered by decapitation with the <b>Guillotine</b> <b>knife.</b> Oxidantantioxidant interaction was evaluated using the following indexes: SH-groups, vitamin C, vitamin E contents; haptoglobin, MDA, and DC concentrations; ceruloplasmin, catalase, peroxidase, SOD, GP activities. All crown-ethers 1 / 1000 LD 50 (subtoxic dose) increased blood serum contents of DC by 80. 1; 75. 4; 70. 2 % and MDA 108. 9; 130. 8; 82. 4 % for 12 -crown- 4, 15 -crown- 5, 18 -crown- 6, respectively. Their action also resulted in enhancing the activity of investigated antioxidant system enzymes â€“ blood catalase (by 35 % on average), blood peroxidase (by 80 % on average), blood GP (by 60 % on average) and blood SOD (by 40 % on average). Crown-ethers significantly increased concentrations of serum ceruloplasmin (by 85 % on average) and haptoglobin (by 82 % on average). The concentration of the main antioxidant peptide glutathione (reduced form) was higher in blood of the experimental rats, whereas the general contents of SH-groups became diminished. The contents of adrenal gland vitamin C got increased (by more than 40 %) in the action of crown-ethers on the background of decreasing in serum vitamin E concentration. The action of 12 -crown- 4, 15 -crown- 5 and 18 -crown- 6 1 / 100 LD 50 resulted in the pronounced increase in blood serum contents of DC by 152; 138; 144 % and MDA by 178; 162; 154 %, respectively. The blood contents of SH-groups did not significantly changed at {{the influence of the}} investigated compounds. This dosage of crown-ethers further activated free-radical processes and lipid peroxidation, inhibiting antioxidant system, which was connected with membranes pathology development being at the base of structure-metabolic disturbances in different organs and tissues of the organism...|$|E

5000|$|Most {{professional}} oboists {{make their}} reeds since every oboist needs {{a slightly different}} reed to suit his or her individual needs. By making their reeds, oboists can precisely control factors such as tone color and tuning.Occasionally, novice oboists may begin with a Fibrecane reed, which is made of a synthetic material. Commercially available cane reeds are available in several degrees of hardness; a medium reed is usually used, and most beginners use medium-soft reeds. These reeds, like clarinet, saxophone, and bassoon reeds, are made from Arundo donax.As oboists gain more experience, they may start making their own reeds after the model of their teacher or buying handmade reeds (usually from a professional oboist) and using special tools including gougers, pre-gougers, <b>guillotines,</b> <b>knives,</b> and other tools to make the reed to their liking. According to the late John Mack, former principal oboist of the Cleveland Orchestra, an oboe student must fill a laundry basket with finished reeds in order to master the art. [...] "Making good reeds requires years of practice, and the amateur is often well advised not to embark on making his own reeds, ... Orchestral musicians sometimes do this reeds, and co-principals in particular often earn {{a bit on the}} side in this way. ... Many professional musicians import their reed cane ... directly from the growers in southern France and split it vertically into three parts themselves. Oboes require thicknesses of about 10 millimeters." [...] This allows each oboist to adjust the reeds precisely for individual embouchure, oral cavity, oboe angle, and air support. The reed is considered the part of oboe playing that makes it so difficult because slight variations in temperature, altitude, weather, and climate will change a perfectly working reed into an unplayable collection of cane.|$|R
