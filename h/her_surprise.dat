5|$|David left London in March, {{arriving}} in Rome {{just before the}} Easter celebrations. She toured the country, watching cooks {{at home and in}} restaurants and making extensive notes on the regional differences in the cuisine. While in Rome she met the painter Renato Guttuso; deeply impressed by his work, particularly his still lifes, she asked if he would illustrate her book. To <b>her</b> <b>surprise</b> he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, he kept to his word and produced a series of illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Only Valentino Garavani, who had {{designed}} the black evening gown Streep wears {{in the museum}} benefit scene, chose to make an appearance. Coincidentally, he was in New York during production and Finerman dared Field, an acquaintance, to ask him personally. Much to <b>her</b> <b>surprise,</b> he accepted. Other cameos of note include Heidi Klum as herself and Weisberger as the twins' nanny. Streep's daughter's film debut as a barista at Starbucks was cut. Gisele Bündchen agreed {{to be in the}} movie only if she did not play a model.|$|E
5|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who had {{recently}} returned from a diplomatic visit to the United Nations, visited {{the site of the}} explosion on August 7. She was berated by local residents; some were angry because <b>her</b> <b>surprise</b> visit halted work at the site, and others thought her presence was politically motivated. The president stayed briefly, visited the CEMAR and met Bonfatti. Kirchner's entourage was surrounded by members of La Cámpora, who tried to prevent demonstrations against her and keep journalists and residents at bay.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, Nina asks Thomas {{to reconsider}} choosing {{her to play}} the role. When he forcibly kisses her, she bites him before running out of his office. Later that day, Nina sees the cast list and discovers, much to <b>her</b> <b>surprise</b> and that of her overprotective mother Erica, {{that she will be}} portraying the lead. At a gala celebrating the new season, an intoxicated Beth confronts Nina, accusing her of sleeping with Thomas to get the role.

5|$|The series {{travels to}} various churches and congregations {{to have a}} single, unsuspecting member of the church {{presented}} with potential suitors. Each episode begins at the setting of a church service, with host Natalie Grant appearing to introduce the show. A single member of the congregation is introduced to his or <b>her</b> <b>surprise,</b> while {{members of the congregation}} then nominate other single members of the congregation as suitors. The number of suitors is immediately narrowed down to four; they are the top three as voted by the congregation and a fourth chosen by the pastor or minister.|$|E
5|$|Mario is {{the main}} {{character}} of The Thousand-Year Door, although the game will frequently cut to Princess Peach in the X-Naut Fortress. Much time is spent on her interaction with the computer TEC, which has suffered from a glitch and has {{fallen in love with}} Peach, much to <b>her</b> <b>surprise.</b> The main antagonist of the Mario series, Bowser, tries to collect the Crystal Stars before Mario does instead of directly opposing Mario, though his attempts mostly become comedic relief. Luigi's role in the game consists of recounting his slapstick adventures in the Waffle Kingdom, and appears with party members of his own, many of whom do not like Luigi at all for unrelated reasons, juxtaposing the universal respect Mario's partners have for Mario.|$|E

5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} Surekill and inquire {{as to the}} company's client, Carlton Chase. Doggett asks if Dwight did time, and he {{responds}} that he did. Doggett asks why Chase would have called Surekill just before his death. After the agents leave, Dwight confronts Tammi about the message, and she lies. Meanwhile, Randall watches Tammi through a wall. Tammi returns to Surekill {{early the next morning}} and rushes in to get the deposit book showing she has taken from the Surekill account out of her desk, but is caught by Dwight and Randall. Dwight is interrupted by the FBI, who have a search warrant. Doggett opens the box Tammi was trying to dispose of, which contains nothing, much to <b>her</b> <b>surprise.</b> Dwight claims he runs a clean business, but Scully pulls out several folders containing invoices for Chase.|$|E
5|$|Asumi's {{elementary}} and middle school classmate Shinnosuke Fuchuya also enters the academy much to <b>her</b> <b>surprise.</b> He defended Asumi from ridicule by other classmates throughout their childhood despite occasionally teasing her as well, and {{it has been suggested that}} he sees her as a romantic interest. The two eventually befriend three other students in the astronaut training program. Shu Suzuki, who is named student representative for the astronaut program, has an easygoing personality. He wears a distinctive face by shaving his eyebrows as a symbol of defiance against his father. Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and a deep sense of loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward gestures of friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father. The five students later make a promise to complete the astronaut program together as their friendship grows stronger. After three years in the astronaut program, Asumi is chosen out of eleven remaining students to take part in Japan's second human spaceflight mission, making her, at the age of eighteen, the youngest person to go into space.|$|E
5|$|Winthrop Rutherfurd died in March 1944 {{after a long}} illness. Lucy {{continued}} to meet with Roosevelt {{in the months that}} followed more frequently. In June 1944, Franklin requested of his daughter Anna, who was then managing some White House social functions and acting as hostess, that she help him arrange to meet Lucy without Eleanor's knowledge. Aware of Rutherfurd's role in her parents' early marriage, Anna was at first angry that her father had put her in such a difficult position. However, she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown. To <b>her</b> <b>surprise,</b> Anna found that she liked Lucy immediately, and the pair became friends. There were supposedly several dinners in the White House's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna's presence and obvious acceptance. When Eleanor discovered shortly after FDR's death from the female cousins of Anna's role in arranging for these meetings, the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and cool for some time.|$|E

60|$|A {{few moments}} later--he never could tell how many--the wickedness of his conduct came down upon Jeff like a thunderbolt. He removed his arm, drew {{away from her}} about three inches, and looked in <b>her</b> <b>surprised</b> face with a solemn, self-condemned expression.|$|R
60|$|She said nothing. She {{stood with}} parted lips by his side, and {{they watched the}} boy drive his bicycle along the sea-stained bank. Once he skidded, and she gave a little scream. Deane laughed at <b>her,</b> <b>surprised</b> to {{discover}} something unnatural in the sound.|$|R
60|$|She seemed {{suddenly}} to have stiffened. He looked at <b>her,</b> <b>surprised.</b> She was standing quite still, her hand gripping the post, her eyes fixed upon the waiting motor-car.

25|$|Lenglen {{arrived in}} New York City {{the day before}} the tournament after a stormy and delayed sea voyage, during which she was ill the whole time. Upon arrival, Lenglen learned that, without her permission, tournament {{officials}} had announced her participation in the US Championships.

Goss immediately defaulted, leaving Lenglen to face Mallory in the second round as her first opponent.|$|E

Althalie Range continued to serve as President of school and county-wide PTAs for sixteen years.Dunn. P. 186Robinson.|$|E
