40|$|Plants {{that have}} evolved to survive on metal-rich soils-metallophytes-have key values that must drive {{research}} of their unique properties and ultimately their conservation. The ability of metallophytes to tolerate extreme metal concentrations commends them for revegetation of mines and metal-contaminated sites. Metallophytes can also be exploited in environmental technologies, for example, phytostabilization, phytoremediation, and phytomining. Actions towards conserving metallophyte species are imperative, as metallophytes are increasingly under threat of extinction from mining activity. Although many <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> <b>describe</b> both the biology and applications of metallophytes, few have investigated the urgent need to conserve these unique species. This paper identifies {{the current state of}} metallophyte research, and advocates future research needs for the conservation of metallophyte biodiversity and the sustainable uses of metallophyte species in restoration, rehabilitation, contaminated site remediation, and other nascent phytotechnologies. Six fundamental questions are addressed: (1) Is enough known about the global status of metallophytes to ensure their conservation? (2) Are metallophytes threatened by the activities of the minerals industry, and can their potential for the restoration or rehabilitation of mined and disturbed land be realized? (3) What problems exist in gaining prior informed consent to access metallophyte genetic resources and how can the benefits arising from their uses be equitably shared? (4) What potential do metallophytes offer as a resource base for phytotechnologies? (5) Can genetic modification be used to "design" metallophytes to use in the remediation of contaminated land? (6) Does the prospect of using metallophytes in site remediation and restoration raise ethical issues? © 2004 Society for Ecological Restoration International...|$|E
5000|$|The first {{fluorescent}} ribose-modified ATP is 2’,3’-O-(2,4,7-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene) adenosine 5’triphosphate (TNP-ATP), and {{was introduced}} in 1973 by Hiratsuka and Uchida. [...] TNP-ATP was originally synthesized to investigate the ATP binding site of myosin ATPase. Reports of TNP-ATP’s success {{in the investigation of}} this motor protein extended TNP-ATP’s use to other proteins and enzymes. TNP-ATP has now been used as a spectroscopic probe for numerous proteins suspected to have ATP interactions. These include several protein kinases, ATPases, myosin, and other nucleotide binding proteins. Over the past twenty years, there have been <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> <b>describing</b> TNP-ATP’s use and applications. Many applications involving this fluorescently labeled nucleotide have helped to clarify structure-function relationships of many ATP-requiring proteins and enzymes. There have also been a growing number <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> that display TNP-ATP use as a means of assessing the ATP-binding capacity of various mutant proteins.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{analysis}} of high-throughput data sets, such as microarray data, often requires that individual variables (genes, for example) be grouped into small clusters such {{that all the}} variables in any given cluster have highly correlated values across all samples. Gene shaving is an established method for generating such clusters, but is overly sensitive to the input data: changing one sample out <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> can {{determine whether or not}} an entire cluster is found, even if the search is continued for many <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> clusters. This <b>paper</b> <b>describes</b> a clustering method based on the bootstrap aggregation (bagging) of gene shaving clusters, which overcomes this and other problems. The <b>paper</b> also <b>describes</b> the application of the new method to a large meta-data set of gene expression microarray data from brain tumor samples.

40|$|Wetland {{areas in}} the {{semiarid}} west of the United States play an important ecohydrological role. The size, location and function of wetlands are affected by numerous factors such as variations in water availability, water quality, geomorphic characteristics and anthropogenic factors such as runoff from irrigation systems, or discharge of urban effluents. Typically, wetland vegetation occurs in patches of variable size and plant species composition, requiring high-resolution imagery to accurately identify distribution and extent of the different wetland habitat types when mapping these complex systems. Airborne multispectral digital imaging offers several advantages, including costeffectiveness and ability to resolve wetland features {{ranging in size from}} a few meters to <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> hectares. This <b>paper</b> <b>describes</b> the mapping <b>of</b> wetland habitats within the Great Salt Lake Ecosystem using high resolution multispectral imagery (1 -m pixels). Image classification was based on super¬vised signature extraction supported by comprehensive ground truth. An error analysis was conducted using independent ground truth data, and the resulting classification accuracy for the final wetland resource map was 92 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of high power, high thrust ion engines requires the {{development of}} long life hollow cathodes capable of producing emission currents <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> amperes. This <b>paper</b> <b>describes</b> results obtained through the extended testing of two 12. 7 mm diameter hollow cathodes at high emission currents. The first cathode, operated on xenon {{for a total of}} 170 hours at an emission current of 100 A, sustained very little damage except for an increase in the cathode orifice diameter, from 0. 953 to 1. 71 mm. The second cathode was operated on xenon at 150 A emission current continuously for 24 hours, and for over 1000 hours at 100 A on argon with essentially no change in the cathode operating characteristics. Operation of this cathode was terminated due to severe erosion of several discharge chamber components located downstream of the cathode. The erosion of these components occurred despite operation at discharge voltages less than 24 volts, and poses a serious challenge to the sucessful implementation of multi-hundred ampere cathodes and high thrust ion engines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission {{addresses}} critical {{problems of}} the physics of explosive disturbances in the solar corona, and their propaga-tion and interactions in the interplanetary medium between the Sun and Earth. The In-Situ-Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT) investigation observes the consequences of these disturbances and other transients at 1 AU. The generation of energetic particles is a fundamentally important feature of shock-associated Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and other transients in the interplanetary medium. Multiple sensors within the IM-PACT suite measure the particle population from energies just above the solar wind up to <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> MeV/nucleon. This <b>paper</b> <b>describes</b> a portion <b>of</b> the IMPACT Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) package, the Suprathermal Ion Telescope (SIT) which identifies the heavy ion composition from the suprathermal through the energetic particle range (∼few 10 s of keV/nucleon to several MeV/nucleon). SIT will trace and identify processes that energize low energy ions, and characterize their transport in the interplanetary medium. SIT is a time-of-flight mass spectrometer with high sensitivity designed to derive detailed multi-species particle spectra with a cadence of 60 s, thereby enabling detailed studies of shock-accelerated and other energetic particle populations observed at 1 AU...|$|R
40|$|The Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) System of the ATLAS Experiment {{comprises}} {{three stages}} of event selection. The Event Filter (EF) {{is the third}} level trigger and is software implemented. Its primary goal is the final selection of interesting events with reduction of the event rate down to ~ 200 Hz acceptable by the mass storage. The EF System will be implemented {{as a set of}} independent commodity components Sub-Farms, each connected to the Event Builder subsystem to receive full events {{and on the other side}} to the Sub-Farm Output nodes, where the selected events are forwarded to mass storage. A distinctive feature of the Event Filter is its ability to use the full event data for selection directly based on the offline reconstruction and analysis algorithms. Besides the main duties on event triggering and data transportation, the EF is also able to provide additional functionalities, like monitoring of the selected events and online calibration of the ATLAS detectors. Significant design improvements are currently under development to provide these additional functionalities to the EF System. The Event Filter was deployed and tested in data triggering at the ATLAS Combined Test Beam at CERN in 2004. The EF is also subject to various tests on dedicated test-bed computer clusters, where both the EF functionalities and performance are studied. Special tests are being done when running the EF software components on the large-scale EF Farms, with <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> computers. This <b>paper</b> <b>describes</b> the current activities and plans on development and testing of the ATLAS Event Filter System...|$|R
