500|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of PCD (2005), {{and over the}} course of two years (2005–07), Scherzinger recorded 75-100 songs for Her Name Is Nicole, her planned solo debut album. [...] Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity as she began work on her own music. She stated that she enjoyed collaborating with many different artists, and that although she had been writing songs for over ten years, she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was at a different level while working with such A-list writers and producers. Following the moderate success of [...] "Baby Love", the complete lack of success of the singles such as [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] and numerous push backs, Scherzinger decided to put the release of the on hold. She then returned her focus back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album. Scherzinger cited that she felt as if the songs were more suited as a Pussycat Dolls song than her own.|$|E
500|$|... "Alive" [...] doesn't {{appear on}} the film score of Enough, and instead was {{included}} on Lopez's first remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes (2002). It was serviced to radio in the United States on May 21, 2002, by Epic Records. The song was released commercially on a 12" [...] vinyl as a double a-side along with [...] "I'm Gonna Be Alright" [...] on July 30. Music critics were divided on [...] "Alive"; some deemed Lopez's change in musical style to be refreshing, while others <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> should stick to the dance arrangements of her previous work. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Jim Gable. It features Lopez playing the piano, writing the lyrics to [...] "Alive" [...] and recording the song, intercut between scenes from Enough. While the song failed to appear on any national charts, it did reach number two on the US Billboard Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart. Lopez performed the song live on The Oprah Winfrey Show on May 17, 2002.|$|E
500|$|Tenar {{begins to}} {{question}} her beliefs {{when she hears}} Kossil defying the Nameless Ones, and sees {{that they do not}} punish her. She has a conversation with Penthe, her only friend, who expresses an [...] "unfaith" [...] in the divinity of the God-king. Though Tenar reacts to this with shock, the incident opens a new perspective to her. In her own thoughts, [...] "she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had looked up and suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an entirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter." [...] Ged acts as a catalyst for this stream of thought, because he is completely alien to her; he is male, brown-skinned, and has a picture of the world is so different from Tenar's own. After speaking to him, she begins to wonder whether the Nameless Ones, despite their power, deserve her worship, and begins to lose faith in them and in all the things she has been taught. She expects to find only evil in Ged, according to what she has been taught; but instead she finds light and love, further challenging her belief.|$|E

500|$|Sheen {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with English actress Kate Beckinsale from 1995 until 2003. They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995, and began living together shortly afterwards. Their daughter, Lily Mo Beckinsale-Sheen, was born in 1999 in London, England. The actress has said she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] that Sheen never proposed, but <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were married. Their relationship ended in January 2003, soon after the couple moved to Los Angeles from London. Beckinsale had persuaded director Len Wiseman to cast Sheen in Underworld; but while on set, she and Wiseman fell in love, and subsequently married in 2004. Sheen has said he continues to live in Los Angeles to be close to his daughter. He remains friends with Beckinsale. [...] "We were very lucky in that we didn't have an acrimonious split," [...] Beckinsale has said. [...] "We are still very close and [...] sees us around each other." [...] "He's absolutely one of my most favourite people ever." [...] "I love him dearly—I would miss him dreadfully if he wasn't in my life."

500|$|Another summertime {{birthday}} celebration in the Netherlands {{was that of}} Wilhelmina's mother, Queen-Regent Emma, who after Wilhelmina attained adulthood generally spent her own birthday, 2 August, at Soestdijk Palace in Baarn. [...] Until her death in 1934, Emma received an annual floral tribute from the townsfolk on her birthday. [...] In 1937 Wilhelmina's daughter and heiress, Princess Juliana, took up residence at Soestdijk Palace following her marriage, and the townsfolk made their floral presentation to her, moving the date to Juliana's birthday, 30 April. In September 1948 Juliana ascended to the Dutch throne and from 1949 onwards Koninginnedag was on her birthday. [...] The change in date attracted immediate approval from Dutch children, who gained an extra day of holiday. [...] The first observance of the holiday on the new date included a huge circus at the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium—one not attended by the royal family, who remained at Soestdijk Palace. [...] Queen Juliana retained the floral tribute, staying each year on Koninginnedag at Soestdijk Palace to receive it. [...] The parade became televised in the 1950s, and Koninginnedag increasingly became a national holiday, with workers given the day off. Juliana {{had a reputation as}} a [...] "queen of the people", and according to Peek, [...] "it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> invited her subjects to the royal home".|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} feature live action footage {{in the game}} after {{becoming}} frustrated with his previous projects, particularly with the technical challenge of translating an actor's performance into a game engine. Barlow set out to work with an actor on Her Story, having enjoyed the process while working at Climax Studio, albeit with a larger budget. He contacted Viva Seifert, whom he had intermittently worked with on [...] for a year, before its cancellation. He felt that Seifert is [...] "very good at picking up a line and intuitively pulling {{a lot of the}} subtext into her performance", which led him to believe that she was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role in Her Story. When Barlow asked Seifert to audition, he sent her a 300-page script, which he managed to reduce to 80 pages, by altering font size, as well as some dialogue; she accepted the role. Seifert began to feel pressure midway through filming, when she realised that [...] "the whole game is hinging" [...] on her performance. She described the shoot as [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "rather exhausting", and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was [...] "subtly being scrutinised" [...] by Barlow, which helped her performance. Barlow also felt that the intensity helped Seifert's performance, taking cues from director Alfred Hitchcock, who would upset his actors in order to achieve the greatest performance. Seifert felt that there were small nuances in her performance that may have [...] "added some twists and turns" [...] for players that Barlow had not anticipated. The game's seven police interviews were filmed roughly in chronological order over five days, in a process that Barlow called [...] "natural". Barlow travelled to Seifert's home county of Cornwall to film. He felt that finding the locations for the interrogation rooms was the simplest part of production, because [...] "everywhere has crappy looking rooms", with footage being recorded in a council building in Truro. When filming was complete, Barlow wanted {{to give the impression that}} the videos had been recorded in 1994, but found digital filters were unable to capture this time frame appropriately. Instead, he recorded the footage through two VHS players to create imperfections in the video before digitising the video into the game.|$|E

2500|$|Young Katherine both {{drew and}} wrote as hobbies, but her first formal {{training}} in painting was at the Corcoran Art School in Washington, D.C., in 1919–1920. After {{she and her mother}} went back to Italy in 1920, she studied art in Rome for several years, learning conventional techniques and styles. She particularly enjoyed painting outdoors in the Roman Campagna with teacher Oronato Carlandi and fellow students. Much later, Sage stated that “these were the happiest days of my life”, and she told friend and gallery owner Julien Levy in 1961 that her campagna experience shaped her “perspective idea of distance and going away.” [...] Nonetheless, in later years Sage usually claimed that she was self-taught, perhaps because, as one of her biographers, Judith Suther, states, most of what she had learned in Rome bore so little relationship to the kind of painting she eventually did that “she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had studied with no one.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1996, Gordeeva {{returned}} to the ice, this time as a solo performer. Her first solo performance was a tribute to her late husband, skated to the 'Adagietto' section of Gustav Mahler's 'Symphony No. 5'. The number was publicly performed only twice, first at a preview performance at the Minto Skating Club in Ottawa Ontario, [...] and then on February 27, 1996, in a televised tribute to Grinkov, called [...] "Celebration of a Life", in which numerous skating luminaries took part. Gordeeva has said that she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> skated with Sergei that night, that she was [...] "double strong" [...] because she felt him with her. The same year, {{with the aid of}} author E. M. Swift, she told her story in a book titled [...] In February 1998, CBS aired an eponymous docudrama based on the book. She published a second book in April 1998, titled A Letter for Daria. In 1998, she told an interviewer that [...] "My life of great skating, and skating with him, is over, ...

2500|$|One Ojibwa {{woman from}} the far western end of Lake Superior, Oshahgushkodanaqua, who married in 1793 John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault St. Marie working for the North West Company, later gave an account in her old age of how she came {{to be married to}} a British writer named Anna Brownell Jameson. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Oshahgushkodanaqua told her when she was 13, she {{embarked}} on her [...] "vision quest" [...] to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Oshahgushkodanaqua's [...] "vision quest": [...] "She dreamed continually of a white man, who approached her with a cup in his hand, saying [...] "Poor thing! Why are you punishing yourself? Why do you fast? Here is food for you!" [...] He was always accompanied by a dog, who looked up at her like he knew her. Also, she dreamed of being on a high hill, which was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was being carried up into the heavens, and as she looked down on the earth, she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, [...] "All my relations will be burned!", but a voice answered and said, [...] "No, they will not be destroyed, they will be saved!", and she knew it was a spirit, because the voice was not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned to her father's lodge". About five years later, Oshahgushkodanaqua first met Johnston, who asked to marry her, but was refused permission by her father who did not think he wanted a long-term relationship. When Johnston returned the next year and again asked to marry Oshahgushkodanaqua, her father granted permission, but she herself declined, saying she disliked the implications of being married until death, but ultimately married under strong pressure from her father. Oshahgushkodanaqua came to embrace her marriage when she decided that Johnston was the white stranger she saw in her dreams during her vision quest. The couple stayed married for 36 years with the marriage ending with Johnston's death, and Oshahgushkodanaqua {{played an important role in}} her husband's business career. Jameson also noted Oshahgushkodanaqua was considered to be a strong woman among the Ojibwa, writing [...] "in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe".|$|E
