5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> and second pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear {{during the first half}} of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.|$|E
