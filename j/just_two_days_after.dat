5|$|Edrich {{came on and}} bowled a bouncer, which Bradman {{tried to}} swing to the leg side, but instead the edge went {{in the air and}} landed behind point. On 13, Bradman played a Bedser ball from his legs, {{narrowly}} evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour he was on 14. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Doug Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. At the lunch break, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. Shortly afterwards, in the third over after the resumption of play, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for 38 for the third consecutive time in Tests by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg, <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> falling the same way in the second innings against Yorkshire. According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he was before World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly said that {{this was the first time}} that Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession. Australia reached 7/258 at the end of day one, before a lower order burst took them to 350 on the second morning.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Kujira, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Amang, was an {{extremely}} long-lived tropical cyclone that lasted for 16days affected the island nations of Micronesia, Taiwan, and Japan in April2003, {{as well as the}} earliest typhoon in a calendar year to ever make landfall on the latter. Forming from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April9 well removed form any landmasses, Kujira quickly intensified in its early stages, and was upgraded to a tropical storm <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> cyclogenesis. Strengthening slowed afterwards, though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April14. Intensification continued and late on April15, Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Following peak intensity, Kujira would begin to track northwest and oscillate in strength, cresting an additional two times in intensity. On April21, the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track erratically for several days east of Taiwan. However, on April24, Kujira would resume a northward track and begin to weaken, and on April24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on Kyushu. Following landfall Kujira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and continued to persist before these extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline towards the end of April2003.|$|E

5000|$|In 1851, two of {{the fastest}} clippers, Flying Cloud and Bald Eagle, left Whampoa laden with tea <b>just</b> <b>two</b> or three <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the Ganges. Ganges appears to have beaten her two rivals to Anjer, in a strong southwestern monsoon, and arrived at the English Channel on 16 December.On the {{following}} morning at daylight we were off Portland, well inshore and under short sail, light winds from the northeast, and weather rather thick. About 8 A.m. the wind freshened and the haze cleared away, which showed two large and lofty ships two or three miles to windward of us. They proved to be our American friends, having their Stars and Stripes flying for a pilot. Captain Deas at once gave orders to hoist his signals for a pilot also, and as, by this time, several cutters were standing out from Weymouth, the Ganges, being farthest inshore got her pilot first on board. I said that I would land in the pilot-boat and go to London by rail, and would report the ship that night or next morning at Austin Friars. (She was consigned to my firm.) The breeze had considerably freshened before I got on board the pilot cutter, when the Ganges filled away on the port tack, and Captain Deas, contrary to his wont, for {{he was a very}} cautious man, crowded on all small sails. The Americans lost no time and were after him, and I had three hours view of as fine an ocean race as I can wish to see; the wind being dead ahead, the ships were making short tacks. The Ganges showed herself to be the most weatherly of the three; and the gain on every tack inshore was obvious, neither did she seem to carry way behind in fore reaching. She arrived off Dungeness six hours before the other two, and was in the London docks twenty-four hours before the first, and thirty-six hours before the last of her opponents. [...] "However, the Ganges in question is identified in various sources as a British ship, not an American clipper.Clark adds:"It is always unpleasant to spoil a really good story, but in this instance I feel constrained {{to point out that the}} Flying Cloud arrived at San Francisco on August 31, 1851, after her famous passage of 89 days from New York; it is therefore difficult to understand how she could have sailed from Wampoa on the Canton River on or about September 1st of that year, as stated by Mr. Cowper; while the Bald Eagle was not launched until 1852." ...|$|R
