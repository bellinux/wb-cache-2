25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|Joe Kernan {{was adamant}} that Diarmuid Marsden {{did not deserve}} to be sent off and criticised players for pretending to be injured during the game. The player himself also {{disagreed}} with the decision: [...] "The umpire said I struck him but I <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> man coming towards me and {{it was more a}} case of getting myself out of the way or protecting myself." [...] He added: [...] "I'd never been sent off for Armagh before and to be sent off in an All-Ireland final is hard to take. Hopefully I won't be remembered for that. And I wouldn't like to end the career on that note." [...] Kernan and Marsden contested the decision and subsequent ban, but the GAA's Games Administration Committee upheld the penalty. However, after taking their case to the Central Council, the ban was overturned.|$|E
500|$|McElhenny {{was also}} an asset in the {{receiving}} game, becoming a favorite target of quarterback Y. A. Tittle on screen passes. His versatility drew praise from opposing coaches, including George Halas of the Chicago Bears and Steve Owen of the New York Giants. Former Bears quarterback Johnny Lujack lauded McElhenny as [...] "the best running back I have seen in a long, long time." [...] Also noted was his vision; he had an uncanny ability of seeing and reacting to tacklers in his peripheral vision. [...] "If you ever watched McElhenny", explained Washington State coach Jim Sutherland, [...] "you'd think he had eyes {{on the back of}} his head. I've seen him cut away from a tackler that 99 percent of the backs wouldn't even have seen. It wasn't instinct—he <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> guy, out of the corner of his eye." [...] McElhenny described his playing style as such: [...] "My attitude carrying the ball was fear—not a fear of getting hurt but a fear of getting caught from behind and taken down and embarrassing myself and my teammates." ...|$|E

500|$|Barker {{grew up in}} the Florence Park area of Oxford, {{and went}} to Donnington Junior School, and then the City of Oxford High School for Boys. [...] Barker's {{chemistry}} textbook at Oxford was previously used by T. E. Lawrence. He found his talent for humour at school and developed his musical ability by singing in the choir at St James's, his local church. He got into the sixth form a year early after gaining the School Certificate but he felt what he was learning would be of no use to him in later life and so left as soon as he could. After leaving school he trained as an architect but gave it up after six months, feeling he was not skilled enough. Barker took his sister Vera's job as a bank clerk at the Westminster Bank after she had left to become a nurse. He harboured dreams of becoming an actor, and took up amateur dramatics, although initially he <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> pastime as a chance to meet girls. For 18 months, while at the bank, he worked as an actor and stage manager, making his first appearance in A Murder Has Been Arranged as the musical director of the play-within-a-play. Eventually he gave up his job to become a professional actor. His father did not support his acting ambition.|$|E
2500|$|Jeremy Sisto (Billy Chenowith) and Peter Krause (Nate Fisher) both {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of David. [...] However, director Sam Mendes had just finished working with Hall on the Broadway show Cabaret and called him one day at noon to invite him to audition {{for the role}} that evening. [...] Ball (who had worked with Mendes on the film American Beauty) said that, after four days of auditions [...] " [...] started reading, and I <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> character come to life. And it was David." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{look was}} created by Doctor Who costume {{designer}} Howard Burden who wanted to strip the Doctor back to the bare basics. His design was described as [...] "No frills, no scarfs, no messing, just 100% rebel Time Lord." [...] Capaldi said that the costume {{took a long time}} to find. The reason he settled on his final costume was because, [...] "I think it's quite a hard look. I always wanted him to be in black – I always <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Doctor in dark colours. Not tweed," [...] in reference to his immediate predecessor's original costume. [...] "Matt's a really young cool guy – he can wear anything, but I wanted to strip it back and be very stark." [...] He also described it as [...] "back to basics." [...] Moffat described the look as [...] "A stick-insect sort of thing". He also said that Clara calls him [...] "a grey-haired stick-insect at one point". Capaldi also stated that he chose the Twelfth Doctor's costume so fans of the show who enjoy cosplay could easily emulate it without going to great expense. Writing for Radio Times, fashion columnist Anna Fielding described it as [...] "a classic early skinhead look" [...] and linked it to Capaldi's history as a punk musician.|$|E

2500|$|Obama noted his interracial and {{international}} heritage: {{he was born}} in Honolulu, Hawaii to a Kenyan immigrant father and a white mother from Kansas. He emphasized the power of education, recounting the privilege of attending the exclusive Punahou School and Harvard Law School despite his family's poverty, and criticized the perception that poor black youths who read books are [...] "acting white." [...] He went on to describe his successful career in law and politics while raising a family in Chicago. [...] "In no other country on Earth is my story even possible," [...] Obama proclaimed. Towards the end of his speech, he emphasized the importance of hope in the American saga, and he illustrated how that hope manifested itself in the lives of John Kerry, John Edwards, and even his own personal life, as [...] "a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him too." [...] According to Obama, the [...] "audacity of hope" [...] is [...] "God's greatest gift" [...] to Americans, allowing him to feel optimistic that the lives of average Americans can be improved with the right governmental policies. Following the speech political commentator Chris Matthews rightly predicted [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> first black president".|$|E
6000|$|... "But surely you, Eleanor-you're {{not going}} in! You'll {{never be able}} to stand it, even if you find a seat. The few people we know who've come are leaving. I <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Allan Pendletons." ...|$|E
60|$|Hugh was up {{a moment}} after Joe Sedley, {{for the latter}} had been nearer to {{a man with a}} torch, but he <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> narrow escape his master had, and was so shaken that his hand trembled as he wrung that of his comrade.|$|E
6000|$|Densher, {{from whom}} an impatience had escaped, had already caught himself up. [...] "Pardon my brutality. Of course I know what you're talking about. I <b>saw</b> him, toward <b>the</b> evening," [...] he further explained, [...] "in <b>the</b> Piazza; only <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> him--through <b>the</b> glass at Florian's--without any words. In fact I {{scarcely}} know him--there wouldn't have been occasion. It was but once, moreover--he {{must have gone}} that night. But I knew he wouldn't have come for nothing, and I turned it over--what he would have come for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{course he}} didn't know that cipher; {{but he was}} the gratefullest man you ever <b>saw,</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> same, for being let out of an uncomfortable place on such easy terms. He said: ...|$|R
60|$|He stood perhaps {{ten feet}} from the table where his gun lay. I saw him calculating chances. He was game. He had the courage that forced me to respect him.

6000|$|... "Peter, I {{believe those}} scoundrels {{are up to}} their old game, {{and that we are}} watched. Once or twice since we have been sitting here I have noticed a heavy-looking fellow glance at us very closely as he passed, and I <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> same fellow, who was evidently hiding from observation, nod to that girl, and beckon her away." ...|$|E
6000|$|SECOND, I {{had a fine}} time, {{rather a}} troubled one, at Newport and New York; saw much of and liked hugely the Fairchilds, St. Gaudens the sculptor, Gilder of the CENTURY - <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> dear Alexander - {{saw a lot of}} my old and admirable friend Will Low, whom I wish you knew and {{appreciated}} - was medallioned by St. Gaudens, and at last escaped to ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} moment there arose from the streets a cry, or wail. Suddenly a {{rumbling}} noise was heard. Lawrence bounded towards the nearest door. Full well he knew what it meant. Before he could escape {{there was a tremendous}} upheaval of the solid earth, and in one instant, without further warning, the entire town fell with one mighty crash! Lawrence <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> walls and roof collapsing--then all was dark, and consciousness forsook him.|$|E
5000|$|The Quendi were sundered {{after the}} {{awakening}} and many sub-groups appeared. The First Sundering occurred when some left Middle-earth {{to live in}} the blessed realm of Valinor, while others stayed behind. This produced the Eldar, who accepted the call to come to Valinor, and the Avari who refused the great journey.Elves who stayed in Middle-earth and never <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> light of the trees became known as the Moriquendi or [...] "Dark-elves".

6000|$|... 'Ah, Flossie {{can look}} after herself,' said her mother; 'she often goes off {{in this way}} like a true child of the wilderness.' But Mr Mackenzie, who came in <b>just</b> then and <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> note for the first time, looked rather grave, though he said nothing.|$|R
60|$|Therefore, <b>just</b> {{before he}} <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> dim {{lights of the}} {{lanterns}} disappearing down the road, which at this point makes a sharp dip before rising abruptly once more {{on the outskirts of}} the wood, Sir Marmaduke finally put his foot in the stirrup and started to follow.|$|R
6000|$|... "One o' the lightermen let go o' {{the skipper}} and went arter 'er, and, just as I was giving {{the other three}} a helping 'and, 'e came back with 'er. Mrs. Pratt caught 'er breath, {{and as for the}} skipper, 'e didn't know where to look, as the saying is. I <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> lady give 'im one quick look, and then afore I could dream of wot was coming, she rushes up to me and flings 'er long, bony arms round my neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it. I was up with my squad {{in those}} divers' dresses, inside the gas-chambers, with sheets of silk for caulking.

I never saw one of those American aeroplanes. <b>Just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> shots flicker through the chambers and sent off men for the tears. We caught fire a bit--not much, you know. We were too wet, so the fires spluttered out before we banged. And then one of their infernal things {{dropped out of the}} air on us and rammed. Didn't you feel it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Before I {{could force}} {{myself out of}} the crowd, and escape into the road, Margaret and Mr. Mannion had hurried into a cab. I <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> vehicle driving off rapidly, as I got free. An empty cab was {{standing}} near me--I jumped into it directly--and told the man to overtake them. After having waited my time so patiently, to let a mere accident stop me from going home with them, as I had resolved, {{was not to be}} thought of for a moment. I was hot and angry, after my contest with the crowd; and could have flogged on the miserable cab-horse with my own hand, rather than have failed in my purpose.|$|E
5000|$|On January 15, 2014, it was {{announced}} that the band had signed to the independent UK-based label Xtra Mile Recordings for a worldwide release of the album.

60|$|What {{should she}} do? To {{throw it away}} would seem stupid, and to keep it was awkward.

6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] {{came the}} reply from farther {{back in the}} wood. [...] "If there {{is a man with}} her and he will not surrender, shoot him." [...] At the words Barney and the girl turned once more to their flight. From behind came the command to halt--"Halt! or I fire." [...] <b>Just</b> ahead Barney <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|R
6000|$|... "Down {{came the}} foremast, {{crushing}} {{half a dozen}} men as she fell. Her deck was nearly level with the water now. I climbed over {{the wreck of the}} foremast, and run out along the bowsprit. I looked round just as I leaped. The pirate captain was standing at the wheel. He had a pistol to his head, and I saw the flash, and he fell. Then I dived off and swam under water as hard as I could {{to get away from the}} sinking ship. When I came up I looked round. I <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> flutter of a black flag above the water and she was gone. I was a good swimmer, and got rid of my shoes and jacket, and made up my mind for a long swim, for the frigate was too busy with the brig for any one to pay attention to us, but it did not take long to finish it.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ailie was not {{the only}} person at the Dovecot who admired Tommy. Though in duty bound, as young patriots, to jeer at him for having been born in the wrong place, the pupils of his own age could not resist the charm of his reminiscences; even Gav Dishart, a son of the manse, listened attentively to him. His great topic was his birthplace, and {{whatever}} happened in Thrums, he instantly made contemptible by citing something of the same kind, but on a larger scale, that had happened in London; he turned up his nose almost farther than was safe when they said Catlaw was a stiff mountain to climb. ("Oh, Gav, if you <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> London mountains!") Snow! why they didn't know what snow was in Thrums. If they could only see St. Paul's or Hyde Park or Shovel! he couldn't help laughing at Thrums, he couldn't--Larfing, he said at first, but in a short time his Scotch was better than theirs, though less unconscious. His English was better also, of course, and you had to speak in a kind of English when inside the Hanky School; you got your revenge at [...] "minutes." [...] On the whole, Tommy irritated his fellow-pupils a good deal, but they found it difficult to keep away from him.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the things}} that first {{attracted}} me to VCU was the opportunity for interdisciplinary discussions and interactions.

I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> opportunity for engineering, for arts, for research, for graphic design. All {{of the things}} I was interested in learning about all came together...|$|R
30|$|The AFC {{does not}} suffer from any {{particular}} negative {{interactions with the}} BSS algorithm since it comes first in the processing chain, but rather benefits from BSS, especially in the low-reverberation chamber, as we <b>just</b> <b>saw.</b> Note that <b>the</b> situation is very different when the AFC is applied after BSS. In this case, the AFC filters need to quickly follow the continuously time-varying BSS filters, which prevents proper convergence of the AFC filters, even with time-invariant FBPs.|$|R
50|$|In December 1961, {{he told a}} {{news conference}} that “sometimes I think this country {{would be better off}} if we could <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> off <b>the</b> Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea”, a remark which {{indicated}} his dislike of the liberal economic and social policies that were often associated with that part of the nation. That comment came back to haunt him, in the form of a Johnson television commercial, as did remarks about making Social Security voluntary and selling the Tennessee Valley Authority. In his most famous verbal gaffe, Goldwater once joked that the U.S. military should “lob one nuclear bomb into the men’s room of the Kremlin” in the Soviet Union.|$|R
