5000|$|Bio{{semiotics}} (from the Greek bios meaning [...] "life" [...] and semeion meaning [...] "sign") is a {{field of}} semiotics and biology that studies the production and interpretation of signs and codes in the biological realm. Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the findings of biology and semiotics and proposes a paradigmatic shift in the scientific view of life, demonstrating that semiosis (sign process, including meaning and interpretation) {{is one of its}} immanent and intrinsic features. The term biosemiotic was first used by <b>Friedrich</b> <b>S.</b> Rothschild in 1962, but Thomas Sebeok and Thure von Uexküll have implemented the term and field. The field, which challenges normative views of biology, is generally divided between theoretical and applied biosemiotics.|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{analysis}} of flat-plate radiative panels operation using average hourly weather data for a maritime climate region was performed. The panels are integrated {{in the space}} ventilation system with air-cooling {{by means of a}} cold-water coil. Their primary function is to prepare sufficient quantity of cold water, integrating radiative and convective cooling, that is collected in the cold-water tank during the nighttime operation. That cold water is used for cooling of the air during daytime. By small modification during daytime, solar panels could be turned into collectors and used to produce the hot water that is collected in a separate tank.

5000|$|Sulloway retraces Freud's {{intellectual}} development and places psychoanalysis {{in a historical}} context larger than that accepted by its proponents. Using sources such as Freud's personal library, Sulloway ties Freud's thinking to contemporary biological theories, and shows that Freud took care {{to hide the fact}} that his psychology was derived from neurobiology. Sulloway criticizes the [...] "psychoanalytic legend": the idea that Freud was a lonely hero who, in a hostile intellectual climate, created ex nihilo an entirely new psychology through sheer personal brilliance and courage. Sulloway believes that such myths are sectarian propaganda and obscure Freud's real greatness. Sulloway explores in detail the influence of Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Havelock Ellis, Iwan Bloch, H. H.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze and improve the {{transient}} stability of an industrial {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) system in a high-tech science park in Taiwan. The CHP system installed two 161 [*]kV/ 161 [*]kV high-impendence transformers to connect with Taipower System (TPS) for both decreasing the short-circuit fault current and increasing the fault critical clearing time. The transient stabilities of three types of operation modes in CHP units, 3 G 1 S, 2 G 1 S, and 1 G 1 S, are analyzed. Under the 3 G 1 <b>S</b> <b>operation</b> mode, the system frequency is immediately restored to 60 [*]Hz after tie line tripping with the TPS.

To simulate the behaviour of electronic competition, we have implemented a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to represent the performance of two competitive sellers and one buyer under uniform and discriminatory pricing rules. As a case study, our proposed pricing rules are tested on the power grid of the Joondalup campus of Edith Cowan University in Western Australia.

40|$|International audienceSince the {{discovery}} of Merkel cells by <b>Friedrich</b> <b>S.</b> Merkel in 1875, knowledge of their structure has increased with the progression of new technologies such as electron and laser microscopy, and immunohistochemical techniques. For most vertebrates, Merkel cells {{are located in the}} basal layer of the epidermis and characterized by dense-core granules that contain a variety of neuropeptides, plasma membrane spines and cytoskeletal filaments consisting of cytokeratins and desmosomes. The presence of the two latter structures would suggest that Merkel cells originate from the epidermis rather than from the neural crest, even though such a hypothesis is not unanimously accepted. The function of the Merkel cell is also very controversial. For a long time, it has been accepted that Merkel cells with associated nerve terminals act as mechanoreceptors although the transduction mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Merkel cells that do not make contact with nerve terminals have an endocrine function. The present review aims to shed new and comparative light on this field with an attempt to investigate the stimuli that Merkel cells are able to perceive...|$|R
