Therefore, we investigated the influence of stress on NK 1 receptor activation at the colonic level in female rats. Methods: The stress procedure used consisted of two hours of partial restraint. Histamine release was measured from colonic samples of control and stressed animals and the effect of SR 140333, a NK 1 receptor antagonist, on substance P induced histamine release was determined.

40|$|Halophilic {{microorganisms}} thrive at elevated {{concentrations of}} sodium chloride up to saturation and {{are capable of}} growing {{on a wide variety}} of carbon sources like various organic acids, hexose and also pentose sugars. Hence, the biotechnological application of these microorganisms can cover many aspects, such as the treatment of hypersaline waste streams of different origin. Due to the fact that the high osmotic pressure of hypersaline environments reduces the risk of contamination, the capacity for cost-effective non-sterile cultivation can make extreme halophilic microorganisms potentially valuable organisms for biotechnological applications. In this contribution, the stepwise use of screening approaches, employing design of experiment (DoE) on model media and subsequently using industrial waste as substrate have been implemented to investigate the applicability of halophiles to generate PHB from the industrial waste stream spent sulfite liquor (SSL). The production of PHB on model media as well as dilutions of industrial substrate in a complex medium has been screened for by fluorescence microscopy using Nile Blue staining. Screening was used to investigate the ability of halophilic microorganisms to withstand the <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substances</b> of the waste stream without negatively affecting PHB production. It could be shown that neither single <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substances</b> nor a mixture thereof inhibited growth in the investigated range, hence, leaving the question on the inhibiting mechanisms open.
