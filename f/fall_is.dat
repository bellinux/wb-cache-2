5|$|Axe to <b>Fall</b> <b>is</b> {{the seventh}} studio album {{released}} by American metalcore band Converge. It {{was released on}} October 20, 2009, through Epitaph Records. It is their second most commercially successful to date, peaking at number 74 in the Billboard 200. The album was produced by guitarist Kurt Ballou, who previously produced many of Converge's album and features artwork created by lead singer Jacob Bannon. Axe to <b>Fall</b> <b>is</b> a collaborative album, which features {{a large number of}} guest musicians, including members from Cave In, Neurosis and The Red Chord among others.|$|E
5|$|Preparedness for ashfalls should involve sealing buildings, {{protecting}} {{infrastructure and}} homes, and storing sufficient supplies {{of food and}} water to last until the ash <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> over and clean-up can begin. Dust masks can be worn to reduce inhalation of ash and mitigate against any respiratory health affects. Goggles can be worn to protect against eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|Shadows <b>Fall</b> <b>is</b> an American {{heavy metal}} band from Springfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1995. Although the band has {{experienced}} several line-up changes, {{for most of}} its recording career, Shadows Fall has been composed of Jonathan Donais (lead guitar), Matt Bachand (rhythm guitar), Paul Romanko (bass), Brian Fair (lead vocals), and Jason Bittner (drums).|$|E
50|$|East Twin <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{located about}} 15 {{miles west of}} Joyce, Washington. The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> within the Olympic National Forest. The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> located {{directly}} off of East Twin Road which is accessible from State Route 112. The <b>Falls</b> <b>are</b> approximately 40 feet in height.|$|R
50|$|Catawba <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} Pisgah National Forest. For many years, {{while the}} <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> located on public land, visitor access to the <b>falls</b> <b>was</b> heavily restricted. The only access points to the <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> a trail that went through private property, and an access point off of Interstate 40. Use of either access point was illegal.|$|R
50|$|Access to the <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> {{restricted}} to a viewing platform at milemarker 361.2 on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> {{directly in the}} City of Asheville's watershed, so {{direct access to the}} <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> strictly prohibited.|$|R
5|$|Young forests (trees <2 years old) {{are most}} at risk from ash falls {{and are likely to}} be {{destroyed}} by ash deposits >100 mm. Ash <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to kill mature trees, but ash loading may break large branches during heavy ash falls (>500 mm). Defoliation of trees may also occur, especially if there is a coarse ash component within the ash fall.|$|E
5|$|Deciding to work together, Bart, Lisa, and Bob {{escape and}} try to save the dam. While Lisa and Bob set about {{defusing}} Cecil's dynamite, Bart jumps at Cecil before he can press the plunger. Cecil attempts to swat him off with the briefcase of money, but the case bursts open and the money is lost. Cecil manages to throw Bart off the cliff, declaring he will kill Bart as Bob never could; ironically, Bob grabs the cord of the dynamite and dives down {{in an effort to}} save him. As the two dangle {{down the side of the}} dam, Bob decides to cut the cord on the dynamite in an act of self-sacrifice to prevent Cecil from destroying the town, but his and Bart's perilous <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> broken by a conveniently placed pipe.|$|E
5|$|However the Golden Path's newfound {{momentum}} {{is threatened by}} deep divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita (Janina Gavankar), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay is forced to intervene on several occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay {{find a way to}} infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.|$|E
50|$|The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> {{occasionally}} {{confused with}} much larger Mazama <b>Falls,</b> which <b>is</b> two kilometers upstream. Ironically enough, Mazama <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> officially named while Wells Creek Falls isn’t {{despite the fact}} almost nobody has ever seen Mazama Falls up close & Wells Creek <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> regularly visited by people driving up Wells Creek Road.|$|R
50|$|Madison Creek <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{located within}} the Olympic National Park near the Elwha River, west of Port Angeles, Washington. The <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> about 50 feet high and has a light flow in a {{horsetail}} shape. Another higher <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> located above the first, but is completely inaccessible. The paved trail to the <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> very short (less than 100 meters) and is wheelchair accessible.|$|R
50|$|Karuma <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{located on}} the Kigumba-Gulu Highway, {{immediately}} south of where the highway crosses the River Nile. Karuma <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> approximately 97 km, by road, northeast of Masindi and approximately 77 km, by road, south of Gulu, the largest city in Northern Uganda. Karuma <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> also the location of Karuma Power Station, the largest hydropower project in Uganda with a planned capacity of 600 megawatts. The coordinates of Karuma <b>Falls</b> <b>are</b> 2° 14' 3.00"N, 32° 14' 47.00"E (Latitude:2.234167; Longitude:32.246390). The average elevation of Karuma <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> about 1000 m above sea level.|$|R
5|$|Volcanic ash <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> physically, socially, and {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas {{many hundreds of}} kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide variety}} of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash is wet or dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from the ash fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the writers}} who {{fell victim to}} the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus and the poet Phaedrus. Cordus was brought to trial in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus {{as the last of}} the true Romans, which was {{considered}} an offence under the Lex Maiestatis; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, in his letter to Cordus' daughter Marcia To Marcia, On Consolation. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source that Cordus starved himself to death. Marcia was instrumental in saving her father's work so that it could be published again under Caligula.|$|E

5000|$|Shivanasamudram: The waterfalls, the Ganganchukki and the Bharachukki, cascade down 90 meters. These <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> {{the source}} of Asia's first Hydro Electric Power Statin called [...] "Shimsa". The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> in full splendour during July-August. The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> 22 km from the Bangalore.|$|R
50|$|Rainbow <b>Falls</b> <b>was</b> first {{discovered}} by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Rainbow Falls and downstream Crooked <b>Falls</b> <b>are</b> the only two waterfalls on the Missouri-Mississippi river system to remain in an almost-natural condition. Black Eagle Falls and Great <b>Falls</b> <b>are</b> half- occupied by their dams' powerhouses, and Colter <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> submerged. The waterfall received {{its name from the}} frequent presence of rainbows in its spray before the dams were built.|$|R
50|$|These <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> {{frequently}} {{referred to}} incorrectly as Middle Whatcom Falls or Lower Whatcom <b>Falls.</b> Middle <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> located down creek near {{the western edge}} of the park and not reachable by trail. The area surrounding the middle <b>falls</b> <b>was</b> devastated by the Olympic Pipeline disaster and is off limits to the public. The lower <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> actually located a couple miles downstream just above the estuary at Maritime Heritage Park.|$|R
25|$|The blood {{pressure}} <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> detected by {{a decrease in}} blood flow and thus a decrease in Glomerular filtration rate (GFR).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fall</b> <b>is</b> not {{the only}} unifying concept for these events; the period {{described}} as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse.|$|E
25|$|Rocket packs can {{be useful}} for spacewalks. While near Earth a jet pack has to produce a g-force of at least 1g (a smaller g-force, {{providing}} only some deviation from free <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> of little use here), for excursions outside a free falling spaceship, a small g-force providing a small deviation from free <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> quite useful. Hence much less delta-v is consumed per unit time, and not during the whole EVA. With only small amounts of thrust needed, safety and temperature are much more manageable than in the atmosphere in Earth's gravity field.|$|E
50|$|Coon Creek <b>Falls,</b> <b>is</b> a 250 ft plunge {{waterfall}} which {{shares a}} plungepool with Fall Creek <b>Falls.</b> The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> not always present, {{depending on the}} amount of precipitation in the area. The <b>falls</b> <b>are</b> located near Spencer, Tennessee in Fall Creek Falls State Park.|$|R
5000|$|Anna Ruby <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{one of four}} popular waterfalls {{located in}} the Forest near Helen, Georgia. Two of the other water falls, Dukes Creek Falls and Raven Cliff <b>Falls,</b> <b>are</b> also in White County, while the third waterfall, DeSoto <b>Falls,</b> <b>is</b> in {{neighboring}} Lumpkin County ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> {{reportedly}} {{discovered in}} 1938 by American entomologist and physician Paul A. Zahl, {{who wrote that}} the noise created by the <b>falling</b> water <b>was</b> deafening already before the <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> visible.|$|R
25|$|Based on the 1981–2010 period, {{the average}} first {{occurrence}} of {{at or below}} freezing temperatures in the <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> November 4 and the average last occurrence in the spring is April 5.|$|E
25|$|In that article, {{he argued}} that free <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> really {{inertial}} motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the Equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomenon of gravitational time dilation.|$|E
25|$|Win by {{technical}} fall: If a <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> not {{secured to}} end the match, a wrestler can win a match simply by points. If a wrestler can secure an advantage of 15 points over an opponent, then the wrestler can win the match by technical fall. A technical <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> very likely when one wrestler has great control over the other wrestler {{and is able to}} score near fall points repeatedly. If the 15-point advantage is gained while the offensive wrestler has his opponent in a pinning situation, the match would continue to allow the offensive wrestler to secure the fall. If the offensive wrestler is unable to secure a fall, the match ends once a near fall situation is no longer seen by the referee or when the wrestlers return to the neutral position.|$|E
50|$|The <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> {{regarded}} as sacred under the Fuji cult. Another waterfall, the Otodome <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> approximately a five-minute walk away.|$|R
50|$|Dangars <b>Falls</b> <b>are</b> located 16 km {{south-south-east}} of Armidale, on Salisbury Waters. They {{have a total}} fall of 120 metres. These <b>falls</b> <b>were</b> previously named Gostwick <b>Falls,</b> and <b>are</b> {{also known}} as Dangarsleigh <b>Falls.</b> They <b>are</b> in the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, {{at the head of}} Dangars Gorge.|$|R
50|$|Turtleback Falls, {{also called}} Umbrella <b>Falls,</b> <b>is</b> a {{waterfall}} in Western North Carolina, located near Brevard. The <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> {{located on the}} Horsepasture River in the Pisgah National Forest. The <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> usually accessed by a hike starting in Gorges State Park which passes through Pisgah National Forest property.|$|R
25|$|One major {{study of}} Ibrahima Fall reports that two {{versions}} exist of {{his search for}} Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba. In the first version, <b>Fall</b> <b>is</b> rich merchant who travelled in Cayor, Jolof and Saloum. But after meeting Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke in Mbacké Bari, Fall gave up business to become Bamba’s disciple.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fall</b> <b>is</b> a precipitous {{transition}} season, {{with the}} average first freeze in Rapid City is October 4 and late August through September in the Black Hills. The Rapid City area's first snowfall is usually in October, although higher elevations sometimes receive significant snow in September. Occasional cold fronts moving through the area bring blustery northwest winds.|$|E
25|$|General {{relativity}} is {{a theory}} of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field (for example, when standing {{on the surface of}} the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that free <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> inertial motion: an object in free <b>fall</b> <b>is</b> falling because that is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical mechanics. This is incompatible with classical mechanics and special relativity because in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other, but objects in free fall do so. To resolve this difficulty Einstein first proposed that spacetime is curved. In 1915, he devised the Einstein field equations which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass, energy, and any momentum within it.|$|E
50|$|Wolf Creek <b>Falls</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} Olympic National Park in Clallam County, Washington {{approximately}} 10 miles (16 km) south west of Port Angeles, Washington. The <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> located on Wolf Creek, {{a tributary of}} the Elwha River. The <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> a tiered <b>falls</b> with drops totaling about 100 feet.|$|R
50|$|Mavinagudi <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> {{visible from}} Jog Falls during June - November {{period and the}} <b>falls</b> <b>is</b> {{surrounded}} by forest filled mountain range.|$|R
