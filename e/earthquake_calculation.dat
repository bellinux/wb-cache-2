40|$|This paper {{considers}} the drawn detail {{as a means}} of archiving the interior not in terms of the familiar fullness or comfort but rather through the idea of absence and emptiness. Empty drawn details could be understood as intervening spaces, ordinarily empty, or as relatively small or narrow spaces, between things or parts of a body. This paper will consider the empty drawn detail as something other than being without interstice, without meaning, without purpose but rather as a system of reference that enables rather than states further making and imitation. Here the empty detail, full or empty of context is temporarily extracted from context, without reference, until it is used in a particular place or moment of exchange. This paper attends to the drawing archive of the Auckland University for the ‘Building Queen Street For Dingwall Trust’ (1934) designed by Gummer & Ford & Partners and in particular singled out for closer examination are seven sheets of <b>earthquake</b> <b>calculations</b> for the building. At one and the same time the seven sheets show complexity, incompleteness and the promise of structured emptiness. These drawings tamper with the limits of construction, control and safety. They set the scene for the fullness of space and empty space, complex, without meaning and yet full of it. The empty drawn detail is represented as a series of woven calculated notations across an ordered series of grids. The seven sheets suggest an historic emptiness and yet of meaning for both architect and engineer. Calculations caught in the margins of the drawings become the detail of the practitioner, a draft of abstract thought, all of which is deliberately hidden within the architecture. The drawn becomes abstract detail, a dark place hidden from view, a matrix of potent emptiness...|$|R

Seismic source zones within an area of about 200 km around Romania were constructed considering seismicity, neotectonics and geological development. The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment in terms of intensities is performed following Cornell (1968) with the program EQRISK (see Mc Guire, 1976), modified by us for use of intensities. To cope with the irregular isoseismals of the Vrancea intermediate depth earthquakes a factor Ω is introduced to the attenuation law (Kövesligethy, 1907). Using detailed macroseismic maps of three earthquakes Ω is calculated by fitting the attenuation law to observed intensities, i. e. to local ground conditions. Strong local variation of Ω is avoided by a gridding of 0. 5 ° in longitude and 0. 25 ° in latitude. The contribution of the Vrancea intermediate depth zone to the seismic hazard at each grid point is computed with the corresponding representative Ω. A seismogenic depth of 120 km is assumed.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} for three-dimensional (3 -D) simulations of earthquake sequences is presented that accounts {{not only for}} inertial effects during seismic events but also for shear-induced temperature variations on the fault and the associated evolution of pore fluid pressure. In particular, the methodology allows to capture thermal pressurization (TP) due to frictional heating in a shear zone. One-dimensional (1 -D) diffusion of heat and pore fluids in the fault-normal direction is incorporated using a spectral method, which is unconditionally stable, accurate with affordable computational resources, and highly suitable to <b>earthquake</b> sequence <b>calculations</b> that use variable time steps. The approach is used to investigate the effect of heterogeneous hydraulic properties by considering a fault model with two regions of different hydraulic diffusivities and hence different potential for TP. We find that the region of more efficient TP produces larger slip in model-spanning events. The slip deficit in the other region is filled with more frequent smaller events, creating spatiotemporal complexity of large events on the fault. Interestingly, the area of maximum slip in model-spanning events is not associated with the maximum temperature increase because of stronger dynamic weakening in that area. The region of more efficient TP has lower interseismic shear stress, which discourages rupture nucleation there, contrary to what was concluded in prior studies. Seismic events nucleate {{in the region of}} less efficient TP where interseismic shear stress is higher. In our model, hypocenters of large events do not occur in areas of large slip or large stress drop. ...|$|R

The presentation of exposure data by applying a dasymetric map approach has good potential for addressing this issue. With the support of 30 '' [*]×[*]  30 '' areal exposure data (population and building data in China), this paper presents a new earthquake disaster loss estimation method for emergency response situations. This method has two phases: a pre-earthquake phase and a co-earthquake phase. In the pre-earthquake phase, we pre-calculate the earthquake loss related to different seismic intensities and store them in a 30 '' [*]×[*]  30 '' grid format, which has several stages: determining the <b>earthquake</b> loss <b>calculation</b> factor, gridding damage probability matrices, calculating building damage and calculating human losses. Then, in the co-earthquake phase, there are two stages of estimating loss: generating a theoretical isoseismal map to depict the spatial distribution of the seismic intensity field; then, using the seismic intensity field to extract statistics of losses from the pre-calculated estimation data. Thus, the final loss estimation results are obtained. The method is validated by four actual earthquakes that occurred in China. The method not only significantly improves the speed and accuracy of loss estimation but also provides the spatial distribution of the losses, which will be effective in aiding earthquake emergency response and rescue. Additionally, related pre-calculated earthquake loss estimation data in China could serve to provide disaster risk analysis before earthquakes occur. Currently, the pre-calculated loss estimation data and the two-phase estimation method are used by the China Earthquake Administration...|$|R

We focused on landslides in lateral moraines as possible triggers. Detailed geomorphological, geophysical, and satellite radar interferometric investigations of the Palcacocha Lake moraine (Cordillera Blanca, Peru) together with laboratory tests on samples from the site provided data for slope stability calculations using GeoSlope software and hydrodynamic impact wave modeling using the Iber code. We identified landslides that could affect Palcacocha Lake and calculated their stability (factor of safety) under specified conditions, including variable water saturation and <b>earthquake</b> effects. <b>Calculations</b> showed that the moraine slopes {{are close to the}} threshold value (Fs = 1) for stability and are especially sensitive to water saturation. The height of impact waves triggered by a landslide in 2003 and the potential wave heights from newly identified, possibly active landslides were calculated, based on landslide volume estimates, detailed lake bathymetry, and basin topography. Results show that potential future landslide-triggered waves could have similar properties to the 2003 impact wave. Evidence gathered in this study suggests that glacial lake outburst floods triggered by landslides from moraines, however, would be probably smaller than floods resulting from other types of slope processes (e. g., ice/rock avalanches) if dam breach is not taken into account. This assumption has to be critically evaluated against site-specific conditions at a given lake and any possible environmental factors, such as climate change or earthquake that may mobilize larger volumes of moraine material...|$|R

Calculations incorporate newly obtained bathymetric images of the North Anatolian fault beneath the Sea of Marmara [Le Pichon et al., 2001; Armijo et al., 2002]. Newly interpreted fault segmentation enables an improved regional A. D. 1500 - 2000 earthquake catalog and interevent model, which form the basis for time-dependent probability estimates. Calculations presented here also employ detailed models of coseismic and postseismic slip associated with the 17 August 1999 M = 7. 4 Izmit earthquake to investigate effects of stress transfer on seismic hazard. Probability changes caused by the 1999 shock depend on Marmara Sea fault-stressing rates, which are calculated with a new finite element model. The combined 2004 - 2034 regional Poisson probability of M >= 7 earthquakes is ~ 38 %, the regional time-dependent probability is 44 +/- 18 %, and incorporation of stress transfer raises it to 53 +/- 18 %. The most important effect of adding time dependence and stress transfer to the calculations is an increase in the 30 year probability of a M >= 7 earthquake affecting Istanbul. The 30 year Poisson probability at Istanbul is 21 %, and the addition of time dependence and stress transfer raises it to 41 +/- 14 %. The ranges given on probability values are sensitivities of the calculations to input parameters determined by Monte Carlo analysis; 1000 calculations are made using parameters drawn at random from distributions.

The existing code of rules SNIP II- 7 - 81 * “Construction in seismic areas” provides that <b>earthquake</b> resistance <b>calculation</b> be performed on two levels of impact: basic safety earthquake (BSE) and maximum considered earthquake (MCE). However, the very nature of such calculation cannot be deemed well-founded and contradicts the fundamental standards of foreign countries. The authors of the article have identified the main problems of the conceptual foundation underlying the current regulation. The first and foremost step intended to overcome the discrepancy in question is renunciation of the K 1 damage tolerance factor when calculating the BSE. The second measure to be taken is implementing the response spectrum method of calculation, but the β spectral curve of the dynamic response factor must be replaced by a spectrum of worst-case accelerograms for this particular structure or a spectrum of simulated accelerograms obtained for the specific construction site. Application of the response spectrum method when calculating the MCE impact level makes it possible to proceed into the frequency domain and to eventually obtain spectra of the accelerograms. As a result we get to know the response of the building to some extent, i. e. forces, the required reinforcement, and it can be checked whether the conditions of the ultimate limit state apply.

The work {{can be divided into}} the following sections: earthquake source modeling, <b>earthquake</b> probability <b>calculations,</b> ground motion simulations, building response, and performance analysis. As a first step the kinematic source inversions of past earthquakes in the magnitude range of 6 - 8 are used to simulate 60 scenario earthquakes on the San Andreas fault. For each scenario earthquake a 30 -year occurrence probability is calculated and we present a rational method to redistribute the forecast earthquake probabilities from UCERF to the simulated scenario earthquake. We illustrate {{the inner workings of the}} method through an example involving earthquakes on the San Andreas fault in southern California. Next, three-component broadband ground motion histories are computed at 636 sites in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area by superposing short-period (0. 2 s- 2. 0 s) empirical Green's function synthetics on top of long-period (> 2. 0 s) spectral element synthetics. We superimpose these seismograms on low-frequency seismograms, computed from kinematic source models using the spectral element method, to produce broadband seismograms. Using the ground motions at 636 sites for the 60 scenario earthquakes, 3 -D nonlinear analysis of several variants of an 18 -story steel braced frame building, designed for three soil types using the 1994 and 1997 Uniform Building Code provisions and subjected to these ground motions, are conducted. Model performance is classified into one of five performance levels: Immediate Occupancy, Life Safety, Collapse Prevention, Red-Tagged, and Model Collapse. The results are combined with the 30 -year probability of occurrence of the San Andreas scenario earthquakes using the PEER performance based earthquake engineering framework to determine the probability of exceedance of these limit states over the next 30 years. </p...|$|R

Further the results of the analysis is controlled according to SNI 1726 - 2012 and Applied Technology Council (ATC- 40). The maximum displacement of the building in the X direction is 0. 1827 m and in the Y direction is 0. 1283 m, so if it is viewed from the serviceability limit and the ultimate limit performance, it is categorized as a eligible building (safely) in accordance with SNI 1726 - 2012.

A group of tests representing design-level and beyond-design-level ground motions were first conducted to verify design safety margins. These were followed {{by a series of}} tests in which progressively larger base motions were applied until structural failure was induced. The analysis was performed by ANATECH Corp. and Sandia National Laboratories for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, employing state-of-the-art finite-element software specifically developed for concrete structures. Three-dimensional time-history analyses were performed, first as pre-test blind predictions to evaluate the general capabilities of the analytical methods, and second as post-test validation of the methods and interpretation of the test result. The input data consisted of acceleration time histories for the horizontal, vertical and rotational (rocking) components, as measured by accelerometers mounted on the structure's basemat. The response data consisted of acceleration and displacement records for various points on the structure, as well as time-history records of strain gages mounted on the reinforcement. This paper reports on work in progress and presents pre-test predictions and post-test comparisons to measured data for tests simulating maximum design basis and extreme design basis earthquakes. The pre-test analyses predict the failure earthquake of the test structure to have an energy level in the range of four to five times the energy level of the safe shutdown <b>earthquake.</b> The post-test <b>calculations</b> completed so far show good agreement with measured data...|$|R
40|$|The first high {{sensitivity}} tripatite observation {{was made}} at Hoshina, Nagano Prefecture in the period from October 31 to December 18, 1965 and the observational result has been reported as the first report. This paper is {{the report of the}} result of the second observation by the same method in the same region, observation starting again on February 20, 1966 after an interruption of sixty days and continuing through the end of June, 1966. This paper is confined to the result obtained in the period from February 20 to June 20, 1966. In the first observation, we have found that the locations of the seismic foci determined by our tripartite method were perceptibly accurate. Therefore, in the second observation, the sensitivity of the instruments was raised higher than the first observation and we registered a large number of ultra-micro earthquakes. The recorded earthquakes were analyzed and the locations of the seismic foci were determined immediately after the observation. Thus, the second observation by our tripartite method was used as a lookout in the area of Matsushiro Earthquakes. For that reason the work of analysis of the <b>earthquakes</b> including the <b>calculation</b> by an electronic computer was consolidated thus raising the efficiency of the work. As regards the methods of observation and determination of the seismic foci, we used the same methods as described in the first report, so we omit description of the methods in this paper reporting only the results of the observation. 第 1 回の高感度 3 点方式による松代地震の観測は, 1965 年 10 月 31 日から 12 月 18 日にかけて行われ,その結果を第 1 報として報告した. この報告は同じ地域で同じ方法による地震観測の第 2 報である. 第 2 回の観測は第 1 回観測から 60 日の間を置いて 1966 年 2 月 20 日から再開され 6 月末現在なお継続中である. この報告は 1966 年 2 月 20 日から 6 月 20 日までの観測結果についてのものである. 第 1 回観測結果から,われわれの 3 点方式によって定めた震源の位置が比較的良く定まっていることがわかった. そこで今回はもう少し感度を上げ,短時間に多くの極微小地震を観測し,直ちに解析を行ない,主に震源の位置を調べて松代地震地域における 1 つの監視として役立てることにした. そのために又電子計算機を中心とする解析作業を整備し,能率化して対処した...|$|R
40|$|The MEM Project (Magnetic and Electric fields Monitoring) was {{activated}} in the INGV Observatory of L’Aquila since 2004. The principal {{purpose of}} the project is to create in Central Italy a network of observatories to monitoring the electromagnetic signals in the frequency band [0. 001 Hz - 100 kHz]. This band includes natural signals (magnetic pulsations of magnetospheric origin, Earth-ionosphere resonance mode signals, atmospheric noise, and so on) and artificial signals (power line emissions, VLF radio transmissions, and so on). The innovative characteristic of the project is the approach chosen to study the complex problem concerning {{the representation of the}} spatial and temporal distributions of the electromagnetic fields in the band of interest. Both the distributions can be represented by some parameters containing the locations and the characteristics of the sources of the electromagnetic signals. When all the stations will be in operation the wide-band interferometry will be applied. Combining the simultaneous observations of the electromagnetic field measured in the stations of the network, {{we will be able to}} obtain detailed information about the investigated electromagnetic sources. A new measurement system has been developed to fulfil these requirements focusing on the automation of the measurements. The system is designed for long term recording of the electromagnetic fields in a wide frequency band. In the frequency band [1 Hz - 100 kHz] the three components of the magnetic field and the three components of atmospheric electric field are processed in real time using DSP (Digital Signal Processing) techniques. In the frequency band [0. 001 - 25]Hz the two components of the telluric field and the three components of the magnetic field are recorded as sampled (100 Hz). One of the main scientific objectives of the MEM project is the long term monitoring of the geodynamical processes, such as the <b>earthquakes,</b> by the <b>calculation</b> of the Poynting vector, and the analysis of the magnetic transfer functions and impedance tensor. In the next years this kind of analysis can be useful to underline the possible correlation between the geodynamical processes and the local magnetic field anomalies...|$|R
30|$|The 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku {{earthquake}} generated an aftershock {{sequence that}} affected {{a large part}} of northern Honshu, and has given rise to widely divergent forecasts of changes in earthquake occurrence probabilities in northern Honshu. The objective of this review is to assess these forecasts as they relate to potential changes in the occurrence probabilities of damaging earthquakes in the Kanto Region. It is generally agreed that the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake increased the stress on faults in the southern Kanto district. Toda and Stein (Geophys Res Lett 686, 40 : doi: 10.1002, 2013) further conclude that the probability of earthquakes in the Kanto Corridor has increased by a factor of 2.5 for the time period 11 March 2013 to 10 March 2018 in the Kanto Corridor. Estimates of earthquake probabilities in a wider region of the Southern Kanto District by Nanjo et al.

Thus some of the large stress transfer may be undergoing aseismic release, consistent with pre-Tohoku geodetic data, so a large earthquake on the Off Boso segment may have a low probability.|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{sensitivity}} {{analysis was conducted}} for a story damage index (SDITC/ASDITC). Based on modal parameters, the story damage index was applied to evaluate the occurrence, location, and severity of torsionally-coupled (TC) buildings damage after <b>earthquakes.</b> During the <b>calculation</b> of this index, the change of center of rigidity can also be obtained, which effectively reveals the damage location in a particular story. The sensitivity analysis of the SDITC/ASDITC and eccentricity under errors of mode shapes was investigated by numerical simulation of an ASCE benchmark model with different damage types. In addition, a mode shape interpolation method was applied to obtain complete mode shapes for incomplete measurement buildings. Besides the verification through the numerical model, this damage index was also applied to the damage assessment of the Taitung Fire Department Building, which experienced severe structural damage during the Beinan earthquake at April 1, 2006. Based on the identified model parameters, the damage index was calculated to assess the damage of the building. Comparing with the visual inspections, {{it was evident that}} SDITC and ASDITC are useful to indicate the damage specifically. Finally, a preliminary study that applying the story damage index to non-shear-buildings was investigated. The results {{can be used as a}} reference for future study. 本文利用前人所推導之扭轉耦合建築結構層間損壞指標與偏心距計算公式，進行完整之敏感度分析。並利用不同破壞形式之ASCE數值模型，探討振態誤差對損壞指標與偏心距計算之影響。除此之外，並利用振態內插法，內插未量測樓層之振態，求得結構完整模態參數，並探討不足量測結構損壞評估之可行性。本文主要是探討損壞指標與偏心距之準確性，並以台東消防分隊大樓受 2006 年 4 月 1 日台東卑南地震損壞前後之實測地震紀錄，應用SRIM (System Realization Using Information Matrix) 系統識別技巧與振態內插法還原結構物完整模態參數進行損壞評估，並與實際現場勘查結果比較，驗證其實用性。最後，本文以平面非剪力結構為例，初步探討層間損壞指標應用於非剪力結構之可行性，可作為後續研究之參考。致謝	i 中文摘要	ii Abstract	iii 目錄	iv 表格目錄	vii 圖目錄	xiii 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 研究動機與目的	 1 1. 2 文獻回顧	 2 1. 2. 1 系統識別理論	 2 1. 2. 2 損壞指標	 3 1. 3 本文內容	 5 第二章 建築結構之層間損壞指標	 6 2. 1 扭轉耦合結構運動方程式與特徵方程式	 6 2. 1. 1 依模態參數計算結構層間勁度	 9 2. 1. 2 依模態參數計算偏心距	 12 2. 2 扭轉耦合結構層間損壞指標	 15 2. 3 平面結構層間損壞指標	 16 第三章 標竿結構數值模擬	 17 3. 1 標竿結構型式	 17 3. 2 振態誤差對損壞指標與偏心距之敏感度分析	 18 3. 2. 1 利用模態參數計算各樓層偏心距值	 19 3. 2. 2 利用偏心距及模態參數計算層間勁度及損壞指標	 20 3. 3 噪訊對損壞指標與偏心距之影響	 21 3. 4 振態內插法於部分量測系統之應用	 23 3. 4. 1 振態內插法	 23 3. 4. 2 振態內插法於含噪訊部分量測結構損壞指標	 26 第四章 實際建築結構震後損壞評估	 28 4. 1 建築物基本資料與實測記錄概述	 28 4. 1. 1 建築結構形式	 28 4. 1. 2 強震監測系統	 29 4. 2 實測記錄之系統識別與振態內插	 29 4. 3 結構實際損害調查與分析結果比較	 30 4. 3. 1 損壞指標評估	 30 4. 3. 2 真實結構損害勘驗結果	 30 第五章 非剪力平面結構之損壞評估初步研究	 32 5. 1 平面非剪力結構勁度矩陣之推導與靜態濃縮	 32 5. 1. 1 平面非剪力結構勁度矩陣	 32 5. 1. 2 勁度矩陣之靜態濃縮	 33 5. 2 五層樓非剪力樓房數值模擬案例分析	 35 第六章 結論與建議	 37 參考文獻	 4...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of a worldwide data set of 91 radon (^(222) Rn) anomalies (the frequency of occurrence, the precursor time interval, {{and the distribution}} of peak amplitudes) are correlated with earthquake data such as the respective magnitude and epicentral distance. These anomalies were reported as precursors to earthquakes in the United States, USSR, China, Japan, and Iceland. Although the data set is incomplete and limited by experimental deficiencies, several consistent patterns emerge. Radon anomalies from different tectonic regions show similar patterns. The radon anomalies occur at greater epicentral distances for earthquakes of the larger magnitude. Anomalies preceding large earthquakes (M ≥ 6) are frequently observed at a distance of 100 to 500 km. These distances are larger than several times the rupture dimensions of the future earthquakes. The time from the onset of an anomaly to the time of the earthquake (the precursor time) increases with magnitude but decreases with distance between epicenter and radon station. In addition, radon anomalies are observed more frequently prior to large earthquakes than prior to small ones, indicating that the preparation zone increases in size as magnitude increases. The peak amplitude does not scale with magnitude but forms a consistent pattern with epicentral distance in that the larger the earthquake magnitude, the farther away the largest amplitudes tend to occur. The preparation zone of the earthquake where the anomalies occur forms an almost continuous annulus that expands with time away from the future rupture zone. The outer radius of this annulus scales with the <b>earthquake</b> magnitude. Model <b>calculations</b> indicate that strain fields of at most 10 ^(− 6) to 10 ^(− 8) strain caused the radon anomalies. If these strains are divided by the appropriate precursor time, minimum strain rates from 10 ^(− 7) day^(− 1) to 10 ^(− 10) day^(− 1) are obtained. Such small strains and strain rates suggest that in most cases neither mechanical crack growth induced by dilatancy nor mechanical coupling between pore pressure and the rock matrix caused the anomalies. Large changes in the orientation of the local strain field, however, could occur and affect the local stress intensity factor. Since changes in the stress intensity factor can result in stress corrosion, the occurrence of radon anomalies is attributed to slow crack growth controlled by stress corrosion in a rock matrix saturated by groundwater...|$|R
