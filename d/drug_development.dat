5|$|In pharmacology, {{ionization}} of {{a compound}} alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and lipophilicity, logp). For example, ionization of any compound {{will increase the}} solubility in water, but decrease the lipophilicity. This is exploited in <b>drug</b> <b>development</b> to increase the concentration of a compound in the blood by adjusting the pKa of an ionizable group.|$|E

5|$|New {{drugs are}} the {{products}} of a long <b>drug</b> <b>development</b> process, {{the first step of}} which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor. In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by combinatorial chemistry approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and high-throughput screening technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1950s, {{screening}} of anti-malarial drugs {{was carried out}} on avian malaria. Avian malaria species differ from those that infect humans. The discovery in 1948 of Plasmodium berghei in wild rodents in the Congo and later other rodent species that could infect laboratory rats transformed <b>drug</b> <b>development.</b> The short hepatic phase and life cycle of these parasites made them useful as animal models, a status they still retain. Plasmodium cynomolgi in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) {{were used in the}} 1960s to test drugs active against P. vivax.|$|E
5|$|Tadalafil was {{initially}} formulated by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) {{under a new}} <b>drug</b> <b>development</b> partnership between Glaxo and Icos that began in August1991. The drug was originally researched {{as a treatment for}} cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina, but focus quickly shifted to ED with the success of another PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra), which had been developed by Pfizer. Icos began research on tadalafil in 1993, and clinical trials started two years later. Glaxo let the partnership with Icos lapse in 1996, including the company's 50% share of profits from resulting drugs, because the drugs in development were not in Glaxo's core markets. In 1998, Icos formed a 50/50 joint venture with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (Lilly Icos LLC) to develop and commercialize tadalafil as Cialis. The release of Cialis in the United States was delayed in April2002 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that Icos perform more studies, improve labelling, and address manufacturing issues. Cialis was approved in Europe in November2002 and in the United States a year later. The drug was approved for once-daily use for ED in Europe in June2007 and in the United States in January2008.|$|E
