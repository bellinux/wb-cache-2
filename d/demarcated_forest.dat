40|$|O Rio Grande do Sul possui atualmente 411. 000 {{hectares}} de sua superfície plantada com essências florestais exóticas. A tendência desses plantios no Estado é ocupar áreas com terrenos declivosos com limitado valor agropecuário e altamente suceptíveis à erosão hídrica. A fragilidade desses solos implica na necessidade de efetuar-se um planejamento criterioso dos talhões, face ao grande risco erosivo compreendido entre o plantio e o fechamento do dossel da floresta. O estudo buscou identificar e quantificar o efeito de métodos de preparo de solo e {{manejo de}} resíduos da colheita sobre a erosão hídrica (sustentabilidade) e o desenvolvimento inicial da floresta (produtividade). O ensaio foi instalado em uma área experimental da Aracruz Celulose e Papel S. A. no Horto Florestal Faxinal, localizado no município de Arroio dos Ratos na região fisiográfica denominada Depressão Central. O ensaio experimental foi instalado em outubro de 2006 em uma área de Cambissolo háplico. Os tratamentos escolhidos para o experimento foram baseados em práticas de manejo que são empregados no estabelecimento de povoamentos florestais. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o de blocos ao acaso com três repetições, os blocos foram demarcados aleatoriamente dentro do horto florestal. Os tratamentos testados foram à subsolagem interrompida com resíduo, subsolagem contínua com resíduo, subsolagem contínua sem resíduo, todos no sentido do declive, e coveamento mecânico. A subsolagem sem resíduo a favor do declive mostrou-se um método de preparo mais erosivo do que o coveamento manual com resíduo, com perda anual de 11, 05 e 0, 16 Mg ha ano- 1, respectivamente. A água escoada superficialmente nos tratamentos com resíduo foi de 1, 6 % e na subsolagem sem resíduo o escoamento foi de 2, 9 % do total precipitado. O preparo mais intensivo do solo aumenta a erosão, porém favorece o crescimento inicial do eucalipto. Observase que para os dois períodos analisados as parcelas subsoladas sem resíduos apresentaram os maiores teores de nutrientes contido na parte aérea. A manutenção dos resíduos de colheita proporciona um adequado desenvolvimento das plantas de eucalipto e reduz a perda de água, solo e nutrientes. The Rio Grande do Sul has currently 411, 000 hectares of its area forested with exotic essences. The tendency of these plantations in the State is to occupy sloped areas with limited agrarian value and highly likely to water erosion. The fragility of these soils implies {{the need of}} a microplanning of the area, given the high risk of water erosion between the planting and soil covernizer by the forest canopy. The study sought to identify and quantify the effect of methods of preparation of soil and solid waste management of the harvest on water erosion (sustainability) and the initial development of the forest (productivity). The test was installed in an experimental area of Aracruz Celulose e Papel S. A. In Horto Florestal Faxinal, located in the municipality of Arroio of Rats in the fisiografic region called Depression Center. The test trial was installed in October 2006 {{in an area of}} Typic Dystrochept in the municipality of Arroio dos Ratos. The treatment chosen for the experiment were based on management practices that are sometimes employed in the establishment of forest. The experimental design was used to block at random with three repetitions. The blocks were randomly within the <b>demarcated</b> <b>forest</b> garden. The treatments tested were subsoiling interrupted with residue, subsoiling continuing with residue, subsoiling continuing without residue and coveamento mechanic. The subsoiling without residue in of the slope has been the method of preparation more erosion than mecanical pit with waste, with annual loss of 11. 05 Mg ha- 1 ano- 1 and 0. 16 Mg ha- 1 ano- 1. Water overland flow treatment with residue was 1. 6 %. In subsolagem without waste the bleeding was 2. 9 %. The preparation more intensive soil erosion increases but favors the initial growth of eucalyptus. It is observed that for the two periods analyzed the parcels subsoladas without waste produced the greatest nutrient content contained in the air. The maintenance of waste collection provides an appropriate development of eucalyptus plants and reduces the loss of water, and soil nutrients...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results on}} whether or not <b>demarcated</b> state <b>forests</b> in Zimbabwe (as state property) can be readily converted to common property. The results are based firstly, on secondary research and the examination of relevant literature on traditional and conventional forest management approaches and forest legislation and its bearing on these approaches. Secondly, the results reflect on the findings of a primary research based on Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) workshops conducted in five villages abutting Fuller forest, using six different PRA tools. During the pre-colonial era the current <b>demarcated</b> <b>forests</b> were managed as common property under the guidance of traditional institutions. Rights accrued to specified user groups. Non-members were excluded. Rules defined the rights and duties of members with regards to access, use and management. Sanctions were in place to ensure compliance. The management practices ensured sustainable forest conservation. After gazetting, the forest became state property with rights of ownership and management vested in the Forestry Commission. The gazetting process alienated the local people by extinguishing traditional use rights to the forests. This has resulted in local resistance to the Forestry Commission authority. Forest margin communities currently illegally use 23 different forest products. State control has failed to halt or reduce forest resource degradation and in some cases complete loss of the forests. The objective {{of this paper is to}} test the reliability of theory that state forests as state property can be sustainably managed under a model of a common property regime to satisfy the needs of rural households without compromising the conservation values of the forests...|$|R

40|$|Sabah, Malaysia, {{was one of}} {{the first}} regions in Southeast Asia to have {{experienced}} large-scale commercial logging. In this paper, the author investigates the drastic change of forest landscape and its impact on the subsistence activities of local communities in order to evaluate the effects of commercial logging. The analysis was conducted through interviews with villagers and collection of data on historical changes of land use in the research area. Before the 1950 s, villagers customarily gathered forest products and engaged in swidden agriculture. From the 1960 s the area was <b>demarcated</b> as a <b>forest</b> reserve, and logging companies conducted massive logging. This logging had an impact on the villagers' livelihood, as many of the villagers worked as logging workers. However, in the 1990 s, after forest resources were depleted, the Forestry Department implemented strict control of forest resources - especially after it introduced the forest certification scheme. Villagers became restricted in their use of the forest. The paper concludes that in the post-commercial logging area, without securing tenure rights over their customary land, villagers face difficulty earning sufficient income, and conflict may arise over the use of forest resources and land...|$|R
30|$|Land use {{pattern in}} Himachal Pradesh has {{undergone}} tremendous transformation due {{to changes in}} agriculture cropping pattern, urbanization and industrialization. Crop diversification gained momentum in the nineties and now covers several new areas in low and mid hill districts of the state (Sharma, 2011). With the integration of horticultural cash crops, changing land use and cropping patterns have evolved (Sharma et al. 2007; Singh 1999). The area under horticulture in the state registered an enormous increase from 86230  ha in 1980 – 1981 to 186900  ha in 2005 – 2006. In Solan the per cent share of area under non-foodgrain crops increased from 8.25  % in 1982 – 1983 to over 12.96  % in 2004 – 2005 (Sharma, 2011). While only about 11  % of the total geographical area {{of the state is}} available for cultivation (Sharma, 2011), over the years growing area under horticultural cash crops has put increasing pressure on forest resources through land clearing (Sharma et al. 2010). In a study on forest based livelihoods in Himachal Pradesh, Gouri et al. (2004) reported that in two of the villages where apple cultivation was adopted 35  years ago, encroachment in forest areas for fruit production has reduced the forest cover to just 5  % in Kiari and 3  % in Dhadi Rawat village. In Kullu district of Himachal, encroachment of apple orchards into un-demarcated protected <b>forest</b> and <b>demarcated</b> protected <b>forest</b> is a common practice (ODA 1993). The use of wood for fruit packing cases also resulted in extensive deforestation in the state (Singh 1992). Up to mid- 1980 s, 0.2 million m 3 of wood was extracted to make 20 million boxes annually for packaging of fruits and vegetables (Stokes, 1983). Alternative packaging materials like corrugated cardboard are being experimented with {{to deal with the problem}} of forest exploitation; however fruit growers have issues with the quality of the boxes.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} between 2006 and 2007 at Agulli forest reserve in Northwest Province of Cameroon to evaluate its floral composition through forest edge and interior analysis. Using a sampling intensity of 2. 2 %, two sample plots of 1 ha each were <b>demarcated</b> in the <b>forest</b> which has a total land area of 89. 24 ha. One plot was located at the left exterior edge, while the other plot was located {{in the interior of}} the forest. Each of the plots was subdivided into 20 plots (size, 20 x 25 m). In each of the subplots, all trees that were 10 cm dbh and above were identified and their dbh measured. Thereafter, parameters such as minimum area, species diversity/dominance index, importance value index and regeneration potential were assessed at the edge and interior of the forest. The minimum area at the interior of the forest was 700 m 2, while the forest edge has no minimum area which can be taken to represent the community. The species dominance index was 0. 18 {{at the edge of the}} forest and 0. 78 at the interior of the forest. The edge of the forest had 20 families, with the family Euphobiaceae having the highest importance value of 64. 9, while 14 families were identified in the interior of the forest, with the family Binoniaceae having the highest importance value of 101. 5.
