5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} <b>finalisation,</b> the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} African nations {{did not show}} up in time, for various reasons such as {{difficulties}} flying through Istanbul, and <b>finalisation</b> of monetary arrangements (teams must pay first, and then get reimbursed later). Former Kenyan Olympic participant and owner of the website Kenya Chess Masala said that the issue just paints Africa in bad image. On 5 September, the organisers confirmed at a press-conference that the host-nation was ready to pay for the poorer nations to travel. Bhari confirmed that the travel expenses were the main problem and wrote that 116 out of the planned 187 federations were on a travel subsidy, including his native Kenya whose players had not shown in the first rounds, though. He also explained that one of the biggest issues was the timing of the funding and that the teams were expected to pay on their own and be reimbursed upon arrival. Finally, Bhari had already reminded other federations to start planning their travel expenses for the 43rd Chess Olympiad in Batumi in 2018. In the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic).|$|E

25|$|Following {{the general}} {{election}} of 8 June, which resulted in no overall majority, a deal {{was expected to be}} announced between the Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), but DUP sources informed the BBC that the fire would delay the <b>finalisation</b> and announcement of this agreement. The announcement would be postponed until the following week and thus could postpone discussions on Brexit that had been scheduled to take place.|$|E
25|$|The D1A {{came out}} of the Imperial Japanese Navy's need for an {{advanced}} carrier-based dive bomber, and in late 1934 the IJN ordered the <b>finalisation</b> of the Aichi AB-9 design which was produced as the early model D1A1. However, the D1A1 was not designed by Aichi Tokei Denki Kabushiki Kaisha aircraft company, but by Ernst Heinkel Flugzeugwerke {{at the request of the}} Aichi company. The initial version designed by Heinkel was the He 50, a similar model equipped with floats instead of landing gear. The subsequent model, the He 66 was provided to Aichi who immediately began production of it as the D1A1.|$|E
25|$|Each {{episode of}} Good Game had a three-week {{production}} schedule. Week one was pre-production, where games were played and reviewed, and any segments {{appearing in the}} episode are written. A rundown was made, allocating the minutes of the episode to each review and segment. Filming occurred early in week two, as well as collation of any gameplay capture necessary for the episode. The episode was then edited throughout week two, for <b>finalisation</b> early week three. After airing in week three, post-production involves putting the episode online, finalising copyright information, etc. The weeks overlap for consecutive episodes (i.e. post-production for episode 1, filming for episode 2, and pre-production for episode 3 all occur in the same week).|$|E
25|$|The {{articles}} {{went through}} at least five major revisions prior to their <b>finalisation</b> in 1571. The first attempt was the Ten Articles in 1536, which showed some slightly Protestant leaningsâ€”the result of an English desire for a political alliance with the German Lutheran princes. The next revision was the Six Articles in 1539 which swung away from all reformed positions, and then the King's Book in 1543, which re-established most of the earlier Roman Catholic doctrines. During the reign of Edward VI, Henry VIII's only son, the Forty-Two Articles were written {{under the direction of}} Archbishop Thomas Cranmer in 1552. It was in this document that Calvinist thought reached the zenith of its influence in the English Church. These articles were never put into action, due to Edward VI's death and the reversion of the English Church to Roman Catholicism under Henry VIII's elder daughter, Mary I.|$|E

2500|$|The {{unsuccessful}} Imagination {{was released}} {{just after the}} <b>finalisation</b> of Reddy's divorce from Wald whose subsequent interference in her career Reddy would blame for the decline of her career profile in the mid-1980s: [...] "Several of my performing contracts were canceled, and one promoter told me he couldn't book me in case a certain someone 'came after him with a shotgun.'" [...] Reddy states that she was effectively being blacklisted from her established performance areas which led to her pursuing a career in theatre, where Wald had no significant influence.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-September 2013, a media report {{revealed}} that Nokia tested the Android operating system on both its Lumia and Asha hardware. On 11 December 2013, a report showed that {{development of the}} Asha-like device, codenamed [...] "Normandy", was continuing, despite the <b>finalisation</b> of Nokia's acquisition by Microsoft. In February 2014, in Barcelona, Spain, the Nokia X family was unveiled at Mobile World Congress. These devices, which were aimed towards emerging markets, run {{a modified version of}} Android known as Nokia X Software Platform, which was aligned towards Microsoft services and did not use Google Play Store. In a company memo released in July 2014, it was announced that, as part of cutbacks, Microsoft would end the Asha, Series 40, and X range entirely, in favor of solely producing and encouraging the use of Windows Phone products.|$|E

2500|$|When Henry VIII {{broke with}} the Roman Catholic Church and was excommunicated, he formed a new Church of England, {{which would be}} headed by the monarch (himself) rather than the pope. At this point, he needed to {{determine}} what its doctrines and practices would be {{in relation to the}} Roman Catholic Church and the new Protestant movements in continental Europe. A series of defining documents were written and replaced over a period of 30 years as the doctrinal and political situation changed from the excommunication of Henry VIII in 1533, to the excommunication of Elizabeth I in 1570. [...] These positions began with the Ten Articles in 1536, and concluded with the <b>finalisation</b> of the Thirty-nine articles in 1571. The Thirty-nine articles ultimately served to define the doctrine of the Church of England as it related to Calvinist doctrine and Roman Catholic practice.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, Duarte Pacheco was {{appointed}} [...] {{mayor of the}} Lisbon City Council. Under his administration, significant changes were made in town planning policies, including new ordinances to facilitate land appropriation. Pacheco invited Ã‰tienne de GroÃ«r {{to work on a}} master plan for Lisbon between 1938 and 1948. [...] It was de GroÃ«r who planned the renovation of the Baixa and whose actions resulted in: the building of the University Campus of the Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST) by the architect PorfÃ­rio Pardal Monteiro (1897-1957), the design of an integrated development of the city, the <b>finalisation</b> of the Bairro do Arco do Cego (the precursor of social housing in Lisbon), the widening of the Alameda D.

2500|$|The {{report also}} {{concluded}} that the [...] "Government over-emphasised the risk" [...] {{in regard to the}} industrial relations {{between the government and the}} CWU, with the BIS Committee referring to the Royal Mail share price before, during and after the <b>finalisation</b> of the pay deal with the union. During the presentation of the report, Bailey referred to the underpinning factors of [...] "fear of failure and poor quality advice", and warned that British taxpayers could sustain further losses in the future due to the inclusion of Royal Mail's 'surplus' assets as part of [...] "the most significant privatisation in years". The BIS Committee called on the UK government to publish a list of the preferred investors involved in the sale, including the details of those investors who sold their shareholding. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the CWU, also responded to the BIS report: [...] "The Bis select committee's damning report published today shows the extent of the government's incompetence in the privatisation of Royal Mail." ...|$|E
