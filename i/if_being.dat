5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even <b>if,</b> <b>being</b> infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E

25|$|As such a {{large number}} of cups are needed, {{gathering}} normally occurs in large groups of people. The cups are simply stacked within each other until they form a tube or 'snake'. Once the snake has reached the desired length it is held skyward to 'dance' as <b>if</b> <b>being</b> charmed. Snake length is often restricted by the width of the bay of seats as anything longer will protrude into the aisle. One solution to this is to team up with other groups and link your snakes together.

25|$|Aged {{thermocouples}} {{are only}} partly modified, for example being unaffected in the parts outside the furnace. For this reason, aged thermocouples cannot {{be taken out}} of their installed location and recalibrated in a bath or test furnace to determine error. This also explains why error can sometimes be observed when an aged thermocouple is pulled partly out of a furnace—as the sensor is pulled back, aged sections may see exposure to increased temperature gradients from hot to cold as the aged section now passes through the cooler refractory area, contributing significant error to the measurement. Likewise, an aged thermocouple that is pushed deeper into the furnace might sometimes provide a more accurate reading <b>if</b> <b>being</b> pushed further into the furnace causes the temperature gradient to occur only in a fresh section.|$|E
25|$|Since bone {{healing is}} a natural process that will occur most often, {{fracture}} treatment aims to ensure the best possible function of the injured part after healing. Bone fractures typically are treated by restoring the fractured pieces of bone to their natural positions (if necessary), and maintaining those positions while the bone heals. Often, aligning the bone, called reduction, in good position and verifying the improved alignment with an X-ray {{is all that is}} needed. This process is extremely painful without anesthesia, about as painful as breaking the bone itself. To this end, a fractured limb usually is immobilized with a plaster or fiberglass cast or splint that holds the bones in position and immobilizes the joints above and below the fracture. When the initial post-fracture edema or swelling goes down, the fracture may be placed in a removable brace or orthosis. <b>If</b> <b>being</b> treated with surgery, surgical nails, screws, plates, and wires are used to hold the fractured bone together more directly. Alternatively, fractured bones may be treated by the Ilizarov method which is a form of external fixator.|$|E

She criticized people like Emerson, however, for focusing too much on individual improvement and not enough on social reform. Like {{other members of the}} so-called Transcendental Club, she rebelled against the past and believed in the possibility of change. However, unlike others in the movement, her rebellion was not based on religion. Though Fuller occasionally attended Unitarian congregations, she did not entirely identify with that religion.

500|$|Diane Keaton {{has stated}} that Annie Hall was her {{favorite}} role and that the film meant everything to her. When asked <b>if</b> <b>being</b> most associated with the role concerned her as an actress, she replied, [...] "I'm not haunted by Annie Hall. I'm happy to be Annie Hall. If somebody wants to see me that way, it's fine by me". Costume designer Ruth Morley, working with Keaton, created a look which had an influence on the fashion world during the late-70s, with women adopting the style: layering oversized, mannish blazers over vests, billowy trousers or long skirts, a man's tie, and boots. The look was {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Annie Hall look". Some sources suggest that Keaton herself was mainly responsible for the look, and Ralph Lauren has often claimed credit, but only one jacket and one tie were purchased from Ralph Lauren for use in the film. Allen recalled that Lauren and Keaton's dress style almost did not end up in the film. [...] "She came in," [...] he recalled in 1992, [...] "and the costume lady on Annie Hall said, 'Tell her not to wear that. She can't wear that. [...] It's so crazy.' And I said, 'Leave her. She's a genius. Let's just leave her alone, let her wear what she wants.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Most nouns {{have one}} or more {{particular}} classifiers associated with them, often depending {{on the nature of}} the things they denote. For example, many nouns denoting flat objects such as tables, papers, beds, and benches use the classifier (...) zhāng, whereas many long and thin objects use (...) tiáo. The total number of classifiers in Chinese may be put at anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred, depending on how they are counted. The classifier [...] (...) , pronounced gè or ge in Mandarin, apart from being the standard classifier for many nouns, also serves as a general classifier, which may often (but not always) be used in place of other classifiers; in informal and spoken language, native speakers tend to use this classifier far more than any other, even though they know which classifier is [...] "correct" [...] when asked. Mass-classifiers might be used with all sorts of nouns with which they make sense: for example, hé ("box") may be used to denote boxes of objects, such as lightbulbs or books, even though those nouns would be used with their own appropriate count-classifiers <b>if</b> <b>being</b> counted as individual objects. Researchers have differing views as to how classifier–noun pairings arise: some regard them as being based on innate semantic features of the noun (for example, all nouns denoting [...] "long" [...] objects take a certain classifier because of their inherent longness), while others see them as motivated more by analogy to prototypical pairings (for example, [...] "dictionary" [...] comes to take the same classifier as the more common word [...] "book"). There is some variation in the pairings used, with speakers of different dialects often using different classifiers for the same item. Some linguists have proposed that the use of classifier phrases may be guided less by grammar and more by stylistic or pragmatic concerns on the part of a speaker who may be trying to foreground new or important information.|$|E
