40|$|The {{literature}} on unionized oligopoly {{has demonstrated that}} unions will generally bent from cooperation. Despite these benets, most initiatives towards Europeanization of collective bargaining have been unsuccesful. Some noteable exceptions {{can be found in}} the European metal industry. The <b>European</b> <b>Metalworkers</b> <b>Federation</b> can claim several path-breaking precedents of cross-border coordination, and is being monitored closely by scholars of European industrial relations. Despite this abundant attention, the reasons for success or faillure have not been analyzed analytically. In this paper, we present a model that takes specic charachteristics of the metal industry into account, such as product di¤erentiation, imports from low-wage countries and di¤erences in reservation wages. We predict that cooperation will be easier when reservation wages are similar and when imports are imperfect substitutes. In contrast to the common truth that an external threat encourages cooperation, we nd that under specic circumstances unions will be less eager to cooperate when faced with a foreign competitor. Our predictions are in line with the various levels of transnational cooperation in the automobile, electrical equipment and steel industries. Furthermore, our results indicate that the opposition of rms and the reluctancy of the European Commission to support transnational bargaining are generally justied by predicted changes in prots and overall welfare. nrpages: 46 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Achieving real {{solidarity}} {{across national}} borders {{and around the}} globe is a difficult undertaking, one which little in our experience has prepared us for. Language barriers, differences in cultures and political traditions, very different styles of unionism — all these make simple communication, let alone real understanding of foreign workers 2 ̆ 7 interests and concerns, difficult. Unfortunately, the AFL-CIO 2 ̆ 7 s official agency for helping us sort through these difficulties — the Department of International Affairs (DIA) — is not much help in doing so. In fact, as I argue here, the DIA is often an obstacle to building real solidarity. After making this case, I will make some suggestions for how U. S. unions can move toward solidarity by avoiding the DIA structure — through direct participation in the International Trade Secretariats (ITSs), like the <b>Metalworkers</b> <b>Federation</b> mentioned above, and through forming 2 ̆ 2 sister union 2 ̆ 2 relationships with relevant unionists in other countries. But, eventually, the DIA must be opened up to reflect the broad and diverse interests of labor 2 ̆ 7 s rank-and-file rather than the narrow sectarian face it has shown {{the world for the}} past several decades...|$|R
