5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed in <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E

Shortly {{the number of women}} attending colleges increased, and the shirtwaist became popular among the average college girl. The outfit worn by the typical college girl was a skirt that was usually shorter than current fashion, and a shirtwaist, which is best described as the equivalent of <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> T-shirt today.|$|E

In the first four seasons, Hunter and McCall typically worked on cases together, allowing the producers to showcase the chemistry between the actors, but the fifth season increasingly had them working apart, ostensibly to lessen the workload of Dryer and Kramer and to allow richer, more complex stories. So instead of <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> old sports jacket, Hunter often was seen in <b>a</b> full suit <b>and</b> tie.|$|R

25|$|A {{break in}} the case came in 1998, when police noticed that broken {{concrete}} at Miracle Motors, a business owned by Karyn's ex-father-in-law Michael Slover Sr, were similar to concrete blocks used to weigh down Karyn's body. A forensic geologist {{was brought in to}} see if anything on the Slovers' business matched evidence found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The geologist found that not only was the concrete consistent with that found at Miracle Motors, but that evidence found in the abandoned car was also likely from Slover's business. The task force sifted through dirt at Miracle Motors and eventually discovered a metal rivet and a plastic button that fit a pair of Paris Club <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> white shirt that Karyn had been wearing the day of her murder. Police also reported finding bones at the scene, but these were not introduced to trial and were believed to have been animal meat bones that came from food fed to two dogs that Slover used to secure the property.|$|E

He additionally sports a green jacket, military pants, a white T-shirt and a green headband instead of his red bandana. He was also given green protectors in his hands which have spikes. The additional outfits from the common Ralf are cosplays from Marco Rossi from the Metal Slug series and Jack Turner from the Art of Fighting series.In The King of Fighters XII, Ralf becomes bulkier and wears a dark olive military vest over a pair of dark olive cargo pants.

5000|$|Carpenter was a {{powerful}} influence on the theatre scene in Liverpool. Though she reportedly knew little about theatre and often got confused with the titles of plays, her enthusiasm and promotion of the theatre was well known locally, earning her the nickname [...] "the Lady Mayoress of Liverpool".

500|$|Drake's outward {{appearance}} is fairly generic, {{consisting of a}} simple white shirt and blue <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> gun holster {{on his back in}} the first game, and a brown henley in the second. He was deliberately costumed in a simple shirt and jeans to provide a [...] "blank slate" [...] on which the everyman persona could be imposed. The programmers designed a layered-animation system to make Drake's motions realistic by blending multiple poses and reactions together. This allowed a complex facial and wrinkle mapping system, which provided Drake more human emotional reactions. Drake's physique is fairly fit, but not overly muscular.|$|E

While Lowell wore a wig for the scenes set in the United States, a scene where Bouvier is given money and told by Bond to go and buy some new clothes (and, going off and doing so, also has her hair cut) was added so that Lowell's own short hair style could be used.|$|E
