40|$|A simple form is {{presented}} {{of the relationships}} derived by Betz for the inviscid, fully developed structure of lift-generated vortices behind aircraft. An extension is then made to arbitrary span-load distributions by inferring guidelines for the selection of rollup centers for the vortex sheet.

The derivation of a method for inviscid roll-up (IRU) is presented in detail, with attention to the cutoff-distance reformulation of the problem, a control-volume analysis of the self-induction properties of the vortex core, the adaptation of the roll-up method of Betz (1932) to IRU in three dimensions, the treatment of linear and <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading,</b> vortices with turbulent central cores, and the effect of cutoff distance on helicopter free-wake computations.

40|$|We use {{a manual}} method and an {{advanced}} geometry gen-erator to optimize a large wing flying obliquely at M = √ 2. These include the informed, but manual, {{design of the}} air-foil sections, the choice of wing planform and airfoil blending of these sections to create a wing. A manual tai-loring of the wing planform and bending are used to pro-vide a nearly <b>elliptic</b> <b>load.</b> The lift coefficient and sweep are varied sequentially to arrive at an optimum inviscid design. Considering this wing to be a flat plate, the vis-cous drag is computed. The altitude at which the wing en-ters cruise is selected to maximize L/D.

40|$|The use {{of linear}} theory in calculating the twist {{distribution}} of a wing designed for cruise at supercritical speeds is justified {{on the basis}} of the transonic equivalence rule. A modified version of Multhopp's subsonic lifting-surface theory was used to calculate the twist distribution. The lifting-surface theory is compared with both slender wing theory and experimental results. A study was also made of the effect of wing sweep on the twist distribution required to maintain an <b>elliptic</b> span <b>load</b> at cruise conditions. The important parameters used in establishing this twist distribution are identified...|$|R
40|$|The plateau {{region in}} which {{trailing}} vortices initially exhibit slow decay of maximum tangential speed is demonstrated {{with the aid}} of constant and variable eddy viscosity models. The existence of the plateau is explained by the presence of the viscous core and by the necessity for transition of the initial, nearly inviscid profile to similarity far downstream. Span loading is shown to affect the initial maximum tangential speed as well as the duration of the plateau region. Triangular span loading is shown to present less hazard to trailing aircraft, at least in the near field, than <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading</b> because the inviscid profile for triangular loading exhibits a finite tangential speed at the vortex centerline and a large inviscid core...|$|E
40|$|In {{studying}} anct comparing various theories for {{the determination}} of the distribution of loading on wings, Garner 1 has given values for the lift slope of several families of swept-back and delta wings deduced from several different lifting-surface theories. In Fig. 8 of Ref. 1, Garner" has plotted these lift slopes as functions of the aspect ratio A, for different values of the angle of sweep. It occurred to the writer to try plotting the ratio of the lift slope to that for <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading</b> instead of the lift slope itself, and when this was done it was noticed that the above ratio was very nearly independent of aspect ratio A, and gave a unique curve for all the available results when plotted against sweepback angle, A. The curve is shown in Fig. 2 and it will be seen that none of the points is more than 3 per cent from the mean curve and most are much closer than this. The cases given by Garner cover an aspect-ratio range from 2 to 8 and a sweep range from 20 to 70 deg, as will be seen from Fig. 1, reproduced from his report. The value of the twodimensional lift slope used in deducing that for <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading</b> at any given aspect ratio was, of course, 2 ~, since comparison is with potential calculations on wings of zero thickness. In using the mean curve to predict a lift slope for practical purposes it might be more logical to use the most probable value of the two-dimensional lift slope for the case in question rather than th...|$|E
40|$|Two vortex-sheet {{evolution}} problems arising in aerodynamics are studied numerically. The {{approach is}} based on desingularizing the Cauchy principal value integral which defines the sheet’s velocity. Numerical evidence is presented which indicates that the approach converges with respect to refinement in the mesh-size and the smoothing parameter. For <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading,</b> the computed roll-up is in good agreement with Kaden’s asymptotic spiral at early times. Some aspects of the solution’s instability to short-wavelength perturbations, for a small value of the smoothing parameter, are inferred by comparing calculations performed with different levels of computer round-off error. The tip vortices ’ deformation, due to their mutual interaction, is shown in a long-time calculation. Computations for a simulated fuselage-flap configuration show a complicated process of roll-up, deformation and interaction involving the tip vortex and the inboard neighbouring vortices. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{spanwise}} vortex-lattice {{arrangement is}} mathematically established by lattice solutions of the slender wing which are {{shown to be}} analogous to the chordwise vortex-lattice thin wing solution. Solutions for any number N of panels wing theory lift and induced drag and thin wing theory lift and moment are predicted exactly. As N approaches infinity, the slender wing <b>elliptic</b> spanwise <b>loading</b> and thin wing cotangent chordwise loading are predicted, which proves there is mathematical convergence of the vortex-lattice method to the exact answer. Based on this planform spanwise lattice arrangement, an A-vortex-lattice spanwise system is developed for an arbitrary aspect ratio A. This A-lattice has the optimum characteristic of predicting lift accurately for any value of N...|$|R
40|$|If {{the roots}} of the {{characteristic}} equation of the governing differential equation for the stress function of an orthotropic plate under generalized plane stress conditions are equal classical solutions of anisotropic elasticity theory do not hold anymore. The general form of the stress function for such orthotropic materials is discussed and the exact solution is given for the plate with an <b>elliptic</b> opening <b>loaded</b> in tension. Comparison of the stress distribution for the material with distinct characteristic roots indicated that in produces much higher stress concentrations than the model with equal roots. For the latter case solution of any boundary value problem may be obtained very easily through an existing solution for the isotropic material. Given also that there are several problems involving stress concentrations in orthotropic plates as yet unsolved, the analysis presented here might be of considerable help in the, designing of the structure of composite laminates. © 1989 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{determine}} the dynamic load between two rotating elastic helical gears is presented. The stiffness of the gear teeth is calculated using the finite element method and includes the contribution from the <b>elliptic</b> distributed tooth <b>load.</b> To {{make sure that the}} new incoming contacts which are the main excitation source are properly simulated, the necessary deformation of the gears is determined by using the true geometry and positions of the gears for every time step of the dynamic calculation. This allows the contact to be positioned outside the plane of action. A numerical example is presented with figures that show the behaviour of the dynamic transmission error as well as the variation of the contact pressure due to the dynamic load for different rotational speeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of laminar trailing vortices behind a lifting wing is considered. The inviscid roll {{up of the}} trailing vortex sheet is examined, {{and the nature of}} the singularity at the centre of the spiral is determined. It is shown that viscosity removes the singularity and the {{structure of}} the viscous core is obtained. The pressure in the viscous core is found and used to calculate the axial velocities produced by streamwise pressure gradients. It is found that the perturbation of axial velocity can be either away from the wing or towards the wing depending on the distribution of tip loading on the wing. For <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading,</b> the perturbation is towards the wing. The axial flow deficit in the core due to the boundary layers on the wing is also estimated. A comparison with experiment is made and reasonable agreement is found...|$|E
40|$|The {{unsteady}} {{evolution of}} trailing vortex sheets {{in ground effect}} is simulated {{by the use of}} a discrete vortex method. The ground effect is included by image method. Two cases of unsteady vortex evolution behind lifting lines (an <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading</b> and a fuselage/flap-wing configuration) are simulated for several ground heights. The present method is validated by comparison of the simulated wake roll-up shapes to published numerical results. For a lifting line with an <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading,</b> the ground has the effect of moving the wingtip vortices laterally outward and suppressing the development of the vortex. An increase in the wing loading has the effect of moving the wingtip vortex more laterally outward. The rotation of the wake vortices behind a fuselage/part-span flap configuration in ground effect is less than the case of flight out of the ground effect.

40|$|An {{analytical}} method of computing the averaging effect of wing-span size on the loading of a wing induced by random turbulence was adapted {{for use on}} a digital electronic computer. The turbulence input was assumed to have a Dryden power spectral density. The computations were made for lift, rolling moment, and bending moment for two span load distributions, rectangular and elliptic. Data are presented to show the wing-span averaging effect for wing-span ratios encompassing current airplane sizes. The rectangular wing-span loading showed a slightly greater averaging effect than did the <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading.</b> In the frequency range most bothersome to airplane passengers, the wing-span averaging effect can reduce the normal lift load, and thus the acceleration, by about 7 percent for a typical medium-sized transport. Some calculations were made to evaluate the effect of using a Von Karman turbulence representation. These results showed that using the Von Karman representation generally resulted in a span averaging effect about 3 percent larger...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{problem of}} a transversely isotropic piezoelectric material with an embedded elliptic crack parallel to the material plane of isotropy is solved using an integral equation method developed earlier to solve similar problems in isotropic homogeneous elastic materials. The field equations of such medium reduce to four simultaneous partial differential equations of second order with the three displacement components and an electric potential as the basic unknowns. These partial differential equations reduce to four quasi-harmonic equations in terms of newly introduced potential functions. For the <b>elliptic</b> crack <b>loaded</b> normally with mechanical and electric loads, the mixed boundary conditions reduce the four quasi-harmonic equations {{to a pair of}} coupled integral equations – the coupling being between the normal displacement component and the electric potential function. A series of transformations together with Fourier expansions of the known and unknown fields reduce the coupled pair of integral equations to four infinite systems of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. For constant mechanical and electric load closed form analytical solutions are obtained for the displacement and electric potentials. The solutions reveal an extremely complicated coupling between the mechanical and electric variables. The method of solution will enable one to investigate further into the fracture behavior of piezoelectric materials with main crack interacting with neighboring micro-cracks and excited not only with static loads but also with time-dependent loads. Various other problems of piezoelectric materials, e. g. vibration problems, contact problems, etc. could also be solved by this method. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper focusses on the {{influence}} of the deviatoric shape of the employed loading surface on the predicted failure of concrete. For this purpose, the Extended Leon Model (ELM) [1] and a multi-surface model are considered. The multi-surface model consists of three Rankine surfaces and the Drucker–Prager surface. Whereas the Drucker–Prager surface is characterized by a circular shape in the deviatoric plane, the ELM accounts for the dependence of the strength of concrete on the Lode angle. It is characterized by an <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading</b> surface in the deviatoric plane. The eccentricity e defines the out-off-roundness. It allows a smooth transition from a circular (e= 1) to an almost triangular shape (e≈ 0. 5) of the loading surface in the deviatoric plane. The significance of the deviatoric shape of the loading surface on the predicted peak load and failure mode of concrete structures is investigated by means of two example problems: a plane-strain compression test characterized by compressive failure and an anchor-bolt test characterized by shear failure...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis contains discussion, theory and program code for a {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model of a wing of arbitrary planform. The model assumes incompressible, inviscid, irrotational flow. The program computes forces acting on the wing by modeling the flow {{with a set of}} horse shoe vortex elements. It models the flow over an arbitrary wing using two solutions. One solution is the ideal lift, associated with a cambered and twisted wing. The other solution is the additional lift associated with a flat wing. The program computes wing camber and twist using an <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading</b> distribution.

40|$|The Weissinger {{method for}} {{determining}} additional span loading {{has been used}} to find the lift-curve slope, spanwise center of pressure, aerodynamic center location, and span loading coefficients of untwisted and uncambered wings having a wide range of plan forms characterized by various combinations of sweep, aspect ratio, and taper ratio. The results are presented as variations of the aerodynamic characteristics with sweep angle for various values of aspect ratio and taper ratio. Methods are also included for determining induced drag and the approximate effects of compressibility. Despite the limitations of a lifting line method such as Weissinger's, the good agreement found between experimentally and theoretically determined characteristics warrants confidence in the method. In particular, it is believed that trends observed in results of the Weissinger method should be reliable. One of the most significant results showed that for each angle of sweep there is a taper ratio for which aspect ratio has little effect on the span loading and for which the loading is practically elliptical. This <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading</b> is approached at a taper ratio of 1. 39 for 30 degree of sweepforward, 0. 45 for zero degree of sweepback. (author) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{parallel}} {{with a recent}} experimental study {{of the use of}} slotted tunnel liners with variable perforated screens to give interference-free aerodynamic damping derivatives, the corresponding problem is considered theoretically. The principle, that wall interference usually changes sign when slots in the roof and floor of a rectangular tunnel are completely sealed, has prompted these complementary studies with systematic variation of a porosity parameter that can govern the intermediate wall conditions. A theory for small frequency parameter and subsonic compressible flow, which has already explained serious interference effects observed experimentally, is extended to the more general tunnel boundary conditions. With the aid of a special similarity rule for compressible flow, the six necessary interference parameters are determined by a judicious amalgam of exact and approximate data for incompressible flow, including allowance for <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading</b> over a finite wing span. The corrections to oscillatory lift and pitching moment are formulated. By iterative calculation the theoretical method is applied to pitching motion of the unswept tapered and cropped delta planforms chosen for the related half-model experiments. The most favourable wall porosity for low interference is similar in theory and experiment for the two wings. A recommended practical procedure for approximating to interference-free wall conditions is thus corroborated by theoretical calculation and is also extended to give residual corrections...|$|E
40|$|A closed-form {{solution}} for the downwash in the plane of symmetry of an elliptically loaded line is given. This theoretical result is derived from Prandtl's lifting-line theory and assumes that: (1) a three-dimensional wing can {{be replaced by a}} straight lifting line, (2) this line is elliptically loaded, and (3) the trailing wake is a flat-sheet which does not roll up. The first assumption is reasonable for distances greater than about 1 chord from the wing aerodynamic center. The second assumption is satisfied by any combination of wing twist, spanwise camber variation, or planform that approximates <b>elliptic</b> <b>loading.</b> The third assumption is justified only for high-aspect-ratio wings at low lift coefficients and downstream distances less than about 1 span from the aerodynamic center. It is shown, however, that assuming the wake to be fully rolled up gives downwash values reasonably close to those of the flat-sheet solution derived in this paper. The wing can therefore be modeled as a single horseshoe vortex with the same lift and total circulation as the equivalent ellipticity loaded line, and the predicted downwash will be a close approximation independent of aspect ratio and lift coefficient. The flat-sheet equation and the fully rolled up wake equation are both one-line formulas that predict the upwash field in front of the wing, as well as the downwash field behind it. These formulas are useful for preliminary estimates of the complex aerodynamic interaction between two wings (i. e., canard, tandem wing, and conventional aircraft) including the effects of gap and stagger...|$|E
