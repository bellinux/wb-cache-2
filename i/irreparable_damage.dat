The tree survived the blaze but suffered <b>irreparable</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Category4 hurricanes tend {{to produce}} more {{extensive}} curtainwall failures, with some complete structural failure on small residences. Heavy, <b>irreparable</b> <b>damage</b> and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile and manufactured homes are often flattened. Most trees, except for the heartiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. These storms cause extensive beach erosion, while terrain may be flooded far inland. Total and long-lived electrical and water losses are to be expected, possibly for many weeks.|$|E

5|$|The inscribed ring {{remains the}} subject of {{considerable}} academic interest, {{and a number of}} theories regarding its origin, the reason for its burial and its date have been proposed. The inscription, which sustained <b>irreparable</b> <b>damage</b> shortly after its discovery, can no longer be read with certainty, and has been subjected to various attempts at reconstruction and interpretation. Recently, however, it has become possible to reconstruct the damaged portion with the aid of rediscovered depictions of the ring in its original state. Taken as a whole, the inscribed ring may offer insight into the nature of the pre-Christian pagan religion of the Goths.|$|E
5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a threat to}} shipping, the British Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided in late August to conduct further attacks against her using Royal Air Force heavy bombers. On 15 September, a force of Avro Lancasters attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted <b>irreparable</b> <b>damage</b> on the battleship. Following this raid she sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø {{to be used as}} an immobile coastal defence battery.

5|$|Over {{the centuries}} the frescoes were greatly altered and damaged. In 1746 the upper levels were painted {{over by the}} artist Vincenzo Meucci, {{covering}} up most of Masolino's work. Then, in 1771, the church was ruined by fire. The Brancacci Chapel, though structurally undamaged by the fire, suffered great damages to its frescoes. It {{was not until the}} years 1981–1990 that a full-scale restoration of the chapel was undertaken, restoring the frescoes to approximately their original state. The paintings had suffered some <b>irreparable</b> <b>damage</b> though, particularly the parts that were painted a secco: in The Tribute Money, the leaves on the trees were gone, while Christ's robe had lost much of its original azure brilliance.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Today, {{all kinds}} of people need {{vehicles}} for performing their daily activities. The need for use of these vehicles for transportation frequently leads to a high rate of road accidents and it seems that certain people do not have enough ability to use these vehicles. Dangerous behaviors lead to financial and life risking <b>irreparable</b> <b>damages.</b> Methods: The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the relationship between psychological characteristics (mental health, aggression, type A characteristic) and driving habits. The researchers chose 110 injured men drivers and asked them to complete the Manchester Driving Behavior, Type A Characteristic, Ahvaz Aggressive and Mental Health questionnaires. The data was analyzed by Pearson's Correlation and Regression Analysis. Results: The findings showed that there is a significant relation between psychological characteristics (mental health, aggression, type A characteristic) and driving habits. The regression analysis also foresees the aggressive and mental health of testers’ dangerous driving behavior. Meanwhile, Type A characteristic is not able to foresee driving behaviors. Conclusion: Risky driving is a phenomenon that leads to many <b>irreparable</b> <b>damages</b> for the society and individual. Present study suggests that in order to reduce dangers and probable damages, procurement of driving license procedures should be prolonged and drivers should be regularly assessed psychologically (personal or public). Risky drivers or the attackers who need education or consultation should attend education-consultation programs...|$|R
5|$|The Admiralty {{accepted}} that Barracudas were {{too slow to}} be effective against the Kaafjord area following the failure of Operation Goodwood. As a result, the task of attacking the battleship was transferred to RAF Bomber Command. The first heavy bomber raid against Kaafjord (Operation Paravane) was conducted on 15 September 1944, with the bombers flying from staging bases in northern Russia. This attack inflicted <b>irreparable</b> <b>damage</b> on Tirpitz, and she was transferred south to the Tromsø area {{to be used as}} an immobile coastal defence battery. The battleship was sunk there with heavy loss of life by another Bomber Command raid on 12 November.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} of Category 3 {{and higher}} {{are described as}} major hurricanes in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific basins. These storms can cause some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings, particularly those of wood frame or manufactured materials with minor curtain wall failures. Buildings that lack a solid foundation, such as mobile homes, are usually destroyed, and gable-end roofs are peeled off. Manufactured homes usually sustain severe and <b>irreparable</b> <b>damage.</b> Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures, while larger structures are struck by floating debris. A large number of trees are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. Additionally, terrain may be flooded well inland. Near-total to total power loss is likely for up to several weeks and water will likely also be lost or contaminated.|$|E
5|$|In late August it {{was decided}} that further Fleet Air Arm attacks should not be {{attempted}} as the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. As it was still seen as desirable to destroy Tirpitz, the task was assigned to Bomber Command. On 15 September a force of heavy bombers attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted <b>irreparable</b> <b>damage</b> on the battleship. Following this, Tirpitz sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø to be used as an immobile coastal defence battery. Another heavy bomber attack on 29 October caused only minor damage, and a third raid was mounted on 12 November in which Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.|$|E
40|$|Radiobiological {{parameters}} {{were assessed}} after irradiation of HTB 140 melanoma cells with 62 MeV/u 12 C ions or protons along Bragg curve. Due to higher {{linear energy transfer}} (LET), better efficiency of 12 C ions compared to protons was revealed through surviving fraction and relative biological effectiveness. Significant cell inactivation on distal declining end of Bragg peak was higher for 12 C ions. Protons, close to Bragg peak maximum, having lower LET, produce reparable damages to affected cells, thus lower proliferation than 12 C ions. Higher LET of 12 C ions causes more <b>irreparable</b> <b>damages,</b> giving higher proliferation activity...|$|R

5|$|Some pre-Code movies {{suffered}} <b>irreparable</b> <b>damage</b> from censorship after 1934. When studios {{attempted to}} re-issue films from the 1920s and early 1930s, {{they were forced}} to make extensive cuts. Films such as Mata Hari (1931), Arrowsmith (1931), and A Farewell to Arms (1932) exist only in their censored versions. Many other films survived intact because they were too controversial to be re-released, such as The Maltese Falcon (1931), which was remade a decade later with the same name, and thus never had their master negatives edited. In the case of Convention City (1933), which Breen would not allow to be re-released in any form, the entire film remains missing. Although it has been rumored that all prints and negatives were ordered destroyed by Jack Warner in the late thirties, further research shows the negative was in the vaults as late as 1948 when it was junked due to nitrate decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the five}} French ships managed to break past the British blockade, taking shelter in the {{protected}} anchorage, which was only accessible {{through a series of}} complicated reefs and sandbanks that were impassable without an experienced harbour pilot. When Pym ordered his frigates to attack the anchored French on August 22 and 23, his ships became trapped in the narrow channels of the bay: two were irretrievably grounded; a third, outnumbered by the combined French squadron, was defeated; and a fourth was unable to close to within effective gun range. Although the French ships were also badly damaged, the battle was a disaster for the British: one ship was captured after suffering <b>irreparable</b> <b>damage,</b> the grounded ships were set on fire to prevent their capture by French boarding parties and the remaining vessel was seized as it left the harbour by the main French squadron from Port Napoleon under Commodore Jacques Hamelin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Apoptosis {{induced by}} DNA damage is an {{important}} mechanism of tumor suppression and it is significant also in cancer chemotherapy. Mammalian cells activate the pathways of p 53 to induce apoptosis of cells harboring <b>irreparable</b> DNA <b>damages.</b> While p 53 induces expression of various pro-apoptotic genes and directly participates in the disruption of mitochondrial membrane polarization, it also increases expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p 21 that is a dominant inhibitor of caspase-activation and apoptosis. Here we discuss how Damaged-DNA Binding Protein- 2 (DDB 2) subdues the level of p 21 in cells harboring <b>irreparable</b> DNA <b>damage</b> to support activation of the caspases. We speculate a model in which DDB 2 detects and couples the presence of un-repaired DNA damages to the proteolysis of p 21, leading to the induction of apoptosis. </p...|$|R
