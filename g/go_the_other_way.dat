5|$|The Knight on c6 {{is safer}} than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} a general {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E

There are also arguments that <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> namely that the life story of Jesus as told by early Christians during the second and third centuries gave rise to new religious movements such as Gnosticism.|$|E
25|$|Indian {{economist}} Arvind Subramanian {{points out}} the potential problem of reverse causality in Acemoglu and Robinson's theory in his publication on The American Interest. Why Nations Fail takes political institutions as causes and economic performance as results for granted. However, according to Modernization theory, causation can also <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around—improvement of political institutions {{can also be a}} result of economic modernization. The book thus fails to explain why this alternative perspective doesn't work.|$|E

500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} generations of baseball, the {{emphasis}} was mostly on bat control, place hitting, bunting, etc. But, starting in 1919, several factors resulted in a dramatic expansion of strategic orientation, supplementing traditional [...] "small ball" [...] with the [...] "power game": a [...] "livelier" [...] ball, because of better materials and a tighter weave; more frequent substitutions of new balls; lighter, more flexible bats; the outlawing of the spitball; {{and the increase in}} attendance which drove owners to build more outfield seating, thus reducing the outfield area significantly. The power game has been encouraged further in recent years, by the construction of new ballparks with smaller outfields than previously, and even the reduction of field size at [...] "classic" [...] ballparks known for spacious outfields; for example, the distance to the fence in deep left field at the original Yankee Stadium was reduced from [...] between 1984 and 1988 (the post-1988 dimensions were maintained at the current Yankee Stadium).
