500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Chandelier" [...] has a sad theme {{talking about}} [...] "the glitter and fatigue {{of a party}} girl's life". John Walker from MTV Buzzworthy opined that the song has a dark theme, [...] "toeing the line between celebration and self-destruction as it becomes {{increasingly}} more blurred". The song's opening lyrics, [...] "Party girls don't get hurt, can't feel anything ... <b>I</b> <b>push</b> it down", are sung over a reggae-influenced background. Walker noted that during the chorus, Sia sings, [...] "I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier/ I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist". A few critics compared the song's musical style to works done by Rihanna, including Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork Media, and Melinda Newman of HitFix.|$|E
500|$|Despite [...] "new celebrity" [...] status, Bell {{claimed that}} she was not {{concerned}} because [...] "no one ever recognizes me anyway". As Bell explained, [...] "I hang out with Hayden quite a bit—they never take pictures of me. I just step to the side, and <b>I</b> <b>push</b> myself in front of her when she wants to get out of it, or put her in the car." [...] Bell was a recurring guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, appearing in interviews as well as sketches. On The Late Late Show, she shows a humorous hostility towards Craig's robot skeleton sidekick Geoff Peterson, claiming that she had wanted to be Craig's sidekick on his show and taking it upon herself to cut Geoff down every chance she gets. Both Bell and Geoff Peterson appeared with Ferguson during the five Late Late Show' episodes filmed in France.|$|E
500|$|Black Flag's {{change in}} musical style and {{appearance}} alienated {{many of their}} original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone. Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote [...] "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When <b>I</b> <b>push</b> out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what I {{really want to do}} to them." [...] During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that [...] "his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself." [...] Rollins has since replied that [...] "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself." ...|$|E
