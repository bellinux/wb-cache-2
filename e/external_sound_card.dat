5000|$|Mean Streets is {{the first}} game in the Tex Murphy series. Unlike later games in the series, it {{features}} segments {{in a variety of}} genres, including adventure game sequences, side-scrolling action sequences, and an open-world flight simulator. It was notable at the time {{as one of the first}} commercially available games to use 256-color VGA graphics, as well as for its [...] "RealSound" [...] technology that allowed recorded digital audio to be played back without the need for an <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Serato {{was founded}} in 1998 by Stephen West and AJ Bertenshaw who {{developed}} a timestretching and pitch-shifting Pro Tools plugin, Pitch 'N Time. [...] They then focused on the evolving vinyl emulation software market, developing the first release of Serato Scratch Live (SSL) in 2004. [...] The software utilizes specialized timecoded audio called the Serato NoiseMap. [...] The NoiseMap is pressed into a control vinyl or CD and the signal is captured by an <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> which is then used to manipulate digital music on the user's computer. Serato began by working with Washington-based Rane Corporation to develop the first Scratch Live supported hardware, the Rane SL1, during which, Serato developed the NoiseMap control vinyl to complete the system.|$|E

There are 12 persons (including 3 females and 9 males, {{who are all}} volunteers in our group) participating as subjects in the test. Being trained, {{most of them are}} experienced listeners.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to finding a solution for mobile computer audio recording and editing. We are searching for appropriate solutions based on defined needs. For calculations we have used the multi-criteria selection method. To be exact, we are searching for computers and <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> <b>cards.</b> The result is {{the location of the}} computer and the <b>sound</b> <b>card.</b> It is a hardware set, which can be used for amateur or semi-professional audio work.

25|$|However, attacks using low-end {{consumer}} grade equipment {{have also}} shown successful. By using an <b>external</b> USB <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> and an induction coil salvaged from a wireless charging pad, researchers {{were able to}} extract a user's signing key in Android's OpenSSL and Apple's CommonCrypto implementations of ECDSA.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of USB, the {{parallel}} interface was adapted to access a number of peripheral devices other than printers. Probably {{one of the earliest}} devices to use parallel were dongles used as a hardware key form of software copy protection. Zip drives and scanners were early implementations followed by <b>external</b> modems, <b>sound</b> <b>cards,</b> webcams, gamepads, joysticks, external hard disk drives and CD-ROM drives. Some of the earliest portable MP3 players required a parallel port connection for transferring songs to the device. Adapters were available to run SCSI devices via parallel. Other devices such as EPROM programmers and hardware controllers could be connected via the parallel port.|$|R

It includes a complete design of differential microphone preamplifier with balanced input and single-ended guitar preamplifier with unbalanced input. The main circuit is completed by dual supply voltage, phantom power and signal indication.

40|$|Photoplethysmography is a prevalent, {{non-invasive}} heart monitoring method. In {{this paper}} an implementation of photoplethysmography on the Raspberry Pi is presented. Two modulation techniques are discussed, which make possible to measure these signals by the Raspberry Pi, using an <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> as A/D converter.

50|$|A {{personal}} computer is the typical {{means by which}} digital audio is recorded and stored. An external hard drive {{may be used for}} additional storage capacity. Routing audio to the computer will require an <b>external</b> or internal <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> or analog to digital converter (A/D). Studio monitors allow the user to listen to the play back. Also required for play back is a digital to analog converter (D/A). Many <b>sound</b> <b>cards</b> will provide both A/D and D/A converters. A good example of a <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> {{would be one of the}} following: Presonus AudioBox, Avid Mbox, M-Audio Fastrack pro. These products offer microphone pre-amps and also AD & D/A converters. They can connect to the computer via USB or Firewire connection and record 1-8 or more audio channels simultaneously. That means that many different sound sources can be captured at the same time. For example, this is needed when making a basic recording of a song where two different microphone signals are required for the voice and the guitar, or in situations to combine many different microphone sounds from the same source.Examples of studio monitor companies are Yamaha, Genelec, Tannoy, Focal.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to share multimedia contents included in existing digital devices and to solve the problems of an increase in installation fees and non-environmentally friendly interiors. This study designed a new digital signal transmitter and receiver using power line transmission and HDMI in order to solve the problems in the existing systems. The transmitter and receiver designed in this study used an AD 9867 BCPZ PLC chip in which the transmission came from digital signals originating in a PC, and the system architecture was configured so that the outputs signals were connected to a TV from the receiver. The experiment was implemented by adding a Video Test Generator, a USBPre <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> <b>card,</b> and Smaart Live 6 for analyzing the characteristics of the configured system. In the video test results, it was verified that communication was actively implemented, and the image quality showed a constant level from the measurement of the captured video. In the case of the sound, it was verified that more than 90 % of the sound signals were normally transmitted and received from the examination of their phases and magnitudes. Thus, the performance of the system designed in this study was verified, which leads to the resolution of some of the problems found in current digital devices.

50|$|Mpxplay {{supports}} <b>sound</b> <b>cards</b> {{using one}} of two methods: natively or through emulation. Native support is achieved by having drivers in Mpxplay {{that are capable of}} writing to the <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> directly. When native support is used more of the <b>sound</b> <b>cards</b> features are available such as the ability to use 32-bit sound.|$|R
2500|$|On {{supported}} <b>sound</b> <b>cards,</b> DirectSound {{would try}} to use [...] "hardware accelerated" [...] buffers, i.e. the ones which either can be placed in local <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> memory, or can be accessed by the <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> from the system memory. If hardware acceleration is not available, DirectSound would create audio buffers in the system memory and use purely software mixing.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> mixer is {{the analog}} {{part of a}} <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> that routes and mixes sound signals. This circuit {{receives}} inputs from both external connectors and the <b>sound</b> <b>card's</b> digital-to-analog converters. It selects or mutes, amplifies (with variable gain) these signals, adds them together, and finally routes the result to both external output connectors and the <b>sound</b> <b>card's</b> analog-to-digital converters. Different mixing schemes are in use, but the ones implemented in most IBM-PC compatible computers today are variants of a scheme defined in Intel's AC'97 Audio Component Specification.|$|R
25|$|This {{requires}} a specialized DJ <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> {{with at least}} 4 channels (2 stereo pairs) of inputs and outputs. With this setup, the DJ software typically outputs unmixed signals from the music files to an external hardware DJ mixer. Some DJ mixers have integrated USB <b>sound</b> <b>cards</b> that allow DJ software to connect directly to the mixer without requiring a separate <b>sound</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|Just {{as there}} are devices to convert {{computer}} signals into printouts and video information, there are devices to convert those signals into sound. these devices are known as <b>sound</b> <b>card.</b> Although <b>sound</b> <b>cards</b> started out as pluggable adapters, this functionality {{is one of the}} most common integrated technologies found on the motherboards today. A <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> Typically has small, round, 1/8´´ jacks on the back of it for connecting microphones, Headphones, and speakers as well as other sound equipment. many <b>sound</b> <b>cards</b> used to have a DA15 game port, which can be used either for joysticks or MIDI controllers.|$|R
