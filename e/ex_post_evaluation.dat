50|$|Counterfactual {{analysis}} enables evaluators {{to attribute}} {{cause and effect}} between interventions and outcomes. The ‘counterfactual’ measures {{what would have happened}} to beneficiaries {{in the absence of the}} intervention, and impact is estimated by comparing counterfactual outcomes to those observed under the intervention. The key challenge in impact evaluation is that the counterfactual cannot be directly observed and must be approximated with reference to a comparison group. There are a range of accepted approaches to determining an appropriate comparison group for counterfactual analysis, using either prospective (ex ante) or retrospective (<b>ex</b> <b>post)</b> <b>evaluation</b> design. Prospective evaluations begin during the design phase of the intervention, involving collection of baseline and end-line data from intervention beneficiaries (the ‘treatment group’) and non-beneficiaries (the ‘comparison group’); they may involve selection of individuals or communities into treatment and comparison groups. Retrospective evaluations are usually conducted after the implementation phase and may exploit existing survey data, although the best evaluations will collect data as close to baseline as possible, to ensure comparability of intervention and comparison groups.|$|E
50|$|Bruno S. Frey (with Marcel Kucher) {{examines}} in {{the paper}} “History as Reflected in Capital Markets: The Case of World War ll”'''', how movements in bond prices {{can be linked to}} historical events. He finds in an econometric analysis’ of price movements of bonds issued by five European governments, which were traded on the Swiss bourse between 1928 and 1948, that most events to which historians attach great importance are reflected in price changes for bonds. However, some major events are not reflected, for example Germany’s capitulation in 1945. Frey and Kucher find for this particular case that bond prices already had changed much earlier when the Allied powers decided at Yalta that they would only accept a total capitulation at all fronts. This indicates an interesting friction between historians’ <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluation</b> of events and the price setting parameters for traders as an ex ante evaluation. Frey and Kucher discuss the potential insight for historical research using market data and econometric analysis. They refer to efficient market theory in order to identify three central advantages of capital market data to other data sources: (a) Data is correctly recorded since bourses are quasi-public. What is assessed is the decision makers expectations about the future; (b) Investors tend to evaluate the situation carefully because they are engaged with their own money; (c) Financial markets usually exhibit a high predictive power, due to marginal traders.|$|E

40|$|Accountability of UK Debt Management: A Proposal' In this paper, {{we argue}} that UK debt {{management}} policy is insufficiently transparent and accountable. The debt management objectives are poorly understood and accountable, and partly as a consequence, there is no formal mechanism for performance measurement by the public.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{reviews the}} {{normative}} literature of performance measurement {{within the context}} of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the effectiveness of current ex post evaluations of PPPs and identify a feasible direction to comprehensively and effectively measure the performance of PPP infrastructure projects. Design/methodology/approach – An in-depth literature review is conducted in this paper. The focus of the review is associated with the general performance measurement and performance measurements of PPPs. Findings – This paper identifies that conventional <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluation</b> is not robust enough to measure the performance of PPP projects. Based on the characteristics of PPPs, the life-cycle (process-based) evaluation under performance measurement system is a promising approach to comprehensive and effective PPP performance measurement. Practical implications – The outcomes of this paper can be used as a theoretical base for the development of PPP performance measurement framework. Originality/value – Performance measurement is essential to business success, whether it is at the organisation or project level. Limitations on public funds have encouraged more and more governments across the world to use PPPs to procure economic and social infrastructure projects. Similar to traditional procurement, <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluation</b> is being widely used in PPP projects. However, PPPs are more complicated than other traditional procurement approaches. Exploration of literature suggests that limited research has been undertaken to examine if conventional <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluation</b> is sufficient to measure the performance of PPPs.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{an issue}} that has received little attention in the literature on health state evaluation: the relevance of the <b>ex</b> ante/ex <b>post</b> distinction in the assessment of quality of life. <b>Ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluations</b> are based on experience of the health state being evaluated. Ex ante evaluations are made in anticipation of actually experiencing the health state, and are able to capture sources of pre-outcome (dis) utility such as anticipatory fear, anxiety, hope and dread.

From the extra-welfarist perspective it might argued that <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluations</b> should be used, because economic evaluation should be based solely on realised outcomes, at least {{in the context of a}} publicly financed health service. We sought the views of the Australian public on this issue. Using social willingness to pay questions, we asked respondents to select between alternative health services which either did, or did not, take pre-outcome sources of utility into account.

We apply this method to provide an <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluation</b> of two almost simultaneous mergers in the Hungarian retail gasoline market.

40|$|An {{effective}} and efficient performance measurement is deemed to be pivotal for ensuring owners’ and stakeholders’ needs are being met throughout a project’s lifecycle. To determine the nature of performance measurement in Australian public-private partnerships (PPPs), an interpretivist approach that utilized semistructured interviews was undertaken in the State of Western Australia. A total of 25 {{interviews were conducted with}} key stakeholders and it was revealed that there was a proclivity for performance measurements during design and construction to focus on traditional ex ante and <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluations</b> that were aligned to the conventional iron triangle: time, cost, and quality (TCQ). However, there was widespread consensus among the interviewees that the traditional TCQ approach was too simplistic to capture the inherent complexities associated with social infrastructure PPPs. In addressing this issue the analysis indicates that process-based lifecycle performance measurement that strategically places an emphasis on value for money (VfM) should be introduced into PPPs to replace traditional ex ante and <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluations.</b> It is suggested that this type of measurement can be integrated with a broader VfM assessment and a series of key performance indicators to enable {{the public and private sectors}} to improve their performance throughout a project’s lifecycle.

40|$|The Austrian Science Fund (FWF) is Austria’s major {{agency for}} {{competitive}} basic research funding {{and has been}} subject to several external evaluations within the last 2 years. In {{the course of the}} Evaluation of the Austrian Industrial Research Promotion Fund (FFF) and the Austrian Science Fund (2003 / 2004), FWF’s governance and processes [Van der Meulen (2004) ], and an Impact Analysis [Sreicher et al., (2004) ], which mainly aimed at identifying parameters which influence the funding decisions of the FWF, have been conducted. Zinöcker and Dinges (2004) have highlighted the position of FWF’s funding instruments in the context of other R&D funding agencies and instruments in Austria. Furthermore, PREST and Fraunhofer (2004) have recently evaluated the thematic "Research Network Programmes" and an evaluation of the international mobility grant programme "Erwin Schrödinger Fellowship is currently being performed". The present study aims to appraise the performance of FWF funded projects within the grant scheme of stand-alone projects (Einzelprojekte), which constitutes the core research funding of FWF, accounting for about two-thirds of FWF’s budget in 2004. The emphasis of the study is to identify the inter-relation between ex ante and <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluation,</b> and to identify critical factors that influence the results of the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Furthermore, the study examines relevance and appropriateness of FWF’s ex post project evaluation procedure.
