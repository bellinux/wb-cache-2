40|$|Toward the {{ultimate}} goal of replacing field-based evaluation of seasonal growth habit, we describe the design and validation of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay diagnostic for allelic status at the barley (<b>Hordeum</b> <b>vulgare</b> ssp. <b>vulgare</b> <b>L.)</b> vernalization locus, VRN-H 1 By assaying for the presence of all known insertion–deletion polymorphisms thought to be responsible for the difference between spring and winter alleles, this assay directly tests for the presence of functional polymorphism at VRN-H 1 Four of the nine previously recognized VRN-H 1 haplotypes (including both winter alleles) give unique profiles using this assay. The remaining five spring haplotypes share a single profile, indicative of function-altering deletions spanning, or adjacent to, the putative “vernalization critical” region of intron 1. When used in conjunction with a previously published PCR-based assay diagnostic for alleles at VRN-H 2, it was possible to predict growth habit in all the 100 contemporary UK spring and winter lines analyzed in this study. This assay is likely to find application in instances when seasonal growth habit needs to be determined without the time and cost of phenotypic assessment and during marker-assisted selection using conventional and multicross population analysis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHulled barley {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} recovered cereals in European archaeological sites from Roman and medieval periods. In southern France this cereal is common in carbonized contexts such as cultural layers, ditches, pits, hearths, etc. The distinction between the two subspecies, two-rowed (<b>Hordeum</b> <b>vulgare</b> subsp. distichum <b>L.)</b> and six-rowed barley (H.  vulgare subsp. <b>vulgare</b> <b>L.)</b> is usually based on morphological characters. The following criteria can be used to discriminate both subspecies from archaeological remains: the number of fertile spikelets per rachis segments, the linear or horseshoe shape depression of the lemma base, the maximum width of the caryopses and the proportion of twisted grains. The recovery of thousands of caryopses, some clearly twisted, and of rachis segments with sterile spikelets from the site of Petit Clos (Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France) dating to the Roman period suggests that both subspecies were cultivated during this time in southern Gaul. However evidence for two-rowed barley is usually scarce in archaeobotanical reports from Roman and medieval sites. To confirm the presence of two-rowed barley in the carbonized assemblage from Petit Clos and its cultivation, we developed a new method for analysing caryopses shape using geometric morphometrics with landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks. We compared modern reference specimens to the archaeological grains from several excavations from southern France dating from the 1 st to the 11 th century AD. Several varieties of both subspecies were correctly identified in the modern reference sample using GMM, both before and after carbonization. Archaeological specimens could then be accurately identified. The results confirm that both subspecies of barley were cultivated in southern France during the Roman period...|$|R

The analysis of molecular variance for these markers {{indicated that the}} populations were partially differentiated (F ST = 0. 18), and clustered into three geographic areas. Consistent with this population pattern, STRUCTURE analysis allocated individuals from a bulk of all populations into four genetic groups, and these groups also showed geographic patterns. In agreement with other molecular studies in barley, the general level of LD was low (13 % of locus pairs, with P < 0. 01) in the bulk of 337 lines, and decayed steeply with map distance between markers. The partitioning of multilocus associations into various components indicated that genetic drift and founder effects {{played a major role}} in determining the overall genetic makeup of the diversity in these landrace populations, but that epistatic homogenising or diversifying selection was also present. Notably, the variance of the disequilibrium component was relatively high, which implies caution in the pooling of barley lines for association studies. Finally, we compared the analyses of multilocus structure in barley landrace populations with parallel analyses in both composite crosses of barley on the one hand and in natural populations of wild barley on the other. Neither of these serves as suitable mimics of landraces in barley, which require their own study. Overall, the results suggest that these populations can be exploited for LD mapping if population structure is controlled...|$|R

In total, 15 loci and 119 alleles were detected, with an average of 7. 93 alleles per locus. The Polymorphic information content value ranged from 0. 220 to 0. 782 with a mean value of 0. 534. Regarding the growth habit and row type groups, gene diversity was comparatively higher for the spring (0. 616) and six-rowed accessions (0. 616) than for the winter and two- rowed accessions (0. 322 and 0. 478, respectively). Analysis of molecular variance showed that all sources of variation were significant (P < 0. 01), but the between-group component was predominant (76. 85 %) for growth habit and 89. 45 % for row type. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) cluster analysis based on the shared allele distance (DSA) matrix estimated on the SSR data assigned the genotypes into two clusters - the first smaller consisting of the six 6 -rowed spring cultivars and the second comprising six subclusters.

50|$|Foxtail barley is {{distinguished}} from cultivated barley (<b>Hordeum</b> <b>vulgare</b> <b>L.)</b> and Meadow barley (Hordeum brachyantherum) by lemma awn length. H. brachyantherum has awn lengths of 0.5 in; Foxtail barley has lengths of 0.5 - 3 in; and cultivated barley of 10 - 15 cm in length. Once foxtail barley is established, it becomes {{extremely difficult to}} eradicate. Its extensive root systems and aggressive habit, {{as well as its}} ability to tolerate saline soils make it a resilient competitor. It is considered a weed because of this competitive ability and the dangers it poses to wildlife and livestock. While foxtail barley may be palatable for animals in early spring before it flowers, its seed heads, when dry, are very harmful to grazing animals. The awns with upward-pointing barbs become easily attached and embedded in the animal's mouth and face, causing severe irritation, abscesses, and even blindness. Foxtail barley is also host to a number of viruses, and because it harbours wheat rust and blackstem rust, can indirectly affect the development of field crops. Since foxtail barley accumulates high amounts of salt in its leaves and roots, it has the potential of reducing soil salinity. Given foxtail barley's ability to withstand saline soils, it has been identified as having potential for the revegetation of saline mine spoils to reduce erosion. It has also been recommended as a species suitable for wildlife habitat rehabilitation on disturbed lands, but given its other less desirable traits, other natural grass species would be more beneficial.|$|E

40|$|A new cytoplasmic male {{sterility}} in barley (<b>Hordeum</b> <b>vulgare</b> s. <b>l.)</b> is described and designated as msm 2. The cytoplasm was derived from a selection of the wild progenitor of barley (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum). This selection, 79 BS 14 - 3, originates from the Southern Coastal Plain of Israel. The selection 79 BS 14 - 3 has a normal spike fertility in Finland. When 79 BS 14 - 3 was crossed by cv. Adorra, the F 1 displayed partial male fertility and progeny of recurrent backcrosses with cv. Adorra were completely male sterile. Evidently 79 BS 14 - 3 is a carrier of a recessive or semidominant restorer gene of fertility. The dominant restorer gene Rfm 1 a for another cytoplasmic {{male sterility}}, msm 1, is also effective in msm 2 cytoplasm. The different partial fertility restoration properties of msm 2 and msm 1 cause these cytoplasms {{to be regarded as}} being distinct. Seventy spontaneum accessions from Israel have been studied for their capacity to produce F 1 restoration of male fertility both in msm 1 and in msm 2 cytoplasms with a cv.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Wild barley (<b>Hordeum</b> <b>vulgare</b> subsp. spontaneum) {{could be}} a source of useful genes for {{improving}} cultivated barley. The useful genes present in <b>Hordeum</b> <b>vulgare</b> subsp. spontaneum may be new alleles at described loci, or these may be entirely new genes in the sense that there is limited allelic variation at these loci in the cultivated germplasm pool. This research was directed at gene discovery in wild barley and involved two steps: (i) characterization of diversity using genetic markers and (ii) development and characterization of novel germplasm for gene discovery. Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) of known map location were used to survey three representative groups of barley germplasm: a sample of crop progenitor (<b>Hordeum</b> <b>vulgare</b> subsp. spontaneum) accessions, a group of mapping population parents, and a group of varieties and elite breeding lines. The objectives were to determine the informativeness and utility of SSRs in differentiating and classifying the three sets of barley germplasm. Crop progenitors had the highest number of alleles per SSR locus, followed by mapping population parents and elite breeding lines. The cluster analysis indicated a high level of diversity within the crop progenitor accessions and within the mapping population parents. It revealed a much lower level of diversity within the elite breeding germplasm. A set of Recombinant Chromosome Substitution Lines (RCSLs) representing introgressions of <b>Hordeum</b> <b>vulgare</b> subsp. spontaneum genome in to a cultivated barley background were developed using the Advanced Backcross strategy. An accession of <b>Hordeum</b> <b>vulgare</b> subsp. spontaneum was the donor parent and the variety "Harrington" was the recurrent parent.
