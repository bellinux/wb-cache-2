25|$|A second subtype of GEFS+, type 2, is {{the result}} of {{mutations}} in SCN1A, a gene encoding a sodium channel α subunit. There are currently almost 90 known mutations in the SCN1A gene throughout the entirety of the channel (see table 1). These mutations result in almost any imaginable mutation type in the gene, short of duplications. The results of these mutations are highly variable, some producing functional channels while others result in non-functional channels. Some functional channels result in membrane hyperexcitability while others result in hypoexcitability. Most of the functional mutant channels result in hyperexcitability due to decreased frequency dependent rundown. An example of this is the D188V mutation. A 10Hz stimulation of wild-type channels causes current to decrease to approximately 70% of maximum whereas the same stimulation of mutant channels results in rundown to 90% of maximum. This is caused by an expedited recovery from inactivation for mutant channels versus wild-type. The D188V mutant, for example, recovers to 90% maximal current in 200ms while wild-type channels are unable to recover to this degree in >1000ms. Some other functional mutations that lead to hyperexcitability due so by other means, such as decreasing the rate of entrance into the slow <b>inactivated</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

(The [...] "V" [...] stands for [...] "voltage".) [...] An NaV channel has three possible states, known as deactivated, activated, and inactivated. The channel is permeable only to sodium ions when it is in the activated state. When the membrane potential is low, the channel spends most of its time in the deactivated (closed) state. If the membrane potential is raised above a certain level, the channel shows increased probability of transitioning to the activated (open) state. The higher the membrane potential the greater the probability of activation. Once a channel has activated, it will eventually transition to the inactivated (closed) state. It tends then to stay inactivated for some time, but, if the membrane potential becomes low again, the channel will eventually transition back to the deactivated state. During an action potential, most channels of this type go through a cycle deactivated→activated→inactivated→deactivated. This is only the population average behavior, however — an individual channel can in principle make any transition at any time.

Compared to the time course of H+- or Ni 2 +-enhanced slow inactivation at + 50 mV, the onset of resting inactivation induced at − 80 mV with either ion involves a relatively slower process.

50|$|Pilsicainide {{is a drug}} used {{clinically}} in Japan {{to treat}} cardiac arrhythmias. It functions by blocking the fast inward movement of sodium ions through the Nav1.5 sodium channel {{that contributes to the}} rapid depolarization characteristic of phase 0 in the cardiac action potential. Pilsicainide is a pure sodium channel blocker, meaning it does not significantly affect any other cardiac channels including potassium and calcium channels. Pilsicainide binds to a common site on the sodium channel through either intracellular or extracellular application(3). The affinity of pilsicainide for the sodium channel receptor and its rate of binding are dependent {{on the state of the}} channel. It has been proven to have a greater affinity for the receptor in its <b>inactivated</b> <b>state</b> as opposed to resting or open(4), thereby following the modulated receptor hypothesis(5). Binding of pilsicainide selectively inhibits the channel(6), preventing the movement of sodium ions into the cardiac cell. This decreases the rate of depolarization of the cell membrane as well as the action potential amplitude, but has no effect on the overall duration of the action potential(6). Suppression of the depolarization rate is use-dependent(7), and therefore inhibition increases with increased stimulation. Pilsicainide also causes delayed impulse conduction through the myocardium in a dose-dependent manner(8). The effects of pilsicainide have a slow rate of onset and offset resulting in a prolonged recovery time(9). This contributes to its potent blocking activity and its classification as a class 1c antiarrhythmic agent(10).A cardiac arrhythmia includes any abnormal heartbeat and can be manifested as tachycardia, bradycardia, or other irregular rhythms. Pilsicainide has been proven successful in treating both ventricular(11) and supraventricular arrhythmias with few adverse effects(12). It is especially effective in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia(14). It may result from various heart abnormalities or may occur spontaneously in a seemingly healthy individual(15). Atrial fibrillation is characterized by rapid, disorganized electrical impulses in the atria resulting in depolarization of only a small group of myocardial cells. This prevents the atria from undergoing coordinated contraction, instead resulting in small fibrillations of the heart muscle. Re-entry occurs when an impulse does not die after activating the heart but instead returns to the atria and causes re-excitation(16). Simultaneous re-entry of multiple impulses with short wavelengths results in atrial fibrillation(17). Impulse wavelength is the product of the conduction velocity and the effective refractory period. Pilsicainide suppresses atrial conduction velocity but also increases the effective refractory period(18). Its effects on the refractory period are significantly more substantial, and therefore pilsicainide treatment results in an increased wavelength and termination of atrial fibrillation. A single oral dose of pilsicainide effectively restores normal sinus rhythm in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation and a healthy left ventricle. Long-term therapy with pilsicainide is successful in treating chronic atrial fibrillation).|$|E

Like phenytoin, the slow binding rates may explain why LTG effectively inhibits seizure discharges, yet spares most normal neuronal activities...|$|E
40|$|Ca 2 � /calmodulin {{dependent}} {{protein kinase}} (CaMKII) and protein phosphatase 2 B (calcineurin) are key enzymes {{in the regulation}} of synaptic strength, controlling the phosphorylation status of pre- and postsynaptic target proteins. Here, we show that the inactivation gating of the Shaker-related fastinactivating K V channel, K v 1. 4 is controlled by CaMKII and the calcineurin/inhibitor- 1 protein phosphatase cascade. CaMKII phosphorylation of an amino-terminal residue of K V 1. 4 leads to slowing of inactivation gating and accelerated recovery from N-type <b>inactivated</b> <b>states.</b> In contrast, dephosphorylation of this residue induces a fast inactivating mode of K V 1. 4 with time constants of inactivation 5 to 10 times faster compared with the CaMKII-phosphorylated form. Dephosphorylated K V 1. 4 channels also display slowed and partial recovery from inactivation with increased trapping of K V 1. 4 channels in long-absorbing C-type <b>inactivated</b> <b>states.</b> In consequence, dephosphorylated K V 1. 4 displays a markedly increased tendency to undergo cumulative inactivation during repetitive stimulation. The balance between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated K V 1. 4 channels is regulated by changes in intracellular Ca 2 � concentration rendering K V 1. 4 inactivation gating Ca 2 �-sensitive. The reciprocal CaMKII and calcineurin regulation of cumulative inactivation of presynaptic K V 1. 4 may provide a novel mechanism to regulate the critical frequency for presynaptic spike broadening and induction of synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|The {{lymphocyte}} voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv 1. 3, inactivates by a C-type process. We have elucidated {{the molecular}} {{basis for this}} process using a kinetic analysis of wild-type and mutant (A 413 V) Kv 1. 3 homo- and heteromultimeric currents in a mammalian lymphoid expression system. The medians of the measured inactivation time constants for wild-type and A 413 V homotetrameric currents are 204 and 4 ms, respectively. Co-expression of these subunits produces heteromultimeric channels manifesting inactivation kinetics intermediate between those of wild-type and A 413 V homomultimers. We have considered several models in which each subunit acts either independently or cooperatively to produce the observed inactivation kinetics. The cooperative model gives excellent fits to the data for any heteromultimeric composition of subunits, clearly distinguishing it from the independent models. In the cooperative model, the difference in free energy between the open and <b>inactivated</b> <b>states</b> of the channel is invariant with subunit composition and equals approximately 1. 5 kcal/mol. Each subunit contributes equally to the activation free energy for transitions between open and <b>inactivated</b> <b>states,</b> with an A 413 V subunit decreasing the free energy barrier for inactivation (and for recovery from inactivation) by approximately 0. 6 kcal/mol. Our {{results are consistent with}} a physical model in which the outer mouth of the channel constricts during C-type inactivation (G. Yellen, D. Sodickson, T. Chen, and M. E. Jurman, 1994, Biophys. J. 66 : 1068 - 1075) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh voltage-activated Ca 2 + channel {{expression}} and gating {{is controlled by}} their β subunits. Although the sites of interaction are known at the atomic level, how β modulates gating remains to be determined. Using a chimeric approach, β subunit regulation was conferred to a low voltage-activated channel. Regulation was dependent on a rigid linker connecting the α 1 interaction domain to IS 6. Chimeric channels also revealed a role for IS 6 in channel gating. Taken together, these results support a direct coupling model where β subunits alter movements in IS 6 that occur as the channel transits between closed, open, and <b>inactivated</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
