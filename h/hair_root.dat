40|$|Root-soil {{contact is}} an {{important}} factor for uptake of a less mobile soil nutrient such as phosphorus (P) by crop plants. <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> can substantially increase root-soil contact. Identification of crop cultivars with more and longer <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> can, therefore, be useful for increasing P uptake in low input agriculture. We studied the <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cvs. Kosack, Foreman, Kraka) and barley cultivars (Hordeum vulgare L. cvs. Angora, Hamu, Alexis, Canut) in relation to P depletion from the rhizosphere in three soils of different P levels (0. 45, 1. 1 and 1. 6 mmoles P kg 1 soil; extracted with 0. 5 M NaHCO 3). <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> were measured in solution culture having nutrients and concentration similar to soil solution. <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> of Kraka were much longer (1. 27 0. 26 mm) and denser (38 3) <b>hairs</b> mm 1 <b>root)</b> than those of Kosack which had shorter (0. 49 0. 2 mm) and fewer (24 3) <b>hairs</b> mm 1 <b>root)</b> <b>root</b> <b>hairs.</b> <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> increased <b>root</b> surface area (RSA) of Kraka by 341 %. The increase with Foreman was 142 % and with Kosack it was 95 %. For winter barley, the length (1. 1 0. 3 mm) and density (30 1 <b>hairs</b> mm 1 <b>root)</b> of <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> of Hamu differed from <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> length (0. 52 0. 18 mm) and density (27 1 <b>hairs</b> mm 1 <b>root)</b> of Angora. <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> of spring barley cultivars differed in length (Canut 1. 0 0. 24 mm; Alexis 0. 64 0. 19 mm) but not in density (Canut 31 1, Alexis 30 2 <b>hairs</b> mm 1 <b>root).</b> <b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> diameter (12 1 m) did not differ among the cultivars. <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> increased RSA of Canut by 245 %, Hamu by 237 %, Alexis by 143...|$|R
30|$|<b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> {{are long}} tubular outgrowths that {{form on the}} surface of {{specialized}} epidermal cells. They are required for the uptake of nutrients and water, particularly in upland conditions. <b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> development can be divided into three phases: cell specification, initiation, and elongation (Cavell and Grierson 2000). The outgrowth of <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> is strictly regulated by genetic and environmental factors. The first root-hairless mutant reported in rice was rh 2 (Suzuki et al. 2003). An exogenous application of NAA could induce very short <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> in rh 2, suggesting that the absence of <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> in this mutant may be due to a shortage of endogenous auxin; however, the gene has not yet been identified. OsWOX 3 A was reported to control <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation through the regulation of auxin transport genes (Yoo et al. 2013), further suggesting that auxin is required for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation. <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> are initiated normally in the Oscellulose synthase-like d 1 (Oscsld 1) mutant; however, this gene, which is expressed only in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cells, is required for their elongation (Kim et al. 2007; You et al. 2011). OsRHL 1, a bHLH transcription factor expressed specifically in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cells, also regulates <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation in rice; the loss-of-function mutants Osroot hairless 1 – 1 (Osrhl 1 – 1) and Osrhl 1 – 2 produced very short <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> without affecting <b>root</b> length or the number of LRs and adventitious roots, suggesting that OsRHL 1 functions specifically in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation (Ding et al. 2009). Furthermore, OsFORMIN HOMOLOGY 1 (OsFH 1) was also found to regulate rice <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation; the loss-of-function mutant osfh 1 exhibited <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> defects when grown submerged in solution, but produced normal <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> in contact with the air. This <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> phenotype could not be rescued by an external supply of hormones or carbohydrates (Huang et al. 2013 a). It is well known that <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> growth requires extensive cell wall modification, and recent research revealed that OsEXPA 17, encoding an expansin involved in cell wall remodelling, plays a crucial role in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation. OsEXPA 17 is exclusively expressed in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> cells, and its null mutant forms short <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> (Yu et al. 2011). Another rice gene, OsSEC 14 -NODULIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1 (OsSNDP 1), encoding a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP), promotes <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation via phospholipid signalling and metabolism, suggesting that the mediation of these processes by PITP is required for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation in rice (Huang et al. 2013 b). Additionally, transgenic rice overexpressing STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 10 (SAPK 10) produced longer <b>root</b> <b>hairs,</b> while plants overexpressing OsABI-LIKE 2 (OsABIL 2) had attenuated ABA signalling and shorter <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> (Wang et al. 2017), suggesting that ABA is also responsible for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a procedure for testing iduronate sulfatase, the enzyme deficient in Hunter syndrome, in single <b>hair</b> <b>roots.</b> Beta-Hexosaminidase {{was used as the}} reference enzyme. The ratio of iduronate sulfatase to beta [...] hexosaminidase, expressed in arbitrary units of activity, is near zero for Hunter patients and greater than 0. 6 in almost all roots of normal individuals. <b>Hair</b> <b>roots</b> of Hunter heterozygotes show a characteristic continuum of activity ratios, ranging from totally deficient up to and including the normal range. The results are consistent with the origin of <b>hair</b> <b>roots</b> from a small number of progenitor cells which obey the Lyon hypothesis.

50|$|The {{change in}} hair color occurs when melanin {{ceases to be}} {{produced}} in the <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> and new hairs grow in without pigment. The stem cells {{at the base of}} hair follicles produce melanocytes, the cells that produce and store pigment in hair and skin. The death of the melanocyte stem cells causes the onset of graying. It remains unclear why the stem cells of one hair follicle may die well over a decade before those in adjacent follicles less than a millimeter apart.|$|E
50|$|Care of {{the hair}} and care of the scalp skin may appear separate, but are {{actually}} intertwined because hair grows from beneath the skin. The living parts of hair (hair follicle, <b>hair</b> <b>root,</b> root sheath, and sebaceous gland) are beneath the skin, while the actual hair shaft which emerges (the cuticle which covers the cortex and medulla) has no living processes. Damage or changes made to the visible hair shaft cannot be repaired by a biological process, though much {{can be done to}} manage hair and ensure that the cuticle remains intact.|$|E
50|$|If hair is pinned too tightly, or {{the whole}} updo slips causing {{pulling on the}} hair in the {{follicle}} at the <b>hair</b> <b>root,</b> it can cause aggravation to the hair follicle and result in headaches.

40|$|<b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> are {{important}} sites for nutrient uptake, especially in P limiting conditions. Here we provide first insights into <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> {{development for the}} diverse root types of rice grown under different conditions, and show the first in situ images of rice <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> in intact soil. Roots of plants grown in upland fields produced short <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> that showed little responsiveness to P deficiency, and had a higher <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> density in the high P condition. These results were reproducible in rhizoboxes under greenhouse conditions. Synchrotron-based in situ analysis of <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> in intact soil further confirmed this pattern of <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation. In contrast, plants grown in nutrient solution produced more and longer <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> in low P conditions, but these were unequally distributed among the different root types. While nutrient solution-grown main <b>roots</b> had longer <b>hairs</b> compared to upland field-grown main roots, second order lateral roots did not form any <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> in nutrient solution-grown plants. Furthermore, <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation for plants grown in flooded lowland fields revealed few similarities with those grown in nutrient solution, thus defining nutrient solution as a possible measure of maximal, but not natural <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> development. By combining <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> length and density as a measure for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> impact on the whole soil-grown root system we show that lateral roots provided the majority of <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> surface...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{benefits}} to waxing versus {{other forms of}} hair removal. It is an effective method to remove large amounts of hair at one time. It is a long-lasting method, as hair in waxed areas will not grow back for two to eight weeks. When hair is shaved or removed by depilatory cream, the hair is removed at the surface rather than the <b>hair</b> <b>root.</b> Within a few days, the hair can reappear back at the surface. With these methods, hair tends to grow back in a rough stubble. Areas that are repeatedly waxed {{over long periods of}} time often exhibit regrowth that is softer.|$|E
40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation in plants, but the regulatory mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that exogenous ABA can promote rice <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation. Transgenic rice overexpressing SAPK 10 (Stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 10) had longer root hairs; rice plants overexpressing OsABIL 2 (OsABI-Like 2) had attenuated ABA signaling and shorter <b>root</b> <b>hairs,</b> suggesting that the effect of ABA on <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation depends on the conserved PYR/PP 2 C/SnRK 2 ABA signaling module. Treatment of the DR 5 -GUS and OsPIN-GUS lines with ABA and an auxin efflux inhibitor showed that ABA-induced <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation depends on polar auxin transport. To examine the transcriptional response to ABA, we divided rice root tips into three regions: short <b>root</b> <b>hair,</b> long <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> and <b>root</b> tip zones; and conducted RNA-seq analysis with or without ABA treatment. Examination of genes involved in auxin transport, biosynthesis and metabolism indicated that ABA promotes auxin biosynthesis and polar auxin transport in the root tip, which may lead to auxin accumulation in the long <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> zone. Our findings shed light on how ABA regulates <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation through crosstalk with auxin biosynthesis and transport to orchestrate plant development...|$|R
40|$|Plant <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> {{increase}} the <b>root</b> surface {{to enhance the}} uptake of sparingly soluble and immobile nutrients, such as the essential nutrient phosphorus, from the soil. Here, <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> traits and the response to scarce local phosphorus concentration were studied in 166 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana using split plates. <b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> density and length were correlated, but highly variable among accessions. Surprisingly, the well-known increase in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> density under low phosphorus was mostly restricted to genotypes that had less and shorter <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> under P sufficient conditions.

5000|$|Central {{centrifugal}} cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), {{also referred}} to as hot comb alopecia and follicular degeneration syndrome, is a type of alopecia first noticed in African Americans in the 1950s and reported by LoPresti et al. in 1968 as a result of application of petrolatum followed by a stove-heated iron comb.

40|$|Summary: Kinetic {{properties}} of human <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were studied {{in order to}} optimize the assay of these enzymes in lysates from single hair roots. In contrast to previously reported methods, an excess of purified 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase {{was added to the}} glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase reaction mixtures, thus allowing a more exact quantification of glucose- 6 -phos-phate dehydrogenase activity. Although enzyme histochemical techniques suggest a similar distribution of <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, enzyme assays on <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> segments after microdissection nevertheless indicate differences in the distribution of these enzymes. Upon storage a gradual drop in the activity of both <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> enzymes was found, but the rate of decrease in enzyme activity was about equal: the enzyme activity ratio was, therefore, not affected.

Objective: To analyze {{the differences in the}} extracted DNA quantity from various <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> phases. Methods: The study was an observational study with cross sectional design using samples of hair roots (n = 15) that includes three phases of <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> growth, namely the anagen phase (n = 5), the catagen phase (n = 5), and the telogen phase (n = 5). The classification of the <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> phases is done through microscopic examination. All samples were extracted with Chelex, the DNA was quantified using NanoDrop spectrophotometer.

30|$|The {{importance}} of <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> traits for P uptake {{is well established}} (Lynch 2011; Brown et al. 2012 a), and <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> are also believed to be important for uptake of other nutrients (Drew and Nye 1969; Gahoonia et al. 2006; Samal et al. 2010), for rhizosheath formation, and for penetration of hard soils (Brown et al. 2012 b; Haling et al. 2013; Lynch et al. 2014). It {{has been suggested that}} <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> could make an important contribution to the efficiency of P uptake, which, together with root size, explains a high proportion of the variation in P acquisition and growth for rice (Mori et al. 2016). The rice genotypes tested here demonstrated some genetic variation for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> length and <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> density (approximately 1.5 and 1.3 -fold, respectively), indicating potential for breeding this trait for improved P-acquisition efficiency. <b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> density was positively correlated with yield after seedling-stage drought in direct-seeded upland conditions (Sandhu et al. 2015). Rice <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> are short compared to other crops. In these experiments, mean <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> length was 0.23  mm, while <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> lengths ranged from 0.32 to 0.83  mm in common bean (Miguel et al. 2015), 0.40 – 1.34  mm in barley (Gahoonia and Nielsen 2004) and 0.62 – 4.07  mm in maize (Zhu et al. 2005 b). While this leaves plenty of room for improvement, breeding for <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> traits will be challenging since <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> development depends strongly on the growth environment. A recent study showed that rice <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> length and density varied among root classes and with growth medium (Nestler et al. 2016). <b>Root</b> <b>hairs</b> on plants grown in nutrient solution were much longer, denser and more responsive to low P than <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> on plants grown in soil in either rhizoboxes or in the field (Nestler et al. 2016). In our experiment using buffered P in a sand-vermiculite medium, nodal <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> were about 30  % longer than <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> found on main (nodal) roots grown in the greenhouse in a P-fixing Andosol, but about 40  % shorter than <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> from plants grown in nutrient solution, and we found a 15  % average increase in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> length with low P compared to 10  % in rhizoboxes with P-fixing Andosol (Nestler et al. 2016). Nester etl al. found that <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> density was increased with low P only in nutrient solution, and was unaffected or reduced by low P in rhizoboxes and an upland field, while we found an average of 10  % increase in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> density with low P. Clearly, the response of rice <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> to low P depends strongly on the growth medium, and the use of soil or buffered P provides a more realistic assessment of <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> phenotypes than hydroponic culture.|$|R

Samples from two mothers of Hunter syndrome patients, one an obligate heterozygote, had lower average iduronate sulfatase activity than the normal mean, and a significant number of hair roots had activity in the pathognomic range. A third mother showed a normal distribution of enzyme activity, and no hair roots were in the range of those from an affected individual. These results are similar to studies on the distribution of other X-linked enzymes in individual <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> samples from heterozygotes. This suggests that <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> iduronate sulfatase assessment is useful in the detection of Hunter syndrome carrier status, but further refinement of the test system is necessary...|$|E
40|$|The fragile X {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common form of inherited mental retardation in humans, caused by an expansion of the cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR 1) gene located on the X chromosome. Antibody tests have been developed to identify fragile X patients, based on the presence or absence of fragile mental retardation protein (FMRP) in both lymphocytes and hair roots. The objective of this study was to compare correlations of <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> and lymphocyte FMRP expression with cognitive functioning in female rural area probands carrying the full mutation. Thirty females (normal, premutation, or full mutation) were selected from Indonesian fragile X families and were tested for FMRP expression in lymphocytes and hair roots using the FMRP antibody test. Subject genotype was determined by Southern blot analysis, and IQ equivalent by Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices. Statistical analysis was by Pearson correlation. FMRP expression in blood lymphocytes was relatively higher than that in hair roots, but <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> FMRP expression was strongly correlated with cognitive functioning in female full mutation carriers (r= 0. 64, p= 0. 015), whereas no significant correlation between lymphocyte FMRP and cognitive functioning was found (r= 0. 31, p= 0. 281). Around 14 % of subjects had a normal and 7 % a borderline IQ level, while 79 % had mild mental impairment. In conclusion, <b>hair</b> <b>root</b> FMRP expression may be a useful marker for identification of fragile X full mutation females...|$|E
40|$|Genetic and {{physiological}} studies implicate the phytohormones auxin and ethylene in <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> development. To {{learn more about}} the role of these compounds, we have examined the <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> phenotype of a number of auxin- and ethylene-related mutants. In a previous study, Masucci and Schiefelbein (1996) showed that neither the auxin response mutations aux 1 and axr 1 nor the ethylene response mutations etr 1 and ein 2 {{have a significant effect on}} <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> initiation. In this study, we found that mutants deficient in either auxin or ethylene response have a pronounced effect on <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> length. Treatment of wildtype, axr 1 and etr 1 seedlings with the synthetic auxin, 2, 4 -D, or the ethylene precursor ACC, led to the development of longer <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> than untreated seedlings. Furthermore, axr 1 seedlings grown in the presence of ACC produce ectopic <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> and an unusual pattern of long <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> followed by regions that completely lack <b>root</b> <b>hairs.</b> These studies indicate that both auxin and ethylene are required for normal <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> elongation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Root</b> <b>hair</b> {{formation}} {{is an important}} model with which to study cell patterning and differentiation in higher plants. Ethylene and auxin are critical regulators of <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> development. The role of jasmonates (JAs) was ex-amined in Arabidopsis <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> development {{as well as their}} interactions with ethylene in this process. The results have shown that both methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and jasmonic acid (JA) have a pronounced effect on promoting <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation. However, the effect of MeJA and JA on <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation was blocked by ethylene inhibitors Ag 1 or aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG). The stimulatory effects of MeJA and JA were also diminished in ethylene-insensitive mutants etr 1 - 1 and etr 1 - 3. Furthermore, the JA biosynthesis inhibitors ibuprofen and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) sup-pressed 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) -induced <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation, and decreased the <b>root</b> <b>hairs</b> in seedlings of the ethylene over-producing mutant eto 1 - 1. These results suggested that JAs pro-mote <b>root</b> <b>hair</b> formation, through an interaction with ethylene. Key words: Ethylene, jasmonates, <b>root</b> <b>hair...</b>|$|R
