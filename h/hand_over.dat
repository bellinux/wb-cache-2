40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a Human-Robot Interaction study that investigates the issues of participants’ preferences {{in terms of the}} robot approach direction (directionRAD), robot base approach interaction distance (distanceRBAID), robot <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> <b>hand</b> distance (distanceRHOHD), robot <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> arm gesture (gestureRHOAG), and the coordination of both the robot approaching and gestureRHOAG {{in the context of a}} robot <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> an object to a seated person. The results from this study aim at informing the development of a Human Aware Manipulation Planner. Twelve participants with some previous human-robot interaction experience were recruited for the trial. The results show that a majority of the participants prefer the robot to approach from the front and hand them a can of soft drink in the front sector of their personal zone. The robot <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> <b>hand</b> position had the most influence on determining from where the robot should approach (i. e distanceRAD). Legibility and perception of risk seem to be the deciding factor on how participants choose their preferred robot arm-base approach coordination for <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> a can. Detailed discussions of the results conclude the paper...|$|R
