40|$|The {{performance}} of mineral <b>grinding</b> <b>circuits</b> strongly affects downstream {{processes such as}} flotation and cyanidation, and grinding is often the single most expensive unit operation. Hence, optimization efforts must be made {{on a regular basis}} to maintain and improve its technical and economic efficiency. The focus of this thesis, off-line optimization of <b>grinding</b> <b>circuits,</b> is based on the mathematical modelling of process units such as ball mills and hydrocyclones. To complete an optimization task, a mineral process engineer must possess skills and knowledge pertaining to the different stages involved in such effort, available software tools and interpretation of results. A prototype knowledge-based system, <b>Grinding</b> <b>Circuits</b> Optimization Supervisor (GCOS), has been developed in CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System) to assist a non-expert mineral process engineer to do off-line optimization studies. Due to the importance of the correct estimation of back-calculated mill selection function in grinding optimization studies, a spline curve fitting algorithm has been used to improve their quality.

40|$|A <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuit</b> forms {{a crucial}} part in the {{energy-intensive}} comminution process of extracting valuable metals and minerals from mined ore. The ability to control the <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuit</b> is of primary importance to achieve the desired product specification with regards to quality and production rate. In order to achieve control objectives an accurate dynamic model of the milling circuit is required. Phenomenological models are preferred over linear-time-invariant models since the latter cannot describe the non-linear behaviour of the process. However, the available phenomenological models of <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuits</b> are usually complex, use large parameter sets and are mostly aimed towards steady-state design of <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuits.</b> This study investigates simplified non-linear dynamic models of <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuits</b> suitable for process controller design. In {{the first part of}} this study, the number of size classes in a cumulative rates model of a <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuit</b> is reduced to determine the minimum number required to provide a reasonably accurate model of the circuit for process control. Each reduced size class set is used to create a non-linear cumulative rates model which is linearized to design a linear model predictive controller. The accuracy of a model is determined by the ability of the corresponding model predictive controller to control important process variables in the <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuit</b> as represented by the full non-linear cumulative rates model. The second part of the study validates a simple and novel non-linear model of a run-of-mine <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuit</b> developed for process control and estimation purposes. This model is named the Hulbert-model and makes use of the minimum number of states and parameters necessary to produce responses that are qualitatively accurate. It consists of separate feeder, mill, sump and hydrocyclone modules that can be connected to model different circuit configurations. The model uses five states: rocks, solids, fines, water and steel balls. Rocks are defined as too large to be discharged from the mill, whereas solids, defined as particles small enough to leave the mill, consist of out-of-specification coarse ore and in-specification fine ore fractions. The model incorporates a unique prediction of the rheology of the slurry within the mill. A new hydrocyclone model is also presented. The Hulbert-model parameters are fitted to an existing plant’s sampling campaign data and a step-wise procedure is given to fit the model to steady-state data. Simulation test results of the model are compared to sampling campaign data of the same plant at different steady-state conditions. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

Over the past three years, metallurgical sampling has been performed at the Laguna Seca concentrator to calibrate both the JKSimMet and JKSimFloat grinding and flotation simulators. In the past, the calibrated simulators have been used to predict the effect of changes in operating conditions in the grinding and flotation circuits separately.

This was achieved by using an integrated grinding and flotation simulation.

40|$|Economic {{performance}} assessment (EPA) {{of control}} systems is receiving increasing attention in both academia and industry. It addresses {{the estimation of}} the potential benefits resulting from control upgrade projects and monitoring and improvement of economic performance of the control system. Economic performance of control systems can often be related to crucial controlled variables dynamically and when controlled variables move away from an optimal operating point either more profit will be made or more cost will be incurred. This relation can be modelled by performance functions (PFs). When the multivariate nature of a process’s economic model is not considered, PFs of different controlled variables {{are referred to as}} individual performance functions. Otherwise, PFs of dependent controlled variables are referred to as joint performance functions. PFs {{play an important role in}} the latest techniques of EPA. There appears, however, to be no systematic method for developing PFs. The lack of such a method restrains further research into EPA, as without well-established PFs an EPA cannot be conducted smoothly and therefore cannot effectively support decision-making for management. The development of PFs is a bottleneck in the further research into EPA. Furthermore, the multivariate nature of processes has not been taken into account sufficiently as far as the relevant literature is concerned, which hampers the accuracy of PFs and accordingly the accuracy of economic assessment results. The contributions of this thesis lie in the following aspects: • A methodology for developing PFs is proposed, based on the PF development for an electric arc furnace, a <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuit</b> and a stage of a bleach plant. • A comprehensive case study of an EPA of three controllers of a <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuit</b> is conducted using a newly published framework to show the significance of PFs and how to perform an EPA systematically. • The current practice and guidelines on the control and functional/economic performance assessment of <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuits</b> are captured using a survey study. The multivariate nature of an electric arc furnace’s economic model is investigated and joint performance functions are built based on individual performance functions. A multivariate economic assessment is conducted that shows how joint performance functions can help to provide a more accurate estimate of the economic performance of a controlled process. A web-based survey study on <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuits</b> in mineral processing industries is conducted. One of its objectives is to obtain general PFs of <b>grinding</b> <b>circuits.</b> The survey results provide instructive insight into the PFs of <b>grinding</b> <b>circuits.</b> Furthermore, an in-depth literature review is conducted and the relationship between the product’s particle size distribution of <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuits</b> and mineral recovery in downstream flotation circuits is revealed. The PFs of a <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuit</b> being considered are formed, based on the survey results and literature study. An investigation into the PF development of a stage of a bleach plant is performed and crucial ideas used for their development are abstracted. A methodology for developing PFs for the EPA of control systems is then proposed by synthesising the methods used in the PF development described above. This methodology mainly includes the following stages: Stage 1 : Determine information required for PF development. • Process operation and control understanding. • Process economics understanding. Stage 2 : Gain required information on PF development. • PF-related information elicitation using survey research. • PF-related information available in the literature, including textbooks, journal papers, conference papers. • PF-related information from plant tests. Stage 3 : Obtain suitable performance measures. Stage 4 : Make suitable assumptions. Stage 5 : Determine PFs. Stage 6 : Develop Joint PFs. An economic assessment of three controllers (a nonlinear model predictive controller, a decentralized controller and three single-loop proportional-integral-derivative controllers) of the considered <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuit</b> is conducted, using an EPA framework published recently to show the central role of PFs in the EPA and how to perform an EPA systematically. The circuit’s PFs, developed as described above, are used for the assessment. The EPA also shows that the improvement in the economic performance with the nonlinear model predictive controller mainly results from the improvement of the operating point and the controlled variables’ variation reduction only contributes a small part to the overall improvement, due to the characteristic of the PF of the circuit’s product particle size distribution. In addition, a web-based survey study is conducted and the current practice and guidelines on the control and functional/economic performance assessment of <b>grinding</b> mill <b>circuits</b> are captured. The questionnaire used for the study includes five segments. The first part identifies the respondents and the second part is intended to obtain background information on the milling circuits.

The observers make use of real-time continuous measurements commonly available on industrial plants. Simulation results show that control objectives {{can be achieved by}} the controller despite the presence of measurement noise and disturbances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Gekko Systems InLine Pressure Jig is {{a unique}} and {{efficient}} gravity separation device, which has found {{a wide variety of}} applications within the mining industry. The unit was originally developed in Australia for recovery of placer gold. The IPJ very quickly moved into the recovery of gold in <b>grinding</b> <b>circuits</b> given the unit’s low water consumption and capital cost benefits. In the late 1990 ’s research into the use of the IPJ in diamonds was commenced envisaging a number of potential benefits including security, low cost performance and simplicity of operation. Some of the advantages and applications of the IPJ in the recovery of diamonds including actual operating plant experience are covered in this paper. Other potential applications {{and the use of the}} IPJ for environmental rehabilitation are also discussed...|$|R
