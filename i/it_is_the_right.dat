5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing to do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At {{the conclusion of the}} episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired.|$|E
25|$|The G2/M {{checkpoint}} {{is where}} the cell ensures that it has enough cytoplasm and phospholipids for two daughter cells. But sometimes more importantly, it checks to see if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time to replicate. There are some situations where many cells need to all replicate simultaneously (for example, a growing embryo should have a symmetric cell distribution until it reaches the mid-blastula transition). This is done by controlling the G2/M checkpoint.|$|E
25|$|In {{the rest}} of the book Ehrlich {{discusses}} things which readers can do to help. This is focused primarily on changing public opinion to create pressure on politicians to enact the policies he suggests, which he believed were not politically possible in 1968. At {{the end of the book}} he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only be better off if it follows his prescriptions, so that even if he is incorrect <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> course of action.|$|E

25|$|Although 5 to 30% of South Koreans {{have eaten}} dog meat {{at least once}} in their lifetime, only a small {{percentage}} of the population eats it regularly. There is a large group of Korean people that are against the practice of eating dog meat. There is also a large population of people in South Korea that do not eat or enjoy the meat, but do feel strongly that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of others to do so. There is a smaller group of pro-dog cuisine people in South Korea who want to popularize the consumption of dog in Korea and the rest of the world, considering it to be part of the traditional culture of Korea with a long history worth preserving.|$|E
25|$|Heap leach is {{significantly}} cheaper than traditional milling processes. The low costs allow for lower grade ore to be economically feasible (given that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> type of ore body). Environmental {{law requires that}} the surrounding ground water is continually monitored for possible contamination. The mine {{will also have to}} have continued monitoring even after the shutdown of the mine. In the past mining companies would sometimes go bankrupt, leaving the responsibility of mine reclamation to the public. Recent additions to the mining law require that companies set aside the money for reclamation before the beginning of the project. The money will be held by the public to insure adherence to environmental standards if the company were to ever go bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|The {{certified}} scuba diver {{is expected}} to be able to assess what type of diving exposure suit is suitable for the planned dive, and to check that it is in safe usable condition, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> size, and to dress correctly in it. Entry level skills usually cover wet suits, but in countries where the water and/or weather conditions are very cold, dry suit skills may be considered an entry level skill. In other parts of the world, dry suit skills are considered a specialty skill. Where dry suits are used, the skills of using the dry suit safely during a dive are also necessary. These include equalizing, buoyancy control, inversion recovery, emergency venting and blowup recovery. Recreational divers trained in warm tropical waters may have no skills in the use of diving suits.|$|E

25|$|Selena {{returns to}} the {{department}} in 2004, having married since her last meeting with Harry. When she is stabbed in the hospital car park, Harry realises he still has feelings for her, but Selena cuts him off {{as he tries to}} tell her. Harry begins a relationship with nurse Ellen Zitek (Georgina Bouzova), who becomes pregnant. Harry proposes, believing <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing to do, but Ellen turns him down. It transpires that Ellen had a cancerous molar pregnancy. She is later hit by a motorbike and dies, leaving Harry distraught. He decides to go into politics when the department is threatened with closure, winning the local by-election. Following his last shift at the hospital, Harry and Selena sleep together. Jealous corporate director Nathan Spencer (Ben Price) deletes text messages Harry sends to Selena, leading her to believe their night together was a mistake.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of Book One describes which Armenians decide on resistance and which on {{cooperating with the}} deportation order. Bagradian camps out {{with his family and}} friends on Musa Dagh, to ensure that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> place to make a stand. Those who decide to resist, dig up a cache of rifles left over from the revolution of 1908, when they were allies of the Young Turks and subsequently bury their church bells, so that these do not fall into Turkish hands. Eventually the Ottoman military police, the dreaded saptiehs, arrive led by the red-haired müdir. They instruct the Armenians to prepare for deportations—- and then leave after beating Ter Haigasun and Bagradian. Instead of complying, the 6,000 Armenians march with everything they can carry, their animals and their weapons to a plateau on Musa Dagh. Bagradian hangs behind and observes the wailing women and the other graveyard folk—- who represent the old ways and sympathetic magic of pagan Armenia—- sacrifice a goat. Its meaning is propitious as well as cautionary. The chapter ends with Bagradian helping Krikor carry the last volumes of his magnificent if eclectic library to the Damlayik, the plateau the Armenians have chosen as their refuge.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{large and}} vocal group of Koreans (consisting {{of a number of}} animal welfare groups) who are against the {{practice}} of eating dogs. Popular television shows like 'I Love Pet' have documented, in 2011 for instance, the continued illegal sale of dog meat and slaughtering of dogs in suburban areas. The program also televised illegal dog farms and slaughterhouses, showing the unsanitary and horrific conditions of caged dogs, several of which were visibly sick with severe eye infections and malnutrition. However, despite this growing awareness, there remain some in Korea that do not eat or enjoy the meat, but do feel that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of others to do so, along with a smaller but still vocal group of pro-dog cuisine people who want to popularize the consumption of dog in Korea {{and the rest of the}} world. A group of pro-dog meat individuals attempted to promote and publicize the consumption of dog meat worldwide during the run-up to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by Japan and South Korea, which prompted retaliation from animal rights campaigners and prominent figures such as Brigitte Bardot to denounce the practice. Opponents of dog meat consumption in South Korea are critical of the eating of dog meat, as some dogs are beaten, burnt or hanged to make their meat more tender.|$|E

500|$|The Ushers' Club {{consists}} of thirty or less {{men of the}} parish. They are chosen to join the club by {{the authority of the}} church. All members are required to do their job as [...] "ushers" [...] during Mass. This job entails showing people to available seats, telling parishioners when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time to rise and get in line for communion, and collecting the monetary offerings of the parishioners during the presenting of the gifts to the altar. Members of the Ushers' Club also serve the church by volunteering their time and labor at the social activities of the parish.|$|E

[...] Ex-Arch Enemy guitarist Fredrik Åkesson replaced Lindgren, as Åkerfeldt explained [...] "Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter. In my opinion he's one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden. We all get along great as we've known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus-like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth." ...|$|E
500|$|Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is {{the bright}} and talented {{newcomer}} to Los Angeles, described as [...] "wholesome, optimistic, determined {{to take the}} town by storm", and [...] "absurdly naïve". Her perkiness and intrepid approach to helping Rita because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> {{thing to do is}} reminiscent of Nancy Drew for reviewers. Her entire persona at first is an apparent cliché of small-town naïveté. But it is Betty's identity, or loss of it, that appears to be the focus of the film. For one critic, Betty performed the role of the film's consciousness and unconscious. Naomi Watts, who modeled Betty on Doris Day, Tippi Hedren and Kim Novak, observed that Betty is a thrill-seeker, someone [...] "who finds herself in a world she doesn't belong in and is ready to take on a new identity, even if it's somebody else's". This has also led one theorist to conclude that since Betty had naïvely, yet eagerly entered the Hollywood system, she had become a [...] "complicit actor" [...] who had [...] "embraced the very structure that" [...] destroyed her. In an explanation of her development of the Betty character, Watts stated: ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of wordplay used in cryptics. One is {{straightforward}} definition substitution using parts of a word. For example, in one puzzle by Mel Taub, the answer IMPORTANT is given the clue [...] "To bring worker into the country may prove significant". The explanation is that to import means [...] "to bring into the country", the [...] "worker" [...] is a worker ant, and [...] "significant" [...] means important. Here, [...] "significant" [...] is the straight definition (appearing here {{at the end of}} the clue), [...] "to bring worker into the country" [...] is the wordplay definition, and [...] "may prove" [...] serves to link the two. Note that in a cryptic clue, there is almost always only one answer that fits both the definition and the wordplay, so that when one sees the answer, one knows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> answer—although it can sometimes be a challenge to figure out why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> answer. A good cryptic clue should provide a fair and exact definition of the answer, while at the same time being deliberately misleading.|$|E
