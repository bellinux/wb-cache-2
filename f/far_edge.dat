25|$|Hull kicked-off the 133rd FA Cup Final and {{dominated}} possession {{for the opening}} stages. Barely four minutes into the game, Hull won a corner that was crossed in by Stephen Quinn to find Tom Huddlestone {{on the edge of}} the penalty area; Huddlestone tried a volley that went into the path of James Chester, who tapped it in from close range to give Hull City an early lead. The high tempo with which Hull started the game overwhelmed Arsenal, and four minutes after the first goal, they scored again. Ahmed Elmohamady received a free kick and crossed it in to the penalty area. This caused controversy as Arsenal believed he had taken the free kick several yards in front of where the foul was committed. Nevertheless, the ball was picked up on the <b>far</b> <b>edge</b> of the penalty area by Quinn, who got past Aaron Ramsey and crossed it in to the goalmouth, where it was headed towards goal by centre-back Alex Bruce. Arsenal goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański parried it out to Hull captain and fellow centre-back Curtis Davies, who fired the ball into the far bottom corner of the goal. Hull almost scored a third goal moments later, when a header from Bruce was headed off the goal line by Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs. Instead, it was Arsenal who scored the next goal; in the 16th minute, they won a free kick {{on the edge of the}} Hull penalty area, which Santi Cazorla fired over the Hull wall and into the top corner of the goal. For the rest of the first half, chances were scarce and Hull maintained their lead into the half-time interval.|$|E

[...] The cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture, with a 9-mm handgun and ammunition beside her on the floor.

2500|$|Having {{successfully}} {{lifted the}} Siege of Chattanooga, General Grant now resolved on a double envelopment of Bragg's army, wherein Major General William T.

The contest kicked off on the morning of November 24, as Hooker drove Confederate forces from Lookout Mountain in the so-called [...] "Battle Above the Clouds," [...] while Sherman crossed the Tennessee River and took up positions along what he thought was the <b>far</b> <b>edge</b> of Missionary Ridgeonly to learn that he had occupied a nearby hill, called Billy Goat Hill, instead.

2500|$|The {{first stage}} in the British plan was a preparatory attack on the German {{positions}} south of Ypres at Messines Ridge. The Germans on the ridge had observation over Ypres and unless it was captured, observed enfilade artillery-fire could be fired against a British attack from the salient further north. Since mid-1915, the British had been mining under the German positions on the ridge and by June 1917, 21 mines had been filled with nearly [...] of explosives. The Germans knew the British were mining and had taken counter-measures but they were surprised at {{the extent of the}} British effort. Two of the mines failed to detonate but [...] off on 7 June, at [...] British Summer Time. The final objectives were largely gained before dark and the British had fewer losses than the expected [...] the initial attack. As the infantry advanced over the <b>far</b> <b>edge</b> of the ridge, German artillery and machine-guns east of the ridge opened fire and the British artillery was less able to suppress them. The attack removed the Germans from the dominating ground on the southern face of the Ypres salient, which the 4th Army had held since the First Battle of Ypres in 1914.|$|E
