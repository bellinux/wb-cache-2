40|$|Candida albicans, {{clinically}} {{the most}} important human fungal pathogen, rapidly develops resistance to antifungal drugs. The acquisition of resistance {{has been linked to}} various types of genome changes. As part of an ongoing study of this problem, we investigated mutation, genome stability and <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition</b> in C. albicans strains with deletions in the base excision repair (BER) genes NTG 1, APN 1 and OGG 1, and in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes RAD 2 and RAD 10. The BER mutants did not exhibit any change in their susceptibility to DNA-damaging agents, but the NER mutants were extremely sensitive to UV-induced DNA damage. We did not observe any significant change in mutation, genome stability and antifungal drug sensitivity in the mutant strains we tested. However, we detected a number of intriguing phenotypic differences between strains bearing deletions in equivalent C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae BER and NER genes, which may be related to differences in the life cycles of these two fungi...|$|E

Definitive diagnosis is by bacteriologic culture of blood samples to identify organisms and establish antibiotic susceptibility. Between July and September 2009, 249 blood samples collected from patients at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital were processed. Positive cultures which accounted for 48 (19. 3 %) of total samples screened, were purified and identified according to standard methods. Sensitivity of bacteria to different antibiotics was determined by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Microorganisms recovered were Staphylococcus aureus (14. 6 %), Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis (12. 5 % respectively), Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis (8. 3 % respectively) and Citrobacter freundii (6. 3 %). The highest antibiotic activities against Gram positive isolates were observed for ofloxacin (90. 9 %), nitrofurantoin (81. 8 %) and gentamicin (72. 7 %), while in Gram negative bacteria, ofloxacin (81. 1 %) and nalidixic acid (45. 9 %) were most effective. The possibility of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition</b> by bacteria makes continuous surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria essential as this will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread...|$|E
40|$|Among {{existing}} fungal pathogens, Candida glabrata is outstanding in {{its capacity}} to rapidly develop resistance to currently used antifungal agents. Resistance to the class of azoles, which are still widely used agents, varies in proportion (from 5 to 20 %) depending on geographical area. Moreover, resistance to the class of echinocandins, which {{was introduced in the}} late 1990 s, is rising in several institutions. The recent emergence of isolates with acquired resistance to both classes of agents is a major concern since alternative therapeutic options are scarce. Although considered less pathogenic than C. albicans, C. glabrata has still evolved specific virulence traits enabling its survival and propagation in colonized and infected hosts. Development of drug resistance is usually associated with fitness costs, and this notion is documented across several microbial species. Interestingly, azole resistance in C. glabrata has revealed the opposite. Experimental models of infection showed enhanced virulence of azole-resistant isolates. Moreover, azole resistance could be associated with specific changes in adherence properties to epithelial cells or innate immunity cells (macrophages), both of which contribute to virulence changes. Here we will summarize the current knowledge on C. glabrata drug resistance and also discuss the consequences of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition</b> on the balance between C. glabrata and its host...|$|E

40|$|Human GTSE 1 (G 2 and S phase-expressed 1) is a cell cycle-regulated protein with {{increased}} expression during S and G 2 {{phases of the}} cell cycle. We have previously reported that hGTSE 1 is a microtubule-localized protein that becomes stabilized upon DNA-damage, and a cell cycle-specific inhibitor of the p 53 pathway. Recently we describe a new function of hGTSE 1 as a physiological regulator of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 levels independently of p 53. In the present work we unravel the functional consequence of hGTSE 1 -mediated p 21 modulation, that {{is reflected in the}} cellular response to stress particularly in the G 2 checkpoint and apoptosis.

40|$|Background and objectives: Salmonellae {{infection}} {{is one of}} the most important foodborne diseases. Antimicrobial <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> is increasing among Salmonella spp. and causes significant therapeutic problems in the treatment of diseases caused by this organisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of class 1 integrons in Salmonella enterica and their relationship with antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates from Iran during 2007 - 2009. Materials and Methods: Salmonella spp. strains were isolated from several hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests and agglutination using specific antisera. The susceptibility of the isolates was determined according to the CLSI guidelines. Class 1 integrons were detected by PCR. Statistical comparisons of the frequency of resistance between integron-positive and integron-negative were made using Pearson χ 2 test or the Fisher’s exact test. A P≤ 0. 05 was intended as the level of statistical significance. Results: Class 1 integrons were detected in 39. 1 % of the strains. Integron-positive isolates represented seven different Salmonella enterica serotypes. All Salmonella isolates carrying class 1 integrons showed multiple <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> Conclusion: Our findings showed that integrons class 1 were widely distributed among Salmonella enterica isolates. Surveillance and monitoring of antimicrobial <b>drug</b> <b>resistance,</b> including screening for integrons as likely indicators of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and <b>acquisition</b> of new <b>resistance</b> traits, are necessary steps in planning effective strategies for containing this phenomenon within foodborne infection organisms...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the rates of}} <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition</b> in a natural population using molecular epidemiological data from Bolivia. First, we study the rate of direct acquisition of double resistance from the double sensitive state within patients and {{compare it to the}} rates of evolution to single resistance. In particular, we address whether or not double resistance can evolve directly from a double sensitive state within a given host. Second, we aim to understand whether the differences in mutation rates to rifampicin and isoniazid resistance translate to the epidemiological scale. Third, we estimate the proportion of MDR TB cases that are due to the transmission of MDR strains compared to acquisition of resistance through evolution. To address these problems we develop a model of TB transmission in which we track the evolution of resistance to two drugs and the evolution of VNTR loci. However, the available data is incomplete, in that it is recorded only {for a fraction of the population and} at a single point in time. The likelihood function induced by the proposed model is computationally prohibitive to evaluate and accordingly impractical to work with directly. We therefore approach statistical inference using approximate Bayesian computation techniques. Comment: 32 pages, 6 figures.

40|$|AbstractPathogenic Escherichia coli strains cause a {{wide variety}} of {{intestinal}} and extraintestinal infections. The widespread geographical clonal dissemination of intestinal pathogenic E. coli strains, such as E. coli O 157 :H 7, is well recognized, and its spread is most often attributed to contaminated food products. On the other hand, the clonal dissemination of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains is also recognized, but the mechanism of their spread is not well explained. Here, I describe major pandemic clonal lineages of ExPEC based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and discuss possible reasons for their global dissemination. These lineages include sequence type (ST) 131, ST 393, ST 69, ST 95, and ST 73, which are all associated with both community-onset and healthcare-associated infections, in particular urinary tract infections and bloodstream infections. As with many other types of drug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial infections, drug-resistant ExPEC infections are recognized to be caused by a limited set of clonal lineages. However, reported observations on these major pandemic lineages suggest that the resistance phenotype is not necessarily the determinant of their clonal dissemination. Both epidemiological factors and their intrinsic biological ‘fitness’ are likely to contribute. An important public health and clinical concern is that pandemicity itself may be a determinant of progressive <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition</b> by clonal lineages. New research is urgently needed to better understand the epidemiological and biological causes of ExPEC pandemicity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Membrane-associated ATP binding {{cassette}} (ABC) transport proteins hydrolyze ATP {{in order}} to translocate {{a broad spectrum of}} substrates, from single ions to macromolecules across membranes. In humans, members from this transport family have been linked to drug resistance phenotypes, e. g., tumour resistance by enhanced export of chemotherapeutic agents from cancer cells due to gene amplifications or polymorphisms in multidrug resistance (MDR) protein 1. Similar mechanisms have linked the Plasmodium falciparum PfMDR 1 transporter to anti-malarial <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition.</b> In this study, the possible involvement of two related MDR proteins, PfMDR 2 and PfMDR 5, to emerging drug resistance is investigated by a reverse genetics approach. METHODS: A homologous double crossover strategy was used to generate P. falciparum parasites lacking the Pfmdr 2 (PfDeltamdr 2) or Pfmdr 5 (PfDeltamdr 5) gene. Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase activity was used as read-out for sensitivity to artemisinin (ART), atovaquone (ATO), dihydroartemisinin (DHA), chloroquine (CQ), lumefantrine (LUM), mefloquine (MQ), and quinine (QN). Differences in half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(5) (0)) values between wild type and each mutant line were determined using a paired t-test. RESULTS: Both PfDeltamdr 2 and PfDeltamdr 5 clones were capable of asexual multiplication. Upon drug exposure, PfDeltamdr 2 showed a marginally decreased sensitivity to ATO (IC(5) (0) of 1. 2 nM to 1. 8 nM), MQ (124 nM to 185 nM) and QN (40 nM to 70 nM), as compared to wild type (NF 54) parasites. On the other hand, PfDeltamdr 5 showed slightly increased sensitivity to ART (IC(5) (0) of 26 nM to 19 nM). CONCLUSION: Both Pfmdr 2 and Pfmdr 5 are dispensable for blood stage development while the deletion lines show altered sensitivity profiles to commonly used anti-malarial drugs. The findings show {{for the first time that}} next to PfMDR 2, the PfMDR 5 transport protein could play a role in emerging drug resistance...|$|E
40|$|Background: India has {{the highest}} number of {{patients}} with tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the world. We used a transmission model to project the emergence of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> in India due to incorrect tuberculosis management practices in multiple sectors, including public and private providers, chemists, and non-allopathic practitioners. Methods: We constructed a dynamic Markov model to represent India's tuberculosis epidemic, including a probabilistic framework reflecting complex treatment-seeking pathways. Underlying <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and the <b>acquisition</b> of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> during treatment were included. India-specific epidemiological data, including tuberculosis management practices, were obtained from published literature. Outcomes, which included annual risk of infection, incidence of new disease, prevalence of untreated tuberculosis, and tuberculosis-related mortality, were stratified by underlying <b>drug</b> <b>resistance,</b> as well as by health sector to understand how each sector contributes to the emergence of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> Findings: If tuberculosis management practices across sectors in India remain unchanged over the next 20 years, we estimated a 47 % increase in the incidence of isoniazid resistance, a 152 % increase in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis incidence, a 242 % increase in prevalent untreated multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and a 275 % increase in the risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis infection. By 2032, an estimated 85 % of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis will be primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis compared with only 15 % in 2012. The public sector contributed 87 % of acquired multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, related to irregular adherence; the remainder came from the private sector, related to treatment non-completion. Chemists and non-allopathic practitioners do not treat with rifampicin, but because of the high rates of inappropriate isoniazid-containing regimens, and treatment non-adherence, this would generate isoniazid resistance. Interpretation: We predict a gradual transformation from the current epidemic of drug-susceptible tuberculosis to a drug-resistant epidemic. Evidence-based strategies to improve provider practices and patient adherence across health sectors are urgently needed to prevent this.

40|$|Tumor cells at {{the tumor}} margin lose {{epithelial}} properties and acquire features of mesenchymal cells, {{a process called}} epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Recently, features of EMT were shown {{to be linked to}} cells with tumor-founding capability, so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs). Inducers of the EMT include several transcription factors, such as Snail (SNAI 1) and Slug (SNAI 2), as well as the secreted transforming growth factor (TGFß). In the present study, we found that EMT induction in MCF 10 A cells by stably expressing SNAI 1 contributed to <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and <b>acquisition</b> of stem/progenitor-like character as shown by increased cell population for surface marker CD 44 (+) /CD 24 (-) and mammosphere forming capacity. Using a microarray approach, we demonstrate that SNAI 1 overexpression results in a dramatic change in signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell death and stem cell maintenance. We showed that NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathways are highly activated in MCF 10 A-SNAI 1 cells by IL 1 ß stimulation, leading to the robust induction in IL 6 and IL 8. Furthermore, MCF 10 A-SNAI 1 cells showed enhanced TCF/ß-catenin activity responding to the exogenous Wnt 3 a treatment. However, EMT-induced stem/progenitor cell activation process is tightly regulated in non-transformed MCF 10 A cells, as WNT 5 A and TGFB 2 are strongly upregulated in MCF 10 A-SNAI 1 cells antagonizing canonical Wnt pathway. In summary, our data provide new molecular findings how EMT contributes to the enhanced chemoresistance and the acquisition of stem/progenitor-like character by regulating signaling pathways...|$|R

In daily practice, PrEP will not be used under the well-controlled conditions available in the trials, suggesting that widespread use of PrEP can result in increased <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> We surveyed expert virologists with questions about biological assumptions regarding <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> due to PrEP use. The influence of these assumptions on the prevalence of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and the fraction of HIV transmitted resistance was studied with a mathematical model. For comparability, 50 % PrEP-coverage of and 90 % per-act efficacy of PrEP in preventing HIV acquisition are assumed in all simulations. Virologists disagreed on the following: the time until resistance emergence (range: 20 - 180 days) in infected PrEP users with breakthrough HIV infections; the efficacy of PrEP against drug-resistant HIV (25 %- 90 %); {{and the likelihood of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition</b> upon transmission (10 %- 75 %). These differences translate into projections of 0. 6 %- 1 % and 3. 5 %- 6 % infected individuals with detectable resistance 10 years after introducing PrEP, assuming 100 % and 50 % adherence, respectively. The rate of resistance emergence following breakthrough HIV infection and the rate of resistance reversion after PrEP use is discontinued, were the factors identified as most influential on the expected resistance associated with PrEP. Importantly, 17 - 23 % infected individuals could virologically fail treatment as a result of past PrEP use or transmitted resistance to PrEP with moderate adherence. There is no broad consensus on quantification of key biological processes that underpin the emergence of PrEP-associated <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> Despite this, the contribution of PrEP use to the prevalence of the detectable <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> is expected to be small. However, individuals who become infected despite the use of PrEP should be closely monitored due to higher risk of virological failure when initiating antiretroviral treatment in the future...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{stability}} {{is extremely important}} {{for the survival of}} every living organism, and a very complex set of genes has evolved to cope with DNA repair upon DNA damage. Here, we investigated the Aspergillus fumigatus AtmA (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated, ATM) and AtrA kinases, and how they impact virulence and the evolution of azole resistance. We demonstrated that A. fumigatus atmA and atrA null mutants are haploid and have a discrete chromosomal polymorphism. The ΔatmA and ΔatrA strains are sensitive to several DNA-damaging agents, but surprisingly both strains were more resistant than the wild-type strain to paraquat, menadione, and hydrogen peroxide. The atmA and atrA genes showed synthetic lethality emphasizing the cooperation between both enzymes and their consequent redundancy. The lack of atmA and atrA does not cause any significant virulence reduction in A. fumigatus in a neutropenic murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and in the invertebrate alternative model Galleria mellonela. Wild-type, ΔatmA, and ΔatrA populations that were previously transferred 10 times in minimal medium (MM) in the absence of voriconazole have not shown any significant changes in <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition.</b> In contrast, ΔatmA and ΔatrA populations that similarly evolved {{in the presence of a}} subinhibitory concentration of voriconazole showed an ∼ 5 – 10 -fold increase when compared to the original minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. There are discrete alterations in the voriconazole target Cyp 51 A/Erg 11 A or cyp 51 /erg 11 and/or Cdr 1 B efflux transporter overexpression that do not seem to be the main mechanisms to explain voriconazole resistance in these evolved populations. Taken together, these results suggest that genetic instability caused by ΔatmA and ΔatrA mutations can confer an adaptive advantage, mainly in the intensity of voriconazole resistance acquisition...|$|E
40|$|Among all {{infectious}} diseases that afflict humans, tuberculosis (TB) remains the deadliest. At present, epidemiologists estimate that {{one-third of the}} world population is infected with tubercle bacilli, {{which is responsible for}} 8 to 10 million new cases of TB and 3 million deaths annually throughout the world. Approximately 95 % of new cases and 98 % of deaths occur in developing nations, generally due to the few resources available to ensure proper treatment and where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are common. In 1882, Dr Robert Koch identified an acid-fast bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as the causative agent of TB. Thirty-nine years later, BCG vaccine was introduced for human use, and became the most widely used prophylactic strategy to fight TB in the world. The discovery of the properties of first-line antimycobacterial drugs in the past century yielded effective chemotherapies, which considerably decreased TB mortality rates worldwide. The later introduction of some additional drugs to the arsenal used to treat TB seemed to provide an adequate number of effective antimicrobial agents. The modern, standard short-course therapy for TB recommended by the World Health Organization is based on a four-drug regimen that must be strictly followed to prevent <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition,</b> and relies on direct observation of patient compliance to ensure effective treatment. Mycobacteria show a high degree of intrinsic resistance to most antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents due to the low permeability of its cell wall. Nevertheless, the cell wall barrier alone cannot produce significant levels of drug resistance. M. tuberculosis mutants resistant to any single drug are naturally present in any large bacterial population, irrespective of exposure to drugs. The frequency of mutants resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid, the two principal antimycobacterial drugs currently in use, is relatively high and, therefore, the large extra-cellular population of actively metabolizing and rapidly growing tubercle bacilli in cavitary lesions will contain organisms which are resistant to a single drug. Consequently, monotherapy or improperly administered two-drug therapies will select for drug-resistant mutants that may lead to drug resistance in the entire bacterial population. Thereby, despite the availability of effective chemotherapy and the moderately protective vaccine, new anti-TB agents are urgently needed to decrease the global incidence of TB. The resumption of TB, mainly caused by the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains and HIV epidemics, led to an increased need to understand the molecular mechanisms of drug action and drug resistance, which should provide significant insight into the development of newer compounds. The latter should be effective to combat both drug-susceptible and MDR/XDR-TB...|$|E
40|$|Integrative conjugative {{elements}} (ICEs) {{are responsible}} for pneumococcal genome evolution and more particularly for virulence and <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition.</b> During conjugation, ICEs transfer from a donor cell containing the genetic element to a recipient cell lacking it. ICEs insert into the bacterial genome, excise from it and form a covalently closed circular intermediate which can integrate in a different genomic site and/or can integrate in a new genome upon conjugative transfer. Tn 5253 is a composite ICE of Streptococcus pneumoniae conferring resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. The complete nucleotide sequence showed that it is 64, 528 bp in size and contains 79 ORFs, 41 of {{which could not be}} annotated. Two distinct genetic elements were found integrated in Tn 5253 : Tn 5251 (18, 033 bp), of the Tn 916 -Tn 1545 family of CTs, and Ωcat(pC 194) (7, 627 bp), which could not conjugate, but was capable of intracellular mobility by homologous recombination. Ωcat(pC 194) was shown to contain a copy of the staphylococcal plasmid pC 194 with a 93 -bp deletion in the replication origin, to be flanked by two 1, 169 -bp direct repeats, and to excise from Tn 5253 producing a circular form of the element. The highest transfer frequency of Tn 5253 was registered when Streptococcus pyogenes was the donor (6. 7 x 10 - 3 transconjugants/donor). Upon conjugal transfer, Tn 5253 was found to always integrate at a single chromosomal site. The target site (attB) was a 83 -bp sequence in the rbg gene of S. pneumoniae. Strains carrying Tn 5253 all contained circular forms of the ICE in which the ends were joined by a 84 -bp sequence (attTn). attB and attTn differed only for an extra nucleotide in attTn. When integrated into the chromosome, Tn 5253 was flanked by a copy of attB and a copy of attTn: invariably attB was adjacent to the left end and attTn to the right, suggesting a polarization in the DNA integration process. In order to study the mechanism of integration into pneumococcal chromosome, we constructed an attB mutant in which the first 63 nts were deleted and 5 nucleotide changes introduced in the remaining 20 nts. The resulting attB mutant was used as Tn 5253 recipient strain in mating experiments. Conjugation frequency of Tn 5253 in the attB mutant recipient was considerably lower when compared to a standard recipient (4. 8 x 10 - 7 vs 1. 7 x 10 - 5 transconjugants per donor cell). Five novel Tn 5253 alternative insertion sites were found located in: spr 1713, coding for an alpha-galactosidase, spr 0540 (cell wall synthesis enzyme), spr 1534 (substrate binding protein of an ABC sugar transporter), spr 1983 (MFS protein) and spr 0546 (nrd, putative nitroreductase). Transfer of Tn 5253 from alternative attB sites occurred at lower frequencies than wild type donor ranging from 2 x 10 - 7 to < 3. 6 x 10 - 8. One transconjugant harboring 3 copies of Tn 5253 was able to transfer the ICE at a frequency 100 -fold higher than wild type donor. Tn 5253 has a strong preference for its primary insertion site, even when it is mutated, but it can also integrate at different sites. The insertion site of Tn 5253 affects its transposition rate, which is decreased or abolished when integrated in one of the alternative attB...|$|E

40|$|Both the {{intrinsic}} and the acquired anticancer <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> presents until today a major drawback {{in the management}} of cancer. The handling with <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> is aggravated by the facts that <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> is a multifactorial and multifaceted phenomenon. The development of tumor-targeted pharmacological and genetic strategies to overcome intrinsic resistance and to prevent the <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition</b> is thus still a pressing need. We put forward the two main objectives: 1) The reversal of the pre-existing <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> in p 53 -deficient cells by either the concomitant abrogation of DNA repair functions or by the concomitant blocking of cytoprotective signaling pathways. 2) The identification of members of the novel class of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors with anticancer activity that have (or do not have) the potential to cause <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition</b> in tumor cells. 	Mutations in the p 53 gene and dysregulation of p 53 -dependent cellular processes are often associated with cancer and resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. Many Advances have been taken to reconstitute the (wildtype) p 53 tumor suppressor pathway in cancer cells. We showed that genetic abrogation of the expression of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene Pms 2 in cells depleted for the p 53 tumor suppressor function hypersensitized these cells to the cytotoxic effect of some anticancer agents through an increase in the rate of apoptosis. Expanding on this, we also showed that genetic depletion of either ATM, BRCA 1, or DNA-PK resulted in an increase in the chemosensitivity of p 53 -deficient cells against a variety of anticancer agents. These studies indicate that tumor-targeted functional inhibition of either {{one or the other of}} these DNA repair genes may reverse resistance in p 53 -mutated tumors and therefore provide a strategy for increasing chemotherapy efficacy for these tumors. Analogous as well as opposing results were reported for loss of the MMR protein MLH 1 in p 53 -deficient cells with Cisplatin. However, neither Radicicol (HSP 90 inhibitor) nor LY 294002 and LY 294005 (Akt inhibitors) were found to reverse Cisplatin resistance specifically in MMR-deficient tumor cells. These Akt inhibitors even further decreased the sensitivity against Cisplatin, suggesting - in addition to its acknowledged cytoprotective function - a cytodestructive function of Akt. 	On the other hand, we showed the potential of the HDAC inhibitor SAHA to induce stable and MDR-independent resistance in HCT 116 colon tumor cells. As these results differ from those reported with FK- 228, we propose a novel mechanism of <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition</b> by the SAHA, the nature of which is still obscure. This is under investigation, as is novel and intriguing molecular approach to reverse drug resistance: the liposomal delivery of (exogenous) cytochrome c to tumor cells...|$|R
40|$|Clin Microbiol Infect ABSTRACT: Drug {{susceptibility}} {{testing of}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the diagnostic laboratory classifies clinical isolates as either drug-'resistant' or drug-'susceptible', {{on the basis}} of their ability to grow in the presence of a 'critical concentration' of the test compound.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of antiretroviral drugs {{is limited by}} the development of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> Therefore, it is important to examine HIV <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> following the nationwide implementation of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> testing in China since 2009. We conducted <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> testing in patients who were already on or new to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Shandong Province, China, from 2011 to 2013, and grouped them based on {{the presence or absence of}} <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> to determine the effects of age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, route of transmission and treatment status on <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> We then examined levels of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> the following year. The <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> rates of HIV patients on ART in Shandong from 2011 to 2013 were 3. 45 % (21 / 608), 3. 38 % (31 / 916), and 4. 29 % (54 / 1259), per year, respectively. M 184 V was the most frequently found point mutation, conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, while Y 181 C, G 190 A, K 103 N and V 179 D/E/F were the most frequent point mutations conferring resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. In addition, the protease inhibitor <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> mutations I 54 V and V 82 A were identified for the first time in Shandong Province. Primary resistance accounts for 20 % of the impact factors for <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> Furthermore, it was found that educational level and treatment regimen were high-risk factors for <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> in 2011 (P< 0. 05), while treatment regimen was a high risk factor for <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> in 2012 and 2013 (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Background The {{effect of}} {{pretreatment}} HIV- 1 <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> on {{the response to}} first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has not been assessed. We studied pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and virological, immunological, and drug-resistance treatment outcomes in a large prospective cohort. Methods HIV- 1 infected patients in the PharmAccess African Studies to Evaluate Resistance Monitoring (PASER-M) cohort started non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART at 13 clinical sites in six countries, from 2007 to 2009. We used the International Antiviral Society-USA <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> mutation list and the Stanford algorithm to classify participants into three pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> categories: no pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance,</b> pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> with fully active ART prescribed, or pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> with reduced susceptibility {{to at least one}} prescribed drug. We assessed risk factors of virological failure (>= 400 copies per mL) and acquired <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> after 12 months of ART by use of multilevel logistic regression with multiple imputations for missing data. CD 4 cell count increase was estimated with linear mixed models. Findings Pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> results were available for 2579 (94 %) of 2733 participants; 2404 (93 %) had no pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance,</b> 123 (5 %) had pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> to at least one prescribed drug, and 52 (2 %) had pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and received fully active ART Compared with participants without pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance,</b> the odds ratio (OR) for virological failure (OR 2. 13, 95 % CI 1 - 44 - 3. 14; p < 0. 0001) and acquired drug-resistance (2. 30, 1. 55 - 3 - 40; p < 0. 0001) was increased in participants with pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> to at least one prescribed drug, but not in those with pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and fully active ART CD 4 count increased less in participants with pretreatment <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> than in those without (35 cells per mu L difference after 12 months; 95 % CI 13 - 58; p= 0. 002). Interpretation At least three fully active antiretroviral drugs are needed to ensure an optimum response to first-line regimens and to prevent <b>acquisition</b> of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> Improved access to alternative combinations of antiretroviral drugs in sub-Saharan Africa is warranted.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Drug</b> <b>resistance</b> in {{bacterial}} pathogens is {{an increasing}} problem, which stimulates research. However, our understanding of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> mechanisms remains incomplete. Fortunately, the fast-growing number of fully sequenced bacterial strains now enables us to develop new methods to identify mutations associated with <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> Results We present a new comparative approach to identify genes and mutations {{that are likely to}} be associated with <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> mechanisms. In order to test the approach, we collected genotype and phenotype data of 100 fully sequenced strains of S. aureus and 10 commonly used drugs. Then, applying the method, we re-discovered the most common genetic determinants of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and identified some novel putative associations. Conclusions Firstly, the collected data may help other researchers to develop and verify similar techniques. Secondly, the proposed method is successful in identifying <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> determinants. Thirdly, the in-silico identified genetic mutations, which are putatively involved in <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> mechanisms, may increase our understanding of the <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> mechanisms. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Primary-HIV- 1 -infection in newborns {{that occurs}} under {{antiretroviral}} prophylaxis {{that is a}} high risk of drug-resistance acquisition. We examine the frequency and the mechanisms of <b>resistance</b> <b>acquisition</b> at the time of infection in newborns. Patients and Methods We studied HIV- 1 -infected infants born between 01 January 1997 and 31 December 2004 and enrolled in the ANRS-EPF cohort. HIV- 1 -RNA and HIV- 1 -DNA samples obtained perinatally from the newborn and mother were subjected to population-based and clonal analyses of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> If positive, serial samples were obtained from the child for resistance testing. Results Ninety-two HIV- 1 -infected infants were born during the study period. Samples were obtained from 32 mother-child pairs and from another 28 newborns. <b>Drug</b> <b>resistance</b> was detected in 12 newborns (20 %) : <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was seen in 10 cases, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in two cases, and protease inhibitors in one case. For 9 children, the detection of the same resistance mutations in mothers' samples (6 among 10 available) and in newborn lymphocytes (6 / 8) suggests that the newborn was initially infected by a drug-resistant strain. Resistance variants were either transmitted from mother-to-child or selected during subsequent temporal exposure under suboptimal perinatal prophylaxis. Follow-up studies of the infants showed that the resistance pattern remained stable over time, regardless of antiretroviral therapy, suggesting the early cellular archiving of resistant viruses. The absence of resistance in the mother of the other three children (3 / 10) and neonatal lymphocytes (2 / 8) suggests that the newborns were infected by a wild-type strain without long-term persistence of resistance when suboptimal prophylaxis was stopped. Conclusion This study confirms the importance of early resistance genotyping of HIV- 1 -infected newborns. In most cases (75 %), <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> was archived in the cellular reservoir and persisted during infancy, with or without antiretroviral treatment. This finding stresses the need for effective antiretroviral treatment of pregnant women. </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryUsing {{sequential}} {{gene expression}} profiling (GEP) samples, we defined a major functional group related to <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> that contains chromosomal instability (CIN) genes. One CIN gene in particular, NEK 2, was {{highly correlated with}} <b>drug</b> <b>resistance,</b> rapid relapse, and poor outcome in multiple cancers. Overexpressing NEK 2 in cancer cells resulted in enhanced CIN, cell proliferation and <b>drug</b> <b>resistance,</b> while targeting NEK 2 by NEK 2 shRNA overcame cancer cell <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and induced apoptosis in vitro and in a xenograft myeloma mouse model. High expression of NEK 2 induced <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> mainly through activation of the efflux pumps. Thus, NEK 2 represents a strong predictor for <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and poor prognosis in cancer and could be an important target for cancer therapy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Cancer <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is a major}} {{obstacle}} {{for the success of}} chemotherapy. Since most clinical anticancer drugs could induce <b>drug</b> <b>resistance,</b> it is desired to develop candidate drugs that are highly efficacious but incompetent to induce <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> Numerous previous studies have proven that shikonin and its analogs not only are highly tumoricidal but also can bypass drug-transporter and apoptotic defect mediated <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate if or not shikonin is a weak inducer of cancer <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> Experimental Design: Different cell lines (K 562, MCF- 7, and a MDR cell line K 562 /Adr), after repeatedly treated with shikonin for 18 months, were assayed for <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and gene expression profiling. Results: After 18 -month treatment, cells only developed a mere 2 -fold resistance to shikonin and a marginal resistance to cisplatin and paclitaxel, without cross resistance to shikonin analogs and other anticancer agents. Gene expression profiles demonstrated that cancer cells did strongly respond to shikonin treatment but failed to effectively mobilize drug resistant machineries. Shikonin-induced weak resistance was associated with the up-regulation of bII-tubulin, which physically interacted with shikonin. Conclusion: Taken together, apart from potent anticancer activity, shikonin and its analogs are weak inducers of cancer <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and can circumvent cancer <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> These merits make shikonin and its analogs potential candidates for cancer therapy with advantages of avoiding induction of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> and bypassing existing <b>drug</b> <b>resistance...</b>|$|R

40|$|Current {{tools and}} {{strategies}} for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) are inadequate, particularly in settings with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Several promising new tools are at advanced stages of development and evaluation. This review describes some of those promising new technologies and the key barriers to their effective implementation. Robert Koch’s recognition in 1882 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the microbial cause of tuberculosis (TB) led shortly thereafter to the identification of methods to stain bacilli in clinical specimens, rendering the or-ganisms visible with use of light microscopy. Such was the birth of TB diagnostics and of diagnostic micro-biology in general. Tragically, development and imple-mentation of TB diagnostics kept pace neither with medical technology nor with the catastrophic explosion of TB, including drug-resistant TB, {{in the wake of}} the global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pan-demic. Inadequate tools and weak systems for labora-tory-based diagnosis of active TB have contributed to (1) underdiagnosis of disease, leading to individual morbidity and mortality and to continued transmis-sion; (2) overdiagnosis of disease, leading to unneces-sary treatment with attendant consequences to the pa-tient and inappropriate resource utilization by the health care program; and (3) delayed diagnosis of <b>drug</b> <b>resistance,</b> leading to <b>acquisition</b> of additional <b>resistance</b> and to morbidity and transmission. Besides deficiencies in diagnostic tools, access to TB diagnostics continues to be a major challenge.
