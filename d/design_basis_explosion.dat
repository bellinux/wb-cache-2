5000|$|Accidents {{caused by}} poor design, failure to follow listed safety procedures, {{or other forms}} of human error are not {{considered}} to be beyond <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> accidents. The terminology can be unclear, however, because a poorly handled <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> accident can result in conditions beyond what was considered likely, causing a beyond <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> accident. [...] For this reason, some industry experts have criticized the use of <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> terminology. The Three Mile Island accident and the Chernobyl disaster are examples of <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> accidents becoming non <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> accidents largely due to failures to follow the written operating procedures.|$|R
40|$|For {{development}} of offshore wind farms, the <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> {{will serve as}} a valuable tool. The purpose with the <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> is twofold – it serves as a technical <b>basis</b> for <b>design</b> and construction of the wind farm and the <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> may together with the contract serve as a basis for managing project variation orders. Experience from the offshore oil & gas industry have shown that a good <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> will allow for a fast track development project of high quality with only minor variation orders, while a poorly worked out <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> opens up for delays and major variation orders.

40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) <b>Design</b> <b>Basis</b> Reconstitution Program (DBRP) is a {{structured}} assessment and reconstitution of the <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> for the ATR. The DBRP {{is designed to}} establish and document the ties between the Document Safety Analysis (DSA), <b>design</b> <b>basis,</b> and actual system configurations. Where the DBRP assessment team cannot establish a link between these three major elements, a gap is identified. Resolutions to identified gaps represent configuration management and <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> recovery actions. The proposed paper discusses the process being applied to define, evaluate, report, and address gaps that are identified through the ATR DBRP. <b>Design</b> <b>basis</b> verification may be performed or required for a nuclear facility safety basis on various levels. The process is applicable to large-scale <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> reconstitution efforts, such as the ATR DBRP, or may be scaled for application on smaller projects. The concepts are applicable to long-term maintenance of a nuclear facility safety basis and recovery of degraded safety basis components. The ATR DBRP assessment team has observed numerous examples where a clear and accurate link between the DSA, <b>design</b> <b>basis,</b> and actual system configuration was not immediately identifiable in supporting documentation. As a result, a systematic approach to effectively document, prioritize, and evaluate each observation is required. The DBRP issue resolution process provides direction for consistent identification, documentation, categorization, and evaluation, and where applicable, entry into the determination process for a potential inadequacy in the safety analysis (PISA). The issue resolution process {{is a key element}} for execution of the DBRP. Application of the process facilitates collection, assessment, and reporting of issues identified by the DBRP team. Application of the process results in an organized database of safety basis gaps and prioritized corrective action planning and resolution. The DBRP team follows the ATR DBRP issue resolution process which provides a method for the team to promptly sort and prioritize questions and issues between those that can be addressed as a normal part of the reconstitution project and those that are to be handle as PISAs. Presentation of the DBRP issue resolution process provides an example for similar activities that may be required at other facilities within the Department of Energy complex...|$|R

In water flow movement similar conditions, the velocity {{scale of the}} Freund's similarity and resistance similarity is inconsistency, and the flow resistance is the function of bed material grain size and flow intensity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to identify the preliminary <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> events (DBEs) for consideration {{in the design of}} the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR).
