40|$|Technology Foresight exammes {{the future}} of the Greek economy and in {{particular}} what the contribution of science and technology is to this. Greek Technology Foresight started in October 2001 as a programme co-financed by the European Union and the target was to create a functional view after two decades. The main purpose of this project is the identification of cost-effective Aerospace and Defence Technologies for Greece in the year 2020. Firstly, the capacity and capability of Greek industries and the research environment are examined in conjunction with the products demanded by Armed Forces. Secondly, comes the examination of all relevant factors (industry, university, government) which have a considerable contribution to research and innovation in order to promote networking and further institutional development. Research was absolutely necessary to foresee and evaluate specific technologies within a frame of long-term development strategy for the various stakeholders. This research area is directly related to my managerial role as I have been in charge of this programme during its implementation. The research methods employed are documentary evidence, interviews and the Delphi approach. Thus the data collected {{from a variety of sources}} ensure the qualitative character of the thesis. The main findings are that the outlined Aerospace and Defence technologies can playa decisive role in the three different scenarios for {{the future of}} the country and they are related to the outcomes of science and technology evolution. The general conclusion is that taking into consideration Technology Foresight results defence procurement could be managed better which would result an efficient contribution to national economy, an improvement in <b>intra-community</b> <b>transfer</b> and several benefits from export opportunities of dual-use products...|$|E

This informal structure assists <b>intra-community</b> knowledge <b>transfer</b> which facilitates the learning or absorption of new knowledge. However, lack of research examines the role organizational absorptive capacity in assisting CoP towards open innovation. Based on resource based view and dynamic capabilities theory, this paper proposes a conceptual framework to investigate the relationship between CoP involvement and absorptive capacity and open innovation. This framework provides a sound basis for further research to shed light on the effects of R&D CoP with regards to university industry collaboration. Contributions to research and practice are discussed...|$|R
