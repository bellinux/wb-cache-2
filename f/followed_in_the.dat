5|$|A tag team match <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth match, with Pat Kenney teaming with Johnny B. Badd {{to fight}} The New York Connection (Johnny Swinger and Glenn Gilbertti). Jacqueline was the special guest referee for the bout. Badd won the {{encounter}} after he lifted Gilberti up onto his shoulders, spun him around, {{and fell to}} his back to perform a move known as a TKO. Badd followed by covering Gilberti for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in {{a classic}} style of design, with the first cover a {{watercolour}} and pencil drawing by illustrator Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font Cochin Bold. The first releases of the successive books in the series <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same style but somewhat more realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created by first Cliff Wright and then Jason Cockroft.|$|E
5|$|Further martyrdoms <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> months thereafter, {{increasing}} {{in the next}} spring, when the new governor, Urbanus, published the fourth edict. Eusebius probably does not list a complete account of all those executed under the fourth edicthe alludes in passing to others imprisoned with Thecla of Gaza, for example, though he does not name them.|$|E

5|$|Further scandal <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1926–27 {{season when}} title-winners Torino Football Club were {{stripped}} of their Scudetto following an FIGC investigation. A Torino official {{was found to have}} bribed opposing defender Luigi Allemandi in Torino's match against Juventus on 5 June 1927, and thus the season finished with no declared champions.|$|E
5|$|Kenya's Jason Dunford {{finished}} fifth {{with a time}} of 51.47, and was <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sixth spot by Japan's Takuro Fujii, in an Asian {{record of}} 51.50. Ukraine's Andriy Serdinov (51.59), the bronze medalist in Athens four years earlier, and Papua New Guinea's Ryan Pini, gold medalist at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, (51.86) closed out the field. Dunford and Pini also made history as the first swimmer for their respective nation to reach an Olympic final.|$|E
5|$|Promethium (formerly prometheum) is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pm and atomic number 61. All of its isotopes are radioactive; {{it is one}} of only two such elements that are <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table by elements with stable forms, a distinction shared with technetium. Chemically, promethium is a lanthanide, which forms salts when combined with other elements. Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3.|$|E

5|$|Significant discoveries {{relating}} to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism, including ammonification, nitrification and nitrogen fixation (the uptake of atmospheric nitrogen by symbiotic soil microorganisms) {{had to wait}} for advances in chemistry and bacteriology in the late 19th century and this was <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century by the elucidation of protein and amino-acid synthesis and their role in plant metabolism. With this knowledge it was then possible to outline the global nitrogen cycle.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands were {{partially}} metricated {{when they}} were French, in the years 1810–1813. With full metrication, effective January 1821, the Netherlands reformed the trooisch pond. The apothecaries' new pound was 375.00g. Apart from rounding issues concerning the subdivisions, this corresponded exactly to the French système usuel. (The reform was not <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north German city of Lübeck, which continued to use the trooisch pond.) In Belgium, apothecaries' weight was metricized effective 1856.|$|E
5|$|The Wellington bypass was {{constructed}} by contractor M. J. Gleeson Ltd, from 1973 to 1975. Many problems <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{two years after}} completion; the rigid concrete carriageway broke up, due to the road being built on a poor subbase with rigid concrete along a historically heavily mined route. The aesthetic and constructional design of the bridges was also heavily criticised. Over the next 15 years, {{almost all of the}} original carriageway had to be replaced with asphalt.|$|E

5|$|The state took Camber Castle into {{guardianship}} in 1967, and {{the next}} year the government began a slow process of restoring the castle with the intention of eventually reopening it to the public, their efforts largely focusing on protecting the internal brick walls and wall-cores. Further excavations <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|This {{plan was}} not <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reconstruction. Although half-timbered houses were banned at first, the ban was lifted in 1731 as brick houses were {{considerably}} more expensive. Medieval Copenhagen, however, had changed permanently when the reconstruction was complete by 1737. Streets and alleys no longer followed the original paths {{and some even}} ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, the game's sequel features a storyline {{although it is}} still not the series canon. However, certain characters' endings are canon, which are <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sequel game Tekken 7. In the story, Heihachi Mishima has developed a rejuvenation serum, which has the ability to regress his appearance and power. After consuming it, Heihachi hosts another King of Iron Fist Tournament, sensing powerful challengers who would come to the tournament.|$|E
5|$|A {{battle for}} Mogadishu <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first half of}} 2006 in which the ARPCT confronted the ICU. However, with local support, the ICU {{captured}} the city in June of the year. It then expanded its area of control in south-central Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum {{under the auspices of}} the Arab League. The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. Hardline Islamists subsequently gained power within the ICU, prompting fears of a Talibanization of the movement.|$|E
5|$|A fresh wave of {{concerns}} about France <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1880s, accompanied {{by the introduction of}} still more powerful naval artillery and fast warships and torpedo boats, resulting in a fresh wave of modernisation. An electronically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. New, quick-firing guns were installed at Hurst to enable the castle to engage the newer vessels. Calshot was brought back into service as a coastal fort, with a new battery of quick-firing guns protecting a boom across the estuary. The original 16th-century parts of fortifications such as Southsea and Calshot were too small and unsuitable for modern weapons, however, and were instead used for mounting searchlights, range and direction finding; in some cases their fabric was left to slowly decline.|$|E

5|$|A {{range of}} the fortifications were {{opened to the public}} in the post-war years. Deal, Hurst, Pendennis and Portland opened in the 1950s, and Southsea in 1967. Calshot <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, Camber after a long period of {{restoration}} work in 1994, and Sandsfoot reopened following repair work in 2012. Visitor numbers vary across the sites; Southsea Castle, for example, received over 90,000 visitors in 2011–12. Other forts were put to different uses: Netley was first used a nursing home, and then converted into private flats; Brownsea became a corporate hotel for the employees of the John Lewis Partnership; and Sandgate was restored in the 1970s to form a private home.|$|E
5|$|A {{resurgence}} of both economy and rugby union <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s and, in 1931, Wales won their first championship for nine years. That year, {{for the first}} time since the First World War, Wales retained the same side for two consecutive Tests when they faced England and Scotland. Then, in 1933, captained by Watcyn Thomas, Wales defeated England at Twickenham. In 1935, Wales beat the touring All Blacks by 13–12, with Haydn Tanner making his first appearance. Although the Five Nations Championship was suspended during the Second World War Wales did play a Red Cross charity match against England at Cardiff in 1940, which Wales lost 18–9.|$|E
5|$|A similar outcome <b>followed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 200m World finals. In the semi-final, Gatlin outpaced Bolt – the Jamaican at 19.95 and the American at 19.87. Despite such slow times {{prior to}} Beijing, Bolt {{delivered}} in the final with his fifth fastest run ever for the 200m at 19.55 seconds. Gatlin failed to reach his early season form and finished almost two-tenths of a second behind Bolt. Bolt's four consecutive wins over 200m at the World Championships was unprecedented and established him clearly as the best ever sprinter at the competition.|$|E
