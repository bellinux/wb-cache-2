50|$|During activation, whilst {{the bulb}} {{is still on}} the pump, an R.F. <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> {{connected}} to a powerful R.F. oscillator operating in the 27 MHz or 40.68 MHz ISM band is positioned around the bulb in the plane of the ring. The coil acts as the primary of a transformer and the ring as a single shorted turn. Large R. F. currents flow in the ring, heating it. The coil is moved along the axis of the bulb so as not to overheat and melt the ring. Once the ring is heated the barium azide decomposes into barium vapor and nitrogen. The nitrogen is pumped out and the barium condenses on the bulb above the plane of the ring forming a mirror like deposit with a large surface area. The powdered glass in the ring melts and entraps any particles which could otherwise escape loose inside the bulb causing later problems. The barium combines with any free gas when activated and continues to act after the bulb is sealed off from the pump. During use, the internal electrodes {{and other parts of the}} tube get hot. This can cause adsorbed gases to be released from metallic parts, such as anodes (plates), grids or non metallic—but porous—parts, such as sintered ceramic parts. The gas is trapped on the large area of reactive barium on the bulb wall and removed from the tube.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOn {{industrial}} <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> devices, <b>induction</b> <b>coils</b> are {{water cooled}} {{at a high}} flow rate: this {{large amount of energy}} (10 to 60 % of the total energy consumption) is often lost. A heat recovery test bench has been built to collect the coil losses and reuse them when needed. The main parts of the test bench are made up two heat exchangers which can be bypassed according to the control and regulation system. The " recovery heat exchanger " collects the heat to be recovered and transfers it to the reuse, the recovery circuit.

40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} into the design of converters for induction heating systems based upon resonant switch mode power converter techniques. The proposed three phase unity power factor induction heating system consists of two stages of power conversions. The important requirements for each stage of the power conversion of a typical induction heating system working from a three-phase supply are identified. A wide range of power converters which fulfil these requirements are compared and evaluated. From the evaluation, the most applicable converter topologies are selected. Each selected converter class is investigated in great detail to outline their advantages and disadvantages. The first stage consists of a push-pull buck converter connected to a unity power factor rectifier stage. This stage converts the three phase AC mains supply to a required DC value. The second stage, which converters the DC into AC is a single ended resonant inverter system. Analysis of the converters has been made and the design procedure has been formulated. The design procedure allows a strenuous design of each resonant converter for particular converter applications. The final converter design has been simulated using the circuit simulation software packages Design Architect and Accusim to verify the results of analysis. The most important design and construction achievements can be summarised as follows: I A novel push-pull buck quasi-resonant converter with a three-phase rectifier stage has been built and tested. At its maximum operating frequency of 40 kHz, the prototype converter delivers an output power of 500 W. The converter draws nearly sinusoidal currents from the three-phase mains supply and has an input power factor approaching unity. A secondary stage resonant converter provides AC for the induction heater coil. This AC current flowing in the induction coil creates an alternating electromagnetic field for the workpiece. An <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> has been designed and built by using electrical equivalent coil design method. A novel control strategy was developed to provide output power control. Both converter and inverter stage of the system are operated in the zero-current switching condition. The use of this technique allows higher switching frequencies and provides low switching losses.

40|$|The High and Thermal Magnetic Processing/Electro-magnetic Acoustic Transducer (HTMP/EMAT) {{technology}} {{has been shown to}} be an enabling disruptive materials processing technology, that can achieve significant improvements in microstructure and consequently material performance beyond that achievable through conventional processing, and will lead to the next generation of advanced performance structural and functional materials. HTMP exposure increased the reaction kinetics enabling refinement of microstructural features such as finer martensite lath size, and finer, more copious, homogeneous dispersions of strengthening carbides leading to combined strength and toughness improvements in bainitic steels. When induction heating is applied in a high magnetic field environment, the <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> is configured so that high intensity acoustic/ultrasonic treatment occurs naturally. The configuration results in a highly effective electromagnetic acoustical transducer (EMAT). HTMP combined with applying high-field EMAT, produce a non-contact ultrasonic treatment that can be used to process metal alloys in either the liquid state resulting in significant microstructural changes over conventional processing. Proof-of-principle experiments on cast irons resulted in homogeneous microstructures in small castings along with improved casting surface appearance. The experiment showed that by exposing liquid metal to the non-contact acoustic/ultrasonic processing technology developed using HMFP/EMAT wrought-like microstructures were developed in cast components. This Energy Intensive Processes (EIP) project sponsored by the DOE EERE Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) demonstrated the following: (1) The reduction of retained austenite in high carbon/high alloy steels with an ambient temperature HTMP process, replacing either a cryogenic or double tempering thermal process normally employed to accomplish retained austenite transformation. HTMP can be described as a 'heat-free', heat treating technology. Lower residual stresses in HTMP treated materials are anticipated since no thermal strains are involved in inducing the transformation of retained austenite to martensite in high alloy steel. (2) The simultaneous increase of 12 % in yield strength and 22 % in impact energy in a bainitic alloy using HTMP processing. This is a major breakthrough in materials processing for the next generation of structural materials since conventionally processed materials show a reduction in impact toughness with an increase in yield strength. HTMP is a new paradigm to beneficially increase both yield strength and impact energy absorption simultaneously. (3) HTMP processing refined both the martensite lath population and the carbide dispersion in a bainitic steel alloy during Gausstempering. The refinement was believed to be responsible for the simultaneous increase in strength and toughness. Hence, HTMP significantly impacts nucleation and growth phenomenon. (4) HTMP processing developed comparable ultimate tensile strength and twice the impact energy in a lower cost, lower alloy content ({approx} 8 % alloy content) steel, compared to highly alloyed, (31 % alloy elements involving Ni, Co, and Mo) 250 -grade margining steel. Future low-cost HTMP alloys appear viable that will exceed the structural performance of highly alloyed materials that are conventionally processed. This economic benefit will enable U. S. industry to reduce cost (better more competitive worldwide) while maintaining or exceeding current performance. (5) EMAT processed cast iron exhibits significantly higher hardness (by 51 % for a 9 T condition) than a no-field processed sample. (6) EMAT produced microstructures in cast iron resulted in an unique graphite nodule morphology, a modified pearlite content, and unique carbide types, that formed during solidification and cooling. (7) EMAT processed nanoparticle dispersions in Mg resulted in a very fine, unagglomerated distribution of the nanoparticles in the magnesium matrix. This provides a breakthrough technology to make the next generation of nanocomposite reinforced metal matrix composites which can be tailored to exhibit higher strength and ductility combinations not only at ambient temperature but at elevated temperatures where enhanced creep resistance is observed. This technology can be extended to non-metallic systems as long as a conductive containment vessel is utilized that will convey the EMAT signal into the material of interest during processing. (8) Facilitation of HTMP/EMAT technology commercialization, throughout the course of the project. Two technology limitations were overcome that led to the first generation commercial prototype HTMP/EMAT system which was initially installed at ORNL. (9) During this project, a production-scale equipment design to enable commercialization of HMFP technology was conceptualized, designed, fabricated, and installed at ORNL as a commercial-scale prototype system...|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{presents}} an <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> system design for fiber optics pipes joints. Remote heating methods are probably inconvenient due to non-uniform heat distribution resulting in unreliable joints. The <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> generates uniform heat distribution {{which can be}} achieved by proper designing of inductive <b>heating</b> <b>coil,</b> and power system inverter that drives the induction system. Two different shaped open jaw type <b>heating</b> <b>coils</b> were designed i. e open claw type coil (OCTC) and curved spiral rectangular coil (CSRC). The coils were designed in COMSOL simulation software to check the coil and workpiece behaviours. These coil designs were then wounded by hand and resistance and inductance of each coil were measured. The OCTC is a short loop coil, having small inductance while the CSRC has a long loop so its inductance is high. CSRC design was selected in the current application. The CSRC inductance was calculated through modified Wheeler formula and current sheet approximation. To design the power inverter, firstly the power density of heating material i. e workpiece was calculated. Then the thermal losses of the coil were calculated, these losses were due to skin effect and proximity effect; and switch losses due to drain to source resistance(RDS) of Mosfets were estimated. The Mazzilli inverter was proposed for power system inverter design which works as a parallel resonant circuit. It was designed in Mandi simulation software and then implemented on hardware. Theoretical results were compared with the practical measurements through Matlab software. Coil efficiency, power inverter efficiency and overall system efficiency were also calculated. This <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> method for fiber optics joints is repeatable, consistent, generates uniform heat and is more convenient for site-specific heat generated on workpiece.

Finally, <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> systems cannot be used with moldings that have brass or steel inserts because the <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> process can destroy or oxidize the insert.|$|R
