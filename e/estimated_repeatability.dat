40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the effects of populations and mother trees over some characteristics on pequi (Caryocar brasiliense Camb.) fruits as well as their repeatability coefficient. Data came from two populations with 15 mother trees each, covering three years. The following physical and chemical characteristics were evaluated: total fruit weight; external mesocarp weight; number of putamens per fruit; total weight of putamens; total and average pulp weight; and proportion of the weight of lipids and proteins in relation to pulp weight. Analysis of variance was performed using a nested design model. The effects of mother trees within populations were highly significant for all variables under study, while the effects of populations were not for any characteristic, showing that for populations and mother trees, efforts must be focused on the number of mother trees per population rather than on populations. The <b>estimated</b> <b>repeatability</b> coefficients showed high genetic control for total fruit weight; external mesocarp weight; average weight of putamens; average pulp weight; and proportion of the weight of lipids in relation to pulp weight.

The data included were 180 records of milk production collected from first, second and third lactation. The objectives of the study were : (1) to estimate heritability and repeatability of the milk production, (2) to compute accuracy, response and effectiveness of individual selection on different selection methods and intensities, (3) to study the best lactation period for selection in dairy cattle. Some conclusion can be drawn: (1) the <b>estimated</b> <b>repeatability</b> of milk production was considered low, the opposite was true for heritability estimate, (2) the selection response and its effectiveness increased when the number of animals maintained in the population decreased, (3) the selection accuracy increased along with the increased of number of record included, (4) the highest selection accuracy was obtained from individual selection with three records whilst the family selection resulted in the lowest selection accuracy.

This paper describes the different approaches required for precision assessment, depending on whether yields or nicotine ratios are being studied. The widely used approach of assessment of yield precision is to perform a collaborative study using a standardised method.

In fish, nest construction has been suggested to reflect qualities of individual builders, but little is known about how consistent individual differences are over time. If nest construction does reliably reflect builder quality, then we expect consistent variation between individuals in this extended phenotypic trait. We test this hypothesis in male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring the repeatability of nest characteristics. We encouraged males, caught from four populations in mid-Wales, U. K., to complete three consecutive nests under standardized laboratory conditions.

40|$|Data from 274 Dutch herds {{recording}} clinical mastitis (CM) over an 18 -month {{period were}} used to quantify the genetic variation for overall and pathogen-specific CM. Analysed pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), Escherichia coli, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and other streptococci. The data set contained 47 563 lactations of 28 695 cows of different parities. Cases of overall and pathogen-specific CM were treated as all-or-none traits. Variance components for the sire, maternal grandsire and permanent environmental effect were estimated using generalized linear mixed models with a logit link function for the binary traits. Average number of days at risk and in milk on trial was 198 days. The estimated heritability for overall CM was 0. 04, and similar heritabilities for the pathogen-specific CM were <b>estimated.</b> <b>Repeatability</b> across lactations was low for overall and pathogen-specific CM (0. 10 to 0. 14). Genetic correlations with milk yield and somatic cell score (SCS) differed according to pathogen. For instance, the incidence rate of clinical E. coli mastitis was slightly unfavourably correlated with milk yield at 150 days (0. 13) but stronger with SCS (0. 74). Whereas, the genetic correlations with clinical Str. dysgalactiae mastitis were 0. 70 and 0. 16, respectively.

Our findings during a farmers&#x 2019; survey in the Lotkho area of Chitral, Pakistan, revealed that the sheep native to the region, locally called &#x 201 c;Kari&#x 201 d;, gestates for a period of only three months. This duration is 25 - 40 % short of the usual gestation length and is shorter than ever recorded for the species. The mean and mode gestation length (GL) was 110 and 92 days respectively and was concentrated in three distinct clusters: day 87 - 95, 120 - 123 and 151 - 153, accounting for 52 % of all observations. GL was influenced by location, season of conception and lambing and the interaction of location with season; had an <b>estimated</b> <b>repeatability</b> of zero.

Crossbred progeny of IdF sires were 10 % heavier than purebred Dorpers at weaning. A corresponding difference {{in favour of}} ML sires amounted to 5 %. IdF crossbred lambs reached slaughter weight earlier than the other cross lambs and purebred Dorper lambs. Lamb mortality prior to weaning was unaffected by the breed of the service sire, and ranged between 0. 13 for lambs sired by IdF rams to 0. 22 for purebred Dorper lambs. Ewe joining weight, as well as number of lambs born and weaned per ewe lambed was independent of the breed of the service sire. When weight of lamb weaned per ewe lambed was considered, there was a tendency towards higher lamb outputs in ewes that were joined to IdF and SAMM sires. <b>Estimated</b> <b>repeatability</b> derived for joining weight and the various measures of reproduction generally accorded with literature estimates. Backfat depth (taken at the 13 th rib, 25 mm from the midline) indicated that purebred Dorper lambs had a thicker fat cover compared to all combinations of crossbred lambs.

40|$|Background: Highly {{polygenic}} traits such as fruit weight, {{sugar content}} and acidity strongly influence the agroeconomic value of peach varieties. Genomic Selection (GS) can accelerate peach yield and quality gain if predictions show {{higher levels of}} accuracy compared to phenotypic selection. The available IPSC 9 K SNP array V 1 allows standardized and highly reliable genotyping, preparing the ground for GS in peach. Results: A repeatability model (multiple records per individual plant) for genome-enabled predictions in eleven European peach populations is presented. The analysis included 1147 individuals derived from both commercial and non-commercial peach or peach-related accessions. Considered traits were average fruit weight (FW), sugar content (SC) and titratable acidity (TA). Plants were genotyped with the 9 K IPSC array, grown in three countries (France, Italy, Spain) and phenotyped for 3 – 5 years. An analysis of imputation accuracy of missing genotypic data was conducted using the software Beagle, showing {{that two of the}} eleven populations were highly sensitive to increasing levels of missing data. The regression model produced, for each trait and each population, estimates of heritability (FW: 0. 35, SC: 0. 48, TA: 0. 53, on average) and repeatability (FW: 0. 56, SC: 0. 63, TA: 0. 62, on average).

Results differed by populations and traits, but predictive abilities were in general high (FW: 0. 60, SC: 0. 72, TA: 0. 65, on average). Conclusions: This study assessed the feasibility of Genomic Selection in peach for highly polygenic traits linked to yield and fruit quality. The accuracy of imputing missing genotypes was as high as 96 %, and the genomic predictive ability was on average 0. 65, but could be as high as 0. 84 for fruit weight or 0. 83 for titratable acidity. The <b>estimated</b> <b>repeatability</b> may prove very useful in the management of the typical long cycles involved in peach productions. All together, these results are very promising for the application of genomic selection to peach breeding programmes...|$|E
40|$|Repeatability is an {{important}} concept in evolutionary analyses because it provides information regarding the benefit of repeated measurements and, in most cases, a putative upper limit to heritability <b>estimates.</b> <b>Repeatability</b> (R) of different aspects of energy metabolism and behavior has been demonstrated {{in a variety of}} organisms over short and long time intervals. Recent research suggests that consistent individual differences in behavior and energy metabolism might covary. Here we present new data on the repeatability of body mass, standard metabolic rate (SMR), voluntary exploratory behavior, and feeding rate in a semiaquatic salamander and ask whether individual variation in behavioral traits is correlated with individual variation in metabolism on a whole-animal basis and after conditioning on body mass. All measured traits were repeatable, but the <b>repeatability</b> <b>estimates</b> ranged from very high for body mass (R = 0. 98), to intermediate for SMR (R = 0. 39) and food intake (R = 0. 58), to low for exploratory behavior (R = 0. 25). Moreover, <b>repeatability</b> <b>estimates</b> for all traits except body mass declined over time (i. e., from 3 to 9 wk), although this pattern could be a consequence of the relatively low sample size used in this study. Despite significant repeatability in all traits, we find little evidence that behaviors are correlated with SMR at the phenotypic and among-individual levels when conditioned on body mass. Specifically, the phenotypic correlations between SMR and exploratory behavior were negative in all trials but significantly so in one trial only. Salamanders in this study showed individual variation in how their exploratory behavior changed across trials (but not body mass, SMR, and feed intake), which might have contributed to observed changing correlations across trials...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to <b>estimate</b> the <b>repeatability</b> of adaptability and stability parameters of common bean between years, within each biennium from 2003 to 2012, in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Grain yield data from trials of value for cultivation and use common bean were analyzed. Grain yield, ecovalence, regression coefficient, and coefficient of determination were estimated considering location and sowing season per year, within each biennium. Subsequently, a analysis of variance these estimates was carried out, and <b>repeatability</b> was <b>estimated</b> in the biennia. <b>Repeatability</b> <b>estimate</b> for grain yield {{in most of the}} biennia was relatively high, but for ecovalence and regression coefficient it was null or of small magnitude, which indicates that confidence on identification of common bean lines for recommendation is greater when using means of yield, instead of stability parameters...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{ultrasound}} {{is currently}} used for in vivo carcass evaluation of beef cattle. We <b>estimated</b> heritability and <b>repeatability</b> coefficients for ultrasound-measured carcass traits in Nelore cattle. We measured longissimus muscle area, backfat thickness, and rump fat thickness in {{male and female}} animals {{ranging in age from}} 10 to 26 months. The variance components were estimated by single-trait analysis using the derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood method, under an animal model. The complete data file included 3077 records of 1172 animals born between 2003 and 2008. Two analyses were performed using a repeatability model: a) all records of longissimus muscle area, backfat thickness, and rump fat thickness of animals aged 10 to 26 months, and b) considering two age periods (11 to 17 and 18 to 24 months). The heritability estimates ranged from 0. 33 to 0. 46 for longissimus muscle area, from 0. 20 to 0. 26 for backfat, and from 0. 26 to 0. 29 for rump fat, demonstrating that direct selection for these traits can provide genetic gain. The <b>repeatability</b> <b>estimates</b> were moderate, ranging from 0. 42 to 0. 73. The highest <b>repeatability</b> <b>estimates</b> were obtained for longissimus muscle area in both the first (0. 70) and second (0. 73) analyses. The <b>repeatability</b> <b>estimates</b> suggest that ultrasound measures are precise; higher precision was obtained for longissimus muscle area than for subcutaneous fat thickness. The latter could be obtained during periods of greater feed availability to increase precision...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] A {{number of}} chest {{radiographic}} scores {{have been developed}} to assess the severity of respiratory disease in cystic fibrosis but critical statistical evaluation has been limited. In particular, the chest radiograph component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical score has not previously been validated. Three different chest radiograph scores have been compared and the association between them and lung function tests investigated. METHODS [...] The interobserver and intraobserver variation of the Brasfield, NIH chest radiograph, and the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) chest radiograph score was assessed by three observers [...] a paediatric radiologist, a junior and a senior respiratory physician [...] who independently scored, on separate occasions, 62 chest radiographs randomly selected from three age strata of patients ranging from 7 to 18 years. Lung function tests were available for 61 patients obtained within three months of the chest radiograph. Two way analysis of variance was used to estimate components of variation in scores. RESULTS [...] Results were similar for the Brasfield and NIH scores, both of which demonstrated greater precision than the RCH score, but the <b>estimated</b> <b>repeatability</b> of the Brasfield and NIH scores can be expected to differ by up to 20 % of the maximum score. The reliabilities (intraclass correlation) are all reasonably high at 0. 74, 0. 73, and 0. 61 for the Brasfield, NIH, and RCH scores, respectively. The estimated correlation between radiographic scores and lung function tests, adjusted for attenuation caused by measurement error, showed a similar correlation for all three scoring methods ranging from 0. 55 to 0. 78. Correlations were slightly greater with FEV 1 % than FVC%. These correlations are substantial but not high, indicating that {{a large proportion of the}} variability in radiographic scores cannot be explained by lung function measurements. CONCLUSIONS [...] The Brasfield and NIH chest radiograph scores have very similar statistical profiles and can be equally recommended if a chest radiograph score is to be used. The RCH radiographic score appears to be less reliable. The limitations of these scores need to be understood...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Ranks {{have been}} used as phenotypes in the genetic {{evaluation}} of horses for a long time through the use of earnings, normal score or raw ranks. A model, ("underlying model" of an unobservable underlying variable responsible for ranks) exists. Recently, a full Bayesian analysis using this model was developed. In addition, in reality, competitions are structured into categories according to the technical level of difficulty linked to the technical ability of horses (horses considered to be the "best" meet their peers). The aim of this article was to validate the underlying model through simulations and to propose a more appropriate model with a mixture distribution of horses {{in the case of a}} structured competition. The simulations involved 1000 horses with 10 to 50 performances per horse and 4 to 20 horses per event with unstructured and structured competitions. Results The underlying model responsible for ranks performed well with unstructured competitions by drawing liabilities in the Gibbs sampler according to the following rule: the liability of each horse must be drawn in the interval formed by the liabilities of horses ranked before and after the particular horse. The <b>estimated</b> <b>repeatability</b> was the simulated one (0. 25) and regression between estimated competing ability of horses and true ability was close to 1. Underestimations of repeatability (0. 07 to 0. 22) were obtained with other traditional criteria (normal score or raw ranks), but in the case of a structured competition, repeatability was underestimated (0. 18 to 0. 22). Our results show that the effect of an event, or category of event, is irrelevant in such a situation because ranks are independent of such an effect. The proposed mixture model pools horses according to their participation in different categories of competition during the period observed. This last model gave better results (repeatability 0. 25), in particular, it provided an improved estimation of average values of competing ability of the horses in the different categories of events. Conclusions The underlying model was validated. A correct drawing of liabilities for the Gibbs sampler was provided. For a structured competition, the mixture model with a group effect assigned to horses gave the best results. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 2, 600 methane (CH 4) and 1, 847 CO 2 {{measurements}} of sheep housed for 1 h in portable accumulation chambers (PAC) were recorded at 5 sites from the Australian Sheep CRC Information Nucleus, which {{was set up}} to test leading young industry sires for an extensive range of current and novel production traits. The final validated dataset had 2, 455 methane records from 2, 279 animals, which were the progeny of 187 sires and 1, 653 dams with 7, 690 animals in the pedigree file. The protocol involved rounding up animals from pasture into a holding paddock before the first measurement on each day and then measuring in groups of up to 16 sheep {{over the course of the}} day. Methane emissions declined linearly (with different slopes for each site) with time since the sheep were drafted into the holding area. After log transformation, <b>estimated</b> <b>repeatability</b> (rpt) and heritability (h(2)) of liveweight-adjusted CH 4 emissions averaged 25 % and 11. 7 %, respectively, for a single 1 -h measurement. Sire × site interactions were small and nonsignificant. Correlations between EBV for methane emissions and Sheep Genetics Australia EBV for production traits were used as approximations to genetic correlations. Apart from small positive correlations with weaning and yearling weights (r = 0. 21 - 0. 25, P < 0. 05), there were no significant relationships between production trait and methane EBV (calculated from a model adjusting for liveweight by fitting separate slopes for each site). To improve accuracy, future protocols should use the mean of 2 (rpt = 39 %, h(2) = 18. 6 %) or 3 (rpt = 48 %, h(2) = 23. 2 %) PAC measurements. Repeat tests under different pasture conditions and time of year should also be considered, as well as protocols measuring animals directly off pasture instead of rounding them up in the morning. Reducing the time in the PAC from 1 h to 40 min would have a relatively small effect on overall accuracy and partly offset the additional time needed for more tests per animal. Field testing in PAC has the potential to provide accurate comparisons of animal and site methane emissions, with potentially lower cost/increased accuracy compared to alternatives such as SF 6 tracers or open path lasers. If similar results are obtained from tests with different protocols/seasonal conditions, use of PAC measurements in a multitrait selection index with production traits could potentially reduce methane emissions from Australian sheep for the same production level...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate genetic correlations between yield traits of cows treated with bovine somatotropin (bST) and the same yield traits of untreated cows. Lactation records from registered Holstein cows were divided by parity into 3 data sets: 1, 2, and 3 through 5. Approximately 10 % of the records in each data set were from cows treated with bST. The numbers of records of treated and untreated cows in the data sets were 4, 337 and 48, 765; 3, 730 and 37, 796; and 3, 645 and 33, 957. Two-trait animal models (records for cows treated or not treated) were used to estimate genetic parameters for milk production traits and somatic cell score (SCS). Estimates of heritability for milk yield for records of treated and untreated cows for the 3 data sets were 0. 13, 0. 16, and 0. 09, and 0. 18, 0. 18, and 0. 14, respectively, with <b>estimates</b> of <b>repeatability</b> of 0. 50 and 0. 41 for data set 3. Estimates of heritability for fat yield for records of treated and untreated cows were 0. 31, 0. 16, and 0. 12, and 0. 27, 0. 21, and 0. 16. <b>Estimates</b> of <b>repeatability</b> were 0. 50 and 0. 43 for data set 3. Heritability estimates for protein yield for records of treated and untreated cows were 0. 13, 0. 17, and 0. 12, and 0. 20, 0. 23, and 0. 16, with <b>estimates</b> of <b>repeatability</b> of 0. 52 and 0. 47. Estimates of heritability for SCS for treated and untreated cows were 0. 08, 0. 15, and 0. 13, and 0. 11, 0. 13, and 0. 13 with <b>repeatability</b> <b>estimates</b> of 0. 52 and 0. 45.

Estimates of genetic correlations for fat and protein yields were 0. 96 for all data sets. Estimates for SCS were 0. 99. Estimates of genetic correlations between records of treated and untreated cows were large enough to conclude that records of treated and untreated cows could be considered to be one trait, with treatment as a fixed effect to account for differences in means...|$|R
40|$|Purpose We {{developed}} a novel technique to measure in-vivo corneal nerve migration, and determined its repeatability and clinical utility in diabetic neuropathy. Methods Wide-field montages of the sub-basal corneal nerve plexus were generated at baseline and {{after three weeks}} for 14 participants (control participants (n= 4); diabetic participants without (n= 5) and with (n= 5) neuropathy). Montages were manually examined side by side to identify a referent landmark in the inferior whorl region and 20 additional nerve landmarks throughout each montage. An algorithm was developed to measure nerve migration by quantifying {{the movement of the}} nerve landmarks relative to the inferior whorl landmark over the three-week period, with migration reported in microns per week. Intra- and inter-observer repeatabilities were determined by measurement of nerve migration on the pair of montaged images by one researcher on two occasions, five days apart, and by two observers respectively. A paired t-test was used to compare {{the difference between the two}} measurements. Bland–Altman plots were generated to assess agreement and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to <b>estimate</b> <b>repeatability.</b> To illustrate it’s clinical utility, we compared the average nerve migration between the three groups.
