50|$|Asian American {{women are}} {{at higher risk}} for getting osteoporosis, because of lower bone mass and smaller body <b>frames.</b> <b>Lower</b> calcium intake amplifies this risk. As many as 90% of Asian Americans are lactose intolerant, or have trouble digesting dairy products. Furthermore, less time spent {{outdoors}} means less vitamin D production, which translates to less calcium absorption. In many Asian cultures, people feel that women with lighter skin tones are more attractive. These factors are further compounded by inadequate knowledge about osteoporosis and calcium consumption among Asian women.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of cell (Hydrostatic {{horizontal}} cell (HHC)) developed for continuous electroplating of strip is described. The cell consists of upper <b>frame,</b> <b>lower</b> <b>frame,</b> upper anode, <b>lower</b> anode, liquid baffle, conductive roll, backup roll, edge mask and its control system etc. The upper and lower hydrostatic cavities are located at {{the middle of the}} cell. The HHC adopts an innovative operating principle to generate strong capability of using hydrostatic pressure to grip the strip and to correct the strip twist. It thereby remarkably decreases the running space height and the deviation-from-center error of the strip in the cell. It originally builds up the horizontal spray of electrolyte to both directions {{at the center of the}} cell. Consequently the gas exhausting ability of the cell and the electroplating efficiency are improved. The cell has improved overall technical performances over conventional horizontal cells, and it is capable to effectively prevent short circuiting between the strip and the anodes. In general, the advantages of HHC include stable operation, excellent coating quality, high current density, low power consumption, and simple as well as compact equipment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the study}} of Weyl–Heisenberg frames the {{assumption}} of having a finite frame upper bound appears recurrently. In this article it is shown that it actually depends critically on the time–frequency lattice used. Indeed, for any irrational α> 0 we can construct a smooth g∈ L 2 (R) such that for any two rationals a > 0 and b > 0 the collection (gna, mb) n, m∈ Zof time–frequency translates of ghas a finite frame upper bound, while for any β> 0 and any rational c> 0 the collection (gncα, mβ) n, m∈ Zhas no such bound. It follows from a theorem of I. Daubechies, {{as well as from}} the general atomic theory developed by Feichtinger and Gröchenig, that for any nonzero g∈ L 2 (R) which is sufficiently well behaved, there exist ac> 0, bc> 0 such that (gn a, m b) n, m∈ Zis a frame whenever 0 0, b > 0, b < 1. In the second example, the <b>frame</b> <b>lower</b> bound equals 0 for all aof the form l· 3 − kwith l, k∈ N and all b, 0 < b < 1, while the <b>frame</b> <b>lower</b> bound is at least 1 for all aof the form (2 m) − 1 with m∈ N and all b, 0 < b < 1...|$|R

SubCompact Alpha and Standard Alpha models were introduced in late 2014/early 2015. All models have a DA/SA trigger, ambidextrous decocker and a TIAIN-coated steel slide. The Compacts are also available with threaded barrels. In the Compact size (7.40" [...] overall length) are the Black, Krypton and Sand lines, featuring hard anodized aluminum upper and <b>lower</b> <b>frames</b> (29.06-29.72 oz), and the Duo-Tone and Stainless Steel lines with all steel upper and <b>lower</b> <b>frames</b> (42.43-42.64 oz).

To accomplish his object then, he made his way down to the very edge of the roof, sliding carefully on his stomach until his feet found support against the marble gutter, the ladder meanwhile remaining hooked by one of its rungs to the sill of the dormer.|$|R
