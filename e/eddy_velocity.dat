40|$|Multiple {{alternating}} zonal jets are a ubiquitous {{feature of}} planetary atmospheres and oceans. However, {{most studies to}} date {{have focused on the}} special case of barotropic jets. Here we investigate the dynamics of freely evolving baroclinic jets, using a two-layer quasi-geostrophic annulus model with sloping topography. In a suite of 15 numerical simulations, the baroclinic Rossby radius and baroclinic Rhines scale are sam-pled by varying the stratification and root-mean-square <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity,</b> respectively. Small-scale eddies in the initial state evolve through geostrophic turbulence and accelerate zonally as they grow in horizontal scale, first isotropically and then anisotropically. This process leads ultimately to the formation of jets, which take about 2, 500 rotation periods to equilibrate. The kinetic energy spectrum of the equilibrated baroclinic zonal flow steepens from a − 3 power law at small scales to a − 5 power law near the jet scale. The conditions most favorable for producing multiple alternating baroclinic jets are large baroclinic Rossby radius (i. e., strong stratification) and small baroclinic Rhines scale (i. e., weak root-mean-square <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity).</b> The baroclinic jet width is diagnosed objectively and found to be 2. 2 – 2. 8 times larger than the baroclinic Rhines scale, with a best estimate of 2. 5 times larger. This finding suggests that Rossby wave motions must be moving at speeds of approximately 6 times the turbulent <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity</b> in order to be capable of arresting the isotropi...|$|E
40|$|A {{parameterization}} for eddy buoyancy fluxes {{for use in}} coarse-grid {{models is}} developed and tested against eddy-resolving simulations. The development {{is based on the}} assumption that the eddies are adiabatic (except near the surface) and the observation that the flux of buoyancy is affected by barotropic, depth-independent eddies. Like the previous parameterizations of Gent and McWilliams (GM) and Visbeck et al. (VMHS), the horizontal flux of a tracer is proportional to the local large-scale horizontal gradient of the tracer through a transfer coefficient assumed to be given by the product of a typical <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity</b> scale and a typical mixing length. The proposed parameterization differs from GM and VMHS in the selection of the <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity</b> scale, which is based on the kinetic energy balance of baroclinic eddies. The three parameterizations are compared to eddy-resolving computations in a variety of forcing configurations and for several sets of parameters.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dynamical}} processes {{through which the}} Tibetan Plateau (TP) influences the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) {{within the framework of}} the moist static energy (MSE) budget, using both observations and atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations. The focus is on the most prominent feature of the EASM, the so-called meiyu–baiu (MB), which is characterized by a well-defined, southwest–northeast elongated quasi-stationary rainfall band, spanning from eastern China to Japan and into the northwestern Pacific Ocean between mid-June and mid-July. Observational analyses of the MSE budget of the MB front indicate that horizontal advection of moist enthalpy, and primarily of dry enthalpy, sustains the front in a region of otherwise negative net energy input into the atmospheric column. A decomposition of the horizontal dry enthalpy advection into mean, transient, and stationary eddy fluxes identifies the longitudinal thermal gradient due to zonal asymmetries and the meridional stationary <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity</b> as the most influential factors determining the pattern of horizontal moist enthalpy advection. Numerical simulations in which the TP is either retained or removed show that the TP influences the stationary enthalpy flux, and hence the MB front, primarily by changing the meridional stationary <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity,</b> with reinforced southerly wind over the MB region and northerly wind to its north. Changes in the longitudinal thermal gradient are mainly confined to the near downstream of the TP, with the resulting changes in zonal warm air advection having a lesser impact on the rainfall in the extended MB region...|$|E

40|$|The 2 -day wave is {{investigated}} in a three-dimensional {{model of the}} nonlinear primitive equations. Extending upward from the tropopause into the thermosphere, the model is forced stochastically by fluctuations of tropospheric wave structure. The behavior recovered is broadly consistent with linear calculations of the Rossby-gravity normal mode {{in the presence of}} instability. The mode's amplification depends sensitively upon details of the zonal-mean flow, which determine instability through a reversal of potential vorticity (PV) gradient. On the other hand, the mode's period and structure are robust. They retain much the same form under a variety of conditions. The response is sharply discriminated to wave number 3 and westward periods of 2. 0 - 2. 3 days, even though forcing is broadband. Under January conditions, strong easterlies and the accompanying reversal of PV gradient enable the mode to amplify through sympathetic interaction with the mean flow. The amplifying signal eventually emerges from random variability, which is excited by broadband forcing. Amplification continues until <b>eddy</b> <b>velocities</b> approach 70 m/s, whereupon the signal saturates. Horizontal mixing then ensues, destroying the meridional gradient of PV, which in turn limits instability and further amplification. Under June conditions the response fluctuates randomly during the entire integration, with no evidence of sustained amplification. Nevertheless, it too is sharply discriminated to westward periods of 2. 0 - 2. 3 days, achieving <b>eddy</b> <b>velocities</b> of 10 - 20 m/s. The sharply discriminated response appears even when a reversal of PV gradient is absent, leaving the mean flow stable. Under all of these conditions the structure of eddy stream function Ψ′ is nearly barotropic, with antisymmetric character between the hemispheres. Eddy motion assumes the form of a wave-number- 3 pattern of equatorial gyres, reducing in the tropics to v′ and strong cross-equatorial motion. The pattern is very similar to the limiting structure of the 2 -day wave observed by UARS. Although magnified in the summer stratosphere and mesosphere, the structure of Ψ′ is global, with a phase reversal between the hemispheres. The modal structure extends upward into the thermosphere and, albeit weaker, as low as the tropopause...|$|R

For weak nonlinearity, as found in the tropics, the mixing length mostly corresponds to the stability threshold for baroclinic instability whereas the eddy radius corresponds to the Rhines scale; it is suggested that this mismatch is indicative of the inverse energy cascade that occurs at low latitudes {{in the ocean}} and the zonal elongation of eddies. At larger values of nonlinearity, as found at mid- and high-latitudes, the eddy length scales are much shorter than the stability threshold, within a factor of 2. 5 of the Rossby deformation radius...|$|E

The eddy, which lasted around 1 month, modified the thermohaline characteristics and the currents of the entire water column. Levantine Intermediate Waters, usually resident in the region, were displaced by colder and fresher Western Mediterranean Intermediate Waters associated with the eddy.

Both Saturn's large-scale cloud bands and the distribution of its local cloud features have a characteristic zonal organization. The region between 30 N and 45 N contains two oppositely directed jets in close proximity, with many bright, active features in the westward jet, and an unusual ribbonlike wave feature encircling the planet in the eastward jet. Several of the smaller features within the westward jet do not remain at fixed latitudes and interact with each other. One group of v-shaped features is found to have periods of high activity correlated with the passage of a cyclonic bright spot. The ribbon wave was Fourier analyzed to determine its spectral composition. The greatest power is near wave number 9, with significant additional peaks appearing at planetary wave numbers 19, 25 - 27, 35 - 38, and 47 - 51. The phase velocity increases with wave number but is not well described by a Rossby-Haurwitz dispersion relation.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{enhancing}} {{our fundamental}} {{understanding of the}} East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), and mechanisms implicated in its climatology in present-day and warmer climates. We focus on the most prominent feature of the EASM, i. e., the so-called Meiyu-Baiu (MB), which {{is characterized by a}} well-defined, southwest to northeast elongated quasi-stationary rainfall band, spanning from eastern China to Japan and into the northwestern Pacific Ocean in June and July. We begin with an observational study of the energetics of the MB front in present-day climate. Analyses of the moist static energy (MSE) budget of the MB front indicate that horizontal advection of moist enthalpy, primarily of dry enthalpy, sustains the front in a region of otherwise negative net energy input into the atmospheric column. A decomposition of the horizontal dry enthalpy advection into mean, transient, and stationary eddy fluxes identifies the longitudinal thermal gradient due to zonal asymmetries and the meridional stationary <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity</b> as the most influential factors determining the pattern of horizontal moist enthalpy advection. Numerical simulations in which the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is either retained or removed show that the TP influences the stationary enthalpy flux, and hence the MB front, primarily by changing the meridional stationary <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity,</b> with reinforced southerly wind on the northwestern flank of the north Pacific subtropical high (NPSH) over the MB region and northerly wind to its north. Changes in the longitudinal thermal gradient are mainly confined to the near downstream of the TP, with the resulting changes in zonal warm air advection having a lesser impact on the rainfall in the extended MB region. Similar mechanisms are shown to be implicated in present climate simulations in the Couple Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 5 (CMIP 5) models. We find that the spatial distribution of the EASM precipitation simulated by different models is highly correlated with the meridional stationary <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity.</b> The correlation becomes more robust when energy fluxes into the atmospheric column are considered, consistent with the observational analyses. The spread in the area-averaged rainfall amount can be partially explained by the spread in the simulated globally-averaged precipitation, with the rest primarily due to the lower-level meridional wind convergence. Clear relationships between precipitation and zonal and meridional eddy velocities are observed. Finally, the response of the EASM to greenhouse gas forcing is investigated at different time scales in CMIP 5 model simulations. The reduction of radiative cooling and the increase in continental surface temperature occur much more rapidly than changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Without changes in SSTs, the rainfall in the monsoon region decreases (increases) over ocean (land) in most models. On longer time scales, as SSTs increase, rainfall changes are opposite. The total response to atmospheric CO^ 2 forcing and subsequent SST warming is a large (modest) increase in rainfall over ocean (land) in the EASM region. Dynamic changes, in spite of significant contributions from the thermodynamic component, {{play an important role in}} setting up the spatial pattern of precipitation changes. Rainfall anomalies over East China are a direct consequence of local land-sea contrast, while changes in the larger-scale oceanic rainfall band are closely associated with the displacement of the larger-scale NPSH. Numerical simulations show that topography and SST patterns play an important role in rainfall changes in the EASM region. </p...|$|E

The utility of a diffusive picture for the near surface poleward flux of heat is emphasized, as {{is the extent to}} which a full closure theory for the troposphere, including the interior potential vorticity fluxes, must revolve around this theory for the heat flux. A central problem in general circulation theory is then to determine which factors control the horizontal diffusivity near the surface. The baroclinic eddy production problem has distinctive features that make it stand out from other inhomogeneous turbulence problems such as Benard convection and laboratory shear flows, the crucial point being that there can be scale separation between the eddies and the scale of the mean flow inhomogeneity in the direction of the relevant transport. This scale separation makes diffusive closures more compelling. In addition, it allows one to compute diffusivities from models of homogeneous turbulence. 1.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss two issues, the {{inter-comparison}} of four mixed layer mesoscale parameterizations {{and the search for}} the <b>eddy</b> induced <b>velocity</b> for an arbitrary tracer. It must be stressed that our analysis is limited to mixed layer mesoscales since we do not treat sub-mesoscales and small turbulent mixing. As for the first item, since three of the four parameterizations are expressed in terms of a stream function and a residual flux of the RMT formalism (residual mean theory), while the fourth is expressed in terms of vertical and horizontal fluxes, we needed a formalism to connect the two formulations. The standard RMT representation developed for the deep ocean cannot be extended to the mixed layer since its stream function does not vanish at the ocean's surface. We develop a new RMT representation that satisfies the surface boundary condition. As for the general form of the <b>eddy</b> induced <b>velocity</b> for an arbitrary tracer, thus far, it has been assumed that there is only the one that originates from the curl of the stream function. This is because it was assumed that the tracer residual flux is purely diffusive. On the other hand, we show {{that in the case of}} an arbitrary tracer, the residual flux has also a skew component that gives rise to an additional bolus velocity. Therefore, instead of only one bolus velocity, there are now two, one coming from the curl of the stream function and other from the skew part of the residual flux. In the buoyancy case, only one bolus velocity contributes to the mean buoyancy equation since the residual flux is indeed only diffusive...|$|R
40|$|Storm tracks play a {{major role}} in {{regulating}} the precipitation and hydrological cycle in midlatitudes. The changes in the location and amplitude of the storm tracks in response to global warming will have significant impacts on the poleward transport of heat, momentum and moisture and on the hydrological cycle. Recent studies have indicated a poleward shift of the storm tracks and the midlatitude precipitation zone in the warming world that will lead to subtropical drying and higher latitude moistening. This study agrees with this key feature for not only the annual mean but also different seasons and for the zonal mean as well as horizontal structures based on the analysis of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) CM 2. 1 model simulations. Further analyses show that the meridional sensible and latent heat fluxes associated with the storm tracks shift poleward and intensify in both boreal summer and winter in the late twenty-first century (years 2081 - 2100) relative to the latter half of the twentieth century (years 1961 - 2000). The maximum dry Eady growth rate is examined to determine the effect of global warming on the time mean state and associated available potential energy for transient growth. The trend in maximum Eady growth rate is generally consistent with the poleward shift and intensification of the storm tracks in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres in both seasons. However, in the lower troposphere in northern winter, increased meridional eddy transfer within the storm tracks is more associated with increased <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity,</b> stronger correlation between <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity</b> and eddy moist static energy, and longer eddy length scale. The changing characteristics of baroclinic instability are, therefore, needed to explain the storm track response as climate warms. Diagnosis of the latitude-by-latitude energy budget for the current and future climate demonstrates how the coupling between radiative and surface heat fluxes and eddy heat and moisture transport influences the midlatitude storm track response to global warming. Through radiative forcing by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapor, more energy is gained within the tropics and subtropics, while in the middle and high latitudes energy is reduced through increased outgoing terrestrial radiation in the Northern Hemisphere and increased ocean heat uptake in the Southern Hemisphere. This enhanced energy imbalance in the future climate requires larger atmospheric energy transports in the midlatitudes which are partially accomplished by intensified storm tracks. Finally a sequence of cause and effect for the storm track response in the warming world is proposed that combines energy budget constraints with baroclinic instability theory...|$|E
40|$|The Reynolds stress {{induced by}} anisotropically forcing an {{unbounded}} Couette flow, with uniform shear γ, on a β-plane, is calculated {{in conjunction with}} the eddy diffusivity of a co-evolving passive tracer. The flow is damped by linear drag on a time scale µ − 1. The stochastic forcing is white-noise in time and its spatial anisotropy is controlled by a parameter α, that characterizes whether eddies are elongated along the zonal direction (α 0) or are isotropic (α = 0). The Reynolds stress varies linearly with α and non-linearly and non-monotonically with γ; but the Reynolds stress is independent of β. For positive values of α, the Reynolds stress displays a “anti-frictional ” effect (energy is transferred from the eddies to the mean flow) and a frictional effect for negative values of α. When γ/µ ≪ 1, these transfers can be identified as negative and positive eddy-viscosities, respectively.

40|$|This study {{combines}} the experimental measurements with large-eddy simulation (LES) data of a neutral {{planetary boundary layer}} (PBL) documented by a 60 -m tower instrumented with eight sonic anemometers, and a high-resolution Doppler lidar during the 1999 Cooperative Atmospheric and Surface Exchange Study (CASES- 99) experiment. The target of the paper is (i) to investigate the multiscale nature of the turbulent eddies in the surface layer (SL), (ii) to explain {{the existence of a}} − 1 power law in the velocity fluctuation spectra, and (iii) to investigate the different nature of turbulence in the two sublayers within the SL, which are the eddy surface layer (ESL; lower sublayer of the SL lying between the surface and about 20 -m height) and the shear surface layer (SSL; lying between the ESL top and the SL top). The sonic anemometers and Doppler lidar prove to be proper instruments for LES validation, and in particular, the Doppler lidar because of its ability to map near-surface eddies. This study shows the different nature of turbulence in the ESL and the SSL in terms of organized <b>eddies,</b> <b>velocity</b> fluctuation spectra, and second-order moment statistics. If quantitative agreement is found in the SSL between the LES and the measurements, only qualitative similarity is found in the ESL due to the subgrid-scale model, indicating that the LES captures part of the physics of the ESL. The LES helps explain the origin of the − 1 power-law spectral subrange evidence in the velocity fluctuation spectra computed in the SL using the CASES- 99 dataset: strong interaction between the mean flow and the fluctuating vorticities is found in the SL, and turbulent production is found to be larger than turbulent energy transfer for k 1 z > 1 (k 1 being the longitudinal wavenumber and z the height), which is the condition of the − 1 power-law existence...|$|R
40|$|The Reynolds stress {{induced by}} anisotropically forcing an {{unbounded}} Couette flow, with uniform shear g, on a b plane, is calculated {{in conjunction with}} the eddy diffusivity of a coevolving passive tracer. The flow is damped by linear drag on a time scale m 21. The stochastic forcing is white noise in time and its spatial anisotropy is controlled by a parameter a that characterizes whether eddies are elongated along the zonal direction (a, 0), are elongated along themeridional direction (a. 0), or are isotropic (a 5 0). TheReynolds stress varies linearly with a and nonlinearly and nonmonotonically with g, but the Reynolds stress is in-dependent of b. For positive values of a, the Reynolds stress displays an ‘‘antifrictional’ ’ effect (energy is transferred from the eddies to the mean flow); for negative values of a, it displays a frictional effect. When g/m 1, these transfers can be identified as negative and positive eddy viscosities, respectively. With g 5 b 5 0, the meridional tracer eddy diffusivity is y 02 /(2 m), where y 0 is the meridional <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity.</b> In general, nonzero b and g suppress the eddy diffusivity below y 02 /(2 m). When the shear is strong, the sup-pression due to g varies as g 21 while the suppression due to b varies between b 21 and b 22 depending on whether the shear is strong or weak, respectively. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} theory for the density {{fluctuations}} of aerodynamic grains, {{embedded in a}} (high Reynolds number) turbulent, gravitating gas disk. The theory combines calculations for the average behavior {{of a group of}} grains encoun-tering a single turbulent eddy, with a hierarchical description of the <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity</b> statistics. We show that this makes analytic predictions {{for a wide range of}} quantities, including: the distribution of volume-average grain densities, the power spectrum and correlation functions of grain density fluctuations, and the maximum volume density of grains reached. For each, we predict how these scale as a function of grain stopping/friction time ts, spatial scale, grain-to-gas mass ratio ρ̃, strength of the turbulence α, and detailed disk properties (orbital frequency Ω, gas density gradients, sound speed, etc.). We test these predictions against numerical simulations with externally driven (magneto-rotational, Kelvin-Helmholtz, or “forced”) or self-driven (streaming instability) turbulence. The simulations agree well with the analytic predictions, spanning a range of tsΩ ∼ 10 − 4 − 10, ρ ̃ ∼ 0 − 3, α ∼ 10 − 10 − 10 − 2, with and without verti-cal stratification or grain-gas back-reaction, and in different numbers of spatial dimensions. Results from “turbulent concentration ” simulations and laboratory experiments are also predicted as a special case (for Stokes and Reynolds numbers 1). We predict that vortices on a wide range of scales act to disperse and concentrate grains hierarchically (even if the gas is incompressible); for small grains this is most efficient in eddies with turnover time comparable t...|$|E
40|$|Mesoscale eddies play a {{major role}} in the {{transport}} of tracers in the ocean. Focusing on a sector in the east Pacific, the authors present estimates of eddy diffusivities derived from kinematic tracer simulations using satellite-observed velocity fields. Meridional diffusivities are diagnosed, and how they are related to eddy properties through the mixing length formulation of Ferrari and Nikurashin, which accounts for the suppression of diffusivity due to eddy propagation relative to the mean flow, is shown. The uniqueness of this study is that, through systematically varying the zonal-mean flow, a hypothetical “unsuppressed” diffusivity is diagnosed. At a given latitude, the unsuppressed diffusivity occurs when the zonal-mean flow equals the eddy phase speed. This provides an independent estimate of eddy phase propagation, which agrees well with theoretical arguments. It is also shown that the unsuppressed diffusivity is predicted very well by classical mixing length theory, that is, that it is proportional to the rms <b>eddy</b> <b>velocity</b> times the observed eddy size, with a spatially constant mixing efficiency of 0. 35. Then, the suppression factor is estimated and it is shown that it too can be understood quantitatively in terms of easily observed mean flow properties. The authors then extrapolate from these sector experiments to the global scale, making predictions for the global surface eddy diffusivity. Together with a prognostic equation for eddy kinetic energy and a theory explaining observed eddy sizes, these concepts could potentially be used in a closure for eddy diffusivities in coarse-resolution ocean climate models...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note is to examine in a more precise way how the Nusselt numbers for {{turbulent}} heat transfer in both the fully developed and thermal entrance regions of a circular tube are affected by two different wall boundary conditions. The comparisons are made for: (a) Uniform wall temperature (UWT); and (b) uniform wall heat flux (UHF). Several papers which have been concerned with the turbulent thermal entrance region problem are given. 1 Although these analyses have all utilized an eigenvalue formulation for the thermal entrance region there were differences in the choices of <b>eddy</b> diffusivity expressions, <b>velocity</b> distributions, and methods for carrying out the numerical solutions. These differences were {{also found in the}} fully developed analyses. Hence when making a comparison of the analytical results for uniform wall temperature and uniform wall heat flux, it was not known if differences in the Nusselt numbers could be wholly attributed to the difference in wall boundary conditions, since all the analytical results were not obtained in a consistent way. To have results which could be directly compared, computations were carried out for the uniform wall temperature case, using the same <b>eddy</b> diffusivity, <b>velocity</b> distribution, and digital computer program employed for uniform wall heat flux. In addition, the previous work was extended to a lower Reynolds number range so that comparisons could be made over a wide range of both Reynolds and Prandtl numbers...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of vortex structures is studied in an impinging jet of Reynolds number 10 000. The {{effect of the}} modulation of the nozzle exit velocity on the flow structure is studied by means of hot-wire anemometry. It is found that the velocity field can be modified by excitations {{of a wide range}} of frequencies. In most cases the excitation yields formation of large vortices, which provoke an unsteady flow separation at their impact onto the wall. The excitation at higher frequencies suppresses the roll-up of large <b>eddies.</b> The <b>velocity</b> fluctuations near the wall are then suppressed and the flow separation disappears. The effect is documented by phase averaging for the low nozzle-to-plate spacing. The time-averaged measurements show that the unsteady flow separation can be suppressed even for nozzle-to-plate spacing up to eight diameters...|$|R

The model exhibits anomalous inertial range scaling for the structure functions constructed from scalar differences. The model provides a simple computational test for recent ideas regarding closure and scaling for randomly advected passive scalars. Results suggest that high order structure function scaling depends on the largest <b>velocity</b> <b>eddy</b> size, and hence scaling exponents may be geometry-dependent and non-universal.
