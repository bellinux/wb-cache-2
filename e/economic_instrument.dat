40|$|Globally, {{the use of}} <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> for {{biodiversity}} conservation {{has gained}} a lot of support. This {{is because of the}} concern for the economic well being of people living in and near biodiversity-rich areas. Also, economic drivers are the main threats to biodiversity. This policy of using <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> is being used on a case-by-case basis worldwide. A review of their use from a global perspective is important to facilitate learning from issues resulting from their implementation. This article documents and reviews the specific <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> being used {{in different parts of the}} world for biodiversity conservation. An analysis of the <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> using a demand or supply classification suggests that more instruments are targeted at increasing supply of biological resources for human use. A review of literature and field documents was also employed to determine trends in the use of <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> for conservation.

One of the most efficient instruments for environmental protection are <b>economic</b> <b>instruments,</b> the indirect methods of influencing agents’ behaviour. The aim of the article is to present {{the state of the}} Polish system of <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> in the light of other European countries’ experiences (especially the European Union countries) and prospects for the use of <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> in the environmental policy during the oncoming years. The study is based on a subject literature review, reports ordered by the Polish Ministry of Environment and publications published by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OE CD) and the European Environment Agency (EEA). The analysis suggests that <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> are widely used in the Polish environmental policy. The main <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> in this policy are environmental charges and fines. Some of these charges and fines have been used in the Polish environmental policy for several dozen years. Revenues from these instruments are earmarked for environmental expenditures. There are also some new, interesting <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> applied in the Polish environmental policy, such as: deposit-refund systems, tradable energy certificates and emissions trading scheme. There are some opportunities for expanding the use of <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> for the environmental policy in Poland.

Pollution taxes are often grouped with two other economic policy instruments: tradable pollution permits/credits and subsidies. These three environmental economic policy instruments are built upon a foundation of a command and control regulation. The difference is that classic command-penalty regulations stipulate, through performance or prescriptive standards, what each polluter is required to do to be in compliance with the law. Command and control regulation is not considered an <b>economic</b> <b>instrument</b> as it is typically enforced by narrower means such as stop or control order, though it may include an administrative monetary penalty in site-specific regulations.

40|$|The key {{aspects of}} {{landfill}} operation that remain unresolved are the extended timescale and uncertain funding of the post-closure period. This paper reviews the topic and proposes an <b>economic</b> <b>instrument</b> to resolve the unsustainable nature of the current situation.

A landfill tax or aftercare provision rebate is proposed as an <b>economic</b> <b>instrument</b> to encourage operators to actively advance the stabilization of landfilled waste. The rebate could be accommodated within existing regulatory and tax regimes and would be paid for: (i) every tonne of nitrogen (or other agreed leachate marker) whose removal is advanced via the accelerated production and extraction of leachate; (ii) every tonne of non-commercially viable carbon removed via landfill gas collection and treatment. The rebates would be set {{at a level that}} would make it financially attractive to operators and would encourage measures such as leachate recirculation, in situ aeration, and enhanced flushing.

40|$|From an {{ecological}} point of view, <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> {{are to be}} preferred to other instruments of environmental policy, the command and control regulations in particular, for several reasons: They are more cost efficient {{in the short term}} in a static sense. While command and control regulations impose an emission ceiling or even a certain technology on each polluter, independently {{of the size of the}} individual firm's marginal costs in reducing emissions, <b>economic</b> <b>instruments,</b> like taxes or marketable permits, assign a "price" to the use of the environment and leave the distribution of the reduction in the emissions to the market process. In the long term, <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> provide dynamic incentives to reduce costs further and, moreover, have ecologically positive effects by inducing environmentally friendly technical progress: taxes as well as pollution permits assign a price to the pollution which remains after the short-term adjustment. Sometimes this price is given by the tax on the remaining pollution, sometimes the price is the opportunity costs of pollution, because less pollution would enable firms to sell their certificates in the market. In both cases the economic agents have an incentive to seek out new ways of avoiding the pollution of the environment. In comparison to command and control measures, <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> have the further advantage of lower administrative costs (this applies especially to product taxes, less to direct, so-called measured emission taxes which are rarely imposed). Finally, the authorities regulating pollution are confronted with incomplete information as to the emission reduction potential and its costs; in this respect, too, <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> via direct regulation are more efficient. Although <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> also suffer from some weaknesses, these are in general outweighed by the above mentioned advantages. When <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> are introduced slowly, not in a shock-like fashion, the macroeconomic aggregates are hardly affected, but the distribution of the costs of avoiding pollution and of the tax burden is changed, as is the distribution of the benefits of environmental protection. If this distribution proves undesirable, the design of <b>economic</b> <b>instruments</b> can be changed with the goal of ameliorating adjustment costs, of granting transitory assistance, and of exempting certain sectors. Environmental taxes, in particular, open up many possibilities, with regard to exemptions as well as to the recycling of tax receipts. Environmental policies appropriate for a sustainable economic development cannot be policies which regulate individual substances or emissions in isolation. Environmental taxes are an <b>instrument</b> to guide <b>economic</b> development in a certain direction, using economic incentives in coordination with other policy areas.
