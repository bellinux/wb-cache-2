25|$|The {{species is}} not {{closely related to}} other extant marsupials; the current {{arrangement}} in the order Dasyuromorphia places its monotypic family with the diverse and carnivorous species of <b>Dasyuridae.</b> A closer affinity with the extinct thylacine, contained in the same order, has been proposed. Genetic studies have shown the ancestors of the numbat diverged from other marsupials between 32 and 42 million years ago, during the late Eocene.|$|E

2500|$|Australia has the world's {{largest and}} most diverse range of marsupials. Marsupials are characterised by the {{presence}} of a pouch in which they rear their young. The carnivorous marsupialsâ€”order Dasyuromorphiaare represented by two surviving families: the <b>Dasyuridae</b> with 51 members, and the Myrmecobiidae with the numbat as its sole surviving member. The Tasmanian tiger was the largest Dasyuromorphia and the last living specimen of the family Thylacinidae died in captivity in 1936. The world's largest surviving carnivorous marsupial is the Tasmanian devil; it {{is the size of a}} small dog and can hunt, although it is mainly a scavenger. It became extinct on the mainland some 600 years ago, and is now found only in Tasmania. There are four species of quoll, or [...] "native cat", all of which are threatened species. The Eastern quoll for example is believed to have been extinct on the mainland since the 1960s, though [...] The remainder of the <b>Dasyuridae</b> are referred to as [...] "marsupial mice"; most weigh less than 100g. There are two species of marsupial moleorder Notoryctemorphiathat inhabit the deserts of Western Australia. These rare, blind and earless carnivorous creatures spend most of their time underground; little is known about them.|$|E
6000|$|The {{mammalian}} fauna of Australia consists, {{as is well}} known, wholly of {{the lowest}} forms--the Marsupials and Monotremata--except only a few species of mice. This is {{accounted for by the}} complete isolation of the country from the Asiatic continent during the whole period of the development of the higher animals. At some earlier epoch the ancestral marsupials, which abounded both in Europe and North America {{in the middle of the}} Secondary period, entered the country, and have since remained there, free from the competition of higher forms, and have undergone a special development in accordance with the peculiar conditions of a limited area. While in the large continents higher forms of mammalia have been developed, which have almost or wholly exterminated the less perfect marsupials, in Australia these latter have become modified into such varied forms as the leaping kangaroos, the burrowing wombats, the arboreal phalangers, the insectivorous bandicoots, and the carnivorous <b>Dasyuridae</b> or native cats, culminating in the Thylacinus or [...] "tiger-wolf" [...] of Tasmania--animals as unlike each other as our sheep, rabbits, squirrels, and dogs, but all retaining the characteristic features of the marsupial type.|$|E
