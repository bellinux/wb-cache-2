5|$|Two {{external}} factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period. One {{is that with}} increasing reputation and financial security he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had more <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> his own subjects, and {{had more time to}} develop them according to his own ideas. In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s, Boisselier often {{taught about}} the Raëlian {{perspective}} {{of the body and}} sexuality. She discussed these topics from a biological perspective, arguing that humans are essentially robots because they can be reprogrammed. Specifically, she maintained that hormones program the brain, and they provide humans with the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> from many possibilities. Raëlians emphasize sexual stimulation as a way to positively change their members, and Boisselier has stated that she sees the pursuit of femininity as a method of spiritual growth. The group highly values feminine beauty, and Raël has applauded Boisselier for maintaining her appearance, casting her as a role model.|$|E
5|$|Though Méliès's {{films were}} of course silent, {{they were not}} {{intended}} to be seen silently; exhibitors often used a bonimenteur, or narrator, to explain the story as it unfolded on the screen, accompanied by sound effects and live music. Méliès himself took considerable interest in musical accompaniment for his films, and prepared special film scores for several of them, including The Kingdom of the Fairies and The Barber of Seville. However, Méliès never required a specific musical score to be used with any film, allowing exhibitors <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> whatever accompaniment they felt most suitable. When the film was screened at the Olympia music hall in Paris in 1902, an original film score was reportedly written for it.|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} of photons {{is derived from}} the theory of representations of the Poincaré group developed by Wigner. This theory places helicity as the most fundamental property; angular momentum and polarization are secondary characteristics. The properties of the beams of light are shown to be fully determined by the quantum states of the photons. Polarization of light beams is explained as the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>chose</b> an arbitrary combination of the helicity states.

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1794, the French Republic, {{under the rule of}} the National Convention, was at war with all its neighbours. With famine imminent, the French Committee of Public Safety looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide an {{infusion}} of grain; this was to be convoyed across the Atlantic during April, May and June, accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the Bay of Biscay. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the French Navy's ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by Lord Howe, knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with {{the main body of the}} Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the weather gage from Villaret, granting him <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> the time and place of his next attack.|$|E
5|$|Thief {{takes place}} from a first-person {{perspective}} in a 3D environment, with the game's story taking place over {{a series of}} missions, in which the player character is able to perform various actions such as leaning, crouching, swimming, climbing, running and fighting, amongst other abilities. Levels are largely unscripted, and allow for emergent gameplay; while non-player characters (NPCs) may either remain stationary or walk about on a patrol route, players have the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> how to get around them and the obstacles in a level's environments in order to complete specific tasks, such as getting through a locked door. In each level, the player is given a set of objectives to complete, such as stealing a specific object, which they must complete in order to progress to the next level; the player can choose to play on one of three difficulty settings before starting a level, which they can change between missions, with higher difficulties adding additional objectives such as not killing human NPCs or stealing {{a certain amount of}} loot from the amount available in a level, changing the amount of health the player character has, and changing how sensitive a NPC is to their environment. In some missions, players may find objectives being changed or new ones being added, due to certain circumstances they encounter, while failing a key objective or dying, will fail a level, forcing a player to either replay it or load up a previous save.|$|E

25|$|Patrick Olivelle {{suggests}} that the Hindu ashrama system of life, created probably around the 4th-century BCE, {{was an attempt to}} institutionalize renunciation within the Brahmanical social structure. This system gave complete <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> adults <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> what they want to do, whether they want to be householders or sannyasins (ascetics), the monastic tradition was a voluntary institution. This voluntary principle, states Olivelle, was the same principle found in Buddhist and Jain monastic orders at that time.|$|R
3000|$|One of {{the main}} {{criteria}} for choosing the adequate sensor type is its sensitivity and the flexibility. For example, using nonlinear response sensors implicitly [...] "builds-in" [...] a certain output-input characteristics (tone mapping) of the original image, which is not desired for high-fidelity imaging, {{and has to be}} removed. Our desire is <b>to</b> have the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>chose</b> the transfer characteristics based on the image content, to achieve the best possible output quality and visibility of details. Furthermore, in terms of sensitivity, a dual-pixel sensor is not acceptable since it often has lower sensitivity due to a fact that high- and low-sensitivity pixels have to share the area of the pixel element.|$|R

30|$|The {{fact that}} forms of {{absolute}} poverty are neglected in Europe deepens the deprivation of relevant futures {{of the people}} involved. Academic and social statistical poverty research {{has a responsibility to}} be concerned with “relevant futures”. This requires an understanding of neglected futures on a meta-level. By understanding neglected futures, academic and political discourse can contribute, e.g., also in cooperation with pressure groups, to resistance to restriction and a fight for the <b>freedoms</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> relevant futures – future lives people have reasons to value. Some of the official reports on poverty and wealth that emerged in Germany during the 1990 s serve as an illustrative example, as they are the result of the joint efforts of welfare organizations, communities and devoted academics [35]. These joint efforts are expressions of “concerns about relevant futures”.|$|R

40|$|This book {{is about}} the {{relationship}} between different concepts of freedom and happiness. The book's authors distinguish three concepts for which an empirical measure exists: opportunity <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> (negative <b>freedom),</b> capability <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> (positive <b>freedom),</b> and autonomy <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> (autonomy <b>freedom).</b> They also provide a comprehensive account of the relationship between freedom and well-being by comparing channels through which freedoms affect quality of life. The book also explores whether the different conceptions of freedom complement or replace each other in the determination of the level of well-being. In so doing, the authors make freedoms a tool for policy making and are able to say which conception is the most effective for well-being, as circumstances change. The results have implications for a justification of a free society: maximizing freedoms is good for its favorable consequences upon individual well-being, a fundamental value for the judgment of human advantage...|$|R

25|$|Direct {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} farmers. This was originally intended to encourage farmers to choose to grow those crops attracting subsidies and maintain home-grown supplies.

Reforms implemented from 2005 are phasing out specific subsidies in favour of flat-rate payments based only on the area of land in cultivation, and for adopting environmentally beneficial farming methods. The change is intended to give farmers more <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> for themselves those crops most in demand and reduce the economic incentive to overproduce.|$|E
