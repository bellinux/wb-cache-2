40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the study and {{development}} of Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (HBTs) designed for high voltage operation. The work concentrates on the use of wide bandgap III-V semiconductor materials as the collector material and their associated properties influencing breakdown, such as impact <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The work deals with issues related to incorporating a wide bandgap collector into double heterojunction structures such as conduction band discontinuities at the base-collector junction and results are presented which detail, a number of methods designed to eliminate the effects of such discontinuities. In particular the use of AlGaAs as the base material has been successful in eliminating the conduction band spike at this interface. A method of electrically injecting electrons into the collector has been employed to investigate impact ionisation in GaAs, GaInP and AlInP which has used the intrinsic gain of the devices to extract impact <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficients</b> over a range of electric fields beyond the scope of conventional optical injection techniques. This data has enabled the study of ''dead space'' effects in HBT collectors and have been used to develop an analytical model of impact ionisation which has been incorporated into an existing Ebers-Moll HBT simulator.

40|$|The best-fitted {{electron}} and hole {{impact ionisation}} coefficients are obtained {{and it is}} found that the electron impact <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficient</b> is higher than the hole impact <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> In this work, the impact ionisation coefficients at low electric fields are extrapolated to a high electric field region of 800 kV/cm. Two proposed models are produced by using the best-fitted electron and hole impact ionization coefficients over the wide range of electric fields. The impact ionisation coefficients for Model A converge at the high electric field region while for Model B the impact ionisation coefficients diverge. It is found that Model A is more suitable and therefore, this model is used to determine the mean multiplication gain and excess noise factor in the short and long devices. A random ionisation path length model is used for the electron- and hole-initiated multiplication in the multiplication region of 0. 1 μm and 0. 2 μm for short devices, and also 1. 3 μm, 2. 0 μm, 3. 6 μm and 4. 6 μm for long devices. The simulation is based on the dead space effect as well as by excluding the dead space effect in our work. It is found that the dead space effect becomes significant in short devices.

40|$|We numerically {{reproduce}} the density profiles for filaments {{that are in}} magnetohydrostatic and pressure equilibrium with their surroundings obtained in Tomisaka (2014) and show that these equilibria are dynamically stable. If the effect of ambipolar diffusion is considered, these filaments lose magnetic support initiating cloud collapse. The filaments do not lose magnetic flux. Rather the magnetic flux is redistributed within the filament from the centre towards the envelope. The rate of the collapse is inversely proportional to the fractional ionisation and two gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion regimes for the collapse are observed as predicted in Mouschovias & Morton (1991). For high values of the <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> that is X ≥ 10 ^- 7, the gas is strongly coupled to the magnetic field and the Jeans length {{is larger than the}} ambipolar diffusion length scale. Then the collapse is governed by magnetically-regulated ambipolar diffusion. For X ≲ 10 ^- 8, the gas is weakly coupled to the magnetic field and the magnetic support is removed by gravitationally-dominated ambipolar diffusion. Here, neutrals and ions only collide sporadically, that is the ambipolar diffusion length scale is larger than the Jeans length. When decaying turbulence is included, additional support is provided to the filament. This slows down the collapse of the filament {{even in the absence of}} a magnetic field. When a magnetic field is present, the collapse rate increases by a ratio smaller than for the non-magnetic case. This is because of a speed-up of the ambipolar diffusion due to larger magnetic field gradients generated by the turbulence and because the ambipolar diffusion aids the dissipation of turbulence below the ambipolar diffusion length scale.

40|$|This work aims at {{studying}} the excess noise characteristics of AlAsSb material and investigating the high speed properties of InGaAs/AlAsSb SAM APDs in optical communication. Current commercial InGaAs/InP APDs {{have been limited}} to low frequency operation, below 10 Gb/s, because scaling down of multiplication region thickness has reached its limit due to high tunnelling current. The new material AlAsSb {{has been shown to}} offer more promising performance in terms of negligible tunnelling current, excellent thermal stability and extremely low excess noise. The fabrication of AlAsSb and subsequent passivation methods are presented. Since AlAsSb oxidizes easily when exposed to air, different etchants were tested. A selective etching method has been shown to provide the best result for homojunction AlAsSb and InGaAs/AlAsSb APDs. SU- 8 and BCB passivated InGaAs/AlAsSb APDs have negligible degradation compared to unpassivated devices. However removal of BCB residue still needs to be optimised {{if it is to be}} used in high speed APD fabrication. Therefore in this work SU- 8 has been identified as the dielectric material for passivation because of its simple process. Procedures for fabrication of high speed InGaAs/AlAsSb APD have been developed. The excess noise and avalanche gain of two thin homojunction AlAsSb p-i-n structures were characterised under pure injection (using 442 nm laser) and mix light injection (using 542 and 633 nm lasers). The absorption coefficient of AlAsSb was estimated from the linear interpolation of absorption coefficients of AlAs and AlSb. Both the gain and excess noise in the two structures indicated that the electron <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficient</b> in AlAsSb is slightly higher than hole <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Very low excess noise with an effective <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficient</b> ratio keff corresponding to 0. 05 was observed in a 230 nm thick AlAsSb p-i-n structure. An InGaAs/AlAsSb APD with a multiplication layer thickness of only 50 nm was studied to determine its temperature coefficient of breakdown Cbd, and compared to an InGaAs/InAlAs APD. Due to the relatively low doping in the charge sheet layers, the tunnelling current from the InGaAs absorption layer has been unavoidable. However using the linear extrapolation of 1 /M to zero, very small Cbd of 8 mV/K was measured. This is lower than all the reported InGaAs/InAlAs and InGaAs/InP APDs. The bandwidth of an InGaAs/AlAsSb APD was studied on different devices with diameters from 25 to 250 µm. Gain close to 100 was measured on the smallest device with 25 µm diameter. However it was found to be partly contributed by edge breakdown. The bandwidth measured was 3. 4 GHz, independent of gain, suggesting that it is not limited by the avalanche process. As the avalanche limited bandwidth decreasing was not observed, a potential high gain bandwidth product > 327 GHz is plausible. The bandwidths of all the devices are mainly limited to the RC effect as the contact resistance still needs to be improved. The similar amplification of 25 dB, obtained at 10 GHz and at 1 GHz confirms the InGaAs/AlAsSb is useful for high speed application. ...|$|E

40|$|Context: In giant {{molecular}} clouds (GMCs), the fractional ionisation is {{low enough}} that the neutral and charged particles are weakly coupled. A consequence {{of this is that}} the magnetic flux redistributes within the cloud, allowing an initially magnetically supported region to collapse. Aims: We aim to elucidate the effects of ambipolar diffusion on the evolution of infinitely long filaments and the effect of decaying turbulence on that evolution. Methods: First, in ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a two-dimensional cylinder of an isothermal magnetised plasma with initially uniform density was allowed to evolve to an equilibrium state. Then, the response of the filament to ambipolar diffusion was followed using an adaptive mesh refinement multifluid MHD code. Various ambipolar resistivities were chosen to reflect different ratios of Jeans length to ambipolar diffusion length scale. To study the effect of turbulence on the ambipolar diffusion rate, we perturbed the equilibrium filament with a turbulent velocity field quantified by a rms sonic Mach number, M_rms, of 10, 3 or 1. Results: We numerically reproduce the density profiles for filaments that are in magnetohydrostatic and pressure equilibrium with their surroundings obtained by a published paper and show that these equilibria are dynamically stable. If the effect of ambipolar diffusion is considered, these filaments lose magnetic support initiating cloud collapse. The filaments do not lose magnetic flux. Rather the magnetic flux is redistributed within the filament from the dense centre towards the diffuse envelope. The rate of the collapse is inversely proportional to the fractional ionisation and two gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion regimes for the collapse are observed as predicted in a published model. For high values of the <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> that is X >= 10 ^- 7, the gas is strongly coupled to the magnetic field and the Jeans length is larger than the ambipolar diffusion length scale. Then the collapse is governed by magnetically-regulated ambipolar diffusion. The gas collapses at velocities much lower than the sound speed. For X < 10 ^- 8, the gas is weakly coupled to the magnetic field and the magnetic support is removed by gravitationally-dominated ambipolar diffusion. Here, neutrals and ions only collide sporadically, that is the ambipolar diffusion length scale is larger than the Jeans length, and the gas can attain high collapse velocities. When decaying turbulence is included, additional support is provided to the filament. This slows down the collapse of the filament {{even in the absence of}} a magnetic field.

The effects of dead space, enhanced speed to ionisation of early ionising carriers and carrier diffusion on multiplication-limited bandwidth are studied in this work via modelling. The degradation of bandwidth due to the presence of dead space, predicted by other was investigated using the Random Path Length model. It was found that dead space increases the order of carrier groups involved in multiplication, and hence the length of the multiplication chains, as impact ionisation events initiated by feedback carriers become more important. This degrades the improvement in bandwidth expected from reducing the multiplication layer thickness. To study the effects of enhanced speed to ionisation of early ionising carriers and of carrier diffusion on the avalanche time response, a technique has been developed for calculating the probability of fusion (pdf) of avalanche duration using general models for pdfs of ionisation in space and time and also for carrier transport. While diffusion plays only a minor role, the speed enhancement of carriers to ionisation events early in their trajectories is found to speed up the avalanche process significantly in short devices...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to better {{understand}} the physical and chemical properties of meteoroids by using simultaneous radar and video observations of meteors. The Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) and several Gen-III image-intensified CCD cameras were used to measure common meteors and validate metric errors determined through Monte Carlo modelling and to relate radar electron line density (q) to video photon radiant power (I). By adopting an <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficient</b> from Jones (1997) and using recorded measurements of q/I, a corresponding estimate of the fraction of meteoroid kinetic energy loss converted into light (luminous efficiency) was found. It was found that 7 % ± 3 % of video meteors were also simultaneously detected as specular echoes by radar, larger than the expected 2 % − 5 % from modelling. Errors in the fiducial picks for video meteors were found to be anisotropic, with video speeds being higher on average compared to radar speeds, consistent with more deceleration in specular radar measurements. Most radar detections occurred near the end of their meteor trails, suggesting simultaneous observations are biased towards larger, non-fragmenting meteoroids. The peak luminous efficiency was found to be 5. 9 % at 41 km/s. The magnitude scale and electron line density were found to relate as M = (38. 7 ± 1. 2) − 2. 5 log 10 q. These results suggest the masses of higher speed meteoroids are an order of magnitude smaller than previously thought, implying the total meteoroid mass influx for small meteoroids is below earlier estimates. The main uncertainties associated with this analysis are the unknown spectra of individual meteors (which affects estimates of I), and assumptions of the initial meteor trail radius (which affects estimates of q). To improve future simultaneous comparisons, an automated video meteor observatory was constructed. This system, named the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO), features a guided camera which tracks meteors in real-time, giving higher precision video measurements of deceleration and fragmentation for comparison to radar measurements. CAMO {{can also be used to}} constrain numerical meteoroid ablation models and to measure the meteoroid mass in-flux at Earth...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the measurement and interpretation of avalanche noise in avalanche photodiodes (APDs). The design of a measurement system with a higher signal to noise ratio than previous systems reported in the published literature is described. The system uses phase sensitive recovery techniques, which allow the avalanche noise power and photocurrent to be measured unambiguously from the system noise and leakage current of the device under test. Using the measurement system described, avalanche noise measurements have been performed on a range of homojunction GaAs p"+-i-n"+ and n"+-i-p"+ diodes with 'i' region widths, w, from 2. 61 #mu#m to 0. 05 #mu#m, and on a range of homojunction InP p"+-i-n"+ diodes with widths, w, ranging from 2. 40 #mu#m to 0. 24 #mu#m. The results show that, for w #<=# 1 #mu#m, the dependence of excess noise factor F on multiplication does not follow the continuous noise model of McIntyre, which has become well established since its publication in 1966. Instead, a decreasing noise factor is observed as w decreases for a constant multiplication. This reduction in F occurs for both electron and hole initiated multiplication in the thinner w structures even though the <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficient</b> ratio is close to unity. These results suggest that, in GaAs and in InP, if a thin multiplication region is used it is not always necessary for the greatest ionising carrier type to initiate multiplication for the lowest avalanche noise. To interpret the measurements, a model is used that includes the effect of dead space; the minimum distance a carrier must travel to gain the ionisation threshold energy. The dead space is found to be increasingly important in these thinner structures and restricts carriers to ionising {{in the latter half of}} their transit of the high field. This restriction makes the probability distribution function for the ionisation path length more deterministic and, in turn, reduces the overall unpredictability in the multiplication process, leading to a lower excess noise. The effect of distributed carrier generation, and so of mixed injection, in a 0. 1 #mu#m avalanche region is also investigated experimentally and using a model including dead space. These results show that the noise produced from mixed injection is lower than predicted by McIntyre's model, but higher than that obtained with pure electron or hole injection due to the effect of dead space.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to characterise and {{understand}} the impact ionisation characteristics of AlInP towards the exploitation as the avalanche medium in GaAs based avalanche photodiode (APD) for optical communication. Initial room temperature spectral response measurements on AlInP with avalanche multiplication region thickness, w, of 1. 03 μm demonstrates a Gaussian like spectral response in the blue green region with a narrow full width half maximum of ~ 40 nm and peak responsivity of 0. 12 AW- 1 at 474 nm wavelength. These results {{are very close to}} the published responsivity data of 0. 16 AW- 1 at 480 nm wavelength and suggesting the suitability for underwater optical communication. Room temperature avalanche multiplication measurements were performed on a comprehensive set of p+-i-n+ (n+-i-p+) diodes with different w, ranging from 1. 03 μm to p+-n+ junctions. The effective impact <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficients,</b> i. e. αeff for electrons and βeff for holes (described in section 2. 2. 2), were deduced from diodes with fairly uniform electric fields using the local model and the results show that αeff > βeff, which in turn, suggest that electron is more readily ionising carrier type compared to holes in this semiconductor. This is further reinforced by excess noise measurements on w ~ 1. 0 µm p+-i-n+ (n+-i-p+) diodes and calculation of electron and hole local impact <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficients</b> using the recurrence equations. Temperature dependence of avalanche multiplication and breakdown voltage from 77 to 400 K were also investigated on AlInP diodes with w ranging from 1. 03 μm to 0. 04 µm. It is found that the αeff > βeff for the range of temperature investigated, suggesting that APD utilising AlInP as the avalanche multiplication medium should be designed for electron initiated impact ionisation event within this operating temperature range. However, αeff/βeff reduces to unity with increasing temperature mainly due to βeff is being less temperature dependent compared to αeff. The temperature coefficient of breakdown voltage in AlInP p+-i-n+ diodes with w of 1. 03, 0. 23 and 0. 04 μm is ~ 12. 90, 3. 45 and 0. 77 mVK- 1 respectively, lower than the values reported for many other semiconductors in the literature for a given w, except for AlSb 0. 44 As 0. 56.

40|$|Tungsten (W) is used {{in present}} fusion {{experiments}} and is as well a material choice for future reactors like ITER [4] and DEMO [80]. However, tungsten eroded from the wall leads to high radiation losses in the plasma and the transport to the plasma center to critical plasma cooling [33]. Therefore a detailed investigation {{of the interaction between}} eroded tungsten and the plasma is necessary. The emission of tungsten line radiation in the plasma and thus the shape of the emission profiles is characterised by excitation and ionisation. Quantitatively the ionisation can be described in terms of the <b>ionisation</b> rate <b>coefficients.</b> This knowledge is necessary for the interpretation of spectroscopic data and especially to determine tungsten fluxes into the plasma that are caused by tungsten erosion. Up to now, <b>ionisation</b> rate <b>coefficients</b> for neutral tungsten were not determined except for the plasma temperature range below 20 eV [88]. For higher temperatures only uncertain calculated data (e. g. [22, 89]) or semi-empirical data [54] is available. Therefore, within this thesis for the first time ionisation and emission processes of tungsten originating from tungsten erosion were investigated in the temperature range between (41 ± 8) eV and (81 ± 8) eV at the tokamak TEXTOR and <b>ionisation</b> rate <b>coefficients</b> were determined experimentally. Measured emission profiles of the W i (400. 88 nm) -line show a typical exponential decrease that is caused by the ionisation of the neutral tungsten atoms. But moreover, at a distance of 1 to 2 mm away from the sputtered surface the emission initially increases to a maximum. By introducing a relaxation time between 0. 5 and 1 μs before reaching the equilibrium {{of the population of the}} emitting energy level of this line the increase of the emission profiles can be reproduced. Simulating the emissions profiles through a Monte-Carlo-simulation that was developed in the scope of this thesis results in <b>ionisation</b> rate <b>coefficients</b> that are identical with values calculated through using the semi-empirical Lotz-formula [48, 54]. The necessary extension of the atomic data base regarding neutral tungsten leads to the interest in a tungsten source that can easily be used for calibration purposes. This was realised at TEXTOR through the injection of WF_ 6. The tungsten that was brought into the plasma via WF_ 6 -injection was investigated regarding the comparability to tungsten originating from a sputteringprocess. Moreover was WF_ 6 used for the first time to determine conversion factors—the so-called photon efficiencies—to calculate tungsten fluxes from spectroscopically measured photon fluxes. For the given combinations of temperature and density from (20 ± 5) eV to (82 ± 5) eV and from (2. 2 ± 1) × 10 ^ 12 cm^− 3 to (6. 8 ± 1) × 10 ^ 12 cm^− 3, respectively, for the W i (400. 88 nm) -line a constant average value of 〈 E^Wi(400. 88 nm) _Ph〉= 49 ± 16 is found. To test these values sputtering yields were determined from the amount of eroded tungsten atoms. These sputtering yields are in line with experimental reference values [19] and calculations from [34]. The prevailing investigated plasma conditions are in the range of what can be expected considering the ITER divertor during ELMs [12, 21, 47, 71]. The found experimental results are consistent and confirm the match between WF_ 6 -photon efficiencies and photon efficiencies of sputtered tungsten...|$|R

We proceed to produce a time dependent code to calculate the Ionisation state distribution of Iron and of Argon, using some of the recent data for <b>Ionisation</b> <b>coefficients</b> by Arnaud & Raymond (1992), and Fournier et al. (1997, 1998). We also look at some data for the excited ionised states using the Chianti database amongst others. Taking the engine developed, we continue by applying it to a three stage nanoflare simulation for the heating, spanning a 2000 km range. This model is drawn from various previous models developed in the literature. We look for the indications of the non Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) processes via the concept of "signature ions". By this we mean the presence of highly charged ions which would not be expected if the temperature were simply constant and everywhere was in LTE. We make a calculation of the actual experimental line of sight results that we would obtain, if we were to take Emission Measure calculations to ascertain the Ionisation distribution within the Solar Atmosphere. We also {{take a look at the}} problem of Diagnostics based on Emission Measure Analysis, and investigate the fundamental nature of the Inversion Problem. Simply stated, it is difficult to obtain the differential emission measure (DEM) of the Transition Region because the only information that we have available to us is the intensity of spectral lines emitted from the Sun. This consists of the integral of the DEM convolved with a function representing the physics of the transition. The problems associated with the inversion of the integral, form much of the discussion together with the philosophical implications of using phenomenology as an alternative.

The temperature dependences of their spectral resolutions (FWHM at 5. 9 keV) are reported. Analyses of the noise sources contributing to the devices’ measured performances are presented which suggest that {{efforts to improve the}} spectral resolutions would be well targeted at reducing the noise contributions from the packaging of the detectors. For the GaAs diodes, the X-ray characterisation of the devices was extended to higher energies (25 keV). Internal detector X-ray fluorescence was demonstrated and Monte Carlo computer simulations were compared with the experimental results. Prior to the research presented in this thesis, the only Al 0. 8 Ga 0. 2 As photon counting X-ray avalanche photodiodes reported in the literature (Lees et al., 2008, Nucl. Instr. and Meth.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that the world needs to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions. It is proposed to use potentially cleaner renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels, and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A significant challenge facing renewable energy sources, however, is that the power generation facilities are often located far from the load centres, meaning that new high capacity long-distance transmission systems {{would need to be}} built. This is a particular issue since there are increasing difficulties in obtaining approval to construct new overhead lines (OHL). An alternative is gas-insulated lines (GIL), a system for the transmission of electricity over long distance and is considered as a viable technical solution in places where OHL cannot be constructed. The currently adopted gas medium in GIL, however, is sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6), which is a potent greenhouse gas. Trifluoroiodomethane (CF 3 I) has been proposed as an alternative insulation medium to SF 6 in GIL, and this thesis investigates the potential of using a CF 3 I gas mixture in GIL applications. It is hoped that the research can lead to a new form of environmentally friendly power transmission system that could cope with the increasing power demand in large metropolitan areas, and contribute to the reduction of SF 6 usage in the high-voltage industry. The literature survey reviewed the research work on CF 3 I gas and its mixtures to date. Several research gaps were identified, and these informed the investigations carried out in this research. Reduced-scale coaxial test systems with the electric field properties of a full-scale 400 kV GIL were designed, developed and fabricated. The designs were simulated using COMSOL to ensure that the highest field would be along the centre of the conductor.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation into}} the avalanche statistics limited energy resolution of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) was carried out using a random path length (RPL) model. The probability density function (PDF) of the avalanche gain which directly affects the energy resolution was computed {{taking into account the}} effects of the incident photon energy, the pair creation energy of the interacting material, the electron and hole <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and the mean avalanche gain. The results show that the use of conventional excess noise factors obtained from light measurements to calculate the spread in energy resolution due to avalanche statistics is incorrect as the gain PDF generated by X-ray absorption is considerably different from that obtained from light detection. The effect of dead space on the PDF was also investigated. Significant dead space leads to a more deterministic multiplication process leading to a narrow gain PDF and hence an improvement in the spectral resolution. Simulations were performed to study the experimental pulse height spectra obtained from a GaAs/Al 0. 8 Ga 0. 2 As separate absorption and multiplication (SAM) APD. The simulated spectra are found to be in good agreement with experimental results when the noise from APD and read out electronics along with the statistics of photon energy loss were accounted for. The spectral performance of the SAM APD at room temperature is also presented. In addition to the SAM APD, narrow bandgap InAs has also been investigated. InAs has the potential to achieve spectral resolution beyond that of elemental Si and Ge, closer to that obtained by superconductors. Its larger atomic number and crystal density also ensure that its linear stopping power is higher than elemental semiconductors. In addition, InAs APDs exhibit the highly desirable single carrier ionisation characteristic that leads to low avalanche excess noise. Electrical and X-ray characterisation of InAs n+ip+ APDs was carried out at liquid nitrogen temperature. The 5. 9 keV X-ray energy peak from a 55 Fe radioisotope source was detected at zero bias with a full width half maximum (FWHM) of 2. 8 keV. At increasing gain the 5. 9 keV peak shifts away from the electronic noise floor improving the signal to noise performance of the detector. This is also complemented by a rapid improvement in the energy resolution with an FWHM of 950 eV obtained at a gain of 5. 3. Modelling of the X-ray pulse height spectra was carried out using the RPL technique. The intrinsic resolution limited by avalanche statistic was found to be independent of avalanche gain.

40|$|Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) {{can provide}} higher sensitivity, when {{the noise is}} {{dominated}} by electronic noise, than conventional p-i-n photodiodes due to its internal gain achieved via the impact ionisation process. High speed and high sensitivity photodetectors operating at the wavelength of 1. 55 m for optical communication have been intensely research due to the ever increasing internet traffic, particularly in the long-haul communication systems. In this dissertation high speed InGaAs p-i-n photodiodes, InGaAs/InAlAs separate absorption and multiplication (SAM) APDs are designed and characterised. The waveguide InGaAs photodiode exhibits a maximum - 3 dB bandwidth of 26. 5 GHz and external quantum efficiency of 38. 4 % giving a bandwidth-efficiency product of 10. 2 GHz, which is higher than 7. 14 GHz obtained from conventional vertically illuminated diodes fabricated from the same wafer. Building on the high speed InGaAs waveguide diodes, the InGaAs/InAlAs APDs were fabricated. We demonstrated low dark currents of ~ 50 nA at 0. 9 Vbd (Vbd is the breakdown voltage), low excess noise factor k  0. 2 (k is the effective ratio of <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficients</b> ratio in excess noise model) and wide bandwidth up to 40 GHz at low gains. Our APDs also achieve higher signal amplification than the best 40 Gb/s APD reported, confirming the suitability of our APDs {{for use in the}} 40 Gb/s optical communication systems. The signal enhancement of up to 24 dB was achieved at 35 GHz. While the InGaAs/InAlAs APDs may be suitable for 40 Gb/s operation, the avalanche gain is limited due to their limited gain bandwidth products. Hence novel wide bandgap AlAsSb avalanche regions were characterised for next generation high speed SAM APDs. The temperature dependence of dark current and avalanche gain were investigated using AlAsSb p-i-n diodes with avalanche region widths of 80 and 230 nm. Extremely low temperature coefficients of breakdown voltage of 0. 95 and 1. 47 mV/K were obtained in these AlAsSb diodes, which are significantly lower than all semiconductor materials, with similar avalanche region widths, in the literature. Band to band tunelling current was shown to be significantly lower than those in InP and InAlAs diodes with the same avalanche region widths. By utilising an extremely thin 40 nm AlAsSb as multiplication layer, low excess noise factor corresponding to effective k values of 0. 1 to 0. 15 in InGaAs/AlAsSb SAM APDs was demonstrated. This is lower than that from an InAlAs pin diode with a 100 nm avalanche region. Therefore the potential of using thin AlAsSb avalanche region for next generation high speed and high sensitivity photodetectors has been demonstrated.

At high current density, the onset of the Kirk effect is often the main power constraint in the bipolar transistor. An analytical model that accurately describes the physics behind the parasitic electron barrier formation in double heterojunction bipolar transistors in the Si/SiGe, GalnP/GaAs and InP/GaAsSb materials systems {{at the onset of the}} Kirk effect is presented. A new lateral current spreading effect due to the electron barrier dependence on collector current density is also discussed. The electron saturation velocity in Ga_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 2 In_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 8 P has also been measured as a function of temperature, utilising the Kirk effect in double heterojunction bipolar transistors. An AIGaAs base was used to eliminate the conduction band spike and measurements were carefully performed using pulse biasing to minimise device self-heating. Voltage drops across the base and collector series resistances were also taken into account. The measured room temperature saturation velocity of 5. 0 x 10 " 6 cm/s decreased rapidly to 2. 9 x 10 " 6 cm/s at 200 deg C.

The results obtained by MC simulations were fitted with polynomials of up to the 3 rd order with reasonable accuracy for E/N above 80 Td. The studied parameters below 80 Td were strongly non-linear as functions of E/N.

40|$|Using the {{interfacial}} misfit (IMF) array growth mode, GaSb p-i-n diodes {{were grown}} on Si and GaAs lattice-mismatched substrates by {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (MBE) under optimised growth conditions. For the sample grown on Si, an AlSb nucleation layer was used to reduce the occurrence of twinning defects. In addition to the samples grown on mismatched substrates, an equivalent structure was further grown on a native GaSb substrate, for comparison. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used {{to demonstrate that the}} layers were fully relaxed, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging showed arrays of 90 ° misfit dislocations with measured periodicities in agreement with atomistic modelling. However, after processing, device dark current densities of 0. 9 Acm^- 2 and 0. 18 Acm^- 2 were recorded for the sample grown on Si and the sample grown on GaAs, respectively, at - 1. 0 V and 300 K. These were compared to the sample grown on native GaSb, which had a dark current density of 0. 01 Acm^- 2 under the same conditions. Furthermore, TEM analysis revealed relatively high threading dislocation densities (TDDs) of ~ 10 ^ 8 cm^- 2. It was proposed that not all the interfacial strain could be accommodated by the IMF arrays, since the array periods (9 : 8 for AlSb/Si and 13 : 14 for GaSb/GaAs) were not in exact agreement with ratio of the lattice constants (of AlSb to Si and GaSb to GaAs), i. e. a population of 60 ° misfit dislocations was still formed. It was therefore decided to investigate the use of nBn detector structures as lattice mismatched photodetectors. Using a design based on an InAsSb bulk-material absorber, a comparison was again drawn between two samples, one grown on mismatched GaAs and a second grown on native GaSb. This time, device dark current densities were found to be relatively similar when comparing the two samples (1. 6 × 10 ^- 5 Acm^- 2 vs 3 × 10 ^- 6 Acm^- 2 at 200 K). D^* performance figures were also found to be within one order of magnitude (1. 5 × 10 ^ 10 cmHz^ 1 / 2 W^- 1 vs 9. 8 × 10 ^ 10 cmHz^ 1 / 2 W^- 1 at 200 K). Furthermore, diffusion limited performance was exhibited at all temperatures tested, so that the effects of Shockley Read Hall (SRH) generation were established to be absent (or at least much less significant). It was also found that absorption layer doping of around ~ 4 × 10 ^ 17 cm^- 3 was necessary to ensure diffusion limited performance for the sample grown on GaAs and that, with this modification, diffusion limited performance was achieved even for a sample with a highly lattice-mismatched absorption layer (with higher Sb content and longer cut-off wavelength). While nBn detector structures offer very low dark currents, it will sometimes be necessary to have a detector which is sensitive to very weak signals. In telecoms applications, avalanche photodiode (APD) structures are often used as receivers for long-haul fibre optic systems. However, relatively few avalanche photodiode designs exist for wavelengths beyond 1. 55 μm. Two novel separate-absorption-and-multiplication (SAM) APD structures were therefore demonstrated based on the IMF growth mode. In particular, by transitioning the lattice from 5. 65 Å to 6. 09 Å, it was possible to combine GaSb absorption layers with GaAs and (for improved noise performance) Al 0. 8 Ga 0. 2 As multiplication layers. Multiplication profiles were established using capacitance voltage modelling (together with <b>ionisation</b> <b>coefficients</b> from the literature) and excess noise measurements were then carried out. Through the presence of 1. 55 μm photocurrent, it was confirmed that absorption took place in the GaSb regions, with transport to the p-n junction (in the multiplication region) taking place by diffusion. Through measurements showing 0. 2 <k_eff< 0. 4 and 0. 1 <k_eff< 0. 2 it was confirmed that multiplication of the photocurrent took place in the GaAs and Al 0. 8 Ga 0. 2 As layers. Extension of the designs for sensitivity at longer wavelengths would then be possible using other absor-ption layer materials which are lattice matched to GaSb. It should be noted that these include InGaAsSb (short-wave infrared) InAsSb (mid-wave infrared) and strained layer superlattices based on InAs/GaSb or InAs/InAsSb (long-wave infrared) ...|$|R

Escape factors for ASDEX Upgrade density limit plasma conditions were calculated {{by means of a}} PC program on the basis of some simplifying assumptions. The calculated ionisation and recombination rate coefficients demonstrate the processes of stepwise ionisation and recombination into excited levels, which are a function of the optical thickness of the Lyman lines.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the sorption of {{a number}} of solutes by the plastics of intravenous delivery systems were investigated. Models based on diffusion theory and compartmental analysis were developed and examined for. their ability to describe the uptake {{of a number}} of solutes from aqueous solutions stored in contact with the plastics. In deriving diffusion equations it has been assumed, firstly, that diffusion of solute in the plastic matrix is the rate-limiting step in the sorption process (matrix-controlled sorption) and, secondly, that both the plastic matrix and an interfacial resistance barrier contribute to the diffusional resistance encountered by the solute molecule (intermediate diffusion kinetics). The situation in which diffusion across the interfacial resistance barrier is the rate-limiting step was also considered. The ability of the diffusion and compartment models to describe and predict the sorption of the nonelectrolytes, nitroglycerin and diazepam, was examined. The diffusion model seemed to be the more satisfactory model in respect of both description and prediction of the drug uptake. The compartment model appeared to describe the drug uptake at earlier times, but was not able to describe the loss as equilibrium was approached; nor could that model be employed as a predictive method. The complete time-course, including equilibrium, of the sorption of nitroglycerin and diazepam was well-described by the (matrix-control) diffusion model. The diffusion model was also found to predict accurately the rate and extent of nitroglycerin and diazepam loss from solutions stored in plastic infusion bags of different sizes and containing various volumes of solution. The sorption of several weak electrolytes, specifically pnitrophenol, p-toluidine, warfarin sodium and trifluoperazine dihydrochloride, during storage of solutions of various pH in plastic infusion bags was also studied. The rate and extent of sorption varied with pH in a manner suggesting preferential uptake of the unionised species. It was assumed that only the unionised species was sorbed by the plastic matrix and the diffusion model was modified accordingly. The uptake of p-nitrophenol and p-toluidine was adequately described by the matrix-control diffusion model, confirming quantitatively the relationship between solute uptake and fraction unionised. However, the uptake of warfarin sodium and trifluoperazine dihydrochloride was significantly better described by the intermediate diffusion model. It appeared that the rate of uptake of the unionised form of these solutes was diminished due to the influence of interfacial or aqueous diffusional barriers. Solute lipophilicity, degree of <b>ionisation</b> and diffusion <b>coefficient</b> appeared to be important factors determining the relative contribution of the interfacial barrier and the plastic matrix to the overall diffusional resistance. Several approximations of the diffusion equations were considered. These approximations suggested that the rate and extent of solute uptake by the plastics of delivery systems at early times can be described by a single parameter. In general these approximations yielded parameter estimates consistent with those obtained by nonlinear regression using the full equations. A method of discriminating between matrix-controlled and intermediate sorption kinetics, based on these approximations, is also presented. The kinetics of solute loss from solution to plastic tubings during the course of an infusion was also investigated. The kinetics of loss could be interpreted in terms of diffusion-controlled sorption of the unionised solute by the plastic. Equations are presented to describe the availability of diazepam, and possibly other solutes, during infusion. The interaction of chlormethiazole edisylate with the plastic infusion systems displayed some unique characteristics, and these were further examined. It was found that, in some circumstances, chlormethiazole edisylate was not only sorbed by the plastic, but also permeated to the external environment. Furthermore, plasticisation of the polyvinyl chloride by chlormethiazole edisylate was observed. Some initial attempts at correlating the physicochemical characteristics of a range of solutes with their plastic sorption behaviour are also presented...|$|R
