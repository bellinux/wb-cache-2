5|$|On the day Murugesa is {{supposed}} to marry Valli at his house, Kali learns that the entire village has left to attend Valli's marriage to Kumaran. He intercepts Valli's group, reminding her that he loves her and how difficult <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> live without her. Although everyone else ignores him, Valli runs to him and assures him {{that she would never}} abandon him. Kali then tells Kumaran that although he still dislikes his former boss, he and Valli have his permission to marry.|$|E
5|$|Shoup later {{warned against}} an armed {{response}} during the Cuban Missile Crisis, noting how difficult <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> invade the country. Still, he prepared {{a team of}} Marines to invade Cuba should it be necessary. He and the other Joint Chiefs unanimously recommended a quick airstrike to knock out the missiles once they were discovered there. Kennedy subsequently sought Shoup's advice in evaluating {{the implications of the}} Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended to be limited, he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the test ban, seeing it as a deterrent to nuclear war.|$|E
5|$|Soule {{was born}} in Keokuk, Iowa to a public school music teacher father and a graphic {{designer}} mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras {{at the age of}} five. Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from Western Illinois University when he was in sixth grade. He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in composition before completing high school, though, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree. He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized how difficult <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> do both.|$|E

5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> make a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E

Also, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> impose massive reparations on the defeated Allies. The exchange rate of the mark against the US dollar thus steadily devalued from 4.2 to 7.9 marks per dollar. (It was only after the war that the extreme hyperinflation occurred.) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{first stage}} of this research, which began on 24 August 1998, {{involved}} a simple RFID transmitter being implanted beneath Warwick's skin, which was used to control doors, lights, heaters, and other computer-controlled devices based on his proximity.

25|$|Orr is {{good friends}} with Yossarian and enjoys winding him up with his stories of crabapples and horse-chestnuts or about the prostitute that kept hitting him over the head. He tries to {{encourage}} Yossarian to fly with him, intimating that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> his advantage, but Yossarian refuses as he is scared of being shot down. It is not until Orr escapes to Sweden that Yossarian realises that Orr was trying to offer him an escape {{out of the war}} with him.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Australia’s public {{transport}} unions resolved {{that the impact}} of changes in the {{public transport}} industry was such that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> their members’ benefit to amalgamate into a single union. The national and state branches of the ARU, ATMOEA, AFULE and NURWA consequently balloted their members on the question as to whether they favoured amalgamation, in which over 85% of their combined members voted ‘Yes’. As a result, these unions amalgamated into a single Public Transport Union (PTU) in February 1993.|$|E
25|$|On 27 March, the new cabinet line-up, agreed between Suharto and Sukarno, was announced. It {{included}} the key figures of Suharto himself as interim {{deputy prime minister}} for security and defence affairs, tasked with preventing the resurgence of communism, the Sultan of Yogyakarta Sri Sulan Hamengkubuwono IX as deputy prime minister for economic, financial and development affairs, tasked with solving the nation's economic problems and Adam Malik as deputy prime minister for social and political affairs, whose job <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> manage foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{tourism in}} Ireland {{was not a}} new development, {{it was in the}} last quarter of the nineteenth century that a great {{increase}} occurred with large numbers of tourists making the sea crossing from Great Britain to see the delights of Ireland's scenery. The railways saw that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> their advantage to encourage tourist development since this would bring them increased traffic. On the BNCR, its manager, Edward John Cotton, especially recognised the potential value of tourism and was influential in its development throughout the North of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|After {{publication}} of the notice in the Government Gazette, it is unlawful for the sheriff to sell any property in the estate which has been attached under a writ of execution, or other similar process, unless the sheriff {{could not have known}} of the publication. The court may, however, order the sale of attached property to proceed if the value of the property does not exceed R5,000, and if <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> the benefit of the creditors.

25|$|As well {{as their}} {{in-house}} brand lines, the retailer sells many products from familiar brands, such as Colgate, Walkers and Cadburys. Poundland were reported to be Britain's largest seller of batteries in 2009, stocking brands such as Sony, Panasonic and Kodak in competitively priced quantities, with Kodak AA batteries being one of their best selling items in 2009. Poundland also sell large quantities of their stock to other retailers off-the-shelf, where it is cheaper for these retailers to pay £1 each for a bulk purchase than <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> pay a discounted bulk-purchase rate elsewhere.|$|E

After Lauren arrived she was tied up, and Sheila flees with Phyllis and babies Fen and Summer as hostages.

The virtuous declaimer will neither persuade himself nor any other person to be content with a double mess of porridge, instead of a reasonable stipend for his services. We might as soon reconcile ourselves to the Spartan community of goods and wives, to their iron coin, their long beards, or their black broth. There is a total dissimulation in the circumstances, as well as the manners, of society among us; and it is as ridiculous to seek for models in the simple ages of Greece and Rome, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> go in quest of them among the Hottentots and Laplanders.|$|E
25|$|From March 1943, British Intelligence {{had been}} trying to find Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's {{headquarters}} in France. Part of the brief looked at creating a timetable for Rommel, to assess how easy <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> kill him. Much as though he had been against the plan pre-D-Day, with manpower losses escalating Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery approved the plan post D-Day, even though they still didn't know where Rommel's base was. In a bizarre coincidence, on 9 June SAS Lieutenant General was heading for a meeting with a French Resistance unit. Resting in a barn, he was approached by a man who lived in La Roche-Guyon, asking for assurances that as Rommel's headquarters was in the village, that the Royal Air Force would not bomb them.|$|E
