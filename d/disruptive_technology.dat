25|$|If some {{existing}} {{technology or}} company whose benefits are {{largely based on}} network effects starts to lose market share against a challenger such as a <b>disruptive</b> <b>technology</b> or open standards based competition, the benefits of network effects will reduce for the incumbent, and increase for the challenger. In this model, a tipping point is eventually reached at which the network effects of the challenger dominate those of the former incumbent, and the incumbent is forced into an accelerating decline, whilst the challenger takes over the incumbent's former position.|$|E
40|$|The rise of <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies</b> {{is profoundly}} {{transforming}} systems {{of production and}} management across sectors and industries, but primarily in wealthy countries. This paper considers how <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies</b> could help improve power sector reform and development in African markets. In particular, it explores the role that might be played by the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and advanced analytics. After reviewing current trends in <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies,</b> the paper illustrates the application of key elements with use cases {{in the areas of}} power infrastructure planning, power sector operations, and off-grid electrification. Finally, the paper looks at context-specific challenges to the widespread implementation of <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies.</b> While <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies</b> offer innovative ways of tackling some of the main challenges of traditional approaches to power sector development, their widespread adoption hinges on a concerted effort across public and private players to lend support to key aspects such as improved broadband connectivity, a vibrant startup scene and surrounding technology ecosystem, or simply the right to Internet access...|$|R

25|$|In 1997, Clayton Christensen (1997) {{took the}} {{position}} that great companies can fail precisely because they do everything right since {{the capabilities of the}} organization also define its disabilities. Christensen's thesis is that outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with <b>disruptive</b> <b>technology.</b> He called the approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies agnostic marketing, i.e., marketing under the implicit assumption that no one – not the company, not the customers – can know how or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used without the experience of using it.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} on a research initiative performed on <b>Disruptive</b> Space <b>Technologies</b> in the European space sector and explains {{a method of}} forecasting them. It was undertaken at the German aerospace center (DLR) in Bremen in co-operation with the University of Groningen as the author’s master thesis. The theory of <b>Disruptive</b> <b>Technologies,</b> explains the evolution of technologies which disrupt the status quo of both dominant technology platforms and competitive market layouts. It does this by having an alternate performance mix, which is perceived as more valuable by the customer than the dominant technology. Several interviews resulted {{to the conclusion that}} {{there is a difference between}} <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies</b> as described in business literature and <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies</b> for the space sector. This is caused by fundamental differences in market dynamics between the terrestrial market and the space sector. This difference creates the necessity for the creation of a new theory of <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies</b> for the space sector, or <b>disruptive</b> space <b>technologies.</b> This thesis does this by explaining the distinction between the various innovation types and <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies.</b> Based on these distinctions and the characteristics of the space sector, a new theory of <b>disruptive</b> space <b>technologies</b> has been elaborated. With the help of this new theory, an evaluation tool has been constructed, which can be used as a forecasting method for these <b>disruptive</b> space <b>technologies.</b> This has been done by researching criteria which indicate a potential for disruptiveness of technologies in the space sector. These criteria can be evaluated using a concept scoring matrix which will compare several potentially <b>disruptive</b> space <b>technology</b> concepts with a dominant space technology. The results of this evaluation will be a forecast for the layout of a specific space technology domain. Nevertheless, the purpose of this research is not to deliver a ready to use method, but rather to indicate a general direction in which future research could lead to an accurate <b>disruptive</b> space <b>technologies</b> forecasting method...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies,</b> mainly {{influenced}} by Clayton M.

Methods, structures and processes seem to be widely applied to support decisions on technologies and technological developments in general. But what are the practices from technology oriented industry leaders {{to respond to the}} special challenges of <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies?</b> To obtain insights into the monitoring of <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies</b> in practice, a semi-structured, qualitative study among global industry leaders from Germany has been carried out. All companies selected for the sample are technology oriented global leaders in their business field. To focus the sample on companies with a high innovation potential, all selected companies have been rewarded with an innovation award at least once within the last five years. For being able to compare the monitoring of technologies in general with the practices applied for the monitoring of <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies,</b> the study was classified into different topic areas including an extended technology monitoring process, the support through information technologies, the monitoring of <b>disruptive</b> <b>technologies</b> and good or best practices to be recommended for further application in other companies...|$|R
