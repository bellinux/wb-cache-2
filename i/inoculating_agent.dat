During the enzymatic degradation assays, it was observed that the addition of some essential nutrients in the formulation of the culture medium contributed positively in the cellulolytic enzyme production, with exception of riboflavin. Such results contributed in the establishment of an effective method for the evaluation of enzymatic activities in anaerobic fibrolytic fungi.

The {{generations of}} {{agricultural}} and forestry wastes (AFWS) are increasing rapidly with developments {{of agriculture and}} forestry in China, and AFWS are commonly treated by composting. The objective of this work was to explore the effect of different microbial agents on biodegradation of AFWS. Three microbial agents in the research were Phanerochaete chrysosporium(PC), Coriolus versicolor (CV) and GP (agent developed from laboratory with high lignocellulose degradation ability). All the composts inoculated the different microbial agents matured in 58 days. Compared with CK(without exogenous micro agent), composts with micro <b>agents</b> <b>inoculated</b> increased the duration of high-temperature fermentation period, reduced the maturity time, and increased lignocellulose degradation rate.

In pigs inoculated only with P. multocida, clinical signs and lung lesions were not observed, and the agent was not recovered. Pigs inoculated with M. hyopneumoniae developed fever, moderate cough and dyspnea which tended to disappear, and small proliferative lung lesions from which M. hyopneumoniae was isolated. Pigs <b>inoculated</b> with both <b>agents</b> had higher fever, severe cough and dyspnea which tended to aggravate, and extensive exudative lung lesions from which organisms were isolated.

40|$|Abstract Background Phospho-tau {{deposition}} {{has been}} described in a rare genetic human prion disease, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, but is not common neuropathological picture for other human and animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). This study investigated the possible changes of tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau, at Ser 396, Ser 404, and Ser 202 /Thr 205) in scrapie experimental animals. Methods The profiles of tau and p-tau (p-tau, at Ser 396, Ser 404, and Ser 202 /Thr 205) in the brain tissues of agents 263 K- or 139 A-infected hamsters were evaluated by Western blots and real-time PCR. Meanwhile, the transcriptional and expressive levels of GSK 3 β and CDK 5 in the brains were tested. Results The contents of total tau and p-tau at Ser 202 /Thr 205 increased, but p-tau at Ser 396 and Ser 404 decreased at the terminal stages, regardless of scrapie strains. Transcriptional levels of two tau isoforms were also increased. Additionally, it showed higher CDK 5, but lower GSK 3 β transcriptional and expressive levels in the brains of scrapie-infected animals. Analysis of brain samples collected from different times after <b>inoculated</b> with <b>agent</b> 263 K revealed that the changes of tau profiles and phosphate kinases were time-relative events. Conclusion These data suggest that changes of profiles of p-tau at Ser 396, Ser 404 and Ser 202 /Thr 205 are illness-correlative phenomena in TSEs, which may arise of the alteration of phosphate kinases. Alteration of tau, p-tau (Ser 396, Ser 404, and Ser 202 /Thr 205), GSK 3 β and CDK 5 were either intermediate or consequent events in TSE pathogenesis and proposed the potential linkage of these bioactive proteins with the pathogenesis of prion diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|To date, bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) and its human counterpart, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, {{have been associated with}} a single prion strain. This strain is characterised by a unique and remarkably stable biochemical profile of abnormal protease-resistant prion protein (PrP(res)) isolated from brains of affected animals or humans. However, alternate PrP(res) signatures in cattle have recently been discovered through large-scale screening. To test whether these also represent separate prion strains, we inoculated French cattle isolates characterised by a PrP(res) of higher apparent molecular mass [...] called H-type [...] into transgenic mice expressing bovine or ovine PrP. All mice developed neurological symptoms and succumbed to these isolates, showing that these represent a novel strain of infectious prions. Importantly, this agent exhibited strain-specific features clearly distinct from that of BSE <b>agent</b> <b>inoculated</b> to the same mice, which were retained on further passage. Moreover, it also differed from all sheep scrapie isolates passaged so far in ovine PrP-expressing mice. Our findings therefore raise the possibility that either various prion strains may exist in cattle, or that the BSE agent has undergone divergent evolution in some animals...|$|R
40|$|Swine {{influenza}} {{is caused}} by two agents, a bacterium (Hemophilus influenzae suis) and the virus of swine influenza, acting in concert to produce an extensive pneumonia (1). This synergistic action can be reproduced by <b>inoculating</b> the two <b>agents</b> on the chorioallantoic membrane of 9 to 10 day chick embryos, thus rapidly killing {{a high proportion of}} embryos and causing selective destruction of the lung tissue in those surviving (2). This effect is not produced by the action of either virus or bacterium alone. Bacteria are not seen in sections of these lungs, and heart blood cultures from embryos killed during the peak of mortality show no growth (Table I). However, since H. influenzae suis persists on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryos infected with swine influenza virus longer than on normal embryos, the bacterium apparently benefits by the presence of the virus. Embryos dying early show the same generalized hemorrhages and later cell destruction seen in the occasional embryo killed by virus alone.

This study documents survival periods, pathological findings, {{and the presence of}} abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) in genetically susceptible sheep <b>inoculated</b> with scrapie <b>agent.</b> Suffolk lambs (AA/RR/QQ at codons 136, 154, and 171, respectively) aged 4 mo were injected by the intralingual (IL) or intracerebral (IC) route with an inoculum prepared from a pool of scrapie-affected US sheep brains. The animals were euthanized when advanced clinical signs of scrapie were observed. Spongiform lesions in the brain and PrPSc deposits in the central nervous system (CNS) and lymphoid tissues were detected by immunohistochemical and Western blot (WB) testing in all the sheep with clinical prion disease. The mean survival period was 18. 3 mo for the sheep inoculated by the IL route and 17. 6 mo for those inoculated by the IC route. Since the IC method is occasionally associated with anesthesia-induced complications, intracranial hematoma, and CNS infections, and the IL method is very efficient, it may be more humane to use the latter.

As successful re-derivation was recently described for gerbils, we now aimed at investigating which mouse viruses induce seroconversion in gerbils and might be transmitted to mice. Gerbils were <b>inoculated</b> with viral <b>agents</b> of mice and co-housed with mouse contact sentinels. Seroconversion in gerbils was observed after oronasal inoculation with Sendai virus (SeV), mammalian orthoreovirus serotype 3 (Reo- 3) and rotavirus A (RV-A, EDIM), seroconversion to RV-A also in sentinel mice. Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) was not detected by serology but by polymerase chain reaction in gerbils and respective sentinel mice. No seroconversion towards or transmission of murine hepatitis virus, murine norovirus, minute virus of mice or mouse cytomegalovirus was detected. Anti-gerbil IgG antibodies did not increase sensitivity of indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) compared with anti-mouse IgG. In conclusion, seroconversion to SeV, Reo- 3 and RV-A as well as transmission of RV-A and PVM indicate that these agents should be included in health monitoring of gerbils.

40|$|With the {{potential}} spread of {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} to people as a variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), it becomes critical to identify cells in the periphery that carry infection. Initial work with scrapie agents suggested that B cells were central vectors for neuroinvasion. Subsequent studies indicated that B cells played an indirect role by promoting the development of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) that accumulate abnormal prion protein (PrP). The mechanism {{for the role of}} FDCs, however, has not been clear. To further dissect potential B cell functions that contribute to neuroinvasion, we <b>inoculated</b> a CJD <b>agent</b> into mutant mice that (i) lacked B cells, (ii) had B cells unable to secrete Ig, or (iii) could secrete only IgM. Remarkably, all these mice developed disease with practically indistinguishable incubation times. The demonstration that neither immune complexes nor B cells were required for neuroinvasion from the periphery mandates a reanalysis of the accepted view of the essential role of B cells and FDC in these infections. Moreover, immune complexes were not required for the accumulation of pathologic PrP on the surface of FDCs, suggesting that PrP can bind to FDCs autonomously or by means of another factor. Wild-type mice had incubation times ≈ 50 days less than all mutant mice at the same peripheral doses, indicating that an intact immune system may increase agent uptake and delivery, but this condition is not essential. Specifically, the evidence to date suggests that IgG may enhance pivotal agent interactions with migratory myeloid cells...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the most common sites of eschars over the bodies of patients with Scrub typhus. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective analysis, we examined a total of 418 patients who presented to Christian Medical College, Vellore between 2009 and 2012 with an acute febrile illness and an eschar on clinical examination and confirmed to have scrub typhus with a positive Scrub typhus IgM ELISA test. We studied the distribution of eschars over the bodies of 418 patients with Scrub typhus. Results: There was a significant difference in the distribution of eschars between males and females with a preponderance of the chest and abdomen (42. 3 %) among females and the axilla, groin and genitalia (55. 8 %) in males. Some unusual sites of an eschar were the cheek, ear lobe and dorsum of the feet.

To determine whether there was an involvement of the host-encoded prion protein (PrPc) in CJD development and prion propagation, mice heterozygous (PrP+/-) or homozygous (PrP-/-) for a disrupted PrP gene were established and inoculated with the mouse-adapted CJD agent. In keeping with findings of previous studies using other lines of PrP-less mice <b>inoculated</b> with scrapie <b>agents,</b> no PrP-/- mice showed any sign of the disease for 460 days after inoculation, while all of the PrP+/- and control PrP+/+ mice developed CJD-like symptoms and died.

This work studied the growth kinetics of Salmonella Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes when substituting table sugar with commercial stevia and a pure mixture of steviol glycosides at different concentration values. Next, the role of homogeneous and heterogeneous solid systems was also studied, using gelatine and dextran as gelling <b>agents.</b> <b>Inoculated</b> media were incubated at 20, 8 and 4 °C, cell concentration was determined and the Baranyi and Roberts (1994) model was fitted for growth parameter estimation. Results reveal a negligible effect from sweetener’s addition in homogeneous gelatine-based media on the growth of S. Typhimurium, while the heterogeneous system, growth inhibition is observed at 8 °C, where λ results enlarged in all the media with sweeteners. The growth of L. monocytogenes in homogeneous solid media is reduced when sweeteners are included at 20 °C, but the opposite occurs at refrigeration conditions. Increasing structural complexity to heterogeneous solid media also lead, independently of the sweetener, to longer λ values of L. monocytogenes.

Twelve Friesian calves, aged 8 to 9 months, were inoculated with noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus genotype 1. Ten were subsequently challenged with bovine herpesvirus 1 and euthanized at 1, 2, 4, 7, or 14 days postinoculation. The other 2 calves were euthanized prior to the second inoculation.

The idea in this study was to compensate the reduced chemical control from the fungicide by the co-application of antagonistic bacteria which were isolated from winter wheat leaves. The aim was to test if a combination of antagonistic bacteria and a experimental dose (0. 5 mg/l) of the fungicide Proline® provides an inhibition of fungal growth of F. graminearum in vitro (Dual culture assay) comparable to single fungicide application. The results showed that antagonistic bacteria are not affected by any of the used concentrations of the fungicide and provided additional inhibition of fungal growth. A experimental dose of the fungicide only reduced fungal growth rate during five days of incubation but did not stop it (mycelial area became equal to control after seven days incubation). The application of antagonistic bacteria however stopped fungal growth after seven days. The treatment effects were significant. From this it can be concluded that the coapplication of fungicides and antagonistic bacteria might be promising to provide sufficient control of fungal growth of F. graminearum provided bacteria survive in the environment they are applied to in a high concentration. As the present study only assessed treatment effects in the lab on agar further field experiments are needed to test the findings of the present study under real life conditions.

When given in combination, inoculation with RSV preceded that with P. haemolytica by 3 or 5 days;In lambs inoculated with P. haemolytica or RSV alone, a mild respiratory disease developed in one of four and two of four lambs of the respective groups. In lambs of the two groups <b>inoculated</b> with both <b>agents</b> and especially in lambs given bacteria 5 days after virus, a respiratory disease was observed which was more severe than that observed in lambs given either agent alone. Respiratory syncytial virus and P. haemolytica were isolated from 8 and 12 lambs respectively, from a total of 15 lambs inoculated with one or both agents. A serologic response to RSV was detected in all lambs inoculated with virus, but no antibody to P. haemolytica was detected;Pneumonic lesions were seen in all 11 lambs given both RSV and P. haemolytica. They were extensive in six of the lambs and were more severe than those in lambs given either agent alone. The lesions were qualitatively similar to those in lambs given the bacteria alone, and were most severe in lambs inoculated with bacteria 5 days rather than 3 days following RSV inoculation. The lesions were characterized as severe, acute, diffuse, exudative pneumonia with focal necrosis, hemorrhages, and fibrinous pleuritis. Lung lesions in lambs infected with RSV alone were interstitial pneumonitis, mild bronchiolitis and focal hemorrhages;In lambs inoculated with RSV alone or with both agents, specific immunofluorescence of viral antigen was detected primarily in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium and in the alveolar lumen.

We used 160 Wistar albin rats (Rattus norvegicus) at 70 days (80 in immunoprophylaxis and 80 in immunotheraphy) were divided into four groups that were immunized three times every 15 days. The groups were divided as follows: G 1 (control, mineral oil), G 2 (Ag + incomplete freund adjuvant), G 3 (Ag + Freund's complete adjuvant) and G 4 (Ag + incomplete freund adjuvant + propolis). Preparation of the vaccine used was an isolate of S. schenckii from yeast {{in the form of a}} case of cutaneous sporotrichosis of domestic cat. The fungus was grown in medium liquid (Brain-Heart broth???), incubated for 10 days at 370 C and kept under constant agitation to obtain the yeast form. The culture was filtered through a double layer of sterile gauze, centrifuged, washed twice with buffered saline (PBS), homogenized and standardized in 108 cells of S. schenckii / ml. The cells were inactivated with 0. 02 % thimerosal and then emulsified with mineral oil, and vaccines packaged in sterilized sealed and kept at a temperature of 40 C throughout the experimental period. Was used a dose of 0. 1 ml/animal intramuscularly. Rats that received the vaccine as immunoprophylaxis after the three doses were challenged, and inoculated subcutaneously with 2 X 103 cells / ml of S. schenckii in the right footpad and evaluated for 10 days. Animals treated with immunotherapy were <b>inoculated</b> with the <b>agent</b> after 14 days and received three doses of immunogen. After the experimental period all were euthanized and necropsy to mycological examination, histopathology and counting colony forming units. The results were: immunoprophylaxis in the pathological changes showed statistically significant differences (P < 0. 05) in the vaccinated groups (G 2, G 3 and G 4) compared to the control group (G 1) to the point of inoculation, with no statistical difference the evaluation of internal organs. Immunotherapy clinical evaluation at the injection showed that there was no statistical difference among the four experimental groups, but at the end of the experiment the groups G 1, G 2, G 3 and G 4 had respectively 8. 3 %, 58. 3 %, 41. 7 % and 50 % of injuries in the process of regression and healing. In relation to injuries in other body areas only in the last week of the experiment, the G 2 and G 3 differ statistically (P < 0. 05) in the control group (G 1). Pathological changes were found in the internal organs of the four experimental groups, but with a greater number of lesions in group CONT. Both in immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy the retroisolation of the agent and count of colony forming units showed that there was growth of S. schenckii in the four experimental groups, but with less frequency and quantification of CFU at the point of inoculation and internal organs of the groups G 2, G 3 and G 4. In histopathologic evaluation to determine the presence of granulomas and pyogranulomas focal and multifocal in the point of inoculation and internal organs of the four groups, but the animals that received immunoprophylactic changes were more restricted to the point of inoculation. The results indicate that the three vaccine formulations (AIF ACF and AIFP) used as immunoprophylactic and immunotherapy have not been effective for the remission of the lesions of experimental cutaneous sporotrichosis...|$|R
