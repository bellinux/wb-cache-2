40|$|Shopping centers {{is vital}} {{in our daily}} life. In this paper, the {{importance}} of provision of <b>entertainments</b> will be analyzed in details {{and this would be}} useful for owners or management companies of shopping malls if they are planning for renovations or implementing new shopping malls. Six research questions are analyzed in this paper through conducting surveys through questionnaires, and they will be categorized into two categories, which is to determine the impact of <b>entertainments</b> {{to the success of the}} shopping malls and to determine the impact of the various means of <b>entertainments</b> to the success of the shopping malls. Convenience sampling is adopted for the data collection of questionnaires and two sets of questionnaires will be distributed only to people who lives or works in Tsuen Wan and have ever visited all of the shopping malls used for case study, that is CityWalk, Tsuen Wan Plaza and Emperor Plaza. After performing the detailed data analysis, it is found out that most people think that provision of <b>entertainments</b> is an important factor that affects people’s decision to visit and shop in the shopping centers, but this factor is not as crucial as factors like location, variety of shops and provision of open spaces. Also, this factor is important to both the newly-built shopping centers and renovated old shopping centers. Also, it is found out that differences in age groups and genders may have variations in determining the importance of provision of <b>entertainments</b> in general for the individual’s shopping preference. Young people relatively regarded provision of <b>entertainments</b> as more important factor that affect people’s decision, when compared to older people. Male also regard provision of <b>entertainments</b> as more important than female. Differences in age groups and genders may also show different priorities for the importance of each means of <b>entertainments</b> in shopping centers. Hence, we have to know the target group of the customers and to invest suitable means of <b>entertainments</b> or otherwise, the shopping centers cannot sustain with a high profit. For example, since there are more old people than the young people in Tsuen Wan, it is not practicable to invest a large sum of money on provision of means of <b>entertainments</b> which cater for the young and male more, such as the video game counters. However, it is always recommended to include the means of <b>entertainments</b> like the cinemas, fitness and spa centers and toy shops as investments from the owners or the management companies of the shopping centers towards these means of <b>entertainments</b> is relatively small, when comparing to other means of <b>entertainments.</b> published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
