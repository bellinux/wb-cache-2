Using an external noise paradigm to factorize the sensitivity into <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> noise and calculation efficiency, {{the present study investigated}} if the variation in photopic motion sensitivity as a {{function of the}} temporal frequency is due to a variation of <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> noise (e. g., early temporal filtering) or calculation efficiency (ability to select and integrate motion). For various temporal frequencies, contrast thresholds for a direction discrimination task were measured in presence and absence of noise. Up to 15 Hz, the sensitivity variation was mainly due to a variation of <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> noise and little variation in calculation efficiency was observed. The sensitivity fall-off at very high temporal frequencies (from 15 to 30 Hz) was due to a combination of a drop of calculation efficiency and a rise of <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> noise. A control experiment in which an artificial temporal integration was applied to the stimulus showed that an early temporal filter (generally assumed to affect <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> noise, not calculation efficiency) could impair both the calculation efficiency and <b>equivalent</b> <b>input</b> noise at very high temporal frequencies. We conclude that at the photopic luminance intensity tested, the variation of motion sensitivity {{as a function of the}} temporal frequency was mainly due to early temporal filtering, not to the ability to select and integrate motion.

40|$|In {{preliminary}} building energy assessments, it {{is often}} desired to estimate a motor's <b>input</b> <b>power.</b> Motor power estimates in this context should be rapid, safe, and noninvasive. Existing methods for motor <b>input</b> <b>power</b> estimation, such as direct measurement (wattmeter), Current Method, and Slip Method were evaluated. If installed equipment displays <b>input</b> <b>power</b> or average current, then using such readings are preferred. If installed equipment does not display <b>input</b> <b>power</b> or current, the application of wattmeters or current clamps is too time-consuming and invasive for the preliminary energy audit. In that case, if a shaft speed measurement is readily available, then the Slip Method is a satisfactory method for estimating motor <b>input</b> <b>power.</b> An analysis of performance data for 459 motors suggests comparable performance for predicting normalized (to the nominal motor <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> motor <b>input</b> <b>power</b> with the Current and Slip Methods: 10. 0 % and 9. 9 % RMSE, respectively. Both of these methods may be improved by applying regression on the predicted variable and/or nameplate parameters. For example, the Slip Method could be improved by applying a second-order regression, thereby reducing the predicted load factor residual RMSE of the data set from 9. 0 % to 8. 2 %. The Current and Slip Methods were also evaluated on two real motors. The normalized (to the nominal motor <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> predicted <b>input</b> <b>power</b> RMSE for the Current Method was on average 15 % for the two motors; for the Slip Method the corresponding average was 17. 5 %.

Other required parameters include ambient temperature, motor efficiency, and a motor thermal constant. The temperature approach offers quick, safe, and non-invasive motor power estimation. However, thermal coefficients may vary significantly across motors and a model to predict the thermal coefficients {{has yet to be}} developed. Furthermore, the temperature approach has a very strong dependence on motor efficiency uncertainty. Experiments were performed on two motors to determine their motor thermal constants.
