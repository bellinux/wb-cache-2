The investigators did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the {{families}} of the six ancient parishes of Andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires. The first <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> purchased by the government was acquired in 1943.

25|$|Four men manned {{this family}} station and were {{provided}} with quarters as follows: One 4 bedroom unit, three 3-bedroom units.

The station had a ½-ton pickup truck assigned which, among other things, was utilized to transport dependent school children to school three miles (5km) from the station.|$|E
25|$|As the North Tower collapsed, heavy debris hit 7World Trade Center, causing {{damage to}} the south face of the {{building}} and starting fires that continued to burn throughout the afternoon. Structural damage occurred to the southwest corner between Floors 7 and 17 and on the south face between Floor 44 and the roof; other possible structural damage includes a large vertical gash {{near the center of the}} south face between Floors 24 and 41. The building was equipped with a sprinkler system, but had many single-point vulnerabilities for failure: the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps, rather than being a fully automatic system; the floor-level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser; and the sprinkler system required some power for the <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> to deliver water. Also, water pressure was low, with little or no water to feed sprinklers.|$|E

25|$|This {{building}} was a 1918 motor car garage. At one end it contains restored horse-drawn vehicles. There is {{a reproduction of}} an 1890 garden seat omnibus, with wooden, slatted seats on top, like garden seats. These vehicles have not {{been used in the}} UK since 1931. This reproduction has hydraulic disc brakes for safety. There is a brougham, a 19th-century gentleman's light one-horse carriage. This design {{is said to have been}} named after Lord Chancellor Brougham in the early 19th century. There is also a steamer, or Shand Mason steam <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> of ca.1880. A team of horses pulled it, and steam powered it, at 250 gallons per minute. Firemen could get it ready in 7 minutes. It was successful enough for the manufacturers to export it worldwide - for example to the Warsaw Fire Guard - but it was expensive in coal and horses, and was superseded by motor pumps in ca.1900.|$|E

Large diameter hose are carried on full-size fire engines, but smaller diameters of hard suction hose {{can be carried}} on apparatus with smaller <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> ratings, such as wildland fire engines. In the United States, NFPA 1901 requires engines to have hard suction hose that matches the engine's pump rating. [...] For example, an engine with a [...] per minute pump is required to carry [...] or larger hose, while a wildland fire engine will typically carry [...] hard suction hose.|$|E
500|$|Unloading of Fort Stikine {{began with}} the {{lubricating}} oil, followed by the fish manure. An extra gang of stevedores were employed on this task, which continued through the night of 13–14 April. At midday on 13 April, lighters arrived for the explosives. Minor engine repairs also started at that time, rendering the ship unable to move under her own power. At 12:30, the Chief Officer of [...] noticed smoke issuing from the ventilators of the № 2 hold of Fort Stikine. This was also seen {{a short time later}} by a DEMS gunner on board [...] Despite being seen by these (and other) witnesses, everyone assumed that the situation was under control. The alarm was not raised until 13:45. The <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> in the ship's engine room was started and the firefighting operation began.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are needed}} {{when the local}} {{municipal}} water system cannot provide sufficient pressure to meet the hydraulic design requirements of the fire sprinkler system. This usually occurs if the building is very tall, such as in high-rise buildings, or in systems that require a relatively high terminal pressure at the fire sprinkler {{in order to provide}} a large volume of water, such as in storage warehouses. <b>Fire</b> <b>pumps</b> are also needed if fire protection water supply is provided from a ground level water storage tank.|$|R
2500|$|An early device used {{to squirt}} water onto a fire {{was known as}} a squirt or fire syringe. Hand squirts and hand pumps are noted before Ctesibius of Alexandria invented the first <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> around the 2nd century B.C., and an example of a force-pump {{possibly}} used for a fire-engine is mentioned by Heron of Alexandria. [...] The <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> was reinvented in Europe during the 16th century, reportedly used in Augsburg in 1518 and Nuremberg in 1657. A book of 1655 inventions mentions a steam engine (called a fire engine) pump used to [...] "raise a column of water [...] ", but {{there was no mention of}} whether it was portable.|$|E
50|$|A Variable Speed (VFD) <b>Fire</b> <b>Pump</b> Controller is a <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> {{controller}} that {{is able to}} {{vary the}} speed of the motor depending on the demand of the <b>fire</b> <b>pump,</b> resulting in the ability to hold a constant discharge pressure. It differs from other industrial variable speed control devices because it is now considered a life safety device, and so must adhere to the more rigid standards set forth by NFPA-20.|$|E
5000|$|Variable Speed <b>Fire</b> <b>Pump</b> Controllers {{were invented}} and {{released}} with a UL Listing for <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> service in 2003 by Master Control Systems, Inc.

In addition to reading these standards, a detailed summary of them by James S. Nasby of Columbia Engineering {{can be found on}} slides 7-11. In 2008 Master Control Systems, Inc. became the first company to provide FM Approval for the controller. A full list of companies with FM Approval may be found here. [...] Variable Speed <b>Fire</b> <b>Pump</b> Controllers are now accepted by NFPA-20, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and most recently Factory Mutual (FM) for <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> applications.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>pumping</b> {{systems are}} often used for {{firefighting}} {{in the majority of}} buildings, can they be residential, commercial, industrial or any other type. These systems are responsible for the needed water flow and pressure on manual or automatic devices installed for building protection purposes. Thus, {{it is very important to}} assure their availability when an undesirable fire event occurs. This paper focuses <b>fire</b> <b>pumping</b> systems' availability when they are submitted to regular periodic inspections or tests. These inspections or tests are performed to observe the system behavior and detect potential hidden failures of some component or subsystem. The methodology proposed in this paper is focused in the first stage on the analysis of the probability of failure on demand of critical equipment and analyzing the probability of success of this important stage. It is also shown the influence of inspection or tests frequency on the desired availability of the <b>fire</b> <b>pumping</b> system. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
