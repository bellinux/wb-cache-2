5|$|In {{order to}} become {{recognised}} fully by the American Kennel Club, they must first compete in a Miscellaneous Class. The requirements to compete <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class</b> are to demonstrate a following by having a minimum of 100 active members in a national breed club, a population of 300 to 400 dogs, with third generation pedigrees and for all dogs in those pedigrees {{to be of the}} same breed, a distribution across twenty or more states, and the breed standard must be reviewed and approved by the AKC. Currently there are five dogs in the AKC's Miscellaneous Class which are Dogue de Bordeaux, Redbone Coonhound, Irish Red and White Setter, Norwegian Buhund and Pyrenean Shepherd. Typical stays <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class</b> are between one and three years, and the national club of the breed must have held seminars, shows and judges workshops prior to being fully recognised.|$|E

5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1990: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and sidecar. The 50/80cc referred {{to the size of}} the engines of the motorcycles that raced <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class.</b> The Grand Prix Road Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship. The 50cc was introduced in 1962, 13 years after the start of the first world championships. The category was replaced by 80cc in 1984 and the class was subsequently discontinued in 1989.|$|E

Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. 250cc is the intermediate category; the 250cc refers {{to the size of}} the engines of the motorcycles that race <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class.</b> The engines have twin cylinders, as opposed to the four cylinders used in MotoGP. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship. The 250cc class was replaced in 2010 by a new class called Moto2. The 250cc engines were replaced by 600cc engines, which were supplied by Honda to all teams.|$|E

25|$|When a given word {{class is}} subject to {{inflection}} in a particular language, there are generally one or more standard patterns of inflection (the paradigms described below) that words <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class</b> may follow.

25|$|In {{all classes}} and skill levels racers also {{receive the same}} number of points {{depending}} on how many are in their class and age group. These are called participant points. For instance if eight riders participate in 17-18 Intermediate class, all those who make the mains will get 8 points, including the last place finisher. If the class has 15 racers, all who make the main will get 15 points. So the winner of the Intermediate class will get 15 points for the fifteen racers <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class</b> on top of the 50 points for winning for a total of 65 points.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} factor determining social mobility in Finland was education. Children who attained {{a higher level of}} education than their parents were often able to rise in the hierarchy of occupations. A tripling or quadrupling in any one generation of the numbers receiving schooling beyond the required minimum reflected the needs of a developing economy for skilled employees. Obtaining advanced training or education was easier for some than for others, however, and the children of white-collar employees still were more likely to become white-collar employees themselves than were the children of farmers and blue-collar workers. In addition, children of white-collar professionals were more likely than not to remain <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E

25|$|Once {{cleared to}} fly one class of {{aircraft}}, pilots could {{be asked to}} ferry any plane <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class</b> {{even if they had}} never seen that type of aircraft before. To do so they had Ferry Pilot Notes, a two-ring book of small cards with the critical statistics and notations necessary to ferry each aircraft. A pilot cleared on more than one class could be asked to fly an aircraft in any of the categories on which he or she was qualified. Thus even a pilot cleared to fly four-engined bombers could be assigned to fly a single-engined trainer if scheduling made this {{the most efficient way to}} get the aircraft to its destination.|$|E
25|$|The first ATA {{pilots were}} {{introduced}} to military aircraft at the RAF’s Central Flying School (CFS), but the ATA soon developed its own training programme. Pilots progressed from light single-engined aircraft to more powerful and complicated aircraft in stages. They first qualified on one “class” of aircraft, then gained experience on that class by doing ferrying work with any and all aircraft <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class,</b> before returning to training to qualify on the next class of aircraft. As a result, pilots made progress {{on the basis of}} their own capabilities rather than on a rigid timetable. This ensured not only that as many pilots as possible advanced, but that those that could not were still gainfully employed flying the aircraft types on which they had qualified.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong's book {{provided}} the first in-depth description of tone in any East African Bantu language. Throughout the book, Armstrong represented tone with a pictorial system; a benefit {{of this method}} was {{that she did not}} need to have a tonemic analysis. A sequence of dashes at varying heights and angles accompanied each word or sentence throughout the book. Armstrong's description of Kikuyu tone involved grouping stems into tone classes; each tone class was defined in terms of its tonal allomorphy depending on surrounding context. Subclasses were based on properties like length or structure of the stem. Armstrong discussed five tone classes for verbs, named Tonal Class I–V, and a small group of verbs which do not belong to any of those five classes, seven tone classes for nouns, each named after a word <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class,</b> e.g., the [...] Tonal Class ( [...] "person"), and three tone classes for adjectives, each named after a stem <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class,</b> e.g., the [...] Tonal Class ( [...] "good").|$|E

500|$|In battle, JP {{are rewarded}} for every {{successful}} action. JP {{are used to}} learn new abilities within each job class. Accumulating enough JP results in a job level up; new jobs are unlocked by attaining a certain level in the current job class (for instance, to become a Priest or Wizard, the unit must first attain Job Level 2 as a Chemist), which also allows the character to gain more JP <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>class</b> in battles. Once all the abilities of a job class have been learned, the class is [...] "Mastered". A soldier in a specific Job always has its innate skill equipped (Wizards always have [...] "Black Magic," [...] Knights always have [...] "Battle Skill") but a second job-skill slot and several other ability slots (Reaction, Support, and Movement) can be filled with any skill the particular soldier has learned from any job class. This deep level of customization and flexibility grants nigh-infinite replayability, contributing to the game's unusually enduring popularity.|$|E

While Kenneth fumbles with the computer, Jack examines the house and finds evidence that Nancy's marriage is reaching its end. They eventually play the message, after Jack finds the voicemail code, in which Jack reminisces about their times in high school German class. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>class,</b> [...] Jack had the name [...] "Klaus" [...] and Nancy had the name [...] "Greta"—and Jack says that he took the class to be with her.
