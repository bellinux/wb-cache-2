5|$|ASL is used {{throughout}} Anglo-America. This contrasts with Europe, where {{a variety of}} sign languages are used within the same continent. The unique situation of ASL {{seems to have been}} caused by the proliferation of ASL through schools influenced by the American School <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf,</b> wherein ASL originated, and the rise of community organizations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1888, Gilkeson was {{delegated}} by the Board to Regents to attend the Conference of Superintendents and Principals of American Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> in New York City and select the most fitting candidate present at the conference or recommended someone to replace him as principal of the West Virginia Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind. Gilkeson tendered an offer to C.H. Hill, then an instructor at the Maryland School <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf,</b> and upon Gilkeson's return to Romney he recommended Hill and resigned from his post as principal. Hill was subsequently appointed by the Board to fill the position. While the Board of Regents was pleased with Gilkeson's performance as principal and wished for him to stay on in the position, but he preferred {{to return to his}} professional law and political career in the end.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 1870, the institute, {{which was}} later {{known as the}} West Virginia Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind, opened its doors in the old Romney Classical Institute {{building}} with 25 deaf and five blind students. Following its disestablishment in 1916, the adjacent Potomac Academy (formerly Potomac Seminary) grounds were also incorporated into {{the campus of the}} Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind.|$|E

5|$|The {{institute}} {{and the society}} experienced a hiatus {{during the course of}} the war. The school held sessions under Reverend Nelson, and subsequently William C. Clayton in 1866. Clayton later served in the West Virginia Senate. The Romney Literary Society was revived in 1869, and following the passage of a bill which established the West Virginia Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind in March 1870, the society offered the institute's building and grounds to the state of West Virginia for the new school. The institute's property was transferred to the state and the West Virginia Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind opened for its first term on September 29, 1870. Following the schools' subsequent expansions, the institute's former building became the center portion of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind, in which capacity it serves at the present day. In addition to Jacob and Clayton, Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia, was also an alumnus of the institute.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{emerged as}} a {{language}} in the American School <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> (ASD), founded in 1817. This school brought together Old French Sign Language, various village sign languages, and home sign systems; ASL was created in this situation of language contact. ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E

5|$|After the {{foundation}} and success of the American School <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf,</b> many other institutions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> were founded throughout the country. Since schools, particularly in the South, were segregated, many Southern states created separate schools or departments for Black deaf children. The first school established for Black deaf children below the Mason–Dixon line opened in the District of Columbia in 1857; it remained segregated until 1958. The last Southern state to create an institution for Black deaf children was Louisiana in 1938. Black deaf children became a language community isolated from White deaf children, with different means of language socialization, allowing for different dialects to develop. Because the education of White children was privileged over that of Black children, oralism—the prominent pedagogical method of the time—was not as strictly applied to the Black deaf students. Oralist methods often forbade the use of sign language, so Black deaf students had more opportunities to use ASL than did their White peers. Despite the decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, integration was slow to come. Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> were no exception: the last desegregated in 1978, 24 years after the decision.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, Smythe became {{involved}} in charities and would remain so {{for the rest of}} his life. He became heavily involved in the Ontario Society for Crippled Children.

5|$|Around {{the time}} of the society's {{reorganization}} in 1869, the state of West Virginia considered the establishment of a school <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> and the blind.

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line to Romney in the 1880s, a {{passenger}} train conducted three trips daily (morning, noon, and evening) from the Romney Depot at Valley to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line. During the 1930s, passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline, and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter. A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind, arriving at Romney Depot in Valley in the fall, and departing in the spring to take the students home. The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind departed Romney Depot in the spring of 1941. Freight operations from Romney Depot later ceased, and the station was closed and demolished soon after.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the {{contents}} of the society's library were plundered by Union Army forces, and many of its 3,000 volumes were either scattered or destroyed. After a reorganization in 1869, the society commenced construction of the present Literary Hall in downtown Romney. It transferred ownership of its Romney Classical Institute campus to the West Virginia Schools <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind in 1870 and in that year completed Literary Hall, where the society reconstituted its library collection and revived its literary activities.|$|E
