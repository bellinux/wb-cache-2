40|$|While {{consumption}} <b>habits</b> {{have been}} utilised {{as a means}} of generating a hump shaped output response to monetary policy shocks in sticky-price New Keynesian economies, there is relatively little analysis of the impact of <b>habits</b> (particularly, external <b>habits)</b> on optimal policy. In this paper we consider the implications of external <b>habits</b> for optimal monetary policy, when those <b>habits</b> either exist {{at the level of the}} aggregate basket of consumption goods (‘superficial’ <b>habits)</b> or at the level of individual goods (‘deep’ habits: see Ravn, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe (2006)). External <b>habits</b> generate an additional distortion in the economy, which implies that the flex-price equilibrium will no longer be efficient and that policy faces interesting new trade-offs and potential stabilisation biases. Furthermore, the endogenous mark-up behaviour, which emerges when <b>habits</b> are deep, can also significantly affect the optimal policy response to shocks, as well as dramatically affecting the stabilising properties of standard simple rules.

Moreover, negative {{body image}} {{is found to}} cause unhealthy eating <b>habits</b> {{in the context of}} several cross-cultural settings. This study aimed to examine the correlation between health perception and body image with eating <b>habits</b> among high school students. Methods: A structured, anonymous questionnaire was distributed to students of a private high school in Bandung, Indonesia in June-October 2014. The questionnaire included questions about health perception, body image, eating <b>habits,</b> body weight and height, and also other demographic parameters. The school was selected as the study object through purposive sampling, and 140 high school students (72 male and 68 female) were ramdomly selected. Results: Male and female did not show considerable differences in health perceptions. Out of 13 statements, 12 statements of male respondents showed better body image than female. While in eating <b>habits</b> statements, female respondents seemed to maintain healthier eating <b>habits</b> than male respondents. No significant correlation was observed between body image and eating <b>habits</b> (r=- 0. 015, p= 0. 858). There was significant correlation between health perception and eating <b>habits</b> (r= 0. 374, p< 0. 001). Correlation between sex and eating <b>habits</b> was found (p= 0. 020), there was not significant relationship between eating <b>habits</b> and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p= 0. 368). Conclusions: The negative relationship between body image and eating <b>habits</b> is not significant. However there was a significant positive relationship between health perception and eating <b>habits.</b> Furthermore, there was correlation between sex and eating <b>habits,</b> while the positive relationship between eating <b>habits</b> and BMI was still not found...|$|R

Data was collected through a questionnaire consisting two sections, the first of which contained demographic data and the second was on Palsane and Sharma Study <b>Habits</b> Inventory (PSSHI) distributed to the students by the researchers and then collected in their dorms and schools. Results: The mean of the study <b>habits</b> was 51. 59 out of 90, and it was found that 21. 4 % of students had adverse study <b>habits,</b> and 60. 5 % had favorable study <b>habits.</b> There was no significant relationship between scores from different areas of study <b>habits</b> in nursing, midwifery and surgical technologist with Kruskal-Wallis test, however, the comparison of different study <b>habits</b> in academic terms we found that there was significant difference between scores in different areas of study <b>habits</b> among students.

40|$|Social {{differences}} {{in the role of}} <b>habits</b> in health-related behaviour are explored within both sociology and economics, where we define <b>habits</b> as non-reflective, repetitive behaviour. The corresponding theoretical perspectives are the habitus theory, the theory of individualization, and <b>habits</b> as rational decision rules. Sixteen thematically structured interviews are analysed using qualitative methodology. Three aspects of <b>habits</b> emerged from the narrative: the association between <b>habits</b> and preferences, <b>habits</b> as a source of utility, and the relationship between <b>habits</b> and norms. We find that people in lower social positions are more inclined to rely on their <b>habits</b> and are accordingly less likely to change their behaviour. These differences are reinforced as not only the disposition to maintain <b>habits</b> but also the tendency to conceive of the habitual as something good seems to be strengthened in lower social positions. We also note that the intensified individualization that characterizes current society erodes the basis for habit-governed behaviour, which may also contribute to social {{differences in}} well-being. Finally, we find that the scientific dialogue has enriched both scientific paradigms, and suggest as a tentative hypothesis that the traditional economic rational-actor model may be relatively less applicable to those with limited resources. <b>Habits</b> Behaviour Health Social differences...|$|R
