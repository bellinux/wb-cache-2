50|$|Dispersal {{by humans}} (anthropochory) {{used to be}} seen as a form of {{dispersal}} by animals. Recent research points out that human dispersers differ from animal dispersers by a much higher mobility based on the technical means of human transport. Dispersal by humans on the one hand may act on large geographical scales and lead to invasive species. On the other hand, dispersal by humans also acts on smaller, regional scales and drives the dynamics of existing biological populations. Humans may disperse seeds by many various means and some surprisingly high distances have been repeatedly measured. Examples are: dispersal on human <b>clothes</b> (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 250 m), on shoes (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 5 km) or by cars (regularly ~ 250 m, singles cases > 100 km).|$|R

He does a monotonous job at ZAO Progress company (a typical {{name of a}} post-Soviet enterprise converted from a military plant into a company producing consumer goods), strives for nothing, wants nothing, is interested in nothing at all. He dedicates his free time to gluing plastic models of aircraft, which is quite similar to what he does at work. He apparently has no parents, perhaps they died, and lives in his grandmother's apartment, who loves her grandson and buys him second-hand <b>clothes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her taste. She must be an arduous Christian, but rather an andherent of one of numerous non-traditional confessions that emerged in Russia after the perestroika.|$|R

If the picture (for the present description is taken from a print) be really by Rembrandt, his intention must have been to burlesque the mythological subject above stated, for he has represented the beautiful Ganymede as a great lubberly child, with a blubbering grimace of countenance, sprawling, with extended arms, in the talons and beak of the eagle Jupiter. The bird has seized him by his unclassical raiments, the weight of his fat body has drawn his <b>clothes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his shoulders, and left his lower extremities in a state of nudity, and is thus bearing him through the murky air to Olympus.

30|$|Residential {{clothes dryers}} were {{available}} in the early 1940 s; however, they were expensive, and most families could not afford them. In 1955, only 10 % of US households had one (Morris 2017). After 1955, companies were able to sell automatic clothes dryers {{at a much lower}} price; therefore, clothes dryer sales increased considerably. According to the United States Energy Information Administration (2009), 79.4 % of US households have a clothes dryer (63.2 % electric clothes dryer, 15.3 % gas clothes dryer, and 0.9 % propane clothes dryer). The averaged number of annual dryer loads varies in different households, but is estimated to be 439 (McCowan et al. 2015). However, using a clothes dryer is a habit peculiar to the US and Canada (81 % in 2009; Statista 2017). Many Europeans and Asians who can afford to purchase clothes dryers still tend <b>to</b> hang <b>clothes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> dry. It is possible that US consumers prefer convenience and time saving and worry that clothes hung outdoor will absorb environmental dust and/or car exhausts. Many people in other countries, however, consider having a clothes dryer a waste of energy and money. In addition, most households do not have enough room for both a washer and a dryer.|$|R

I also noticed a quantity of blood under her head on the footway. The P.C. said heres another murder. I directed the P.C. not to leave the body or let anyone touch it until the Dr. arrived.

25|$|The first {{attempts}} at developing an odor-based form of crowd control began in Israel in 2004 by Rafael. The IDF reconsidered {{at the time}} a change in its open fire procedures, and adopting other crowd dispersal methods after an Israeli demonstrator, Gil Na'amati (21), was shot during a protest over the separation barrier, near the West Bank village of Mas-ha in late 2003. It reportedly does not wash off easily and may linger on <b>clothes</b> for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> five years. The development of Skunk followed numerous accusations against Israeli forces that they often employ disproportionate force in clashes with Palestinian protestors (e.g. using rubber bullets or tear gas), which has led them to seek new, non-lethal but effective methods of crowd control.|$|R
50|$|The second video, {{directed}} by Steven Oritt, features the band playing the song {{along with a}} man in his house watching a woman through binoculars in her house as she swims, takes a bath and dresses for a night out. While she is getting dressed, the man watching her sees a figure in dark <b>clothes</b> sneak <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her door, and creep in without knocking. The man panics, puts down the binoculars and picks up his keys. He drives to her house, and knocks on the door. He is surprised to see the hooded man {{on the other side of}} the door, with the girl he'd been watching right behind him. Embarrassed, he says nothing while the couple leaves holding hands.|$|R

She could have escaped at first, but she heard Sally cry to her through the blinding smoke, and went to find and rescue her. I dimly recalled that, and pressed closer to the white shoulder, full of pride and affection for the kind soul whom I had often thought too gay and giddy to care for anything but pleasure.|$|R
5000|$|The camp had a {{reputation}} for good living conditions, fair wages, and good food. Lumberjacks ate a lot, and if the food wasn't to their liking, they would leave and seek employment with a different company. The sleeping accommodations were spartan, with rows of wooden bunk beds topped with mattresses stuffed with straw, hay, or evergreen boughs, along with pillows stuffed with grain and straw. Author Cathy Wurzer speculates that the smell in the bunkhouse was rather [...] "ripe", given the smell of wet woolen <b>clothes</b> being hung <b>up</b> <b>to</b> dry and the housing of sweaty workers living in close quarters.|$|R

She lived on her own at this point, and got a job {{to be able to afford}} <b>clothes</b> and make <b>up</b> <b>to</b> fit in. When the twins started high school, her mother decided to move with them to Malta and they all moved into Judy's grandmother's house, which made Judy's life more isolated.

Finally, Rüdiger and Anna ring the bell. They wear human <b>clothes</b> and make <b>up</b> <b>to</b> hide they are vampires. The whole party is overseen by aunt Dorothee/Hildegard, uncle Theodor/Ludwig and Lumpi. While {{it is no surprise}} that Anna drinks milk, they believe both ate bread due to mimed chewing (although Anton quickly wolfed most of each sandwich), and Rudiger is seen apparently drinking tea (it is consommé soup). Even Lumpi is shocked when he discovers Rüdiger consumes the regular human food. Theodor/Ludwig suspects they are not vampires.|$|R
5000|$|Gainfully {{employed}} in the delivery department of the Panther Pilsner Beer company (a reference to the derogatory slang term, characterizing poor quality beer as [...] "panther piss"), the Stooges suffer several mishaps while loading {{the back of their}} truck with a six-barrel tall stack of beer barrels. After learning of a golf tournament their company is sponsoring, in which cash prizes will be awarded, the boys quickly drive off to the Rancho Golf Club. To gain access they impersonate reporters by using knobs torn from bathroom fixtures as press badges. The ruse barely succeeds—Moe's and Larry's are marked [...] "press", but Curly's reads [...] "pull". Once inside, the Stooges steal some golfers' <b>clothes,</b> and split <b>up</b> <b>to</b> practice—although they know absolutely nothing about golf.|$|R
50|$|The {{fifth and}} last {{disappearance}} occurred sixteen days after Jephson had vanished. On October 28, 1950, Frieda Langer, 53, and her cousin, Herbert Elsner, left their family campsite near the Somerset Reservoir {{to go on}} a hike. During the hike, Langer slipped and fell into a stream. She told Elsner if he would wait, she would go back to the campsite, change <b>clothes</b> and catch <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him. When she did not return, Elsner made {{his way back to the}} campsite and discovered Langer had not returned, and that nobody had seen her since they had left. Over the next two weeks, five searches were conducted, involving aircraft, helicopters, and <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 300 searchers. No trace of Langer was found during the search. On May 12, 1951, her body was found near Somerset Reservoir, in an area that had been extensively searched seven months previously. No cause of death could be determined because of the condition of her remains.|$|R

50|$|Brian is {{also called}} back into town {{to deal with}} Tiffany for sneaking off. When Brian orders her to come downstairs she is at first hesitant, but then finally comes down. When he asks and confronts her about sneaking off to the party, she boldly admits to it and tells him to get over it. It is clear Tiffany has zero respect for Brian as a parent due to him being a pushover and refusing to {{discipline}} his kids {{the same way he}} was raised by Joe. Madea, Hattie, and Bam then begin <b>to</b> pack Tiffany's <b>clothes</b> <b>up</b> in bags <b>to</b> throw her out of the house. This plan works and Tiffany and Brian lay their feelings out about Brian's wife cheating on him and him being a pushover. Brian, finally toughening up, participates in helping to throw her out and exclaims that she can either live there with him, abiding by his rules and respecting him, or go out on the street on her own. Tiffany apologizes to Brian and the women for her behavior and agrees to listen to her father's rules. Afterwards, the police return to Brian's house looking for Tiffany, revealing to her that her best friend, Aday has gone missing. They then take her with them and handcuff her.|$|R
