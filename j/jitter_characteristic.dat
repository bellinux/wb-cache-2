40|$|Sub-picosecond laser-electron {{synchronization}} {{is required}} {{to take full advantage}} of the experimental possibilities arising from the marriage of modern high intensity lasers and high brightness electron beams in the same laboratory. Two particular scenarios stand out in this regard, injection of ultra-short electron pulses in short wavelength laser-driven plasma accelerators (1), and Compton scattering of laser photons from short electron pulses(2, 3). Both of these applications demand synchronization, which is sub-picosecond, with tens of femtosecond synchronization implied for next-generation experiments. Typically, an RF electron accelerator is synchronized to a short pulse laser system by detecting the repetition signal of a laser oscillator, adjusted to an exact sub-harmonic of the linac RF frequency, and multiplying or phase locking this signal to produce the master RF clock. Pulse-to-pulse <b>jitter</b> <b>characteristic</b> of self-modelocked laser oscillators represents a direct contribution to the ultimate timing jitter between a high intensity laser focus and electron beam at the interaction point, or a photocathode drive laser in an RF photoinjector.

40|$|Electrical systems {{which use}} voltage {{transitions}} to represent timing information {{suffer from a}} degrading phenomenon called timing jitter. Sampling time jitter is the deviation of sampling clock from its ideal position. As transmission rates raise above couple of GHz, deviations become significant comparing to signalling interval, jitter becomes a fundamental performance bottleneck. Especially in band-limited communication systems that imperfect sampling times result in Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) jitter is a very limiting factor to decode correct transmitted data. In this case, jitter timing error translates into amplitude error. At first, the effect of sampling time jitter at the received signal is modelled as an additive noise. This additive noise signal which we call it jitter noise is a coloured noise that also depends on input signal. Expressions for jitter noise correlation factors, its cross- correlation with input signal are derived. These correlations depend on input spectral density, timing <b>jitter</b> <b>characteristic</b> function (Fourier transform of jitter probability density function) and whether timing jitter is white or coloured. In case of first order Gauss-Markov process for sampling time jitter {{it is observed that}} in high memory regime (highly correlated timing jitter) the spectral density of additive jitter noise is concentrated around higher frequencies. Exploiting this quality, a spectral shaping scheme is used to improve the performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) for an AWGN channel with discrete input corrupted by sampling time jitter. Simulation results comparing the proposed scheme performance with a minimum distance decoder are provided. As another approach the well-known Viterbi Algorithm is used for decoding same AWGN channel suffering from ISI terms due to sampling jitter. The Viterbi algorithm, which basically is a dynamic programming algorithm, finds the most likely input data and jitter times based on observed output sequence. A quantized version of jitter times is {{used to be able to}} work with a finite state trellis and to find likelihoods along the paths of the diagram. Then Bit Error Rate curves for different jitter quantization levels and different impulse response lengths of channel are presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{reactive}} routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks which uses {{the mechanisms of}} Swarm Intelligence to select next hops. Our protocol, Ad hoc Networking with Swarm Intelligence (ANSI), is a congestion-aware routing protocol, which, owing to the self-configuring mechanisms of Swarm Intelligence, is able to collect {{more information about the}} local network and make more effective routing decisions than traditional MANET protocols. Once routes are found, ANSI maintains routes along a path from source to destination effectively, without high MAC layer overheads, by using Swarm Intelligence techniques, and is able to gauge the slow deterioration of a link and restore a path along newer links as and when necessary. ANSI is thus more responsive to topological fluctuations. In addition, owing to ANSI’s lower delay <b>jitter</b> <b>characteristics</b> at high loads, ANSI is inherently more suited for certain types of multimedia applications over mobile ad hoc networks. Our simulation study compared ANSI with AODV and the results show that ANSI is able to achieve better or comparable results at lower loads and better results at higher traffic loads as compared to AODV. In addition, ANSI achieves this performance with comparable or better delay and <b>jitter</b> <b>characteristics</b> along with significantly lower consumption of MAC layer resources. Lastly, ANSI is able to perform more consistently, considering the lower variation (measured as the width of the confidence intervals) of the observed values in the results of the experiments.

When > 100 coherently phased 5 MeV electron bunches are produced in bursts, the photoinjector should be an ideal electron source for a pulsed, pre-bunched free-electron laser (FEL) operating at 100 GHz. The laser oscillator is a self-modelocked Titanium:Sapphire system operating at the 108 th subharmonic of the rf gun. The X-band signal is produced from the laser by a phase-locked dielectric resonance oscillator, and amplified by a pulsed TWT and klystron. A comparison between the klystron and TWT amplifier phase noise and the fields excited in the rf gun demonstrates the filtering effect of the high Q structure, thus indicating that the rf gun {{can be used as}} a master oscillator, and could be energized by either a rf oscillator such as a magnetron or a compact source such as a cross-field amplifier.

It is shown through simulation that MOD_GBW also provides guaranteed bandwidth and that its delay and <b>jitter</b> <b>characteristics</b> are significantly better than those of the GBW protocol.

For both results, the outcomes led to trajectories that were significantly smoother and apt at reaching fixed or moving targets with relative ease and within a 5 % error margin or deviation from desired trajectories. The positive effects of such jitter reduction are presented graphically for visual appreciation...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of the design parameters of the compact, high gradient, high luminosity X-band (8. 568 GHz) photoinjector facility currently being developed as a collaborative effort between LLNL and UC Davis, {{is followed by a}} more detailed description of each of its major subsystems : X-band rf gun, GHz repetition rate synchronously modelocked AlGaAs quantum well laser oscillator, and 8 -pass Ti: Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } chirped pulse laser amplifier. The photoinjector uses a high quantum efficiency ({approx} 5 %) Cs{sub 2 }Te photocathode, and will be capable of producing high charge (> 1 nC), relativistic (5 MeV), ultrashort (< 1 ps) electron bunches at 2. 142 GHz repetition rate in burst mode (100 photoelectron bunches). Design studies indicate that a normalized rms transverse emittance {epsilon}{sub n} = 0. 75 {pi} mm-mrad is possible at 0. 1 nC charge, while 2. 5 {pi} mm-mrad can be obtained at 1 nC. A complete status report of our progress in {{the development and implementation of}} the design discussed herein is then given, together with initial experimental data concerning the performance of the 15 MW SLAC X-band klystron amplifier. Finally, the phase noise and <b>jitter</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the laser and rf systems of the high gradient X-band photoinjector have been measured experimentally. In this case, the laser oscillator is a self-modelocked Titanium:Sapphire system operating at the 108 th subharmonic of the rf gun. The X-band signal is produced from the laser by a phase-locked dielectric resonance oscillator, and amplified by a pulsed TWT. A comparison between the TWT phase noise and the fields excited in the rf gun demonstrates the filtering effect of the high Q cavity resonant structure, thus indicating that the rf gun can be used as a master oscillator, and could be energized by either a magnetron or a cross-field amplifier...|$|R
