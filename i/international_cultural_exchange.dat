40|$|Considerable {{negative}} {{views of}} China’s rise persist in international opinion, highlighted by criticisms of China’s {{domestic and foreign}} affairs and concerns of “China threat”. To tell China's story to the world, Chinese leaders {{pay particular attention to}} <b>international</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>exchanges.</b> How does the foreign public respond to China’s <b>cultural</b> <b>exchange</b> program abroad? During the 2011 Terracotta Army exhibition in Montreal, this survey finds a majority of respondents view China’s oversea cultural programs positively and favours the idea that <b>cultural</b> <b>exchanges</b> help to improve China's international image, while a substantial number of audience holds either neutral or unfavourable attitudes towards China’s international image and lacks knowledge about China and Chinese culture. This paper suggests that China’s <b>international</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>exchanges</b> should be maintained and enhanced with a two-pronged approach to provide foreign public with a convincing source of learning about both ancient Chinese culture and contemporary Chinese experience and hence, reduce their doubts and concerns about China’s development. <br /...|$|R
