50|$|Not {{only were}} 28 mm printed films safer, {{they were also}} more {{efficient}} than 35 mm film. 28 mm film held 20.5 frames per foot as opposed to 16 frames per foot on 35 mm film. “A 400 foot reel of 28 mm film was equal to over 500 feet of 35 mm film.

5000|$|In 1963, Crest Digital {{developed}} the first 35/32 printing equipment {{for use in}} motion picture labs. [...] The first closed captioning for the hearing impaired direct for home video cassette and videodisc release was introduced by Crest Digital (then called Crest National) in 1984. The company introduced the world's first 65/70mm flying spot scanner <b>film</b> <b>transfer</b> system, “Ultrascan 70™” in 1991. In 2002, the first Cineglyph HD large-format telecine was introduced. Royal Philips Electronics and Crest Digital partnered in May 2002 to develop and install the first Super Audio CD (SACD) hybrid disc production line {{in the country at}} Crest Digital's Hollywood facilities, with a production capacity of 3 million discs per year. Crest Digital also did the first MPEG encoding for in-flight films.|$|E
50|$|Spirit DataCine is a {{telecine}} {{and/or a}} motion picture film scanner. This device {{is able to}} transfer 16mm and 35mm motion picture film to NTSC or PAL television standards or one of many High-definition television standards. With the data transfer option a Spirit DataCine can output DPX data files. The image pick up device is a solid state charge-coupled device. This eliminated the need for glass vacuum tube CRTs used on older telecines. The units can transfer negative film, primetime, intermediate film and print film, stock. One option is a Super 8 gate for the transfer of Super 8 mm film. With a sound pick up option, optical 16mm and 35mm sound can be reproduced, also 16mm magnetic strip sound. The unit can operate stand alone or be controlled by a scene by scene color corrector. Ken Burns, {{the creator of the}} The Civil War documentary film included in the DVD release, a short documentary on how he used the Spirit DataCine to transfer and remaster this film. The operator of the unit is called a Colorist or Colorist Assistant. The Spirit DataCine has become the standard for high-end real-time <b>film</b> <b>transfer</b> and scanning. Over 370 units are used in post production facilities around the world. Most current film productions are transferred on Spirit DataCines for TV, Digital television, Cable television, Satellite television, Direct-to-video, DVD, blu-ray Disc, pay-per-view, In-flight entertainment, Stock footage, Dailies, Film preservation, digital intermediate and digital cinema. The Spirit DataCine is made by DFT Digital Film Technology GmbH in Darmstadt, Germany.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2011, Moore {{pointed out}} that nearly fifteen minutes of {{somewhat}} controversial statements from kids at Hunters Point were cut from his film. This was a concession that he deeply regretted. It was made following complaints from the KQED Board. They felt that the lengthy sequences with young Black Muslims were excessive and that the film should not be broadcast. Cutting the sequences shifted the attention to Baldwin {{and away from the}} Black Muslims. In the interests of getting the film broadcast, Moore agreed to the cuts. This cleared the way for both local and national broadcast. It also placed a great strain on his relationship with James Baldwin. He was genuinely surprised at the intensity of the anger expressed by the youth and felt that this should be the major emphasis of the film. The long monologue {{at the end of the}} film shifted the attention back to Baldwin. This may have made it more of an [...] "artful" [...] documentary but at the expense of, once again, ignoring the plight of young, urban African Americans. A 16mm film print featuring Moore's original edit (59 minutes long) was identified in the KQED Film Collection at the San Francisco Bay Area Television Archive in June 2013 which contained 15 minutes of extra footage, mostly featuring scenes of African American youth speaking with Baldwin about their lives and the police, on the streets of San Francisco. Movette <b>Film</b> <b>Transfer</b> of San Francisco remastered this 16mm positive film print in August 2013 in 2K resolution (2048x1556 pixels), using a Kinetta film scanner.|$|E

40|$|Sliding {{friction}} {{experiments were}} conducted with the noble metals copper, silver, and gold and two binary alloys of these metals contacting iron {{in the presence of}} various adsorbates including, oxygen, methyl mercaptan, and methyl chloride. A pin on disk specimen configuration was used with a load of 100 grams, sliding velocity of 60 mm/min; at 25 C with the surfaces saturated with the adsorbates. Auger emission spectroscopy was used to monitor surface films. Results of the experiments indicate that friction and transfer characteristics are highly specific with respect to both the noble metal and surface film present. With all three metals and <b>films</b> <b>transfer</b> of the noble metal to iron occurred very rapidly.

40|$|Restricted Access. Discotic {{molecules}} {{are known}} to form highly anisotropic structures at the air-water (A-W) interface. We have studied two novel ionic discotic mesogenic molecules, viz., pyridinium tethered with hexaalkoxytriphenylene with bromide counterion (Py-Tp) and imidazolium tethered with hexaalkoxytriphenylene with bromide counterion (Im-Tp) at A-W and air-solid interfaces. The monolayer phases were investigated at the A-W interface employing surface manometry and Brewster angle microscopy techniques. They indicate a uniform monolayer phase which shows negligible hysteresis on expanding and compressing. Also, in both the systems the collapsed state completely reverts to the monolayer state. These monolayer <b>films</b> <b>transferred</b> at different surface pressures by Langmuir-Blodgett technique were studied by employing atomic force microscopy. The topographies of these <b>films</b> <b>transferred</b> at the low and high surface pressure region of the isotherm indicate a transformation of the monolayer from face-on to edge-on structure...|$|R
