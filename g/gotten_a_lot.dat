In terms of costume designe, Ottobre-Melton described Krzeminski as [...] "a bit of a slob with his sport jacket, and open collar shirts." [...] After the character's death, Butters explained that Carter would feel guilty about it moving forward, as it was her decisions that [...] "inadvertently put Krzeminski at risk". His death also affected the series in general, with Fazekas explaining, [...] "The stakes have changed now, they’ve <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more serious.

500|$|Jakob Von Bayer {{said the}} episode {{continued}} {{a long history}} of South Park Canada-bashing: [...] "South Park has <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of comic mileage out of Canada over the years. [...] This episode portrays a country full of Bob and Doug McKenzies; Toronto is but a highway town en route to Buffalo." [...] "Terrance and Philip in Not Without My Anus" [...] was among the episodes featured in a 2006 list by the Winnipeg Free Press of the ten most memorable South Park episodes. The Toronto Sun listed the episode {{as one of the most}} memorable television moments of 1998, and the single most memorable moment from the month of April. The prank played by the airing of this episode was revisited a number of times in subsequent episodes. The episode [...] "Cartoon Wars Part II" [...] revisits it by appearing to begin with a similar spoof, though the episode then cuts to the actual plot. The [...] episode, [...] "", also references the controversy over the airing of this episode, as does the thirteenth season episode, [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef".|$|E

500|$|With the Cardinals down by 25 {{points in}} the fourth quarter, quarterback Neil Lomax threw for three touchdowns in a come-from-behind win. One of the touchdowns was to tight end Robert Awalt, the other two to league {{reception}} leader J.T. Smith. Donald Igwebuike's potential game-tying 53-yard field goal attempt bounced off the crossbar as time ran out. The Cardinals came in on a three-game losing streak, while the Buccaneers entered the game leading the league in takeaways. The attendance of 22,449 was the Cardinals' lowest in four years, the team having announced the previous week their plans {{to move to another}} city. Detectives were assigned to guard Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill due to death threats. Irritation over DeBerg's celebrations after his three touchdown passes provided inspiration to some of the Cardinals, who commented, [...] "he's going to lose his job to Vinny Testaverde {{in a couple of weeks}} anyway". Awalt caught nine passes for 124yards, while Smith caught eight passes for 96yards. Said coach Perkins of his team's performance, [...] "...they whipped us in every phase of the game. Even down 28–3, they were playing better football than we were". After the Buccaneers turned three consecutive potential blowout wins into nail-biters, safety Rick Woods said that the team seemed to be playing not to lose instead of playing to win. As an example, he noted that many players turned to see how much time was left on the clock after Cardinals linebacker Niko Noga returned a James Wilder fumble for a touchdown. The next week, Woods was demoted to the taxi squad. Offensive tackle Rob Taylor suffered a strained medial collateral ligament, and center Randy Grimes was also out for the fourth quarter with a hyperextended knee. [...] "We should have <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more hurt", Perkins said, and accused his players of allowing positive press coverage to inflate their egos and cloud their judgments. The 25-point lead, if it had held, would have represented the largest margin of victory in a Buccaneers road win. Instead, it became the largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly Clarkson {{was born}} in Fort Worth, Texas, to Jeanne Ann (née Rose), a first grade English teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson, a former engineer.

Her mother is a descendant of Republican state senator Isaiah Rose, whose life story was discussed on Clarkson's episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, in 2013. Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist. She has said: [...] "I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I’ve always grown up pretty close to church and with God. But I think I’ve just <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> closer just because He’s the only one I can lean on."

2500|$|After {{the teasing}} of the Nick–Jess {{relationship}} in the first season, critics named Jake Johnson the breakout star of season 2 as the characters' romance unfolded. Saying that [...] "Not since Ross and Rachel's tango on Friends has watching a comedy romance been so satisfying", The Hollywood Reporter said the producers [...] "did the impossible by engaging their leads in a love story, which only strengthened the artistry of the single-cam comedy". The New York Times said season 2 [...] "erupted in fantastic and bizarre fits and starts" [...] because of the characters' unmatched personalities, and lauded the writers for not playing up the will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. By emphasing how the characters got together, the show [...] "made for hilarious setups [...] to high-level Abbott and Costello slapstick. They have a modern love. [...] Together, they are fully functional. They make each other human." [...] The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan was unconcerned about getting Jess and Nick together, as because of immaturity [...] "they're bound to keep on {{making a lot of}} amusing and painful mistakes, sometimes with each other. Those choices can be both hilarious and sad, and New Girl has <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of mileage out of both those areas." [...] The continued Nick–Jess relationship was criticized in season 3 for dropping the characters' personalities, lack of tension, and for neglecting the show's female friendship between Jess and Cece. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt that {{during the first half of}} season 3 that [...] "bringing them together caused that [...] spark [...] to diminish", while Hitfix Alan Sepinwall and The A.V. Club David Sims found that the show's perceived decline in quality had less to do with the Nick–Jess relationship but with the handling of Schmidt's cheating arc and the re-introduction of Coach.|$|E

One is my pal Joe Sacco's Safe Area Gorazde, and the other is Chris Ware's Jimmy Corrigan collection. Both of those books have <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of play in the 'mainstream' press; they've been written up in The New York Times for instance... It's that kind of more adult material that will help us break out of the sort of superhero-bound, direct-sales specialty market.
