25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a big thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the time. The reason I was using that concept so much {{at that point in}} my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E
500|$|All {{the things}} that {{happened}} were really inspiring, because it was frustrating ... But <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> least, every time we get really frustrated and you're hitting a wall and everything is chaos, it just makes the music that much better, because you have passion—even if it's negative. That's sometimes better, actually.|$|E

In a Rolling Stone article, PewDiePie admitted to being shocked by his fame; PewDiePie recalled a gaming event near his hometown, stating [...] "I remember there were five security guards yelling at a crowd to back up — it was out of control. It was shocking to find myself in that situation, where I was that celebrity person." [...] At the 2013 Social Star Awards, PewDiePie greeted his fans personally despite security warning him against doing so. PewDiePie also mentioned this event to Rolling Stone, stating, [...] "I didn't even understand they were screaming <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> first." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Slow Dance" [...] {{was written}} with Hilson {{alongside}} American recording artist Justin Timberlake, {{as well as}} Johnkenum D. Spivery and Timbaland protégés The Royal Court and Jim Beanz. According to Hilson, the songs were first in the works with fellow Timbaland collaborator Justin Timberlake in 2006, during FutureSex/LoveSounds era, but she commented, [...] "it was still unofficial then. The budgets hadn't been opened up <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> that stage." [...] Hilson premiered the song at her producer and mentor Jamal [...] "Polow da Don" [...] Jones's launch party his newly created, Interscope-distributed record label, Zone 4, in Atlanta in July 2007. On choosing singles for In A Perfect World..., {{in an interview with}} Digital Spy, Hilson stated, [...] " [...] liked it a lot at first and said it should be a single, but just as that was about to happen he called it 'bubble bath music'. But now he loves it again and thinks it should be a single! He'll really change it up on you." [...] The song went for adds on urban airplay formats on July 21, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Aware of the {{potential}} for controversy, Liszt wrote, [...] "The barometer is hardly set on praise <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the moment. I expect quite a hard downpour of rain when the symphonic poems appear." [...] Joseph Joachim, who in his time in Weimar had found Liszt's workshop rehearsals and the trial-and-error process practiced in them to be wearisome, was dismayed at what he considered their lack of creativity. Vienna music critic Eduard Hanslick found even the term [...] "Sinfonische Dichtung" [...] contradictory and offensive; he wrote against them with vehemence after he had heard only one, Les préludes. Surgeon Theodor Billroth, who was also a musical friend of Brahms, wrote of them, [...] "This morning [...] and Kirchner played the Symphonic Poems (sic) of Liszt on two pianos ... music of hell, and can't even be called musictoilet paper music! I finally vetoed Liszt on medical grounds and we purged ourselves with Brahms's [...] G Major String Sextet." [...] Wagner was more receptive; he agreed with the idea of the unity of the arts that Liszt espoused and wrote as much in his [...] "Open Letter on Liszt's Symphonic Poems". Walker considers this letter seminal in the War of the Romantics: ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984. The music was developed early in the recording sessions for The Joshua Tree. The Edge said, [...] "We were jamming with Brian [...] He was playing keyboards ... we just got this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost highlife, although it's not African at all ... the sound was <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> that time a very elaborate one. I would never have dreamt of using a sound like that before then, but it just felt right, and I went with it." [...] Bono recorded his vocals in a single take, as {{he felt that he}} could not sing the lyrics a second time. The Edge used a Bond Electraglide guitar to play a solo with a [...] "heavy fuzz" [...] sound {{at the end of the}} song. Three musicians from Toronto—Dick, Paul and Adele Armin—recorded string pieces for the song in Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario. In a six-hour phone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of producer Daniel Lanois, the Armins used [...] "sophisticated 'electro-acoustic' string instrument" [...] they developed called Raads to record a piece created for the song. Dick Armin said, [...] " [...] were interested in using strings, but not in the conventional style of sweetening. They didn't want a 19th-century group playing behind them." [...] Bono found the song so emotional, he was unable to listen to it after it had been recorded.|$|E
500|$|His first {{appearance}} of 2007–08 {{came as a}} 75th-minute substitute in a 2–0 defeat away to Darlington on 11 August 2007 and following a 2–1 away defeat against Bradford City on 25 August he said [...] "I'm pleased with my form at the moment because I've been working hard to try {{and stay in the}} team and I'm happy that things seem to be going well <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the moment". Mackin joined Conference Premier club Droylsden on 24 January 2008 on a one-month loan, having made seven appearances for Wrexham by that point in 2007–08. He made his debut two days later in a 1–0 home victory over Kidderminster Harriers and on 31 January 2008 the loan was extended {{until the end of the}} season after earning [...] "rave reviews" [...] for his performances. His only goal for Droylsden came in the 70th minute against Torquay United on 1 April 2008, which was their only goal in a 2–1 home defeat. He made 15 appearances and scored 1 goal for Droylsden before returning to Wrexham after being recalled from the loan in April 2008. The four appearances he made following his return were described as [...] "battling", and the last of these included his first goal for Wrexham in a 4–2 win away to Lincoln City on 3 May 2008, which was Wrexham's final match in the Football League before their relegation to the Conference Premier. He later commented [...] "I got a little touch on it and I'm not sure if the defender got the final touch but it went straight in and I'm very pleased with it!" [...] He finished the season with 11 appearances and 1 goal for Wrexham, with opportunities in the team again being rare.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{that year}} he mounted {{a show of}} O'Keeffe's works next to some amateurish {{paintings}} on glass by Becky Strand. He did not publish a catalog of the show, which the Strands took as an insult. Paul Strand never forgave Stieglitz. He said [...] "The day I walked into the Photo-Secession 291 [...] in 1907 was a great moment in my life… but the day I walked out of An American Place in 1932 was not less good.

Former world record holder Steve Cram emphasised the Games' role in developing younger athletes: [...] "That's what it was <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>at</b> 17 years old I went to the Commonwealth Games because Coe and Ovett didn't go. Nobody {{at the time was}} telling me it was bad that Coe and Ovett weren't there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gouldman’s {{reputation}} as a hit songwriter {{attracted the attention of}} bubblegum pop producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz of Super K Productions, who invited him to New York to write formula bubblegum songs. In what he later called a [...] "creative lowpoint", Gouldman accepted. He recalled: [...] "They wanted me to write and produce for them, so I figured, why not? Nothing else was happening <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the time. All told I worked for them for three or four periods {{over the course of a}} year, just writing and recording, and had no time for anything else. I was totally involved in the whole Kasenetz-Katz thing while I was with them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{characteristic of}} Ryelandt was his modesty. Although he enjoyed hearing his works performed, {{he left it}} to others—especially his teacher Tinel and Charles Lamy (pen name of Charles Martens, meaning ‘Charles, the friend ’)—to make his works known. As he put it: “If God wants my work to be known one day, that will happen. If not, what does it matter? The task of the artist is to create, and that’s it. Success is a luxury and a pleasure, it’s not indispensable.” He never bragged about the extra-musical honors that befell him. Sometimes he gently mocked them, like when, on being made Commander {{in the order of}} Leopold, he “complained” no one had told him whom to command. When he was very old, he told his daughter: “You must never call a priest or a doctor <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> night, not before 6 in the morning. Those folk need their sleep.” ...|$|E

In the interview, he disclosed that he also paid two of his children while a Senator for the Sarthe between 2005 and 2007, claiming that he employed them in their capacity as lawyers. He also pledged to resign if he would be personally placed under investigation. However, on 27 January, it was revealed that both Marie and Charles Fillon were only law students when their father employed them during his stint in the Senate, contrary to his statements the previous day. Interrogated by investigators the same day, former editor-in-chief of the Revue des deux Mondes Michel Crépu claimed that only [...] "two or maybe three" [...] bylines in the review were attributed to her, also saying that he had seen [...] "no trace" [...] of any work by her that would [...] "resemble [...] a literary adviser".|$|E
