5|$|By 2001, {{the notable}} successes of computer-animated films from Pixar and DreamWorks such as Monsters, Inc. and, Shrek, respectively, against Disney's lesser returns for The Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis: The Lost Empire {{led to a}} growing {{perception}} that hand-drawn animation was becoming outdated and falling out of fashion. In March 2002, just after the successful release of Blue Sky Studios' computer-animated feature Ice Age, Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, downsizing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films. A handful of employees were offered positions doing computer animation. Morale plunged to a low {{not seen since the}} start of the studio's ten-year exile to Glendale in 1985.

At no time had he ever believed the two were actually selling heroin, he claimed. He raised the entrapment defense but proposed an alternate to the standard entrapment instruction.|$|E

25|$|When {{the ball}} is new the seam is {{used to create a}} layer of {{turbulent}} air {{on one side of the}} ball, by angling <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side and spinning the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this turbulent air creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the turbulent air due to the greater air coverage and as there is a difference in air velocity, the static pressure of both sides of the ball are different and {{the ball is}} both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the turbulent airflow side of the ball.|$|E

However, he was also criticised for being inflexible and overly strict in applying the laws, and for his preference for bureaucracy over talent.

With the boat badly holed and sinking, the man abandons ship in an inflatable life raft, salvaging whatever he can to survive.|$|E
