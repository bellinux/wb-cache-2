25|$|Miller's {{relations}} with the provincial government of Dalton McGuinty have generally been cordial, although the two governments have had disputes over finances. Miller argues that the former provincial government of Mike Harris burdened the city with disproportionately high service costs, and <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> provincial government to re-assume responsibility {{for some of these}} programs. As of 2007, Toronto pays $730 million for services that were provincial responsibilities before Harris came to power (Harris stated that the downloads were necessary to reduce the provincial deficit, and to compensate for reduced transfer payments from the federal government of Jean Chrétien). McGuinty has shown some sympathy to Toronto's position, but has also argued that the city has not taken sufficient responsibility for its own budgetary shortfalls.|$|E
25|$|The Energy Policy Act of 1992 had a {{provision}} under Section 801, which directed the EPA to promulgate radiation protection {{standards for the}} Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada. The Yucca Mountain site was then designated {{by the federal government}} to serve as the permanent disposal site for used nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials from commercial nuclear power plants and U.S. Department of Defense activities. The costs for this project have reached $13.5billion for this expected 25-year program. However, in 2009, President Barack Obama fulfilled his campaign promise to end the shipping of nuclear waste to the site. Soon after this, the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives passed legislation to back Obama's decision, although the site is still active and being funded by the government ($196.8million in the federal budget). Although Obama <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> NRC to devise another long-term solution to waste storage of spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors, as yet, none have been proposed, and all radioactive waste is still being stored on-site at nuclear power plants.|$|E
25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph {{had been arrested}} in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} people in the room – must confess. They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E

500|$|During the {{campaigning for}} the 1995 Ontario provincial election, Conservative Party leader Mike Harris deemed Big Thunder a [...] "cash cow" [...] {{as part of}} his Common Sense Revolution. Following the party's victory in the election, the venue was closed. Even though the venue closed, it still costs the {{province}} several hundred thousand dollars per year. The citizens group Friends of Big Thunder Bay announced on 1 March 2010, following the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, that they had sent a letter of intent to the provincial government where they stated that they wished to re-open the sports park. They intend to not only reopen the hill, but also the associated sports area and provide year-round training of ski jumping, freestyle skiing, cross-country skiing, mountain biking, event hosting and hiking. Ski Jumping Canada <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> province to establish a training facility for ski jumping in Ontario, stating that lack a facilities make it difficult for Canada to produce ski jumpers for the world scene, and that this among other things will result in poor performances in the Olympics.|$|E

My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E
