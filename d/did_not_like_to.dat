He continued teaching, and helped to organize concerts for some of his students. Another album, Descent into the Maelstrom, was released in the 1970s; it consisted of recordings made between 1951 and 1966.|$|E
5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he did}} not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.|$|E
5|$|The {{far left}} wing, under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, guarded the Rhine border from Mannheim to Switzerland. This {{part of the}} army {{included}} the conscripts drafted from the imperial circles. Charles <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> use the militias in any vital location and once it seemed clear {{to him that the}} French intended to cross at the middle Rhine, the Archduke felt no qualms placing his militia men at Kehl. In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands, the occasional journeyman, and day laborers drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. The remainder of the force included experienced troops from the Habsburg frontier troops stationed just north of Rastatt and a cadre of French royalists and a couple hundred mercenaries at Freiburg im Breisgau.|$|E

6000|$|Again, this is {{defective}} observation. It {{is human}} <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be praised; one can even notice {{it in the}} French. But it is <b>not</b> human <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, even when it {{comes in the form}} of a [...] "tribute." [...] I think a little psychologizing ought to have come in there. Something like this: A dog <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, a redskin <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, a negro <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, a Chinaman <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed; let us deduce from these significant facts this formula: the American's grade being higher than these, and the chain-of argument stretching unbroken all the way up to him, there is room for suspicion that the person who said the American <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, and regards it as a tribute, is not a capable observer.|$|R

25|$|There {{were four}} known {{assassination}} attempts on Nehru. The first attempt {{on his life}} was during partition in 1947 while he was visiting North-West Frontier Province (now in Pakistan) in a car. The second one was by a knife-wielding rickshaw-puller in Maharashtra in 1955. The third one happened in Bombay (now Maharashtra) in 1956. The fourth one was a failed bombing attempt on train tracks in Maharashtra in 1961. Despite threats to his life, Nehru despised having too much security around him and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> disrupt traffic due to his movement.|$|E

It was largely guess work {{where they should be}} placed and Charles <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> use the militias in any vital location. In late May and early June, when the French started to mass troops by Mainz as if they would cross there—they even engaged the Imperial force at Altenkirchen (4 June) and Wetzler and Uckerath (15 June)—Charles thought that the main attack would occur there and felt few qualms placing the 7,000-man Swabian militia at the crossing by Kehl.|$|E

500|$|Jackals were hunted {{in three}} ways: with greyhounds, with foxhounds, and with mixed packs. Hunting jackals with greyhounds offered poor sport because greyhounds were {{too fast for}} jackals, and mixed packs were too {{difficult}} to control. From 1946 in Iraq, British diplomats and Iraqi riders conducted jackal coursing together. They distinguished three types of jackal: the [...] "city scavenger", which was described as being slow and so smelly that dogs <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> follow them; the [...] "village jack", which was described as being faster, more alert, and less odorous; and the [...] "open-country jack", which was described as being the fastest, cleaner, and providing better sport.|$|E

He said that he had a twin brother. He had no twin brother. He said that the twin brother or a friend of the twin brother was in Eastbourne that night. There were no such people, and the whole story is an invention because, having known John Williams in the past, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think of his being hanged." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{perception}} {{of being able to}} perform effortlessly, acquaintances of Tracy said that he would carefully prepare for each role. Joseph L.

Many co-workers commented on his strong work-ethic and professionalism. Tracy <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> rehearse, however, and would lose his effectiveness after two or three takes. Kanin described him as [...] "an instinctive player, who trusted the moment of creation." [...] Tracy's close friend Chester Erskine pinpointed his acting style as one of [...] "selection"—he strove to give as little as was needed to be effective—reaching [...] "a minimum to make the maximum." ...|$|E
500|$|According to him, Madonna {{was moved}} while singing the song, since the theme {{suggested}} incest and the controversial topic of closet beatings. However, her insecurities about her childhood {{showed up in}} anxieties during her vocal performance. Meyers said that if Madonna bended a note or sang flat in a certain spot, she would go on doing that consistently as she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> vary her voice or change the tone. Madonna recalled that Leonard thought of the melody for the song. After the mixing was over, Meyers complimented Madonna by {{saying that it was}} her [...] "strongest" [...] vocal performance.

500|$|Charlene was a {{self-described}} tomboy, who preferred {{to be known}} by her nickname [...] "Lenny". She was known for her quick temper and her [...] "heart of gold". She always stuck up {{for those who were}} considered the underdog. In her book Neighbours: The First 10 Years, Josephine Monroe wrote that Charlene <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be patronised and had a sharp tongue. Monroe observed that Charlene's feisty side helped endure her to viewers. In keeping with her tomboyish nature, Charlene trained as a mechanic after leaving school and got an apprenticeship with Rob Lewis (Ernie Bourne). The character's style often consisted of khaki overalls, baggy sweatshirts and her hair set in a perm. A reporter for the Daily Mail said this look helped to launch Minogue [...] "into the public eye" [...] as Charlene.|$|E
