5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. The result will be an eye which can not move <b>downwards</b> properly (especially <b>downwards</b> when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and <b>downwards.</b> In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses <b>downwards,</b> the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|In many short scale countries, {{milliard}} {{was dropped}} altogether and billion was redefined down to 109, adjusting <b>downwards</b> {{the value of}} trillion and all the larger numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{follow the}} 14th-century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs {{associated with the}} saved to Christ's right, {{and those of the}} damned to his left. The words beneath the lily (the benedicti) read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the maledicti) flows in the opposite direction; from the highest point <b>downwards.</b> The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, {{to the extent that they}} are usually difficult to discern in reproductions. The lettering opposite faces <b>downwards,</b> and is applied with black paint.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{has been}} mined around Worsley from {{as long ago}} as 1376, {{originally}} in bell pits. The coal seams in the area tend to be fairly thin, slanting <b>downwards</b> from north to south, and so deeper mining became necessary during the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Glareolidae is {{a family}} of wading birds {{comprising}} the pratincoles, which have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails, and the coursers, which have long legs, short wings and long, pointed bills which curve <b>downwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like others storks, {{it lacks}} vocal muscles and {{produces}} sound mainly by bill-clattering, although low grunting, mooing or roaring sounds are made especially when nesting. The bill-clattering display {{is made with}} the bill raised high and {{differs from that of}} the closely related African marabou which holds the bill pointed <b>downwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|The hubs of orb webs, {{where the}} spiders lurk, are usually above the center, as the spiders can move <b>downwards</b> faster than upwards. If {{there is an}} obvious {{direction}} in which the spider can retreat to avoid its own predators, the hub is usually offset towards that direction.|$|E
5|$|There are six stamens in one to {{two rows}} (whorls), with the {{filaments}} separate from the corona, attached at the throat or base of the tube (epipetalous), often of two separate lengths, straight or declinate-ascending (curving <b>downwards,</b> then upwards). The anthers are basifixed (attached at their base).|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{that day}} and the {{following}} night the Senior Common Room, from the Principal <b>downwards,</b> took it in turns to sit on guard beside the hole, for fear any unruly spirit should escape through it to the forbidden adventurous males on the other side.|$|E
5|$|To {{successfully}} complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills {{and how many}} uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings. There are eight skills that can be assigned: 'Climbers' climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang. 'Floaters' use a parachute to fall safely from heights. 'Bombers' explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. 'Blockers' stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. 'Builders' build a stairway of 12 steps. 'Bashers', 'Miners' and 'Diggers' dig horizontally, diagonally <b>downwards</b> or directly <b>downwards</b> respectively.|$|E
5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} {{was found on the}} right side of the butt, {{pointing}} <b>downwards.</b> A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could not be identified.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} displays involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble <b>downwards</b> in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E
5|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop. Hanging <b>downwards</b> on wooden stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split longitudinally {{to release the}} winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae separate the seeds {{from each other and}} the follicle walls.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing mouths and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at {{the bases of}} their legs; both of these features {{are part of the}} ancestral arthropod feeding system. Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and <b>downwards,</b> and all have some means of breathing air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} flies with deep, slow wingbeats, {{giving it}} a wavelike movement. It can also glide for extended periods with its wings held <b>downwards.</b> Flocks generally fly at height, descending to treetops to feed or roost. Birds can be agile, manoeuvring quickly if startled or disturbed. In contrast, they waddle awkwardly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice to everyone from monarchs <b>downwards.</b> Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E
5|$|Even {{following}} the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, {{it was still}} possible to distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered <b>downwards</b> {{at right angles to}} connect with the buffer beam {{in the style of the}} Princess Royal Class. The ex-streamliners did not have any such connection, except No.46242 City of Glasgow which was rebuilt in 1952 following a serious collision.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, city staff {{reported}} that the estimated cost of the extension will increase by $150 million to $3.35 billion {{in order to build}} a 34-bay bus terminal at Scarborough Town Centre, to be the largest bus terminal on the TTC system. Also, the projection for new riders for the extension has been revised <b>downwards</b> to 2,300 per day, down from the 4,500 new riders estimated in the summer of 2016.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles <b>downwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates <b>downwards,</b> dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged <b>downwards</b> by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly <b>downwards</b> from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E
5|$|On August9, 2007, NOAA revised {{its season}} {{estimate}} slightly <b>downwards</b> to 13 to 16named storms of which seven to nine {{were to be}} hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes. However, the agency reaffirmed its prediction of an above-average season, citing warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures {{in parts of the}} Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea and the likelihood of La Niña conditions during the peak of the season.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys nelsoni was {{distinctive}} in {{its large}} skull with broad, well-developed incisors {{and a strong}} front part (rostrum) that is strongly curved <b>downwards.</b> In O.albiventer, the rostrum and incisors were not as massive, but the molars are larger. The interparietal bone, part of {{the roof of the}} braincase, was broad and the incisive foramina, which perforated the palate between the incisors and the molars, were relatively short.|$|E
5|$|Since John Ostrom first {{described}} Sauropelta in 1970, {{it has been}} recognized {{as a member of}} the family Nodosauridae. The nodosaurids, along with the family Ankylosauridae, belong within the infraorder Ankylosauria. Nodosaurids are characterized by certain features of the skull, including the mandible (lower jaw), which curves <b>downwards</b> at the end. Overall, nodosaurids had narrower snouts than the ankylosaurids, and also lacked the heavy ankylosaurid tail clubs. Nodosaurids, like ankylosaurids, are found in North America, Asia, and Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Texas {{pocket gopher}} avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the surface}} to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them <b>downwards</b> into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.|$|E
5|$|The coyote is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} gray wolf, but has longer ears and a relatively larger braincase, {{as well as a}} thinner frame, face, and muzzle. The scent glands are smaller than the gray wolf's, but are the same color. Its fur color variation is much less varied than that of a wolf. The coyote also carries its tail <b>downwards</b> when running or walking, rather than horizontally as the wolf does.|$|E
5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} hooked sharply <b>downwards,</b> while the heavy lower mandible hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclination}} {{is given}} by an angle that can assume values between -90° (up) to 90° (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points <b>downwards.</b> It is straight down at the North Magnetic Pole and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a dip circle.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea <b>downwards,</b> the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E
5|$|The wolf is {{likened to}} a wicked man who oppresses others. The fox is likened to the devil. The farmer is likened to the godly man, {{with whom the}} fiend finds fault. The woods where the wolf was cheated are corrupting goods that man longs to get. The cheese {{represents}} covetousness; the well that contains it is fraud and fantasy, which draws men <b>downwards</b> into hell.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{start of}} a {{demographic}} shift <b>downwards</b> when the Royal Navy pulled out of Deptford, and the docks moved into storage and freight. The downward shift continued into the 20th century as the local population's dependency on the docks continued: as the docks themselves declined, so did the economic fortune of the inhabitants until the last dock, Convoys Wharf, closed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread <b>downwards.</b> The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|A {{pendulum}} hangs straight <b>downwards</b> in a symmetrical gravitational field. However, if {{a sufficiently}} large mass {{such as a}} mountain is nearby, its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's plumb-bob slightly out of true. The change in plumb-line angle against a known objectsuch as a starcould be carefully measured {{on opposite sides of}} the mountain. If the mass of the mountain could be independently established from a determination of its volume and an estimate of the mean density of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, its mass.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than <b>downwards,</b> and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E
5|$|After {{the season}} began, Dr. Gray {{announced}} he had revised his predictions slightly <b>downwards</b> on August6, citing mild El Niño conditions. His new forecast was thirteen named storms, seven hurricanes, and three reaching major hurricane intensity. On August10, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of above-to-near normal activity, {{but the same}} number of storms forecast. CSU issued another forecast on September3, indicating sixteen tropical storms, eight hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. The season ended up with sixteen tropical depressions, fifteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and six major hurricanes, which matched CSU's final prediction on October1.|$|E
