40|$|Pattern Specific Emulation (PSE) may be {{required}} for <b>ion-beam</b> <b>projection</b> <b>lithography</b> to meet the high pattern placement requirements in the sub- 0. 1 3 im regime. To effectively employ PSE, {{it is necessary to}} simulate the distortion of the stressed mask membrane due to the fabrication of the stencil void pattern. Equivalent modeling techniques have been developed to determine both global and local in-plane distortions (IPD) using finite element (FE) methods. IPD is calculated by first dividing the patterned area of the membrane into subregions of equivalent void fraction. These subregions are based upon the percent void fraction as well as the pattern geometry. For each subregion, a set of equivalent elastic constants are used as input into the FE model to represent the stiffness of the actual perforated membrane. Global distortions are then computed to simulate the pattern transfer process. In this paper, a verification test case for equivalent modeling and an example of PSE for a complete mask pattern are presented...|$|E

40|$|Lithographic {{processes}} {{belong to}} the most critical steps in the fabrication of microelectronic circuits. Optical <b>projection</b> <b>lithography</b> which transfers the layout of a mask into a photoresist at the top surface of a silicon wafer is still the workhorse of semiconductor industry. Many innovations regarding the optical imaging system {{and the introduction of}} new mask technologies have pushed optical projection techniques close to their theoretical limits. Nowadays, optical <b>projection</b> <b>lithography</b> is used to create 45 nm features with a wavelength of 193 nm. This paper discusses the impact of the mask on the performance of a lithographic process. For large feature sizes the mask can be considered as infinitely thin and its local transmission and phase can be directly derived from the design. For mask features comparable to the wavelength of the used light and below, the mask becomes a complex scattering object which has a pronounced impact on the intensity, phase, and polariza tion of the diffracted light. The light diffraction from the mask has to be computed by rigorous electromagnetic methods. Several consequences with respect to the choice of most appropriate mask materials and geometries will be discussed...|$|R
