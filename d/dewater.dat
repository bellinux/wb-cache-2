5|$|There are 26 {{species of}} native and {{introduced}} {{fish in the}} lower Central Valley portion of the river, including Sacramento sucker, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and carp. Anadromous fish species found in the lower river are chinook salmon, Pacific lamprey and striped bass. The upper section of the river, defined as the stretch from Lake McClure to the headwaters, has 11 species of fish. Historically, the range of anadromous fish extended to the waterfalls {{at the head of}} Yosemite Valley, but dams have blocked their migration since the early 1900s, and diversions frequently <b>dewater</b> their remaining spawning habitat in {{the lower part of the}} river. Environmental measures enacted in the late 20th century have had some success in boosting chinook salmon populations, from a record low of 500 fish during several years in the 1950s, to a high of 30,000 in 1984. Since the 1970s, the annual chinook run has averaged about 5,300.|$|E

25|$|The {{new year}} began with no {{work at the}} {{convention}} center construction site. Mayor Celebrezze ordered city Law Director Ralph S. Locher to order Hunkin-Conkey to begin work in three days or be in default of its completion bond. These demands were communication on December 26 and 27, 1961. The construction company replied with a five-page letter outlining why it could not. William S. Hunsel, a consultant to Outcalt, Guenther & Van Buren, advised Hunkin-Conkey to <b>dewater</b> in sections, laying the foundation in sections. But the company refused, as this {{would be much more}} expensive. Implementing a new drainage system was the only solution, company officials said, and it would take four more months to finish the foundation. Hunkin-Conkey's reply was unacceptable to the city, so on January 11 Cleveland Properties Director Harold Lausche sent the bonding firm, Federal Insurance Co., noticed of failure to perform. Defending itself to the insurer, Hunkin-Conkey said its contract required all pumping to be complete before additional excavation could proceed. The company admitted that it had successfully tested a dragline excavator to remove watery soil at the site, but it would need written city approval to use the excavator for the remaining foundation work.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a belt press filter is to <b>dewater</b> process sludge {{and much of}} this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote flocculation of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation. It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.|$|E

2500|$|Suncor {{invested}} $1.2 {{billion in}} their Tailings Reduction Operations (TROTM) method [...] that treats mature fine tails (MFT) from tailings ponds with chemical flocculant, an anionic Polyacrylamide, {{commonly used in}} water treatment plants to improve removal of total organic content (TOC), to speed their drying into more easily reclaimable matter. Mature tailings dredged from a pond bottom in suspension were mixed with a polymer flocculant and spread over a [...] "beach" [...] with a shallow grade where the tailings would <b>dewater</b> and dry under ambient conditions. The dried MFT can then be reclaimed in place or moved to another location for final reclamation. Suncor hoped this would reduce the time for water reclamation from tailings to weeks rather than years, with the recovered water being recycled into the oil sands plant. Suncor claimed the mature fines tailings process would {{reduce the number of}} tailing ponds and shorten the time to reclaim a tailing pond from 40 years at present to 7–10 years, with land rehabilitation continuously following 7 to 10 years behind the mining operations. For the reporting periods from 2010 to 2012, Suncor had a lower-than-expected fines capture performance from this technology.|$|E

2500|$|The {{existing}} ponds {{above and}} below the minor road from Pumsaint to Caeo, were probably part of a cascade for washing ore, the upper tank having yielded large quantities of Roman pottery from ca 78 to at least 300 AD (Lewis, 1977; Burnham 2004). The upper pool is known as Melin-y-Milwyr, or the soldiers' mill, an intriguing name that implies that watermills may have been used here during the Roman period. Alternatively, {{it may have been a}} sequence of washing tables for the crushed gold ore. A large-scale mill complex is known from Barbegal in southern France, where no less than 16 mills (in two lines of 8 each) were built into the side of a hill and supplied with water from a single aqueduct. There were two lines of parallel overshot mills, the outflow from one feeding the next below. The mill supplied flour to the region. Moreover, Roman engineers used sequences of reverse overshot water-wheels to <b>dewater</b> mines, and the deep workings at Dolaucothi produced a fragment of such a wheel during the 1930s when deep mining operations were resumed. Sequences of such wheels increased the lift, and one extensive sequence of 16 wheels was found in old Roman mine workings on the Rio Tinto river in the 1920s. The wheels were arranged in pairs and could lift water about [...] from the bottom of the mine there.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{co-disposal}} of <b>dewatered</b> {{sewage sludge}} and {{municipal solid waste}} may cause significant impacts (such as total and differential settlement, slope stability of the waste, and leachability) on landfill operations and the subsurface environment. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the co-disposal of <b>dewatered</b> sewage sludge and municipal solid waste with respect to their consolidation characteristics, vane shear strength, and leachability. The results of the consolidation tests show that, for a given stress increment, the deformation (the change in the void ratio) of the <b>dewatered</b> sewage sludge is larger than the deformation of its sludge mixtures. When the sludge ratio in the mixture increases, the compressibility of the mixture increases. The total consolidation settlement taking place in landfilling of <b>dewatered</b> sewage sludge alone would be much greater than that for co-disposal of sludge with solid waste. The results of the shear stress strength tests of the sludge and its mixtures imply that side slopes of 20 º can probably be constructed in a landfill site without causing a sliding problem. Based on the results of the column leachability tests, Fe, Cu and nitrogen leached out from the sludge and its mixture might cause groundwater pollution. ...|$|R

40|$|Force and {{material}} balance equations were {{developed for the}} electro-osmotic dewatering of slurries between two fixed electrodes. It was assumed that the resistance to flow caused by the <b>dewatered</b> bed could be {{described in terms of}} Darcy's law for laminar flow. Specific cake resistances were extremely low due to the formation of channels through the <b>dewatered</b> bed. Owing to the complex particle-fluid interactions in the system, both the cake resistance and the electro-osmotic coefficient had to be estimated from experimental dewatering data and could not be predicted accurately from fundamental equations. Any change in the temperature of the system was accounted for by a change in the conductivities of the slurry and the <b>dewatered</b> bed. The temperature profiles were not predicted, but merely simulated by empirical equations. Independent measurements showed that the conductivity of the slurry increased linearly with temperature. The conductivity of the <b>dewatered</b> cake decreased linearly with temperature owing to the enhanced conversion of water to steam.
