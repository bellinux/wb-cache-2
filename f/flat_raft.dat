40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{geotechnical}} behaviour of three foundation solutions for windmills. The first design is a traditional <b>flat</b> <b>raft,</b> the second is a deep <b>flat</b> <b>raft,</b> {{and the third is}} a conical raft. A comparative study between the traditional and the new solutions is performed. A conical raft is used to improve the resistance of the soil-structure interface. It is shown that a conical raft gives a significant decrease of tilting compared to a flat circular raft. The use of a conical raft can thus decrease the dimensions of the foundation which may lead to potential cost reductions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The mass <b>flat</b> <b>raft</b> {{foundation}} Section {{is large}} and Cement is in large quantities, the temperature changes in the larger cement hydration heat of the water releasing, the temperature stress is main reason reducing cracking. According to {{the basement of a}} project of Guangzhou large slab raft foundation engineering as an example, Discussing the construction technology measures of early crack of large volume concrete of raft plate in the process of construction,. The results show that it Can effectively prevents the slab foundation structure cracking and achieves good results through controlling Concrete materials and concrete temperature Parameter such as the lifting machine temperature and the pouring temperature and the expansion joint or the whole pouring length. Causes for the early temperature cracks of plate raft slab foundation Plate raft slab foundation is a flat slab system, and features simple force transfer and good integral rigidity, but temperature cracks are generally easy to occur in the early construction because of the thicker slab. In the early period of raft casting, a lot of hydration heat is generated from cement hydration and the concrete temperature is rising fast, and then a temperature gradient is formed inside and outside the slab foundation so that the generated internal constraints will give rise to the compressive stress within concrete, and tensile stress is produced on the surface (see figure 1) and then cracks occur on the concrete surface; after the concrete is casted for a few days, the cement hydration heat is released basically and concrete temperature lowering will give rise to contraction, while the slab foundation can't be deformed freely under the constraint of the foundation and structure boundary conditions, so that the temperature tensile stress is produced...|$|E

Their cell membranes contain cholesterol-rich microdomains called lipids rafts, which participate in numerous signaling cascades. In {{addition to its}} cholesterol-lowering effect, pravastatin has several pleiotropic effects and is widely used as secondary prevention treatment after myocardial infarction (MI). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of pravastatin on the organization of cholesterol within monocyte membrane rafts from patients who had suffered myocardial infarction. Monocytes from healthy donors and acute MI patients were cultured with or without 4 μM pravastatin. Lipid rafts were extracted by Lubrol WX, caveolae and <b>flat</b> <b>rafts</b> were separated using a modified sucrose gradient. Cholesterol level and caveolin- 1 expression in lipid rafts were determined. In healthy donors, cholesterol was concentrated in <b>flat</b> <b>rafts</b> (63 ± 3 vs 13 ± 1 %, p< 0. 001). While monocytes from MI patients presented similar cholesterol distribution in both caveolae and <b>flat</b> <b>rafts.</b> Cholesterol distribution was higher in <b>flat</b> <b>rafts</b> in healthy donors, compared to MI patients (63 ± 3 vs 41 ± 2 %, p< 0. 001), with less distribution in caveolae (13 ± 1 vs 34 ± 2 %, p< 0. 001). Pravastatin reversed the cholesterol distribution in MI patients cells between <b>flat</b> <b>rafts</b> (41 ± 2 vs 66 ± 3 %, p< 0. 001) and caveolae (34 ± 2 vs 18 ± 1 %, p< 0. 001). In conclusion, MI redistributes cholesterol from <b>flat</b> <b>rafts</b> to caveolae indicating monocyte membrane reorganization. In vitro pravastatin treatment restored basal conditions in MI monocytes, suggesting another effect of statins...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Diabetic {{retinopathy}} is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disease where the infiltration of plasma and neovascularization of the retina cause blindness. This disease affects {{millions of people}} in developed countries and early biological markers would better manage these patients. Methods For this purpose we purified monocytes, key players of inflammation, blood of healthy and sick people. On the surface of monocytes, there are dynamic structures called rafts membrane microdomains, which there are two subtypes: <b>flat</b> <b>rafts</b> and caveolae rafts. They correspond to dynamic assemblies and ordered cholesterol and sphingolipids. We isolated these rafts membranes of monocytes and studied protein AT 2 (angiotensin receptor II) and gp 91 (major membrane subunit of NADPH oxidase, producing enzyme superoxide anions), potential markers of the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Results Our results have shown a switch of cholesterol and sphingomyelin <b>flat</b> <b>rafts</b> to caveolae rafts. The analysis of the constituent proteins (flotillin and caveolin) and functional (AT 2, gp 91 and p 47 phox) have shown that these are mobile in the membrane in an inflammatory context. Subunits of NADPH oxidase seem to gather in caveolae rafts and more precisely when the enzyme is activated. Conclusion The proteins of interest and the switch composition of lipid rafts therefore would appear to be an indicator of the progression of diabetic retinopathy and {{it would be interesting to}} provide a mechanistic explanation for the evolution of this chronic vascular disease to consider potential therapeutic targets...|$|R

50|$|Fishermen cut {{and gather}} the larger, lower fronds from palm trees which they then weave into large <b>flat</b> <b>rafts.</b> The rafts are pulled out to sea, usually {{with the small}} {{traditional}} fishing boats known as Luzzu, but can also be pulled out to sea by using larger modern fishing boats. Around midday, lampuki school underneath the rafts, seeking the shade. The fishermen first stay 5-10 metres away from the raft and repeatedly go around the raft pulling a silicone squid jig behind them until they catch something; they then leave the lampuka (dorado, mahi-mahi) hanging {{off the side of}} the boat until other fish come and school next to it; then a mesh net is thrown over the schooling fish. This method is known as kannizzati and has not changed significantly since Roman times. The lampuki are used both for local consumption as well as export.|$|R

Nanocomposite {{films of}} poly (9, 9 -dioctylfluorene) (PFO) /Al 2 O 3 have been {{prepared}} by blending the conjugated polymer solution with alumina nanoparticle dispersion in common organic solvent and investigated {{in terms of the}} optical property. A blue shift of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum for the as fabricated PFO/Al 2 O 3 nanocomposite film was observed as compared to the results obtained from the bulk PFO film, the maximum of the PL emission peaks occurs at 442 nm in the bulk film while after the incorporation of the alumina nanoparticles the maximum appears at 420 nm in the spectrum for PFO/Al 2 O 3 nanocomposite film. The dependence of fluorescence blue shift of PFO on the concentration of Al 2 O 3 was investigated. The isolation of the conjugated polymer chains by the <b>flat</b> <b>rafts</b> of alumina nanoparticles was shown to play a key role for the obtained blue shift...|$|R
60|$|The {{whole country}} around us {{seemed to be}} {{swarming}} with savages, crowds of whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands to the southward on <b>flat</b> <b>rafts,</b> doubtless {{with a view of}} lending their aid in the capture and plunder of the Jane. The vessel still lay calmly at anchor in the bay, those on board being apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them. How we longed at that moment to be with them! either to aid in effecting their escape, or to perish with them in attempting a defence. We saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with but a remote hope of benefit to them. A pistol fired might suffice to apprise them that something wrong had occurred; but the report could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety lay in getting out of the harbour forthwith--it could not tell them that no principles of honour now bound them to remain, that their companions were no longer among the living. Upon hearing the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet the foe, who were now getting ready to attack, than they already were, and always had been. No good, therefore, and infinite harm, would result from our firing, and after mature deliberation, we forbore.|$|R

60|$|Only just in {{time had}} Ghibba seen their danger, and almost before the shrill echo had died away, and Thimble had cast himself <b>flat,</b> their <b>raft</b> was swirled under a huge rock, blossoming with quartz, that hung down almost {{to the surface of}} the water. Thimble's jacket was ripped collar to hem as he slid under, lying as close as he could. And the bobbing raft of baggage behind them was torn away in a twinkling, so that now all the food and torches the Mulgars had was what each carried for himself. They dared not stir nor lift their heads, for still the fretted roof arched close above the water. And so they drifted on and on, their torches luckily burnt low, until at length the cavern widened, the roof lifted, and they burst one by one into a great chamber of smooth water, its air filled strangely with a faint phosphorescence, so that every spar and jag of rock gleamed softly with {{coloured}} light as they paddled their course slowly through. In this great chamber they stayed awhile, for there was scarcely any current of water against its pillared sides. With their rafts clustering and moored together, they shared out equally what nuts, dry fruit, and unutterably mouldy cheese remained, and divided the torches equally between them, except that Ghibba, who led the way, had two for every one of the others.|$|R
50|$|Though the fleet-test was unsuccessful, Britain {{continued}} to be on high alert with defences from invasion. With the flotilla and encampment at Boulogne visible from the south coast of England, Martello towers were built along the English coast to counter the invasion threat, and militias were raised. In the areas closest to France new fortifications were built and existing ones initiated against the 1779 invasion completed or improved. Dover Castle had underground tunnels added to garrison extra troops, the Dover Western Heights were constructed (with a Grand Shaft to deploy its troops from its hilltop site to sea level rapidly should a landing occur), and the Royal Military Canal cut to impede Napoleon's progress into England should he land on Romney Marsh. Unfounded rumours of a massive <b>flat</b> French invasion <b>raft</b> powered by windmills and paddle-wheels, a secretly-dug channel tunnel and an invasion fleet of balloons spread via the print media, as did caricatures ridiculing the prospect of invasion. A naval raid on Boulogne was also carried out in October 1804 and British fleets {{continued to}} blockade the French and Spanish fleets that {{would be needed to}} gain naval superiority long enough for a crossing.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} synthesis of novel nanoparticles that are interesting for catalytic applications. The decomposition of RhCp(C 2 H 4) 2 and Rh(hfacac) (CO) 2 were investigated, and the complex RhCp(C 2 H 4) 2 was successfully shown to decompose to rhodium nanoparticles. Analysis of the decomposition chemistry was used to control nanoparticle seed formation and growth. New stabilizer ligands, both polymeric and molecular, were attempted for {{the synthesis of}} rhodium nanoparticles. Polymeric stabilizers were screened as replacements for the widely used polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP) surfactant, however none afforded {{the high degree of}} control exhibited by PVP. However, molecular stabilizers were screened and small, monodisperse rhodium nanoparticles were synthesized with the stabilizer octadecylphosphonic acid, with a size and size dispersity of 1. 92 +/- 0. 16 nm. A concurrent hydrogenation catalytic process was also utilized for the synthesis of small rhodium seed particles. In this nanoparticle synthesis, a rhodium precursor and a stabilizer were combined in the presence of an olefin and hydrogen, which aids in decomposition of the rhodium precursor to nanoparticles, and also catalytically converts the olefin to a saturated compound. The rate of hydrogen uptake was monitored and fit to a two-step autocatalytic mechanism correlated to nanoparticle formation and growth. Two new rhodium complexes were synthesized that contained a stabilizer ligand, however the most successful attempt to produce small, monodisperse rhodium nanoparticles by this process was with the rhodium source [(COD) Rh(NCCH 3) 2]BF 4, and the stabilizer (Bu 4 N) 2 HPO 4 in the presence of an equivalent of Proton Sponge&# 61652;. Rhodium nanoparticles synthesized by this process have a size and size distribution of 1. 88 +/- 0. 27 nm. The presence of olefin and hydrogen pressure of 42 psi was found to be ideal for the stabilization of nanoparticles during their formation. Also, reactant concentrations and the rate of the cyclohexene consumption are crucial to yield nanoparticles with this excellent size dispersity. Growth reactions with these small rhodium nanoparticles have been successful the synthesis of larger nanoparticles under conditions involving alternate stabilizers. The small nanoparticles were then tested and found to be useful as seed particles in the synthesis of larger rhodium nanoparticles. For each procedure, a mixture of 1 -hexadecylamine, adamantane carboxylic acid, and 1, 2 -hexadecanediol was used to stabilize the nanoparticles. The use of synthesized seed particles allowed for the formation of tetrahedral (average edge length: 4. 77 +/- 0. 72 nm) or icosahedral shaped particles, depending on reaction temperature. Subsequent characterization revealed that approximately half of the tetrahedrally shaped nanoparticles are in fact triangular <b>flat</b> <b>rafts,</b> where one corner of the tetrahedron appears to be "cut off. " However, the use of in situ seeds resulted in the formation of multipod structures. The multipods are single crystals with 2 - 8 arms per multipod, that propagate both the (110) and (111) directions. The synthesis and characterization of mixed-metal oxide spinel nanoparticles was then attempted for water oxidation catalysis. Nanoparticles of the compositions MnFe 2 O 4 and CoFe 2 O 4 (5. 7 nm and 6. 1 nm respectively) were synthesized according to a literature procedure with the stabilizers oleic acid and oleylamine, however they were characterized by ICP-OES to have low M:Fe (M = Mn, Co) ratios of 1 : 5 and 1 : 4 respectively. Nanoparticles of NiFe 2 O 4 (8. 0 nm) were also synthesized by a similar approach, and had the expected Ni:Fe ratio of 1 : 2 by ICP-OES. Cubic nanoparticles of Co 3 O 4 were also synthesized, and through a subsequent cation exchange reaction with this material, CuxCo 3 -xO 4 and NixCo 3 -xO 4 nanoparticles could be synthesized with varying degrees of copper or nickel incorporation. Linear scan voltammograms were conducted on anodes modified with these nanoparticle materials. For the mixed-metal ferrites, CoFe 2 O 4 showed the lowest overpotentials in the water oxidation reaction in the range of 0 - 100 mA cm- 2. Copper modified Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles had a lower onset potential than Co 3 O 4 and performed with lower overpotentials at low current densities (20 mA cm- 2). The nickel modified Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles were superior to the other MxCo 3 -xO 4 materials at all current densities measured (0 - 100 mA cm- 2) ...|$|R
