5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is <b>high,</b> <b>at</b> 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{critical}} acclaim, The Wire received poor Nielsen ratings, which Simon {{attributed to the}} complexity of the plot; a poor time slot; heavy use of esoteric slang, particularly among the gangster characters; and a predominantly black cast.

5|$|In 2010, Pablo Jayat {{and colleagues}} {{reviewed}} {{the members of}} the Akodon boliviensis group in Argentina. On the basis of sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, they found A.caenosus to be closest to A.lutescens and A.subfuscus, forming a clade that was the sister group to a clade of the remaining species in the A.boliviensis group—A.boliviensis, A.spegazzinii, A.sylvanus, and A.polopi. They classified A.caenosus as a species separate from A.lutescens because the two forms did not form a single clade (A.caenosus was instead closer to A.subfuscus), and because the difference between the cytochrome b sequences of A.lutescens and A.caenosus was relatively <b>high</b> <b>at</b> 3.5%. A.aliquantulus was reduced to a synonym of A.caenosus, because they found no substantial morphometrical differentiation between the two and could not replicate the characters Díaz and colleagues had noted as diagnostic for A.aliquantulus.|$|E

5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment.

Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E

5|$|The {{influence}} of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Atlantic Current creates a mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging 6.5°C (44°F) in January and 15.4°C (60°F) in July at Duntulm on the Trotternish peninsula of Skye. Snow seldom lies at sea level and frosts are fewer than on the mainland. Winds are a limiting factor for vegetation: a speed of 128km/h (80mph) has been recorded; south-westerlies are the most common. Rainfall is generally <b>high</b> <b>at</b> between 1300 and 2000mm (50–80in) per annum, and the mountains and hills are wetter still.

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{are those that}} are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits. Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%. Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), if used strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%. With typical use first-year failure rates are considerably <b>high,</b> <b>at</b> 9%, due to incorrect usage. Other methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young people.|$|E
5|$|The {{nuclear fission}} {{properties}} of berkelium {{are different from}} those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium, and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Specifically, berkelium-249 has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of 710 barns for thermal neutrons, 1200 barns resonance integral, but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons. In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250. In principle, berkelium-249 can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a fast breeder reactor. Its critical mass is relatively <b>high</b> <b>at</b> 192kg; it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} {{methods for}} different isotopes vary, and only those for promethium-147 are given {{because it is}} the only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 is produced in large quantities (compared to other isotopes) by bombarding uranium-235 with thermal neutrons. The output is relatively <b>high,</b> <b>at</b> 2.6% of the total product. Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium-146 with thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator. Another method is to bombard uranium-238 with fast neutrons to cause fast fission, which, among multiple reaction products, creates promethium-147.|$|E
