We developed an indirect ELISA based on the recombinant hexon protein produced by E. coli. The recombinant hexon protein was tested with sera, in both infected and noninfected chickens. The recombinant hexon protein was standardized with an antigen concentra-tion of 3. 75 µg/ml and test sera. The intra- and inter-assays were repeatable. The cutoff value from TG-ROC curve analysis was 0. 106. The specificity and sensitivity were 80 and 80 %, respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) of absorbance values from this ELISA compared with the serum neutralization test was 0. 76. This ELISA might be helpful for IBH diagnosis and surveillance.

However, the expense and logistical demands of current VLP vaccines will limit their widespread use in resource-limited settings, where most HPV-induced cervical cancer occurs. Live oral <b>adenovirus</b> <b>vaccines</b> have properties that are well-suited {{for use in}} such settings. We have described a live recombinant <b>adenovirus</b> <b>vaccine</b> prototype that produces abundant HPV 16 L 1 protein from the adenovirus major late transcriptional unit and directs the assembly of HPV 16 VLPs in tissue culture. Re-combinant-derived VLPs potently elicit neutralizing antibodies in mice. Here, we characterize the immune response to the recombinant after dual oral and intranasal immunization of pigtail macaques, in which the virus replicates as it would in immunized humans. The immunization of macaques induced vigorous humoral responses to adenovirus capsid and non-structural proteins, although, surprisingly, not against HPV L 1. In contrast, immunization elicited strong T-cell responses to HPV VLPs as well as adenovirus virions. T-cell responses arose immediately after the primary immunization and were boosted by a second immunization with recombinant virus. T-cell immunity contributes to protection against a wide vari-ety of pathogens, including many viruses.

40|$|Abstract Background Many viral {{pathogens}} {{are poorly}} characterized, {{are difficult to}} culture or reagents are lacking for confirmatory diagnoses. We have developed and tested a robust assay for detecting and characterizing large DNA viruses and adenoviruses. The assay {{is based on the}} use of degenerate PCR to target a gene common to these viruses, the DNA polymerase, and sequencing the products. Results We evaluated our method by applying it to <b>fowl</b> <b>adenovirus</b> isolates, catfish herpesvirus isolates, and largemouth bass ranavirus (iridovirus) from cell culture and lymphocystis disease virus (iridovirus) and avian poxvirus from tissue. All viruses with the exception of avian poxvirus produced the expected product. After optimization of extraction procedures, and after designing and applying an additional primer we were able to produce polymerase gene product from the avian poxvirus genome. The sequence data that we obtained demonstrated the simplicity and potential of the method for routine use in characterizing large DNA viruses. The adenovirus samples were demonstrated to represent 2 types of <b>fowl</b> <b>adenovirus,</b> <b>fowl</b> <b>adenovirus</b> 1 and an uncharacterized avian adenovirus most similar to <b>fowl</b> <b>adenovirus</b> 9. The herpesvirus isolate from blue catfish was shown to be similar to channel catfish virus (Ictalurid herpesvirus 1). The case isolate of largemouth bass ranavirus was shown to exactly match the type specimen and both were similar to tiger frog virus and frog virus 3. The lymphocystis disease virus isolate from largemouth bass was shown to be related but distinct from the two previously characterized lymphocystis disease virus isolates suggesting that it may represent a distinct lymphocystis disease virus species. Conclusion The method developed is rapid and broadly applicable to cell culture isolates and infected tissues. Targeting a specific gene for in the large DNA viruses and adenoviruses provide a common reference for grouping the newly identified viruses according to relatedness to sequences of reference viruses and the submission of the sequence data to GenBank will build the database to make the BLAST analysis a valuable resource readily accessible by most diagnostic laboratories. We demonstrated the utility of this assay on viruses that infect fish and birds. These hosts are phylogenetically distant from mammals yet, sequence data suggests that the assay would work equally as well on mammalian counterparts of these groups of viruses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that obtaining genetic information on routine diagnostic samples has great potential for revealing new virus strains and suggesting the presence of new species. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fowl</b> <b>adenovirus</b> (FAdV) is {{a member}} of the genus Aviadenovirus and causes a number of {{economically}} important poultry diseases. One of these diseases, inclusion body hepatitis (IBH), has a worldwide distribution and is characterised by acute mortality (5 % – 20 %) in production chickens. The disease was first described in the United States of America in 1963 and has also been reported in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Ireland, but until now, not in South Africa. Adenoviruses isolated from the first outbreak of IBH in South Africa were able to reproduce the disease in chicken embryo livers. The aim of the present study was to characterise the viruses and determine the pathogenicity of the FAdV strains responsible for the first reported case of IBH in South Africa. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the L 1 loop region of the <b>fowl</b> <b>adenovirus</b> hexon gene using degenerate primer pair hexon A/B was used to identify the viruses that were isolated. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the amplification products was used for the differentiation of 14 isolates of <b>fowl</b> <b>adenovirus.</b> Sequencing of the PCR products followed by amino acid comparison and phylogenetic analysis using the L 1 loop region of the hexon protein was done to determine the identity of the isolates. Amino acid sequences of the hexon genes of all the South African isolates were compared with those of reference strains representing FAdV species. Amino acid comparison of 12 South Africa field isolates to FAdV reference strains revealed a high sequence identity (> 93. 33 %) with reference strains T 8 -A and 764. Two of the isolates had high sequence identity (93. 40 %) with reference strains P 7 -A, C 2 B and SR 48.

Virulence testing of these recombinants located the region responsible for differences in virulence to an 8. 4 -kb fragment of the genome located between kb 26. 6 and 35. 0. According to data available for a serotype 10 FAV that had been partially characterized in the laboratory, this segment of the genome contained three genes of known identity (100 K, 33 K, and pVIII) and a region between kb 31 and 35 with unknown coding potential (although this information subsequently became available for a serotype 1 FAV, CELO).

Samples {{were collected from}} an outbreak in 12000 broiler flock from Andhra Pradesh with sudden high mortality initiated from 32 days of age. Liver was enlarged and showed petechae. Hydropericardium was extensive. 10 % liver suspension inoculated to SPF chicks produced mortality with hydropericardium and showed presence of intranuclear inclusions in the hepatocytes. Viral DNA extracted from infected liver processed for PCR produced an amplicon of 890 bp.

40|$|Although limited almost {{exclusively}} to military trainees, acute respiratory disease (ARD) caused by adenovirus types 4 and 7 had been {{the leading cause of}} hospitalization in U. S. Army personnel. This disease which resembles influenza in clinical manifestations led to hospitalization of as many as 50 % of military trainees in midwinter and imposed a heavy burden on military hospitals and training programs. In studies undertaken from 1965 to 1970, live adenovirus type 4 and subsequently type 7 vaccines were found to be safe and immunogenic and to confer protection against type specific adenovirus ARD. For the past 5 yr, military trainees have been immunized with both <b>adenovirus</b> <b>vaccines</b> during periods of expected adenovirus disease. Since 1966, use of <b>adenovirus</b> <b>vaccines</b> has been monitored through the adenovirus surveillance program which yields weekly data on incidence and etiology of ARD in basic combat trainees. Since 1973, stable <b>adenovirus</b> <b>vaccines</b> have resulted in excellent control of adenovirus ARD. Potential problems with this immunization program are discussed. Shortly after adenoviruses were first isolated from explant cultures of human adenoid tissue by Rowe et al. (1), Hilleman and Werner of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) (2) isolated a new strain of virus, subsequently classified as adenovirus type 4 (Adv- 4) from recruits at Ford Leonard Wood, Missouri. It has since been amply confirmed that specific adenovirus serotypesprincipally types 4 and 7, and occasionally types 3, 11, 14, and 21 -are important causes of acute respiratory disease (ARD) in military trainees (3 - 6) although these types cause but a small proportion of respiratory tract infections in civilian populations. While many aspects of the epidemiology of adenovirus ARD remain obscure (7), the impact of this disease on military trainees and military training programs is clear and is illustrated by the experience of a platoon of basic combat trainees (BCTs) studied by our laboratory at Fort Dix, New Jersey, during the winter o...|$|R
40|$|Five adenoviruses were {{effectively}} concentrated {{and partially}} purified by methanol precipitation. The soluble antigens from one adenovirus concentrate {{were obtained by}} adsorption to and elution from calcium phosphate. Formaldehyde-inactivated vaccines prepared from the virus concentrates were more antigenic in guinea pigs than a National Institutes of Health reference vaccine or one prepared from unconcentrated adenovirus. The soluble antigens also proved to be antigenic. The data indicate that <b>adenovirus</b> <b>vaccines</b> of superior potency can be prepared from concentrated virus preparations and that the extracted soluble antigens are immunogenic...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{effort has}} been placed in {{developing}} efficacious recombinant attenuated adenovirus-based vaccines. However induction of immunity to the vector is a significant obstacle to its repeated use. Here we demonstrate that skin-based delivery of an adenovirus-based malaria vaccine, HAdV 5 -PyMSP 1 ₄₂, to mice using silicon microneedles induces equivalent or enhanced antibody responses to the encoded antigen, however it results in decreased anti-vector responses, compared to intradermal delivery. Microneedle-mediated vaccine priming and resultant induction of low anti-vector antibody titres permitted repeated use of the same <b>adenovirus</b> <b>vaccine</b> vector. This resulted in significantly increased antigen-specific antibody responses in these mice compared to ID-treated mice. Boosting with a heterologous vaccine; MVA-PyMSP 1 ₄₂ also resulted in significantly greater antibody responses in mice primed with HAdV 5 -PyMSP 1 ₄₂ using MN compared to the ID route. The highest protection against blood-stage malaria challenge was observed when a heterologous route of immunization (MN/ID) was used. Therefore, microneedle-mediated immunization has potential to both overcome some of the logistic obstacles surrounding needle-and-syringe-based immunization {{as well as to}} facilitate the repeated use of the same <b>adenovirus</b> <b>vaccine</b> thereby potentially reducing manufacturing costs of multiple vaccines. This could have important benefits in the clinical ease of use of adenovirus-based immunization strategies...|$|R
40|$|Chick cells {{infected}} by chick embryo lethal orphan (CELO) virus (<b>fowl</b> <b>adenovirus</b> type 1) contained four prominent virus-specific, structurally related DNA-binding proteins with mol. wt. of 74 K, 64 K, 56 K, 52 K, and two minor forms. The CELO virus DNA-binding proteins were phosphorylated, elayed-early nuclear proteins. CELO virus early proteins were expressed in BHK cells, {{but did not}} complement human adenovirus type 5 mutants with lesions in E 1 A, E 2 A or E 2 B. Moreover, CELO virus DNA-binding proteins were not produced in 293 cells, which express human adenovirus E 1 genes. These results suggest that activation of transcription by adenovirus E 1 A genes involves specific interactions between the E 1 A gene products and viral early promoters...|$|R
