25|$|The name {{butadiene}} {{can also}} {{refer to the}} isomer, 1,2-butadiene, which is a cumulated diene with structure H2C=C=CH−CH3. However, this allene is difficult to prepare and has no industrial significance. This diene is also not expected {{to act as a}} diene in a <b>Diels–Alder</b> <b>reaction</b> due to its structure. To effect a <b>Diels–Alder</b> <b>reaction,</b> only a conjugated diene will suffice. The rest of this article concerns only 1,3-butadiene.|$|E
25|$|This {{transition}} state likely {{occurs because}} of favorable pi-stacking with the phenyl substituent.

40|$|A {{strategy}} for the modular ambient temperature synthesis of ABA and ABC triblock copolymers via a combination of photoinduced <b>Diels-Alder</b> <b>reactions</b> with thermal <b>Diels-Alder</b> <b>reactions</b> and azide-alkyne click chemistry is reported. Polystyrene (PS) and PMMA (PMMA) with α- 2, 5 -dimethylbenzophenone and ω-cyclopentadienyl or ω-azide end-functionality were prepared via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and subsequent transformation of the bromine end-group. The phototriggered conjugation reaction proceeds via an in situ formation of highly reactive o-quinodimethanes. Maleimide-capped poly(tert-butyl acrylate) obtained via ATRP was employed as dienophile. Alkyne and maleimide functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were synthesized by esterification of monomethoxy PEG. PtBA-b-PMMA-b-PtBA and PtBA-b-PS-b-PtBA were successfully prepared in a one-pot reaction at ambient temperature combining photoinduced and thermal <b>Diels-Alder</b> <b>reactions.</b> ABC triblock copolymers (PtBA-b-PS-b-PEG) with narrow polydispersities were obtained via the combination of photoinduced <b>Diels-Alder</b> <b>reactions</b> with thermal <b>Diels-Alder</b> <b>reactions</b> as well as CuAAc chemistry.

Hydrolysis of the cyanochloro group and simultaneous cleavage of the acetate group led to hydroxyketone 3.4. The hydroxyl group was protected as a tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether (3.5).

25|$|The iodolactonization {{transform}} affords an allylic alcohol {{leading to}} a key Baeyer-Villiger intermediate. This oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electron-rich site. The pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the Diels-Alder structural goal, which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring. Later Corey developed an asymmetric <b>Diels-Alder</b> <b>reaction</b> employing a chiral oxazoborolidine, greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins.|$|E

In the following example, the reaction with a highly electron-rich diene and an electron-poor dienophile is thought to develop significant {{negative charge}} on the enal fragment, and is the transition state is stabilized by increased hydrogen bonding to the TADDOL (Ar = 1-naphthyl).|$|E

Other synthetic rubber materials such as chloroprene, and the solvent sulfolane are also manufactured from butadiene. Butadiene is used in the industrial production of 4-vinylcyclohexene via a Diels Alder dimerization reaction. Vinylcyclohexene is a common impurity found in butadiene upon storage due to dimerization. Cyclooctadiene and cyclododecatriene are produced via nickel- or titanium-catalyzed dimerization and trimerization reactions, respectively.
