5000|$|Christianity was {{introduced}} in India by St. Thomas the Apostle who landed at Muziris on Malabar Coast in the year 52 AD. These ancient Christians are today known as Saint Thomas Christians or Syrian Christians or Nasrani. They are now divided into different denominations namely, Syro-Malabar Catholic, Syro-Malankara Catholic, Malankara Orthodox, Jacobite and Malankara Marthoma. Syrian Christians followed the same rules of caste and population as that of Hindus and sometimes they were even considered as population neutralizers. They tend to be endogamous, and tend not to intermarry even with other Christian groupings. Saint Thomas Christians derive status within the caste system from the tradition that they were elites, who were evangelized by St. Thomas. [...] Also, <b>internal</b> <b>mobility</b> is allowed among these Saint Thomas Christian sects and the caste status is kept even if the sect allegiance is switched (for example, from Syrian Orthodox to Syro-Malabar Catholic). Despite the sectarian differences, Syrian Christians share a common social status within the Caste system of Kerala and is considered as Forward Caste.|$|E

Although migration between EU countries is higher than in other world regions, it falls short of the European Union’s aspiration of a fully integrated labor market. In addition, <b>internal</b> labor <b>mobility</b> in most countries is low. The explanations (beside the obvious difference in language and culture between EU countries) involve inefficient housing markets, wage-setting practices that do not signal labor shortages and surpluses, and the absence of a Europe-wide social safety net that makes moving too risky.|$|R

Non-native states have been obtained at pH 2 in the presence of 0, 8, and 10 M urea-d(4) and at pH 6. 7 in the presence of 10 M urea-d(4). The dependence of the geminate CIDNP spectra of the two proteins on the denaturant concentration is shown to be determined by the intrinsic reactivity of the amino acid residues toward the triplet excited dye rather than by structural changes in the proteins. Values of the proton paramagnetic relaxation times (T(1)) have been obtained from an analysis of the CIDNP kinetics. For tryptophan and tyrosine residues, the T(1) values change in opposite directions when the proteins are progressively denatured, reflecting the different <b>internal</b> <b>mobilities</b> of the two types of residues. It has been found that for both BLA and HLA the CIDNP kinetics of the non-native states formed at pH 6. 7 in the presence of 10 M urea are almost identical to those at pH 2 with no urea, suggesting that the polarizable amino acid side chains have closely similar solvent accessibilities and motional properties in the two non-native states...|$|R
