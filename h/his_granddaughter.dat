5|$|The mansion was {{completed}} in 1914. Because McCreary was widowed before his second term in office, <b>his</b> <b>granddaughter,</b> Harriet Newberry McCreary, served as the mansion's first hostess during her summer vacations from her studies at Wellesley College.

5|$|Adler's memoirs were {{published}} in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper Die Varheit in 1916–1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; <b>his</b> <b>granddaughter</b> Lulla Rosenfeld's English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916–1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed picture of his Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed picture of his time in London, although with some evasions around the relative timing of his relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin. It contains only a relatively fragmentary description of his New York career. In the English-language book of these memoirs, Rosenfeld attempts to fill the gaps with her own commentary.|$|E

5|$|Relative of the Rowan family, Stephen Collins Foster, {{occasionally}} visited Federal Hill {{according to}} letters penned by Stephen's brother Morrison Foster. Stephen {{was inspired by}} the imagery witnessed at Federal Hill and by Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin to write his ballad My Old Kentucky Home. The mansion remained in the possession of Rowan's family until 1922, when <b>his</b> <b>granddaughter,</b> Madge (Rowan) Frost, sold it to the state of Kentucky to be preserved as a state shrine. Today, it is a part of My Old Kentucky Home State Park in Bardstown. In 1856, the Kentucky General Assembly created a new county from parts of Fleming and Morgan counties and named it Rowan County in Rowan's honor.|$|E

However, marriage to Wang had been ruled out by a local diviner because their horoscopes were incompatible. Although displeased by the arrangement, Mao agreed to marry Luo. At the time he was fourteen, and later erroneously informed Edgar Snow that Luo was aged twenty, a claim independently accepted by Mao biographers Ross Terrill and Philip Short, but later challenged by biographers Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, and Alexander V. Pantsov and Steven I. Levine, who established that she was eighteen.|$|E

5|$|After reuniting with Terra, the Returners {{decide that}} it is time to launch an all-out attack on the Empire, and Banon asks Terra to attempt {{contacting}} the espers' land in order to gain their support.
