5|$|The Athsheans {{perceive}} the Terrans as an insane people, {{partly because of}} the disconnect amongst the Terrans between conscious, rational thinking and subconscious <b>drives.</b> <b>The</b> Terrans frequent use of hallucinogens is seen as the closest they are able to get to understanding their own subconscious. The psychological equilibrium which their dreaming gives the Athsheans is portrayed as the reason why they are able to live in balance with their ecosystem.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{models were}} {{produced}} both powered by J.A.P air-cooled V-twin engines with friction disc transmission and belt <b>drive.</b> <b>The</b> friction <b>drive</b> {{consisted of a}} vertical driven disc and a smaller wheel which could be moved {{across the face of}} <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> disc so <b>the</b> distace from <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> axis would give variable gearing. A clutch action was made by lifting <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> wheel off <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> disc. Moving <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> wheel past <b>the</b> centre gave a reverse gear. The smaller car with an engine rated for taxation at 5/6hp had tandem seating with the driver sitting behind the passenger. The larger model had a 7/9hp engine.|$|R
5000|$|Cotton mills were <b>driven</b> by water. <b>The</b> {{power was}} used to card the raw cotton, and then to <b>drive</b> <b>the</b> {{spinning}} mules and ring frames.

5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E

50|$|Don't Let <b>the</b> Pigeon <b>Drive</b> <b>the</b> Bus! is a children's {{picture book}} by Mo Willems. Released by Disney-Hyperion in 2003, it was Willems' first book for children, and {{received}} the Caldecott Honor. The plot is about a bus driver who has to leave so he asks the reader to not allow <b>the</b> pigeon to <b>drive</b> <b>the</b> bus. The pigeon tries many excuses and tries to finagle readers into letting it <b>drive</b> <b>the</b> bus. An animated adaptation of the book won the 2010 Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Children's Video.|$|R

5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Ash pedals furiously toward Viridian City. Ash loses {{control of}} the bike and wipes out, {{crashing}} down a hill. Realizing Pikachu's condition is critical, Ash pleads him to go inside his Poké Ball so that Ash can protect him from the approaching Spearow. Pikachu, after seeing how much Ash cares for it, performs a powerful Thunder attack which <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> Spearow away, but also destroys Misty's bike. As the rain-clouds part, a mysterious golden bird flies over a rainbow and Ash's Pokédex informs him {{that there is no}} current data on this Pokémon and that there are several yet to be identified. Ash carries Pikachu into Viridian City, and Pikachu licks Ash's cheek.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial species {{differ in}} the number and {{arrangement}} of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This motor <b>drives</b> <b>the</b> motion of the filament, which acts as a propeller.|$|E
