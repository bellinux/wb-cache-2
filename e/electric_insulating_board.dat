The sound absorption coefficient of experimental was measured at five frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. Results have indicated that the sound absorption coefficient increases as the frequency is increased up to 2000 Hz; further increase in the frequency resulted in decrease in the coefficient. Two type of resins UF and MUF didn't show significant difference in sound absorption. Boards with lower density absorbed less at lower frequencies; however, increase in {{the density of the}} boards resulted in the increase in their sound absorption. Furthermore, layered boards resulted in more sound absorption coefficients at lowest frequency of 250 Hz. Higher frequencies, though, have shown more absorption coefficient.

40|$|Typically, {{shareholders}} are {{not sure}} whether boards act in their interest, or have been captured by management. They are also less well informed than boards about firm investment opportunities and operating conditions. We develop a model, consistent with these observations, in which discretionary compensation payments to managers might increase firm value or might simply enrich managers {{at the expense of}} shareholders. After observing the board’s compensation and investment policies, shareholders update the probability that the board is captured using Bayes rule. Shareholders are “outraged” if this updated probability is sufficiently large. Outrage is costly for the board. Shareholder democracy, by enabling outrage to constrain board actions, typically lowers firm value relative either to governance regimes that <b>insulate</b> <b>boards</b> from shareholder outrage, or regimes that ban discretionary compensation altogether...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper aims to {{investigate}} the problem of attics conservation or dismantling from historic buildings. The attic, unconsciously inherited and planned with the traditional building techniques, constitutes a precious architectural heritage {{in the field of}} historic housing in the whole European patrimony. In many cases, the peculiarities of the type of techniques and the use of traditional local materials are the reasons why attics constitute an evidence of an active culture of know-how that has to be preserved. Furthermore, the attic-mediated heat transfer between indoor and outdoor environments, contributes to the saving of building heat loss. Nevertheless, the practice of eliminating attics is particularly diffused, and building owner or architects, preferring to dismantle their structure, compensate this loss by using <b>insulating</b> <b>boards</b> to constitute the final roofing section...|$|R

40|$|Many U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{facilities}} are undergoing decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) activities.

25|$|Prior to the ban, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used {{in the construction industry}} in thousands of materials. Some are judged to be more dangerous than others due to the amount of asbestos and the material's friable nature. Sprayed coatings, pipe insulation and Asbestos <b>Insulating</b> <b>Board</b> (AIB) are thought to be the most dangerous due to their high content of asbestos and friable nature. Many older buildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States, there is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by ASTM Standard E 2356–04. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos-contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list (NPL). Renovation and demolition of asbestos contaminated buildings is subject to EPA NESHAP and OSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under CERCLA's innocent purchaser defense. In the UK, the removal and disposal of asbestos and of substances containing it are covered by the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to selecting a heatsink with a given junction-to-case thermal resistance (ΘJC) assumes a one-dimensional heat flow {{path in the}} package. Similarly, when the case temperature of a component is known, and a user wants to predict the junction temperature (Tj), the data sheet ΘJC is deployed in one dimension. In this simplified approach, the user assumes that all generated heat flows serially from the junction to the case, then across the interface into the heatsink, and is finally dissipated from the heatsink to the air stream. Unless the component is floating or is on an <b>insulating</b> <b>board,</b> this assumption cannot be true. Any appreciable heat flow into the board will distort the Tj prediction or {{lead to a more}} conservative, and perhaps expensive, heatsink choice. For most systems, such over-design might be tolerable; however, this may not always be the case. This review will point out some of the pitfalls of this onedimensional approach and offer an example to illustrate a more complete approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{precipitation}} {{of magnesium}} hydroxy-carbonate hydrates {{has been suggested}} as a route to sequester CO 2 into solids. We report the development of self-cementing compositions based on nesquehonite, MgCO 3 · 3 H 2 O, that are made from CO 2 -containing gas streams, the CO 2 being separated from other gases by its high solubility in alkaline water, while magnesium is typically provided by waste desalination brines. Precipitation conditions are adjusted to optimize the formation of nesquehonite and the crystalline solid can readily be washed free of chloride. Products can be prepared to achieve self-cementation following two routes: (i) thermal activation of the nesquehonite then rehydration of the precursor or (ii) direct curing of a slurry of nesquehonite. The products thus obtained contain ~ 30 wt% CO 2 and could {{form the basis for}} a new generation of lightweight, thermally <b>insulating</b> <b>boards,</b> blocks and panels, with sufficient strength for general construction...|$|R
