[...] Daryl Eslea of BBC Music wrote that [...] "Young Soul Rebels ‚Äì fierce, raging and passionate ‚Äì remains one of the greatest debut albums of all time". In a retrospective review following the album's 2010 re-issue, Graeme Thomson of Uncut concluded that [...] "ultimately, the myth-making around Kevin Rowland tends to obscure the fact that he's been responsible for some truly soul-scorching music", and that [...] "at 30 years of age, Young Soul Rebels continues to burn." [...] Tom Ewing, writing in Pitchfork, called it Dexys Midnight Runners' most coherent and consistent record, as did Drowned in Sounds Neil Ashman, who added that [...] "it's <b>damned</b> <b>near</b> perfect."

500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this <b>damn</b> <b>near</b> Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone ‚Äì and {{that was part of the}} vocals on one of those songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower.

[...] Baker concluded in his review, [...] "With another nearly flawless album, OutKast arguably solidifies their {{reputation as one of}} the best hip-hop groups of all time." [...] The Los Angeles Times opined that [...] "the record's most interesting moments are gorgeous Prince-style soul." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "OutKast's music savors the viscous propulsion of funk, with raps and tunes that never ignore the body and its instinctive desires ... Yet OutKast -- taking cues from a band it obviously reveres, Parliament-Funkadelic -- never forgets that bodies are attached to minds."

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method for {{learning}} discriminative category-level features and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on large-scale ac-tion recognition in video. The key observation is that one-vs-rest clas-sifiers, which are ubiquitously employed for this task, face challenges in separating very similar categories (such as running vs. jogging). Our proposed method automatically identifies such pairs of categories using a criterion of mutual pairwise proximity in the (kernelized) feature space, using a category-level similarity matrix where each entry corresponds to the one-vs-one SVM margin for pairs of categories. We then exploit the observation that while splitting such ‚ÄúSiamese Twin ‚Äù categories may be difficult, separating them from the remaining categories in a two-vs-rest framework is not. This enables us to augment one-vs-rest classifiers with a judicious selection of ‚Äútwo-vs-rest ‚Äù classifier outputs, formed from such discriminative and mutually <b>nearest</b> (<b>DaMN)</b> pairs. By combining one-vs-rest and two-vs-rest features in a principled probabilistic manner, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the UCF 101 and HMDB 51 datasets. More importantly, the same DaMN features, when treated as a mid-level representation also outperform existing methods in knowledge transfer experiments, both cross-dataset from UCF 101 to HMDB 51 and to new categories with limited training data (one-shot and few-shot learning). Finally, we study the generality of the proposed approach by applying DaMN to other classification tasks; our experiments show that DaMN outperforms related approaches in direct comparisons, not only on video action recognition but also on their original image dataset tasks. ...|$|R
