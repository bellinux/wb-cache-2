25|$|As is {{the case}} in churches {{directly}} influenced by Anglican ethos and theology, the ACC tends to reflect the dominant social and cultural strains of the nation in which it finds itself. For most of its history, the ACC embodied the conservative, colonial outlook of its mostly British-descended parishioners and of English Canada as a whole. In the post-World War II period, as the character of Canada changed, so too did the attitudes of people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pews,</b> and by extension, the church.|$|E
25|$|From around 1967 onwards, the Anglican-Methodist unity scheme {{began to}} run into problems. There was strong {{opposition}} from Anglo-Catholics, and the Voice of Methodism campaigned against it. Following initial alarm that the Scheme would begin in 1965, voting was delayed until 1969. There were many arguments over the ‘Service of Reconciliation’. It was argue that by asserting the historic episcopate {{the doctrine of the}} priesthood of all believers, stated in the 1932 Methodist Deed of Union, was being denied. The debate became acrimonious, reaching a low point with the publication of the book 'Anglican-Methodist Unity: Some Considerations Historical and Liturgical' by Margaret Deanesly and Geoffrey G. Willis. The Voice of Methodism brought a Chancery Court case against the Methodist Connexion. It was claimed that the degree of opposition expressed in the Methodist District Synods and Circuit Meetings did not represent the true depth of feeling against the Scheme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pews.</b> Around a tenth of the Church left. At the votes taken in July 1969, the Methodist Conference accepted the Scheme, but insufficient support was given in the Anglican Convocations and, despite several attempts to revive it, the proposals lapsed.|$|E

2500|$|David Roozen, {{director}} of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research {{who has studied the}} United Church of Christ, said surveys show the national church's pronouncements are often more liberal than the views <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> but that its governing structure is set up to allow such disagreements. Starting in 2003, a task force commissioned by General Synod 24 studied the diverse worship habits of UCC churches. The study can be found online and reflects statistics on attitudes toward worship, baptism, and communion, such as [...] "Laity (70%) and clergy (90%) alike overwhelmingly describe worship 'as an encounter with God that leads to doing God's work in the world.'" [...] "95 percent of our congregations use the Revised Common Lectionary in some way in planning or actual worship and preaching" [...] and [...] "96 percent always or almost always have a sermon, 86 percent have a time with children, 95 percent have a time of sharing joys and concerns, and 98 percent include the Prayer of Our Savior/Lord's Prayer." [...] Clergy and laity were invited to select two meanings of baptism that they emphasize. They were also to suggest the meaning that they thought their entire church emphasized. Baptism as an [...] "entry into the Church Universal" [...] was the most frequent response. Clergy and laity were invited to identify two meanings of Holy Communion that they emphasize. While clergy emphasized Holy Communion as [...] "a meal in which we encounter God's living presence," [...] laity emphasized [...] "a remembrance of Jesus' last supper, death, and resurrection." ...|$|E
