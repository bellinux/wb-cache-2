It is essential as manual annotation is time consuming especially for large databases and there is no standard captioning procedure because it is based on human perception. This paper discusses implementation of automatic image annotation using K-means clustering algorithm to annotate the colors with the appropriate words by using predefined colors. Experiments are conducted to identify the number of cen-troids, distance measures and <b>initialization</b> <b>mode</b> for the best clustering results. A prototype of an automatic image annotation is developed and then tested us-ing thirty-five beach scenery photographs.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a microsatellite attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS) and verification of its functionality by software-in-the-loop (SIL) method. The role of ADCS is to provide attitude control functions, including the de-tumbling and stabilizing the satellite angular velocity, and as well as estimating the orbit and attitude information during the satellite operation. In Taiwan, Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), dedicating for students to design experimental low earth orbit micro-satellite, called AFITsat. For AFITsat, the operation of the ADCS consists of three modes which are <b>initialization</b> <b>mode,</b> detumbling mode, and normal mode, respectively. During the <b>initialization</b> <b>mode,</b> ADCS collects the early orbit measurement data from various sensors so that the data can be downlinked to the ground station for further analysis. As particularly emphasized in this paper, during the detumbling mode, ADCS implements the thrusters in plus-wide modulation control method to decrease the satellite angular velocity. ADCS provides the attitude determination function for the estimation of the satellite state, during normal mode. The three modes of microsatellite adopted Kalman filter algorithm estimate microsatellite attitude. This paper will discuss using the SIL validation ADCS function and verify its feasibility...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the design of}} a novel boil-off gas (BOG) re-liquefaction technology using a BOG recondenser system. The BOG recondenser system targets the liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering operation, in which the BOG phase transition occurs in a pressure vessel instead of a heat exchanger. The BOG that is generated during LNG bunkering operation is characterized as an intermittent flow with various peak loads. The system was designed to temporarily store the transient BOG inflow, condense it with subcooled LNG and store the condensed liquid. The superiority of the system was verified by comparing it with the most extensively employed conventional re-liquefaction system in terms of consumption energy and via an exergy analysis. Static simulations were conducted for three compositions; the results indicated that the proposed system provided 0 to 6. 9 % higher efficiencies. The exergy analysis indicates that the useful work of the conventional system is 24. 9 %, and the useful work of the proposed system is 26. 0 %. Process dynamic simulations of six cases were also performed to verify the behaviour of the BOG recondenser system. The results show that the pressure of the holdup in the recondenser vessel increased during the BOG inflow mode and decreased during the <b>initialization</b> <b>mode.</b> The maximum pressure of one of the bunkering cases was 3. 45 bar.

40|$|The idea {{of using}} {{artificial}} neural network has been proven useful for hyperspectral image classification. However, the high dimensionality of hyperspectral images usually leads {{to the failure of}} constructing an effective neural network classifier. To improve the performance of neural network classifier, wavelet-based feature extraction algorithms can be applied to extract useful features for hyperspectral image classification. However, the extracted features with fixed position and dilation parameters of the wavelets provide insufficient characteristics of spectrum. In this study, wavelet networks which integrates the advantages of wavelet-based feature extraction and neural networks classification is proposed for hyperspectral image classification. Wavelet networks is a kind of feed-forward neural networks using wavelets as activation function. Both the position and the dilation parameters of the wavelets are optimized as well as the weights of the network during the training phase. The value of wavelet networks lies in their capabilities of optimizing network weights and extracting essential features simultaneously for hyperspectral images classification. In this study, the influence of the learning rate and momentum term during the network training phase is presented, and several <b>initialization</b> <b>modes</b> of wavelet networks were used to test the performance of wavelet networks...|$|R

In the development of biomaterials for bone tissue engineering, mechanical stimuli and formation of a vascular network that transport oxygen to cells within the pores of the scaffolds are essential. Angiogenesis and cell differentiation have been simulated in scaffolds of regular porosity; however, the dynamics of differentiation can be different when the porosity is not uniform. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the mechanical stimuli and the capillary network formation on cell differentiation within a scaffold of irregular morphology. A porous scaffold of calcium phosphate based glass was used. The pores and the solid phase were discretized using micro computed tomography images. Cell activity was simulated within the interconnected pore domain of the scaffold using a lattice modeling approach. Compressive strains of 0. 5 and 1 % of total deformation were applied and two cases of mesenchymal stem cells initialization (in vitro seeding and in vivo) were simulated. Similar capillary networks were formed independently of the cell <b>initialization</b> <b>mode</b> and the magnitude of the mechanical strain applied. Most of vessels grew in the pores at the periphery of the scaffolds and were blocked by the walls of the scaffold. When 0. 5 % of strain was applied, 70 % of the pore volume was affected by mechano-regulatory stimuli corresponding to bone formation; however, because of the lack of oxygen, only 40 % of the volume was filled with osteoblasts. 40 % of volume was filled with chondrocytes and 3 % with fibroblasts. When the mechanical strain was increased to 1 %, 11 % of the pore volume was filled with osteoblasts, 59 % with chondrocytes, and 8 % with fibroblasts.
