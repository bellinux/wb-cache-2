5|$|In the 2009 Wimbledon final, Roddick lost to Federer in five sets. The match {{included}} a 30-game fifth set (a Grand Slam final record) and lasted over four hours.

With that victory, Federer broke Pete Sampras' record of 14 Grand Slam singles titles, and Roddick apologised to Sampras (who was there) <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to stop Federer.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, {{to prepare}} Fleming for {{possible}} {{entry into the}} Foreign Office, his mother {{sent him to the}} Tennerhof in Kitzb√ºhel, Austria, a small private school run by the Adlerian disciple and former British spy Ernan Forbes Dennis and his novelist wife, Phyllis Bottome. After improving his language skills there, he studied briefly at Munich University and the University of Geneva. While in Geneva, Fleming began a romance with Monique Panchaud de Bottomes and the couple were briefly engaged in 1931. His mother disapproved and made him break off the relationship. He applied for entry to the Foreign Office, but failed the examinations. His mother again intervened in his affairs, lobbying Sir Roderick Jones, head of Reuters News Agency, and in October 1931 he was given a position as a sub-editor and journalist for the company. In 1933 Fleming spent time in Moscow, where he covered the Stalinist show trial of six engineers from the British company Metropolitan-Vickers. While there he applied for an interview with Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, and was amazed to receive a personally signed note apologising <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to attend.|$|E
5|$|Tess, {{awakening}} {{on a table}} {{inside a}} laboratory, is greeted by the parallel universe version of Lionel Luthor (John Glover), who reveals that Lex took his imperfect clones' best pieces and assembled them to create a perfect clone of himself. Lionel attempts to use Tess's heart to bring Lex back to life, but she breaks free and shoots Lionel during her escape. Lionel makes a deal with Darkseid to bring his son to life in exchange for Lionel's soul. Clark tracks Tess to the Luthor Mansion, where he is confronted by Lex. Clark apologizes <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to save Lex, but declares that he {{will always be there}} to stop him in the future. Oliver confronts Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey, dispatching them with three arrows. At LuthorCorp, Tess confronts Lex, who reveals that he always knew that she was his sister and that he used her. Lex embraces Tess, and stabs her in the stomach as he tells her he loves her, claiming to be saving her from becoming like him. As she lays dying, she infects Lex with a neurotoxin that erases all of his memories within 30 seconds.|$|E

25|$|As {{several of}} Valve's series feature only two primary games, named with numerals such as Half-Life and Half-Life 2, {{and with no}} {{apparent}} announcements on a third title in these series, Valve has developed a lighthearted joking reputation <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to count to 3, or scared of this number.

25|$|By now, Dravid {{had been}} branded as a Test specialist. While he {{continued}} to score heavily in Test cricket, his poor strike rate in ODIs came under scanner. He drew criticism <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to adjust his style of play {{to the needs of}} ODI cricket, his lack of attacking capability and play big strokes. However, 1999 proved to be the year of renaissance for Dravid's ODI career. Dravid worked hard and re-tooled his game by increasing his range of strokes and adapting his batting style to suit the requirements of ODI cricket. He learned to pace his innings cleverly without going for the slogs.|$|E
25|$|With new {{national}} Bundestag (West Germany's parliament) elections coming up, the Social Democratic Party was coming into power, first in 1966 {{as part of}} a broad coalition, and by 1969, with a parliamentary majority. With the Social Democrats holding the power, they were finally {{in a position to make}} key appointments in the Ministry of Justice and start implementing reform. In addition, demographic anxieties such as fear of declining birth rate no longer controlled the 1960s and homosexual men were no longer seen as a threat <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to reproduce. The role of the state was seen as protecting society from harm, and should only intervene in cases that involved force or the abuse of minors.|$|E
25|$|During England's {{second round}} match against Ecuador, Beckham scored from a free {{kick in the}} 59th minute, {{becoming}} the first English player to score in three separate World Cups, and giving England a 1‚Äì0 victory and {{a place in the}} quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of dehydration and illness that he got after having scored the winning goal for England. In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3‚Äì1), the score having been 0‚Äì0 after extra time. After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to play, being in tears at one point.|$|E

25|$|The Empire {{declared}} {{war against the}} United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata (now Argentina) in 1825 because that nation was aiding the secessionist revolt of the Brazilian province of Cisplatine. The Argentine and the Cisplatine secessionist troops made use of guerrilla tactics that prevented the much stronger Brazilian Army (1st Line with 27,242 men and 2nd Line with 95,000) from delivering an overwhelming blow against its enemies. By {{the end of the}} conflict more than 8,000 Brazilians had died and the esteem associated with a career in the military declined. In the aftermath, the military blamed the Emperor <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to convince the Parliament to allow more financial aid to purchase equipment, munitions and provisions, while the liberals, on the other hand, considered the monarch responsible for the high costs of the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Muslims are {{commanded}} {{to perform}} prayers {{five times a}} day. These prayers are obligatory on every Muslim who has {{reached the age of}} puberty, with the exception being those who are mentally ill, too physically ill for it to be possible, menstruating, or experiencing postnatal bleeding. Those who are ill or otherwise physically unable to offer their prayers in the traditional form are permitted to offer their prayers while sitting or lying, as they are able. The five prayers are each assigned to certain prescribed times (al waqt) at which they must be performed, unless there is a compelling reason <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to perform them on time. These times are measured according to the movement of the sun. These are: near dawn (fajr), after midday has passed and the sun starts to tilt downwards/noon (zuhr), in the afternoon (asr), just after sunset (maghrib) and around nightfall (Isha). Under some circumstances ritual worship can be shortened or combined (according to prescribed procedures). In case a ritual worship is not performed at the right time, it must be performed later.|$|E
25|$|In early 2013, India {{returned}} the favour to Australia and whitewashed them 4‚Äì0 {{at home in}} a Test series. India then beat the Aussies 3‚Äì2 in the 7-match ODI series and won the one-off T20I. However, India lost heavily against New Zealand and South Africa away from home and led to heavy criticism of Indian cricketers <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to perform overseas. India defeated England in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy final and Mahendra Singh Dhoni became the first captain in history to win the three major ICC trophies, namely- ICC Cricket World Cup, ICC World Twenty20 and ICC Champions Trophy. This was followed by a victory in the West Indies Triangular Series in 2013 consisting of India, West Indies and Sri Lanka. In 2014, India toured Bangladesh and England. Although they beat the former 2‚Äì0 in 3 One Day Internationals, Team India were beaten 3‚Äì1 in 5 Test matches by England. This series included a famous win for the Indian team in the first match of the series at Lord's. The Test series was followed by a 3‚Äì1 win for the Indians in a 5-match ODI series and a loss in a one-off T20, both against England.|$|E
