25|$|Today in medicine, it {{is common}} that {{physicians}} often use a trial and error strategy until they find the treatment therapy that is most effective for their patient. With personalised medicine, these treatments can be more specifically tailored to an individual and give insight into how their body will respond to the drug and if that drug will work based on their genome. The personal genotype can allow physicians to have more detailed <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> guide them in their decision in treatment prescriptions, which will be more cost-effective and accurate. As quoted from the article Pharmacogenomics: The Promise of Personalised Medicine, “therapy with the right drug at the right dose in the right patient” is a description of how personalized medicine will affect the future of treatment. For instance, tamoxifen {{used to be a}} drug commonly prescribed to women with ER+ breast cancer, but 65% of women initially taking it developed resistance. After some research by people such as David Flockhart, it was discovered that women with certain mutation in their CYP2D6 gene, a gene that encodes the metabolizing enzyme, were not able to efficiently break down Tamoxifen, making it an ineffective treatment for their cancer. Since then, women are now genotyped for those specific mutations, so that immediately these women can have the most effective treatment therapy.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells {{us to look at}} another bit unless we have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It is easy to see that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E

It appears that, from year to year, he owned a larger share in the Blackfriars' Theater:[618] its wardrobe and other appurtenances were his: and he bought an estate in his native village, with his earnings, as writer and shareholder; that he lived in the best house in Stratford;[619] was intrusted by his neighbors with their commissions in London, as of borrowing money, and the like; and he was a veritable farmer. About the time when he was writing Macbeth,[620] he sues Philip Rogers, in the borough-court of Stratford, for thirty-five shillings, ten pence, for corn delivered to him at different times; and, in all respects, appears as a good husband with no reputation for eccentricity or excess. He was a good-natured sort of man, an actor and shareholder in the theater, not in any striking manner distinguished from other actors and managers. I admit the importance of this information.
