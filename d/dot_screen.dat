Next, the plate is exposed to a positive transparency of an image.

Dot-on-dot/dot-off-dot and rotated <b>dot</b> <b>screen</b> configurations are examined via simulation and supported by print measurements. The color and color shifts were calculated using a spectral Neugebauer model for the underlying simulations. As expected, dot-on-dot/dot-off-dot color shifts were very high, while rotated dots screens exhibited very little color shift under the present idealized conditions. The simulations also demonstrate that optical dot gain significantly reduces the color shifts seen in practice...|$|E

40|$|As {{the desktop}} {{printing}} market becomes more competitive, {{the demand for}} halftoning techniques that generate very high quality halftones is likely to increase. To achieve {{the highest level of}} print quality, a model based halftoning algorithm such as DBS must be used. This algorithm is an iterative method designed to minimize a metric of error between the grayscale original and halftone image. This metric incorporates a model for the human visual system (HVS) and the printer used to render the image. Unfortunately, this type of algorithm is required to employ an ad-hoc optimization strategy to solve this inherently nonlinear problem. As a result, these algorithms are extremely difficult to analyze. In addition, they are more computationally intensive than conventional halftoning techniques, and therefore less practical. ^ First, DBS is analyzed to show why the algorithm produces halftones which exhibit high quality textures. This analysis {{is referred to as the}} Dual interpretation of DBS. Here, we have been able to establish that all halftones generated by DBS are guaranteed to satisfy a set of perceptually based performance criteria. Then, this analysis is applied to the design of dispersed <b>dot</b> <b>screen</b> functions. We compare and contrast DBS and Void-and-Cluster, two popular approaches for designing dither arrays. Next, we focus our attention on reducing the computational complexity of DBS. This effort includes a technique for implementing DBS on platforms with limited computing resources. Lastly, a perceptually based technique for sharpening images is provided. This approach is a direct outgrowth of the use of visual models in our prior work. ...|$|E
40|$|The ordered-dither halftoning {{technique}} which reproduces continuous tones with spatially encoded binary imaging elements uses the digital halftone screen. The effect at the microstructural level of four screens on tone reproduction, spatial signal reproduction, and quantization noise is evaluated {{by measuring the}} tone reproduction curve (TRC), the two-dimensional Fourier transform of a constant density patch, the degree of harmonic distortion (THD), the system Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), and the Wiener Spectrum (WS) produced by each screen. The applicablity of these five conventional image evaluation metrics on binary output is also evaluated. Spatial averaging is done to convert the binary output to a more linear form. The TRCs {{were found to be}} identical with a full output average reflectance range and a contrast of 1. 0 / 255. 0. The curves were step-wise linear, displaying 65 reproducible average reflectance levels. Fourier analysis of the binary structure showed that aliasing was likely to occur with the Diamond Dot and Bryngdahl screens, while aliasing from the Bayer and Allebach screens was unlikely. The THD plots showed that the Diamond <b>Dot</b> <b>screen</b> produced the highest degree of non-linearity, followed by Bryngdahl. The Bayer and Allebach screens produced the lowest THD. The line edge derivative approach to determining MTF did not yield useful MTF results for the halftoned forms. The Weiner spectrum for the Diamond Dot and Bryngdahl screens contained components at the halftone cell frequency, while the spectrum for the Bayer and Allebach screens contained components at much higher frequencies. Using these results, it was concluded that all the traditional metrics are valid for binary output except the line edge derivative approach for the MTF which did not yield the traditional MTF...|$|E
40|$|The {{halftone}} {{process has been}} the conventional means of reproducing photographic artwork on newsprint. The use of relatively coarse screen rulings, dictated by the paper characteristics, produces an image with a noticeable dot pattern. Furthermore, the printing process is susceptible to extreme dot gain variation, which affects tone reproduction and the pictorial communication of the image. There were good reasons to suspect that a random <b>dot</b> <b>screen</b> could give more consistent tone rendition than a conventional halftone screen. A comparative study of the consistency of perception of conventional and randomly screened images when printed on newsprint {{has not yet been}} reported. The present study is an attempt to determine which screen can reproduce more consistently perceptible images when extreme dot gain occurs. To test this comparison, an original black and white photographic image, composed of geometric shapes of varying densities superimposed on backgrounds of varying densities, was reproduced from a computer generated slide. This test target, designed to encourage objective answers from observers, was photographed through 65 -and 85 -line conventional halftone screens, and 75 -and 150 - line mezzotint (random dot) screens. The production of film, plate, and the press run were the same for the four screened images. The pressman purposely varied the ink film thickness to simulate dot gain. Selected samples of minimum, average, and maximum dot gain were presented to observers, who were asked to identify geometric shapes on 12 printed images. The recorded responses were averaged, and the collected data was represented in graphs. In this manner it was possible to determine which screens can reproduce more consistent tonal distinctions. The results of the experiment proved that the random dot screens are not capable of reproducing more consistently perceptible images. The 65 -line conventional halftone screen produces more consistent perceptual responses in the highlights, while the 85 -line conventional halftone screen produces more consistent responses in the midtones...|$|E

40|$|Fine resolution, bright X-ray screens {{are needed}} for digital {{radiography}} and material characterization at the Y- 12 National Security Complex (Y- 12). Current technology is simply not adequate for transferring high-energy X-ray images to visible light for demanding digital applications. Low energy radiography and especially emerging tomographic technologies are severely hampered for Y- 12 nondestructive evaluation (NDE) applications by dim screens with poor resolution. Also, {{the development of more}} advanced materials characterization techniques, such as electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), is driven by a design agency desire for tighter specifications and more uniform materials. Brighter screens would allow us to probe materials on a finer scale, leading {{to a better understanding of}} material behavior. A number of X-ray screen materials were studied that would be suitable for direct replacement in existing digital imaging systems. Spectroscopic evaluations were first made for a several candidates and indicated that lutetium orthosilicate (LSO) would be a promising candidate for MeV images. A relative comparison of brightness at various energies was then completed which showed that cesium iodide (CsI) could increase brightness by over an order of magnitude. Since image quality is also important for better screens, the resolving capabilities of candidate materials were measured. Resolution measurements were completed at X-ray peak energies up to 420 KeV with magnified optical imaging systems, and indicated that LSO and Industrial Quality Incorporated glass (IQI) exhibited higher resolution than the CsI screen. The results give a choice of materials that can be tailored to the particular test under consideration. If high-speed images are necessary and some resolution can be sacrificed, the CsI screen will be a good choice. The screen can be replaced by an IQI or LSO unit if higher resolution is needed later, for instance to focus in on a region of interest. A number of significant findings were obtained from this study. Most important of the findings was that materials are commercially available that are much brighter than screens currently in use. This finding meets the original objective of the project. Two objectives of the study; however, were not met. We hoped to evaluate a &#x 27;quantum dot&#x 27; (nanometer-sized particles of semiconductor material) wavelength conversion screen, but the manufacturer ceased production of the screen shortly before the project was started. The <b>dot</b> <b>screen</b> could be efficient in converting ultraviolet light to visible light which would have proved important for utilizing a Cherenkov screen. Since this was a very new, cutting-edge technology, an alternative supplier was not found during the study. Also, high-energy testing of a Cherenkov light screen was not performed due to difficulties in obtaining appropriate approvals for locating test equipment in the high-energy X-ray vault at Y- 12. The test is still important, and is being pursued through follow-on funding sources. Although many film shots will be eliminated by the availability of high quality digital images, the largest potential gains result from the availability of clearer images that show fine detail in the parts under analysis. Digital radiographic data also offers the possibility of easily sharing data with other sites. This could prove invaluable when critical material, placement, assembly, or quality issues are pressing. Also, increased throughput in the NDE facility allows statistically significant numbers of units to be analyzed. Digital technologies may in fact be needed just to meet minimum requirements of future demands. Increased brightness screens allow for such innovations as 3 -D tomographic images to be acquired in a reasonable time. Much of the skill required to interpret &#x 27;flattened&#x 27; X-ray images is not needed to maneuver around the reconstructed tomogram. This study showed that several commercially available materials are much brighter than screens currently in use. The study also showed that materials other than the brightest may be preferred for the best resolution. Since the X-ray conversion screen can be designed for easy exchange, a combination of materials will ultimately be the best approach for the broad range of radiography analysis performed at Y- 12...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Superpositions of {{periodic}} <b>dot</b> <b>screens</b> {{are largely}} used in electronic imaging {{in the field}} of color printing. In such superpositions the interaction between the superposed layers may cause new structures to appear which did not exist in any of the original layers: macrostructures (also known as moiré patterns) and microstructures (also known as rosettes). While macrostructures are not always generated in the superposition (cf. moiré-free superpositions), microstructures exist practically in any superposition, except for the most trivial cases. In fact, even the macrostructures, whenever they occur, consist of variations in the microstructure of the superposition. In the present paper we investigate the microstructures that appear in the superposition of periodic structures and their properties. We also find the conditions on the superposed layers under which the microstructure of the superposition varies—or remains invariant—when individual layers in the superposition are laterally shifted with respect to each other. © 2002 SPIE and IS&T.

One of the most interesting properties of such moiré effects, which clearly distinguish them from their periodic counterparts, is undoubtedly the appearence in the superposition of intriguing microstructure dot alignments, also known as dot trajectories. These dot trajectories may have different geometric shapes, depending on the transformations undergone by the superposed layers. In the case of simple linear transformations such as layer rotations or layer scalings, the resulting dot trajectories are rather simple (circular, radial, spiral, elliptic, hyperbolic, linear, etc.); but in more complex layer transformations the dot trajectories can have much more interesting and surprising shapes. A full mathematical analysis of the dot trajectories, their morphology, and their various properties is provided. Furthermore, it is shown how the approach also allows us to synthesize correlated random screens that give in their superposition dot trajectories having any desired geometric shapes.
