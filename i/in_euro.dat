All intra-EU transfers <b>in</b> <b>euro</b> are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of {{creating}} a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (golden goal), or if one team held a lead {{at the end of}} the first period of extra time (silver goal). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996. Silver goal was used <b>in</b> <b>Euro</b> 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated <b>in</b> <b>euro</b> are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{having a}} {{disrupted}} pre-season {{due to his}} participation <b>in</b> <b>Euro</b> 2012, Ben Arfa enjoyed a good start to the new Premier League season. On the opening weekend of the season he won and converted a penalty that gave Newcastle a 2–1 victory over Tottenham. Two weeks later he scored with a spectacular 25-yard drive, on his weaker right foot, to earn Newcastle a point in a 1–1 draw against Aston Villa. He injured his hamstring during December, and made his comeback against Anzhi Makhachkala in the Europa League on 7 March 2013, his 26th birthday. He then developed an injury which {{kept him out of}} the team until the second leg of the Europa League quarter final against Benfica on the 11 April 2013 when he came on as a second-half substitute. Ben Arfa scored the equaliser in a 2–1 away win at Loftus Road from the penalty spot as Newcastle confirmed their Premier League status for the next season.|$|E
