5|$|Due to its remoteness, Sangay hosts a {{significant}} biological community with fauna {{such as the}} mountain tapir, giant otter, Andean cock-of-the-rock and king vulture. Since 1983, its ecological community has been protected {{as part of the}} Sangay National Park. Although climbing the mountain is hampered by its remoteness, poor weather conditions, river flooding, and the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> ejecta, the volcano is regularly climbed, a feat first achieved by Robert T. Moore in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Several deaths {{occurred}} {{as a result}} of injuries sustained in struggles. In a few of these cases head injury due to falling after being shocked contributed to later death. Some police departments, like that of Clearwater, Florida, have tried to eliminate such incidents by prohibiting taser use when the suspect is in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under {{the sway}} of the Cap faction, Sweden seemed in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> prey to the {{political}} ambitions of Russia. It appeared {{on the point of}} being absorbed into the Northern Accord sought by the Russian vice-chancellor, Count Nikita Panin. It seemed to many that only a swift and sudden coup d'état could preserve Sweden's independence.|$|E

25|$|The Fort de Maulde {{was closed}} to public access in 2009, due to the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> into pits in the {{darkness}} of its interior and from falling masonry. Toxic waste from the tileworks was dumped in the fort until the 1980s. Its subsidiary bunkers remain visible in the surrounding fields.|$|R
25|$|In {{common with}} other daytime soaps, Another World {{experienced}} a gradual erosion of viewership but, amazingly enough given its turbulent history, {{held on to}} ninth place on the ratings chart from the mid 1980s {{until the end of}} its run. While it never showed signs of moving up through this period, it was for the most part never in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> to last place.|$|E
25|$|In 1743 it {{was decided}} to raise the steeple 10 yards higher so that the bells could be heard better, and the bells were also to be re-cast. In 1753, the tower was {{determined}} to be in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> down, so the bells were removed from it. Henry Sephton was commissioned to demolish and rebuild the tower. In 1759 a new tower was erected, which still stands.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{secondary}} plot about another scientist seeking to undermine Murray's work. This {{comes into play}} as Santiago and Murray attempt to source the equipment they need for their experiment. Ultimately and perhaps predictably, the entire scheme ends up in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> apart and that's when the creativity in the film shines. The character work and script development keep the characters moving along their dramatic arch in a funny and unique way.|$|E
2500|$|Falling away: [...] "The image <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> {{with the}} sense of going to eternal destruction, is {{particularly}} evident in the New Testament... In his [...] parable of the wise and foolish builder, in which the house built on sand falls with a crash {{in the midst of a}} storm (Matthew 7:24-27)... he painted a highly memorable image <b>of</b> the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> spiritually." ...|$|R

25|$|During the Depression, the Conservatory of Flowers, due to {{apparent}} lack of maintenance, was in poor condition. The Park commissioners {{instructed the}} superintendent of Parks to close the Conservatory of Flowers in 1933 and construct proper barricades to prevent possible injury to citizens. The woodwork, foundations, girders, posts, and various structural members became rotted and decayed {{to such an extent}} that certain portions of the conservatory were reported to be in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and potentially causing great injury.|$|E
25|$|This {{time the}} preservationists sued {{the city to}} stop the demolition. The {{buildings}} continued to deteriorate, and in 2004 a section of State Street was closed since part of the Wellington's cornice was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> into it. A new owner, Columbia Development Companies, bought the properties and finally reached a compromise that preserved the façades of the Wellington and the other State Street buildings, with the new office building to rise behind them. Demolition began in 2009.|$|E

25|$|On Labour's other flank, {{the three}} Māori seats that it held last time against a strong Māori Party {{challenge}} were in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> {{as they did}} in 1996 when New Zealand First broke Labour's sixty-year stranglehold. Nanaia Mahuta again faced Angeline Greensill for the new Hauraki-Waikato seat, and narrowly held it. Māori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia also held on by a small margin against veteran broadcaster Derek Fox in Ikaroa-Rāwhiti. Incumbent Mahara Okeroa, however, was defeated by Rahui Katene in Te Tai Tonga, giving the Māori Party an additional seat.|$|E
25|$|After the Register listing, in 1999, the Salem Cemetery Committee {{was formed}} to restore and oversee the Revolutionary War Cemetery {{as well as two}} others in the town. It took {{photographs}} of the gravestones and found that half of them had either been knocked over or were in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Others were buried and overgrown, and a lightning strike later damaged a section of the wall. The committee has put out information brochures, compiled lists of those buried, put American flag holders next to the headstones of veterans, and promulgated regulations for the taking of stone rubbings.|$|E

By day 52, he was reportedly in severe pain, was finding it hard to see, and was <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> into a coma. According to Mann, his supporters were bringing him tape recordings of the talks with the government, which he was having difficulty concentrating on. Mann writes that Horne decided to take some orange juice and sweet tea for three days, in order {{to stave off the}} coma so that he could understand the negotiations. This later caused the media to refer to the hunger strike as a fraud.|$|E

40|$|With {{an aging}} {{population}} and a greater desire for independence, the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> incidents in the elderly have become particularly pronounced. In light of this, several technologies have been developed {{with the aim of}} preventing or monitoring falls. Failing to strike the balance between several factors including reliability, complexity and invasion of privacy has seen prohibitive in the uptake of these systems. Some systems rely on cameras being mounted in all rooms of a user's home while others require being worn 24 hours a day.

25|$|Sergeant Edward James Gibson Holland – Soldier of the Royal Canadian Dragoons. Holland {{received}} his Victoria Cross {{from the same}} rear guard conflict at Leliefontein on 7 November 1900 as Cockburn and Turner. However, Holland {{received his}} medal {{for a different reason}} than the two aforementioned Lieutenants. During the Boer advance, Holland kept the Boer soldiers at bay with his carriage mounted Colt machine gun despite the position becoming increasingly dangerous due to the proximity of the enemy. With his gun jammed and in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> into enemy hands, Holland removed the Colt from its carriage and rode away on his horse with the gun in hand.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time, Fromme {{came to believe that}} California's giant coastal redwoods, the tallest trees in the world, were in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> because of {{automobile}} smog reaching their rural location. Feeling personally responsible for the fate of the redwoods, Fromme traveled to San Francisco to meet with a San Francisco government official to save the trees from pollution. After returning from San Francisco, Fromme watched a news report from her P Street apartment and learned some details of Ford's plans to visit Sacramento. The hotel Ford would be staying at, the Senator Hotel, was located {{a little more than a}} —about fifteen minutes walking distance—from Fromme's Sacramento apartment. At this point, Fromme decided to bring attention to the trees by putting fear into the government through killing its symbol, President Ford.|$|E
25|$|Data also {{appeared}} in the crossover graphic novel series , set in 2368, in which the Borg Collective joins forces with the Cybermen when the latter invade their universe. Data and {{the crew of the}} Enterprise-D form an alliance of their own with the Eleventh Doctor-who immediately recognizes Data as an android upon seeing him-and his companions, Amy Pond and Rory Williams. The group later forms a reluctant truce with the Borg, who have been betrayed by the Cybermen and are in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> to them. Data and the others manage to restore the Borg Collective and destroy the Cybermen, but their Borg liaison then attempts to seize control of the Doctor's TARDIS. The time machine's intelligence then briefly transfers itself into Data to escape the Borg's control, and the empowered Data overpowers the Borg and throws him out into the Time Vortex.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} redoubts {{were now}} in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> {{into the hands}} of the oncoming Russians. The battalions of the Ukraine Regiment under Colonel Dudnitsky-Lishin, attacked redoubts Nos.2 and 3, while the Odessa Regiment under Skyuderi advanced on redoubt No.4. The Ottoman forces in these positions, having already watched their compatriots flee the first redoubt and realizing that the British were not coming to their aid, retreated towards Balaclava, pursued by the Cossacks who had little trouble dispatching any stray or isolated men. The few British NCOs could do nothing but spike the guns, rendering them unusable. The Ottoman forces had gained some time for the Allies, but in the end the Turks were forced to abandon the redoubts. By 08:00 the Russians had occupied redoubts 1, 2 and 3, and, considering it too close to the enemy, had razed redoubt No.4.|$|E
25|$|Misses {{down the}} stretch by Tayshaun Prince and Rasheed Wallace kept the Pistons from beating the Sixers at their home floor as Andre Iguodala grabbed clutch {{defensive}} rebounds to seize home court advantage. The Pistons responded with a blowout in Game 2. Game 3 was close at halftime, but Samuel Dalembert and Andre Miller helped to break it open with strong overall performances. Detroit was behind by 10 in Game 4 at halftime and in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> behind 3–1 going back home, but three second-half 3s by Rasheed Wallace and strong showings by Tayshaun Prince and Chauncey Billups keyed an 18-point 3rd quarter turnaround which evened the series. Detroit dominated Game 5 behind Billups's 14 points and 5 first quarter assists, jumping out to a 14-point lead and never looking back. Richard Hamilton keyed a similar start in Game 6, scoring 13 points, as the Pistons took an 18-point first quarter lead and eventually rolled into the second round.|$|E
25|$|For the 2009 season, Menard {{moved over}} to the No. 98 Ford Fusion {{operated}} by Yates Racing. Menard showed limited improvement in 2009, running in the top 10 many times, only to later have problems. For example, he crashed at Las Vegas Motor Speedway while running very well, and {{was involved in a}} wreck with only 40 laps to go, while running 7th. These issues lead to the team being in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> out of the top 35 in points standings for much of the year. Menard's best finishes included two 13th-place finishes in the Aarons 499 at Talladega Superspeedway as well as the Samsung 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, and a 15th-place finish in the Southern 500. At the second Dover race, Menard started 10th and ran in the top 10 for most of the day, only to find his car tighten up {{near the end of the}} race and come home 19th. At the end of the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Menard was the only driver to not score a top 10 finish who ran all of the races. Menard ended up finishing 31st in the final point standings.|$|E
40|$|The {{information}} on emergencies and disasters of ships belonging to icebreakers and hovercrafts, destroying the ice analyzed {{from the point}} of view of the risks to use the results in the future design, is collected. The classification of emergency situations by the level of consequences is given. The frequency <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> in all studied cases and for the most severe cases is calculated. The coefficients of relative responsibility (ponderability) for each identified risk are defined and the generalized conditional risk is calculated. Based on these data the risk matrixes for the hovercrafts and icebreakers have been constructed, whose analysis shows inadmissible risks for the studied ships, and the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> into the "almost admissible risks" and "minor risks"...|$|R
50|$|In some countries, {{the use of}} {{shoulders}} {{is optional}} for cyclists, who may choose not {{to use it for}} reasons such as: it being too narrow, inviting dangerously close passes at high speed by motorists; it having a road surface unsuitable for cycling, as shoulders may not be intended for wheeled vehicles; and it putting the path of the cyclist in direct conflict with the paths of other road users, such as those turning across the shoulder. Generally, the usable width of the road begins where one can ride without increased <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> jolts or blowouts. A road may have a gravel shoulder, its edge may be covered with sand or trash and the pavement may be broken.|$|R
