5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like,</b> well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

25|$|I think no, it {{has been}} too long. If they {{would have made it}} to a million in like 2 months, then they would have had something. They even got {{sponsored}} by that gum factory. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it's three years later, forget it. I also felt that people signed numerous times on the petition so it is probably only like 150,000 people that actually signed it.|$|E
25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. I felt the rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E
500|$|All the {{expenses}} and labor {{had to be}} provided by the [...] Press. A huge truck with three to help was hired. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> people who, when {{they are to be}} executed, are made to dig their own graves first and are then shot and thrown in. We carried box after box of the literature.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after taking}} the oath of office, Truman spoke to reporters: [...] "Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now.

500|$|Twenty-five {{years after}} the assassination, Grant wrote that the events did not really sink in until after he had {{finished}} his work that day. [...] "Then I was stunned, disappointed and embarrassed that it had happened—especially in my home town. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> crawling under a log.

500|$|In {{regards to}} the outcome, Rosolie {{explained}} that the anaconda [...] " [...] my arm into a position where her force was fully on my exposed arm.

500|$|Bang {{started writing}} the novel in 1885 in Vienna, after remembering Skørping Station: [...] "It {{was in one}} of those windows behind the flowers that I saw her face, a face which I {{had not been able to}} erase from my memory for two years and which, as if a painter, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> drawing in soft, melancholic, almost blurry lines and using it as a kind of cover {{illustration}} for this book." ...|$|E
500|$|Jordan Young aka DJ Swivel mixed [...] "I Care" [...] at New York's KMA Studio. He told Sound on Sound, [...] "I didn’t {{really know}} I {{was going to}} mix 'I Care' until the last minute. Luckily, {{during the course of}} the album, I had a couple of days to myself and I mixed it just because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it, so the demo was already {{somewhat}} mixed, and B let me do the final mix also." ...|$|E
500|$|... 'To me {{the most}} {{important}} thing is the message he says in the beginning of the song,' she notes. 'Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.' <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a lot of people may not hear that message and a lot of people need to. It wasn't to be preachy. A lot of times people will hear songs that I write that are not the typical songs people look at as 'Mariah Carey songs.' ...|$|E

500|$|When {{comparing}} work on Batman Forever, Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, explained, [...] "It {{just felt}} like everything got a little soft the second time. On Batman Forever, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I was making a movie. The second time, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I was making a kid's toy commercial." [...] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable {{than the one he}} wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, [...] "Joel [...] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of {{set the tone for the}} film." [...] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from [...] "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy." [...] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.|$|E
500|$|It {{describes}} how I {{got into the}} business, verbatim. I did {{grow up in a}} small town, I wanted to get out, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> there was something... not better for me, but something different for me. I didn't feel like I fit in at school. Whether you are a DJ, or if you work with computers, or if you're a teacher, everyone has that point where they feel, 'I'm bored and this isn't what I wanted to do with my life.' ...|$|E
500|$|I {{was more}} {{concerned}} that [...] would feel that we did it. A lot of times producers or songwriters leak records because they feel {{if you put the}} song out there it would go [...] Usually a leak that far in advance of an album release puts the song in serious jeopardy of being excluded from the final track list. It was frustrating. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> you work hard to get in the studio to work with Beyoncé. [...] I was blessed... that song turned out [...] have nine lives.|$|E

500|$|As most of {{the main}} cast was not from the Orthodox community, Burshtein {{instructed}} them to attend {{all of the major}} events that take place within the film, including a wedding and a circumcision. Yaron commented, [...] " [...] it was so intense and [...] was crying and she was really in it and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> she was my sister because I'm going to be like her in a while. So it was really helpful to experience all these things and to see how it is and to feel a part of it actually." ...|$|E
500|$|Chesimard {{changed her}} name to Assata Olugbala Shakur in 1971. Assata is a West African name, derived from the Arabic name Aisha, said to mean [...] "she who struggles", while Shakur means [...] "thankful one" [...] in Arabic. Olugbala means “love for the people” in Yoruba. She now {{identified}} as an African and felt her old name no longer fit: “It sounded so strange when people called me Joanne. It really {{had nothing to do}} with me. I didn’t feel like no Joanne, or no negro, or no amerikan. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> an African woman”.|$|E
500|$|Rakim is {{credited}} with influencing rappers including the Wu-Tang Clan, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, and Nas, who cited Paid in Full {{as one of his}} favorite albums. 50 Cent told NME that Paid in Full was the first album he bought: [...] "I used to get my grandmother's tape recorder – the one she used to tape church services – and record hip-hop off the radio.
