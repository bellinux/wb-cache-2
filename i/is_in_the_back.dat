The engine <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> {{of the vehicle}} to the right (unlike most other IFVs, which have the engine located forward in the hull). As a result, the driver is seated forward in the hull (in the center) together with two infantrymen (one {{on each side of}} the driver). The vehicle has a double bottom and the engine is located under the floor of the vehicle (troops enter/leave the vehicle over the engine).

The first floor of the house is divided in two by a central passage, leading from a door in the northwest to a door in the southeast, with a staircase running up on the northeast side. On the northeast side of the central passage is the primary chamber (or bedroom) in the front, and the little parlor in the back. Between the primary chamber and the little parlor is a smaller passage, leading to a service staircase and a small, side stairway. The Gunston Hall Plantation official website says that on the southwest side of the house is a parlor in the front and a dining room in the back. However, the Historic American Buildings Survey says that on the southwest side of the house the dining room is in the front and a palladian room <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
500|$|Enemies {{are confronted}} on the overworld map and in dungeons through both random {{encounters}} and staged battles. Battles {{are governed by}} a turn-based system: the player's and enemy's parties each get a turn during which they can perform available actions. The player party is arranged in a three-by-two grid, with their positioning effecting how they can attack enemies: for instance, short-ranged attacks are made less effective if the selected party member <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> row. The player has access to multiple commands in battle: [...] "Sword", [...] "Gun", [...] "Magic" [...] and [...] "Extra". Items {{can also be used}} in battle, and the player can choose to escape from most encounters aside from key boss battles. An [...] "Auto" [...] option is also available, where the entire party is commanded using the game's artificial intelligence. At the end of each successful battle, experience points are distributed among party members depending on the strength of the enemy, and the protagonist is given Ability Points to assign to six different attributes which affect his performance in battle.|$|E

2500|$|The 2013 Stanley Cup {{run by the}} Bruins was {{one that}} further united the New England region that had been rocked by tragedies, such as the Boston Marathon bombing and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

It hit close to home, and the best way we felt we could try and cheer the area was to win a Stanley Cup. I think that's what's hard right now for the players. We had more reasons than just ourselves to win a Cup." ...|$|E

60|$|At Number Thirteen Rutherford Street, Soho, {{there is}} a stationer's shop. It is kept by one Mr. Yatman. He is a married man, but has no family. Besides Mr. and Mrs. Yatman, the other inmates in the house are a lodger, a young single man named Jay, who {{occupies}} the front room on the second floor--a shopman, who sleeps {{in one of the}} attics, and a servant-of-all-work, whose bed <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> kitchen. Once a week a charwoman comes to help this servant. These are all the persons who, on ordinary occasions, have means of access to the interior of the house, placed, as a matter of course, at their disposal. Mr. Yatman has been in business for many years, carrying on his affairs prosperously enough to realize a handsome independence for a person in his position. Unfortunately for himself, he endeavored {{to increase the amount of}} his property by speculating. He ventured boldly in his investments; luck went against him; and rather less than two years ago he found himself a poor man again. All that was saved out of the wreck of his property was the sum of two hundred pounds.|$|E
