40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{potential}} approaches to continuing education and training delivery for community pharmacists to equip them to support mental health consumers and carers with illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Design/methodology/approach - Review of national and international literature about community pharmacists' roles, beliefs and attitudes towards mental health, continuing education delivery for the workforce and training recommendations to equip pharmacy workforce. Findings - Training involving consumer educators was effective in reducing stigma and negative attitudes. Interactive and contextually relevant training appeared to be more effective than didactic strategies. Narratives and role-plays (from the perspective of consumers, carers and health professionals) are effective in promoting more positive attitudes and reduce stigma. <b>Flexible</b> on-line <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> with video footage of expert and consumer narratives were preferable for a cost-effective programme accessible to a wide community pharmacy workforce.

40|$|AbstractPost-secondary {{education}} is a massive industry undergoing significant growth. The demand for post-secondary education has never been higher, and it is increasing every year (British Council, 2012). Moreover, globalization and technology are transforming this marketplace in dramatic ways. In general, the higher education marketplace is becoming more open and dynamic as traditional geographic barriers are disappearing. These transformations are leading to increased levels of international outsourcing and partnerships to develop and deliver education. In addition, the global workplace itself is becoming more dynamic; specifically, the individual demand for ongoing high quality lifelong {{education is}} increasing as the nature of jobs and work skills continuously changes (Hanover Research Council, 2010). This increasingly open global marketplace for post-secondary education requires new innovative educational programming through <b>flexible</b> and innovative <b>delivery</b> <b>methods.</b> This {{is especially true in}} professional and applied fields such as engineering, business, management, and health administration. Educational leadership, in particular, could greatly benefit from more innovative programming, since the next generation of educational leaders need training and direct experiences in new educational delivery models, particularly for the quickly globalizing nature of post-secondary education, but eventually for leadership in the primary and secondary education sectors as well...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the extent to which {{learning}} styles influence tertiary students' preferences for flexible delivery and assessment methods in higher education. Design/methodology/approach – A voluntary self-administered questionnaire was distributed within three core undergraduate courses. A total of 891 students responded to the survey, across a range of locations, representing a response rate of approximately 45 per cent. Findings – Results reveal that learning styles do not appear to influence students level of preference overall for <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> and assessment approaches. However, there remain a significant percentage of students who report that they do not want all course delivery to be online. The findings generally suggest that there are changing expectations of students in relation to delivery and assessment in tertiary education.

In addition over 75 per cent of respondents fall within the Generation Y category, which means that these results may not be generalisable to older populations of learners.

40|$|Today many {{educators}} in the tertiary education environment face the dilemma of having to provide learning richness and a quality learning experience to growing numbers of students {{in an environment of}} reducing resources (Broad et al., 2000; Nunan et al., 2000; Bonk & Graham, 2006). These challenges are influenced a number of factors. Where resources are scarce tertiary education providers need to learn to use what is available to its full potential and to make wise investments by paying closer attention to how technology is used, introduced and managed (Buchan, 2008; Broad et al., 2000; Nunan et al., 2000; Bonk & Graham, 2006). The changes to funding arrangements; a decrease in government subsidies and the trends towards user-pays; pressures on universities to generate other sources of income; a rapid growth in the higher education export markets and changing student expectations are also seen as key factors impacting on the tertiary education environment (Scott et al. 2008). Further, ‘the massification and internationalisation of Australian tertiary education’ has meant that student diversity has increased, and therefore effective teaching requires the ability to manage diversity (Devlin & Samarawickrema, 2010). In order to engage students, teachers must have appropriate pedagogical responses to accommodate a variety of student learning styles and cultural and educational backgrounds (Devlin, 2007 c). While flexible course delivery methods have been in use for some time, increasingly we are seeing a move away from sole reliance on either traditional face-to-face or flexible teaching and assessment methods, towards {{an increase in the number}} of courses offered by hybrid flexible delivery which is a blend of face-to-face and <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> (Selim, 2010; Vaughan, 2010). As stated, effective teaching in tertiary education is linked to technological changes (Devlin, 2007 a). Teachers must continually learn new skills and familiarise themselves with new ways of interacting and communicating with students and be capable of teaching in ‘blended’ environments employing technologies and pedagogies suited to the context and student cohort (Benson & Samarawickrema, 2009). Garrison and Vaughan (2008) point out however, that research into many of these significant technological innovations and changes in delivery have been confined to addressing the issues of access and convenience, such as the relevance and suitability of the method, yet the quality of the learning experience has yet to be properly examined. Given the changes to the tertiary education environment this research aims to identify what is the relationship between hybrid flexible delivery and the level of critical engagement in tertiary education. There are many definitions of critical engagement but it is generally seen to be concerned with the extent students are engaging in a range of educational activities that research has shown as likely to lead to high quality outcomes (Coates, 2005). For the purpose of this research students’ perception of their learning engagement is being measured; that is their success in achieving ‘critical engagement’ as the learning outcome embedded in the unit design and required to achieve the specified unit learning outcomes. Student’s perception of their learning engagement is also measured by changes in their confidence levels in achieving the unit learning outcomes at pre-unit and post-unit. Students’ perception is also measured by the change in their level of agreement, at pre-unit and post-unit, regarding the degree the teaching and assessment methods used contribute to learning. Also students’ perception regarding the degree of change regarding whether the unit teaching and assessment methods assist in developing high level academic, critical reasoning skills and useful practical work-related skills is also measured. In summary this research focus is to explore: To what extent are students critically engaged by hybrid flexible delivery? What aspects of hybrid flexible delivery most affect the level of critical engagement? Does the level of critical engagement differ according to age, gender, first language, year of enrolment or the level of student prior achievement? This research involved a mixed-method longitudinal study of predominately international Master of Business Administration students enrolled in a Strategic Management unit. Respondents completed two questionnaires: one pre-unit and one post-unit. From this research it can be concluded that hybrid <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> can facilitate critical engagement but any unit offered by this method should include both practical and theoretical elements in its design. Teachers need to ensure that theory is relevant and useful to students and is used to challenge and extend ways of thinking. By embedding each level of Bloom’s Taxonomy a scaffolding approach to learning, within the learning outcomes can facilitate critical engagement in hybrid flexible delivery. It can be concluded from this research that the difference in confidence levels and the performance of students seems to impact on the level of critical engagement. The results suggest that the teacher’s presence, in developing a community of inquiry, and the use of case study workshops, provided support to construct meaning and confirm understanding of the key issues in this unit (Garrison et al., 2004). It appears important for the teacher to consider the whole unit and ‘weave through’ rather than ‘tack on’ hybrid flexible delivery approaches and adopt the constructivist approach to learning. It could also be concluded that there is a 8 relationship between the level of critical engagement and the teacher-student relationship. Generally need the opportunity to build a relationship with the teacher early in the learning experience to achieve critical engagement. The age of students is not a significant factor associated with the level of critical engagement in hybrid flexible delivery with the exception of older students who were more critically engaged than younger students. This study also found there was no significant difference in performance and the level of critical engagement by gender when hybrid <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> are used. Males had a higher level of confidence in achieving the learning outcomes than females, but this was not statistically significant. It could be concluded that although there are no significant differences to the level of critical engagement by gender, males may prefer learning experiences that require less collaboration and interaction. It is suggested that a mix of learning strategies to satisfy both males and female learning styles may assist critical engagement in hybrid flexible delivery (Biggs & Tang, 2007). The number of respondents limited reliable assessment of the role of language and prior student level of achievement in critical engagement. In a tertiary education environment which includes combinations of traditional face-to-face, flexible and hybrid <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>methods,</b> this research provides some reassurance that well designed hybrid flexible delivery programs can facilitate critical engagement. If teachers provide a greater emphasis on the correlations between learning outcomes, teaching and assessment methods and the levels of cognitive development, this can produce high levels of critical engagement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: The first aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relationships}} between the big five personality traits and approaches to learning in a sample of first-year psychology distance students. Approaches to learning are the intentions a student has when faced with a learning task. A deep approach reflects an intention to understand the material, a strategic approach reflects an intention to achieve the highest grades possible, and a surface approach reflects an intention to cope with the course requirements by memorising facts. Consistent with previous research of on-campus students, the Intellect trait predicted the deep learning approach; the Conscientiousness trait predicted the strategic learning approach; and the Emotional Stability trait negatively predicted the surface learning approach. The second {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether approaches to learning predict academic success, as measured by grade point average. As expected, the surface learning approach negatively predicted achievement. However, contrary to expectations, neither the deep nor the strategic learning approach predicted academic success. This finding may partly be explained by these first-year distance students undergoing a transition to the expectations and requirements of their flexible learning environments. Further research is warranted to establish whether the deep and strategic learning approaches become more likely to predict academic success in the latter years of study, after distance students have adapted to the <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>methods.</b> To this end, a longitudinal study that tracks the academic performance of these students until they complete their degrees or leave the university is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Government {{policy in}} Australia is {{increasingly}} encouraging training organisations in the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector to adopt <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> approaches. This policy shift {{is supported by}} key VET stakeholders including Industry Training Advisory Boards. A recurring theme in VET policy documents is an apparent confidence that <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> can meet the diverse needs of individual learners {{while at the same}} time providing cost savings. Yet evidence is emerging that Australian VET learners are not typically ready for <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery,</b> and this lack of readiness is reflected in high attrition rates and low pass rates in many flexibly delivered courses. One research project found that over 70 % of learners in the Australian VET sector do not have the learning capabilities required to be ready for <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery.</b> A recent review of the module outcomes achieved by VET students nationally found that students studying by external/correspondence and self-paced unscheduled modes had lower module completion rates than students studying by other delivery strategies. Research on student progress in <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> within the Australian VET sector has largely been quantitative. That research provides useful statistical data on completion and attrition rates for various modes of delivery, but does not explore the reasons underlying the high attrition rates found in <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery.</b> The qualitative research that is available tends to focus on students who successfully complete their courses, not on those who withdraw. As a result, the Australian literature on <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> in the VET sector is lacking in-depth qualitative information about students who enrol in courses but do not complete. In comparison, the broader literature on distance education and <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> in other educational sectors offers some useful insights into student attrition, and can be can be used to inform research into attrition within the Australian VET sector. This paper reports on aspects of a research project that followed up six adult learners who enrolled in VET courses but who either failed assessment or withdrew. The research project presented the students’ stories in the form of narrative case studies, focussing on the detailed examination of the barriers that each student experienced, and analysing these barriers in relation to issues raised in the literature. This paper reports on two particular themes that emerged from that research project. The literature on distance education and <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> argues that: · student dropout is often not determined by a single factor, but by the interaction of a number of factors that build up over time; · students who experience difficulties when studying by <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> can often be reluctant to access the support that is available to them. This paper uses these themes as a point of reference in presenting the stories of some of the students who participated in the research project. </div...|$|R

These security issues have been moved into a state of flux with the use of <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>methods.</b> Students may now be scattered from one side of the globe to the other. Is it realistic to require foreign students to attend examinations at the Institution originating the course, or even to attend authorised examination centres within their country of residence? Is it even feasible to establish authorised examination centres at all locations where students may possibly study? With computer assisted assessment, conducted on-line, it is now possible for students to participate in assessment tasks and examinations from any location on the planet. However, how do we authenticate and invigilate these assessment processes? Is it the actual candidate, sitting the exam or participating in the assessment? How can we ensure that the person sitting at the computer is in fact the intended student? This paper examines the emerging new media communication hybrid technologies and devices, including authentication and cryptographic technologies, and highlights how these may be effective for the facilitation of Authenticated Secure On-line Computer Assisted Assessment (ASOCAA). These authentication and security methods will empower educators to construct more flexible assessment environments, where all participants (both faculty and students), can be assured that the assessment process is secure and authentic. This in turn will provide a richer learning experience for students undertaking flexible and distance learning...|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises {{the major}} {{findings}} {{from a series}} of qualitative and quantitative research projects conducted by WestOne and the Western Australian Department of Training during 2001 and 2002. These research projects examined student preferences for various delivery strategies. Of particular interest was the strength of the overall demand for <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> and differences in delivery preferences among segments of the student population (defined on the basis of primary motivation for training). The research also looked at the relationship between quality of learning, quality of teaching and delivery strategies. The research has shown that the experience of the majority of vocational education and training (VET) students is dominated by face-to-face teaching and, on the whole, they are fairly satisfied with this traditional and familiar method of delivery. However, there are signs that flexible delivery options are important and valued by certain segments of the student population (eg “career changers”, “skill improvers ” and the “self-employed”). There are also signs that demand will build in the future as students have more experience with a range of delivery options. Furthermore, experience with alternative delivery methods appears to be associated with higher quality of learning scores, which reflect personal empowerment and confidence in one’s ability to learn. “…if you don’t know who the learners are – their concerns, their ambitions, their background – how can you know if you’re making a difference for them… ” (ANTA, 2002, p 4). “We still seem to be making choices about what to offer flexibly based on ‘what is available’, ‘what is easy ’ or ‘who is available to deliver ’ – not based on learners ’ needs. ” (Manager, TAFE College, survey response, 2002). “[We need] proper, comprehensive research into student needs/wants BEFORE development of resources. My students tell me flexible, off-campus learning is a last resort if they can’t access suitabl...|$|E
40|$|Government {{policy in}} Australia is {{increasingly}} encouraging training organisations in the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector to adopt <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> approaches, but some researchers are sounding {{a note of}} caution. Evidence is emerging that Australian VET learners are not universally ready for <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery,</b> and this is reflected in high attrition rates and low pass rates. The literature on <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> identifies a number of specific factors that can impact {{on the success of}} adult learners. However, there seems to be agreement that failure or dropout is not determined by a single factor, but by the interaction of a number of factors that build up over time. To understand these factors, we need to understand the learners - what their participation in education means to them, the context in which they are studying, and the numerous inter-connected factors that contribute to their failure to achieve a successful outcome. This paper discusses four case studies from a research project that followed up a small number of adult learners who enrolled in <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> VET courses but did not achieve a successful outcome. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this paper is still in progress. The paper takes a critical stance {{on the development of}} instructional materials and methodologies to support <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery,</b> and argues that quality client centred <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> requires data to be generated on the learning preferences and context of learners in the workplace. Early research data indicates that there can be some confidence in the development of training materials and methodologies that are based on client learning preferences. Learning Preferences and the Construction of Knowledge Although there has been widespread acknowledgment in Australia and overseas that <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> has a major contribution to make to education and training, Sadler-Smith (1996) has been able to accurately observe that the designers of instructional materials to support <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> still assume that learners are “by and large uniform ” (p 185). The same comment was made earlier by Riding, Buckle, Thompson and Hagger (1989, p. 393) when they wrote “In designing training materials there is often the assumption that all trainees learn in a similar manner”. Additionally, Mitchell and Bluer (1997), in an Australia wide study of the use of new technologies observed, somewhat depressingly...|$|R
40|$|Patricia Hyde, Berwyn Clayton and Robin Booth {{survey the}} {{diversity}} of <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> and assessment arrangements across the Australian vocational education and training (VET) sector. They show that while assessment practice in <b>flexible</b> <b>delivery</b> is underpinned by training packages and course curriculum factors, other issues influence the assessment methods that teachers and assessors choose. These include providing qualified workplace assessors, ascertaining {{the location of the}} student, ensuring the authenticity of student evidence, and involving the learner and workplace in the assessment process...|$|R
