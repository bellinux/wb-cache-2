As a result the calculation methodology for problems of the strong interaction of gas with bodies of the strong modification of geometry on curvilinear finite-difference nets of various topology has been created. The effective method and algorithm for the solution of problems of the strong interaction of gas with a soft envelope in subsonic and supersonic flows of gas have been also created. The process of the strong interaction of gas with a soft envelope with big form modifications and transitions of a stream-lined construction {{in a wide range}} of speeds of a climbing flow has been investigated numerically for the first time. The new program complex for the solution of a wide class of interaction problems has been created. The paper results have been introduced into operation.

A tower that sat on top of the capsule would contain a docking tunnel as well as the capsule's rocket engines, again similar to the Apollo configuration.

50|$|It is a {{drop test}} vehicle {{constructed}} for the European Space Agency intended {{to test the}} atmospheric <b>deceleration</b> <b>parachutes</b> for the ExoMars EDM lander module. It has the same weight and parachute deployment systems present on the ESA module. The DTV {{is intended to be}} lifted to an altitude of 24 km by a stratospheric helium ballon, from where it will fall freely reaching a dynamic pressure similar to that encountered by the ExoMars EDM at entry into the Mars atmosphere. At that dynamic pressure the parachute will deploy and the module will land on the Black Sea surface and will be recovered by the Romanian Naval Forces.|$|R
50|$|It is {{intended}} to be used to help a spacecraft decelerate before landing on Mars. This is done by inflating the balloon around the vehicle to increase the surface area and create atmospheric drag.

40|$|Parachute {{systems can}} be used to control the reentry {{trajectory}} of launcher upper stages, in order to lower the risks to the population or facilitate the retrieval of the stage. Several types of parachutes deployed at subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic speeds are analyzed, modeled as single and multistage systems. The performance of <b>deceleration</b> <b>parachutes</b> depends on their drag area and deployment conditions, while gliding parachutes are configured to achieve stable flight with a high glide ratio. Gliding parachutes can be autonomously guided to a low risk landing area. Sizing the canopy is shown to be an effective method to reduce parachute sensitivity to wind. The reentry trajectory of a launcher upper stage is simulated for each parachute system configuration and the results are compared to the nominal reentry case...|$|R
50|$|The sample return capsule entered Earth's {{atmosphere}} over northern Oregon at 16:55 UTC September 8, 2004, with a {{velocity of}} approximately 11.04 km/s (24,706 mph). Due to a design flaw in a <b>deceleration</b> sensor, <b>parachute</b> deployment was never triggered, and the spacecraft's descent was slowed only {{by its own}} air resistance. The planned mid-air retrieval could not be carried out, and the capsule crashed into the desert floor of the Dugway Proving Ground in Tooele County, Utah, at about 86 metres per second (311 km/h).|$|R
40|$|The multibody {{analysis}} of the system formed by an entry vehicle and a parachute {{is the subject of}} the present paper. In particular, two different models of the system made of bridles (connecting the vehicle to the suspension point) and riser (connecting the suspension point to the suspension lines of the parachute) are considered. This allows one to highlight if and how the simplifying assumptions at the basis of many techniques adopted for sizing the suspension system are reasonable and if they affect the most important factors that characterize the final phase of an entry trajectory, such as peak load and maximum <b>deceleration</b> at <b>parachute</b> inflation and landing site dispersion footprint.

After the war he resumed his work on geomagnetism, developing the theory of induction in thin sheets.|$|R
40|$|For {{planetary}} lander missions, {{the most}} challenging phase of the spacecraft to ground communications is during the entry, descent, and landing (EDL). As each 2003 Mars Exploration Rover (MER) enters the Martian atmosphere, it slows dramatically. The extreme acceleration and jerk cause extreme Doppler dynamics on the X-band signal received on Earth. When the vehicle slows sufficiently, the parachute is deployed, causing almost a step in <b>deceleration.</b> After <b>parachute</b> deployment, the lander is lowered beneath the parachute on a bridle. The swinging motion of the lander imparts high Doppler dynamics on the signal and causes the received signal strength to vary widely, due to changing antenna pointing angles. All this time, the vehicle transmits important health and status information that is especially critical if the landing is not successful. Even using the largest Deep Space Network antennas, the weak signal and high dynamics render it impossible to conduct reliable phase coherent communications. Therefore, a specialized form of frequency-shift-keying will be used. This paper describes the EDL scenario, the signal conditions, the methods used to detect and frequency-track the carrier and to detect the data modulation, and the resulting performance estimates...|$|R
40|$|During final {{approach}} and entry, descent, and landing (EDL), the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Navigation team was tasked with the real-time detection based on one-way Doppler {{data of the}} following events for MER-A and MER-B: transition from the cruise stage medium-gain antenna to the cruise stage low-gain antenna, turn-to-entry attitude, venting of the heat rejection system (HRS), cruise stage separation, atmospheric <b>deceleration,</b> and <b>parachute</b> deployment. In addition, {{an attempt was made}} to ascertain, in near real-time, the relative average density of the atmosphere with respect to the nominal predicted density. Detection of each event from the Doppler data was complicated by several factors, including oscillator instability, acceleration, temperature changes caused by cycling of the HRS thermal valve, pressure effects, and Allan variance. These factors resulted in signatures that could not be modeled predictively. Nonetheless, an understanding of the expected Doppler signatures and the distinct Doppler pattern caused by each event enabled their real-time detection. In particular, comparisons between the pre-arrival predicted Doppler signature and the actual signature for each event are described and differences are explained. Finally, the process used to rapidly reconstruct the EDL trajectory and estimat...|$|R
40|$|Solar Montgolfiere {{balloons}}, or solar-heated hot air balloons {{have been}} evaluated by use on Mars for about 5 years. In the past, JPL has developed thermal models that have been confirmed, as well as developed altitude control systems to allow the balloons to float over the landscape or carry ground sampling instrumentation. Pioneer Astronautics has developed and tested a landing system for Montgolfieres. JPL, together with GSSL. have successfully deployed small Montgolfieres (< 15 -m diameter) in the earth's stratosphere, where conditions are similar to a Mars deployment. Two larger Montgolfieres failed, however, {{and a series of}} larger scale Montgolfieres is now planned using stronger, more uniform polyethylene bilaminate, combined with stress-reducing ripstitch and reduced <b>parachute</b> <b>deceleration</b> velocities.

40|$|During the Orion spacecraftâ€™s return, {{at higher}} altitudes drogue {{parachute}}s {{will be used}} for <b>deceleration.</b> These <b>parachutes</b> are made of ribbons and have 24 gores, with 52 ribbons in each gore, where a gore is the slice of the parachute between two radial reinforcement cables extending from the parachute apex to the skirt. There are hundreds of gaps that the flow goes through, and there are also three wider gaps created by removing ribbons. Computational analysis can help reduce the number of costly drop tests in comprehensive evaluation of the parachute performance. Reliable analysis requires accurate computation of the parachute fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between the drogue and the compressible flow it is subjected to. The FSI computation is challenging because of the geometric and flow complexities and requires first creation of a starting parachute shape and flow field. This is a process that by itself is rather challenging, {{and that is what we}} are focusing on here. In our structural and fluid mechanics computations, for spatial discretization, we use isogeometric discretization with quadratic NURBS basis functions. This gives us a parachute shape that is smoother than what we get from a typical finite element discretization. In the flow analysis, we use the NURBS basis functions in the context of the compressible-flow Space-Time SUPG (ST SUPG) method. The combination of the ST framework, NURBS basis functions, and the SUPG stabilization assures superior computational accuracy...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{estimates}} of the mass and performance characteristics of entry system designs for advanced Mars missions is presented. The missions were: (1) a Mars Surface Sample Return Mission (MSSR), (2) a Mars Hard Lander, and (3) a Mars Aircraft Mission, and Viking technology or its extensions were used for these entry system conceptual designs. For the MSSR mission, various mission combinations were evaluated including different Mars Ascent Vehicle masses {{and the use of}} 2 through 4 stages of the IUS launch vehicle. The constraints for this Mars mission were the Shuttle payload bay geometry limitation and its massive requirements. Requirements for the simple Hard Lander Mission including entry and <b>deceleration,</b> using a <b>parachute</b> and a solid rocket are discussed. A design requirement for the Mars Aircraft Mission to minimize the total entry capsule/aircraft mass by combining entry functions and hardware into the aircraft system was described, and various approaches for supporting the folded aircraft within the aeroshell were examined...|$|R
40|$|In 2005, the Congressional NASA Authorization Act {{enacted a}} new space {{exploration}} program, the "Vision for Space Exploratien". The Constellation Program {{was formed to}} oversee the implementation of this new mission. With an intent not simply to support the International Space Station, but to build a permanent outpost on the Moon and then travel on to explore ever more distant terrains, the Constellation Program is supervising {{the development of a}} brand new fleet of launch vehicles, the Ares. The Ares lineup will include two new launch vehicles: the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle and the Ares V Cargo Launch Vehicle. A crew exploration vehicle, Orion, will be launched on the Ares I. It will be capable of docking with the Space Station, the lunar lander, Altair, and the Earth Departure Stage of Ares V. The Ares V will be capable of lifting both large-scale hardware and the Altair into space. The Ares First Stage Team is tasked with developing the propulsion system necessary to liftoff from the Earth and loft the entire Ares vehicle stack toward low Earth orbit. The Ares I First Stage booster is a 12 -foot diameter, five-segment, reusable solid rocket booster derived from the Space Shuttle's four segment reusable solid rocket booster (SRB). It is separated from the Upper Stage {{through the use of a}} Deceleration Subsystem (DSS). Booster Tumble Motors are used to induce the pitch tumble following separation from the Upper Stage. The spent Ares I booster must be recoverable using a <b>parachute</b> <b>deceleration</b> system similar to that of the Shuttle SRB heritage system. Since Ares I is much heavier and reenters the Earth's atmosphere from a higher altitude at a much higher velocity than the SRB, all of the parachutes must be redesigned to reliably meet the operational requisites of the new launch vehicles. This paper presents an overview of this new booster deceleration system. It includes comprehensive detail of the <b>parachute</b> <b>deceleration</b> system, its design and deployment sequences, including how and why it is being developed, the requirements it must meet, and the testing involved in its implementation...|$|R

The parachute deployment was initiated by the firing of a mortar at a Mach number of 1. 39 and a dynamic pressure of 11. 0 lb/ft(exp 2) (527 newtons/m(exp 2)) at an altitude of 122, 500 feet (37. 3 kilometers). The parachute deployed to suspension-line stretch (snatch force) in 0. 35 second, and 0. 12 second later the drag force increase associated with parachute inflation began. The parachute inflated in 0. 24 second to the full-open condition for a total elapsed opening time of 0. 71 second. The maximum opening load of 3970 pounds (17, 700 newtons) came at the time the parachute was just fully opened.

40|$|The {{origins of}} the lifting-body idea are {{traced back to the}} mid- 1950 's, when the concept of a manned {{satellite}} reentering the Earth's atmosphere {{in the form of a}} wingless lifting body was first proposed. The advantages of low reentry deceleration loads, range capability, and horizontal landing of a lifting reentry vehicle (as compared with the high <b>deceleration</b> loads and <b>parachute</b> landing of a capsule) are presented. The evolution of the hypersonic HL- 10 lifting body is reviewed from the theoretical design and development process to its selection as one of two low-speed flight vehicles for fabrication and piloted flight testing. The design, development, and flight testing of the low-speed, air-launched, rocket-powered HL- 10 was part of an unprecedented NASA and contractor effort. NASA Langley Research Center conceived and developed the vehicle shape and conducted numerous theoretical, experimental, and wind-tunnel studies. NASA Flight Research Center (now NASA Dryden Flight Research Center) was responsible for final low-speed (Mach numbers less than 2. 0) aerodynamic analysis, piloted simulation, control law development, and flight tests. The prime contractor, Northrop Corp., was responsible for hardware design, fabrication, and integration. Interesting and unusual events in the flight testing are presented with a review of significant problems encountered in the first flight and how they were solved. Impressions by the pilots who flew the HL- 10 are included. The HL- 10 completed a successful 37 -flight program, achieved the highest Mach number and altitude of this class vehicle, and contributed to the technology base used to develop the space shuttle and future generations of lifting bodies...|$|R
40|$|The Orion Pad Abort 1 (PA- 1) {{flight test}} was {{designed}} as an early demonstration of the Launch Abort System (LAS) for the Orion capsule. The LAS was designed developed and manufactured by the Lockheed Martin/Orbital Sciences team. At inception it was realized that recovery of the Orion Capsule simulator would be useful from an engineering analysis and data recovery point of view. Additionally this test represented a flight opportunity for the Orion parachute system, which in a real abort would provide final landing <b>deceleration.</b> The Orion <b>parachute</b> program is named CPAS (CEV Parachute Assembly System). Thus CPAS {{became a part of}} the PA- 1 flight, as a secondary test objective. At program kick off, the CPAS system was in the design state described below. Airbag land landing of the spacecraft was the program baseline. This affected the rigging of the parachutes. The system entry deployment conditions and vehicle mass have both evolved since that original design. It was decided to use the baseline CPAS Generation 1 (Gen 1) parachute system for the recovery of the PA- 1 flight. As CPAS was a secondary test objective, the system would be delivered in its developmental state. As the PA- 1 program evolved, the parachute recovery system (CPAS) moved from a secondary objective to a more important portion of the program. Tests were added, weights and deployment conditions changed and some hardware portions of the CPAS configuration were not up to the new challenges. Additional tests were added to provide confidence in the developmental system. This paper will review a few of these aspects with the goal of showing some preliminary and qualitative results from what we believe was a highly successful test...|$|R
40|$|At higher altitudes, {{prior to}} the {{deployment}} of the main parachutes, the Orion spacecraft descent to Earth will rely on <b>deceleration</b> by drogue <b>parachutes.</b> These parachutes have a ribbon construction, and in fluidâ€“structure interaction (FSI) modeling this creates geometric and flow complexities comparable to those encountered in FSI modeling of the main parachutes, which have a ringsail construction. The drogue parachutes {{to be used with}} the Orion spacecraft have 24 gores, with 52 ribbons in each gore, resulting in hundreds of gaps that the flow goes through. We address this computational challenge, as was done for the main parachutes, with the Homogenized Modeling of Geometric Porosity (HMGP). Like the main parachutes, the drogue parachutes will be used in multiple stages, starting with a "reefed" stage where a cable along the parachute skirt constrains the diameter to be less than the diameter in the subsequent stage. After {{a certain period of time}} during the descent, the cable is cut and the parachute "disreefs" (i. e. expands) to the next stage. Computing the parachute shape at the reefed stage and FSI modeling during the disreefing involve computational challenges beyond those in FSI modeling of fully-open drogue parachutes. Orion spacecraft drogue parachutes will have three stages, with FSI modeling of disreefing from Stage 1 to Stage 2 being somewhat more challenging than disreefing from Stage 2 to Stage 3. We present the special modeling techniques we devised to address the computational challenges and the results from the computations carried out. We also present the methods we devised to calculate for a parachute gore the radius of curvature in the circumferential direction. The curvature values are intended for quick and simple engineering analysis in estimating the structural stresses. The flight envelope of the Orion drogue parachutes includes regions where the Mach number is high enough to require a compressible-flow solver. We present some preliminary computations for such cases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a set of}} four Earth atmosphere flight test experiments on prototype helium superpressure balloons designed for Mars. Three of the experiments explored the problem of aerial deployment and inflation, using the cold, low density environment of the Earthâ€™s stratosphere {{at an altitude of}} 30 - 32 km as a proxy for the Martian atmosphere. Auxiliary carrier balloons were used in three of these test flights to lift the Mars balloon prototype and its supporting system from the ground to the stratosphere where the experiment was conducted. In each case, deployment and helium inflation was initiated after starting a parachute descent of the payload at 5 Pa dynamic pressure, thereby mimicking the conditions expected at Mars after atmospheric entry and high speed <b>parachute</b> <b>deceleration.</b> Upward and downward looking video cameras provided real time images from the flights, with additional data provided by onboard temperature, pressure and GPS sensors. One test of a 660 m 3 pumpkin balloon was highly successful, achieving deployment, inflation and separation of the balloon from the flight train at the end of inflation; however, some damage was incurred on the balloon during this process. Two flight tests of 12 m diameter spherical Mylar balloons were not successful, although some lessons were learned based on the failure analyses. The final flight experiment consisted of a ground-launched 12 m diameter spherical Mylar balloon that ascended to the designed 30. 3 km altitude and successfully floated for 9. 5 hours through full noontime daylight and into darkness, after which the telemetry system ran out of electrical power and tracking was lost. The altitude excursions for this last flight were Â± 75 m peak to peak, indicating that the balloon was essentially leak free and functioning correctly. This provides substantial confidence that this balloon design will fly for days or weeks at Mars if it can be deployed and inflated without damage...|$|R
