25|$|Famous {{individuals}} have sometimes been diagnosed, albeit at a distance, as psychopaths. As one example {{out of many}} possible from history, in a 1972 version of a secret report originally prepared for the Office of Strategic Services in 1943, and {{which may have been}} intended to be used as propaganda, non-medical psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer suggested Adolf Hitler was probably a psychopath. However, others have not drawn this conclusion; clinical <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologist</b> Glenn Walters argues that Hitler's actions do not warrant a diagnosis of psychopathy as, although he showed several characteristics of criminality, he was not always egocentric, callously disregarding of feelings or lacking impulse control, and there is no proof he could not learn from mistakes.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. There {{has been}} an {{explosion}} of interest in therapeutic jurisprudence as both a filter and lens for viewing {{the extent to which}} the legal system serves therapeutic or anti-therapeutic consequences. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of therapeutic jurisprudence on questions of international human rights law and the role of <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists.</b> The paper aims to provide an intersection between human rights, therapeutic jurisprudence, and forensic psychology. Method. Human rights are based on legal, social, and moral rules. Human rights literature generally considers legal rights but such policy statements do not provide principles to guide <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> in addressing moral or social rights. Therefore, a framework to guide <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> is required. Conclusion. As duty-bearers, <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> need to address the core values of freedom and well-being in rights holders (in this instance, prisoners and detainees with a mental illness). The paper proposes that human rights principles can add to the normative base of a therapeutic jurisprudence framework, and in-turn, therapeutic jurisprudence can assist <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> to actively address human rights. <br /...|$|R

25|$|The {{research}} study that Dr. Kupferberg introduces to Dr. Melfi, which she later carefully reads and which makes her decide to finally drop Tony Soprano as her patient, is an actual three-volume study called The Criminal Personality, written by Dr. Samuel Yochelson and Dr. Stanton Samenow, published between 1977 and 1986. David Chase discovered the study {{when he and}} some Sopranos writers attended a psychiatric conference. Chase further asked <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologist</b> Nancy Duggan to analyze Tony Soprano's mental state and the progress of his psychotherapy with Melfi; Dugan also opined that talk therapy was enabling Melfi's patient to commit crime and justify his actions for himself. The Criminal Personality greatly impressed Chase after he read it and he decided that its introduction in the show would spell the end of Tony and Melfi's psychotherapy story arc in the series. After the airing of the episode, psychotherapists reported an outpouring of questions and concern from their clientele about the ethics of dropping patients unilaterally. Chase also commented about the seeming lack of finality in Tony Soprano's therapy, stating that its depiction was most realistic as psychotherapy most often is marked with moments of progress but is essentially an endless process until one party decides it has had enough of it.|$|E

40|$|Assessing victim’s {{credibility}} is essential but very complex when physical evidence is lacking. The dual query of evaluating victim’s credibility and sequels and unclear mandates increase the confusion. Similarly, {{the use of}} the controversial term “credibility” illustrates the different expectations of the various protagonists involved in the judicial process. The conditions of evaluation and the limitations of available methods and assessment tools make this task difficult for the <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists.</b> In this context, our exploratory study aimed to understand how <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> actually performed their task. In 2007, we interviewed 11 <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> with a questionnaire on their training, their practice, their use of the different methods of assessment, their understanding of the concept of credibility, their perception of their role and the content of their forensic report. Different practices were observed, although a majority of <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> used the Statement Validity Analysis (SVA) and seemed to use the assessment tools within the limits of their duties.

Bundy attended Temple University from January through May, 1969 and apparently did not move west until after Memorial Day weekend. While Bundy's accounts of his earliest crimes varied considerably between interviews, he told <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologist</b> Art Norman that his first murder victims were two women in the Philadelphia area. Biographer Richard Larsen believed that Bundy committed the murders using his feigned-injury ruse, based on an investigator's interview with Julia, Bundy's aunt: Ted, she said, was wearing a leg cast due to an automobile accident on the weekend of the homicides, and therefore could not have traveled from Philadelphia to the Jersey Shore; there is no official record of any such accident.

500|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>psychologist</b> Eric Cullen {{and prison}} {{governor}} Tim Newell claim that prisoners face a throffer {{once they are}} told that they must acknowledge their guilt before they are offered parole or moved to an open prison. Cullen and Newell cite {{the example of a}} prisoner who falsely admitted guilt to move to an open prison; once there, however, he felt he could no longer lie about his guilt, and confessed to the prison's governor. He was subsequently transferred back to a maximum security prison. In the case of sex offenders, a throffer is presented when they are offered release if they take up treatment, but are threatened with extended sentences if they do not. Cullen and Newell are concerned about the predicament that these throffers present to prisoners, including those found innocent on appeal. Concerns surrounding throffers proposed to convicted sex offenders have also been discussed in print by Alex Alexandrowicz, himself wrongly imprisoned, and criminologist David Wilson. The latter observed the difficulties for those innocent people wrongly imprisoned who are faced with the throffer of having their sentence shortened if they [...] "acknowledge their guilt", but noted that, as perspectives of prisoners were rarely considered, the problem is usually not visible.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he refused}} to work with Ashworth's psychiatrists, Brady {{occasionally}} corresponded with people outside the hospital, including Lord Longford, writer Colin Wilson and various journalists. In one letter, written in 2005, he claimed that the murders were [...] "merely an existential exercise of just over a year, which was concluded in December 1964". By then, {{he went on to}} claim, he and Hindley had turned their attention to armed robbery, for which they had begun to prepare by acquiring guns and vehicles. During several years of interactions with <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologist</b> Chris Cowley, including face-to-face meetings, Brady told him of an [...] "aesthetic fascination [...] with guns", despite his never having used one to kill. He complained bitterly about conditions at Ashworth, which he hated. In 1999, his right wrist was broken in what he claimed was an [...] "hour-long, unprovoked attack" [...] by staff. Brady subsequently went on hunger strike, but while English law allows patients to refuse treatment, those being treated for mental disorders under the Mental Health Act 1983 have no such right if the treatment is for their mental disorder. He was therefore force-fed and transferred to another hospital for tests, after he fell ill. He recovered, and in March 2000 asked for a judicial review of the legality of the decision to force-feed him, but was refused permission.|$|E

In November 2008, <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologist</b> Leslie Powers reported that Siddiqui had been [...] "reluctant to allow medical staff to treat her". Her last medical exam had indicated her external wounds no longer required medical dressing and were healing well. A psychiatrist employed by the prosecutor to examine Siddiqui's competence to stand trial, Gregory B. Saathoff, noted in a March 2009 report that Siddiqui frequently verbally and physically refused to allow the medical staff to check her vital signs and weight, attempted to refuse medical care once {{it was apparent that}} her wound had largely healed, and refused to take antibiotics. At the same time, Siddiqui claimed to her brother that when she needed medical treatment she did not get it, which Saathoff said he found no support for in his review of documents and interviews with medical and security personnel, nor in his interviews with Siddiqui.|$|E
40|$|Community {{protection}} from offenders is addressed through punishment, deterrence, incapacitation, and/or rehabilitation. The current {{public policy debate}} about community protection refers to community rights as opposed to offender rights as if the two are mutually exclusive. However, in this article it will be argued that offender rehabilitation can enhance community protection if it addresses community rights and offender rights. The author proposes a normative framework to guide <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> in offender rehabilitation. The normative framework considers psychological theory—the risk-need model to address community rights and the good lives model to address offender rights. However, <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> operate {{within the context of}} the criminal justice system and so legal theory will also be considered. Therapeutic jurisprudence can balance community rights and offender rights within a human rights perspective. The proposed normative framework guides <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> in the assessment of risk, the treatment of need, and the management of readiness in balancing community rights and offender rights. Within a human rights perspective, <b>forensic</b> <b>psychologists</b> have a duty to provide offenders with the opportunity to make autonomous decisions about whether to accept or reject rehabilitation. <br /...|$|R
