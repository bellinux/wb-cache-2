In contrast to an <b>intervener</b> however, a person filing observations during opposition proceedings does not become party to the proceedings. This notably means that such person does not acquire the [...] "bundle of procedural rights" [...] created [...] "in respect of the opponent", such as the right to be heard before any decision is taken. Observations by third parties, which must be filed in writing, may be filed by post or online. According to Board of Appeal 3.3.08, the observations have to be signed [...] "in order to allow an identification of the third party" [...] and, unless [...] "adopted by a party to the proceedings as its own" [...] or by the competent organ of the EPO of its own motion, [...] "anonymous third party observations are to be disregarded altogether." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Interveners</b> make {{submissions}} {{in about}} half of the cases heard by the Supreme Court of Canada, but the motivations for and consequences of the practice are not clearly understood. Considered broadly, {{there are at least three}} functions that the practice of intervention might perform. The first possibility is that hearing from <b>interveners</b> might provide objectively useful information to the Court (i. e., <b>interveners</b> might promote the 2 ̆ 2 accuracy 2 ̆ 2 of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision making). A second possibility is that the practice of intervention allows <b>interveners</b> to provide the 2 ̆ 2 best argument 2 ̆ 2 for certain partisan interests that judges might want to 2 ̆ 2 affiliate 2 ̆ 2 with. A third possibility is that interventions are allowed mainly (if not only) so that intervening parties feel they have had their voices heard by the Court and the greater public, including Parliament, regardless of the effect on the outcome of the appeal (i. e., the Court might be promoting the 2 ̆ 2 acceptability 2 ̆ 2 of its decisions by allowing for an outlet for expression). We examine empirically the role of <b>interveners</b> in all the cases decided by the Supreme Court of Canada from January 2000 to July 2009 and find statistical evidence that <b>interveners</b> matter...|$|R
40|$|Behavioral {{studies of}} {{sentence}} comprehension suggest that processing long-distance dependencies {{is subject to}} interference effects when Noun Phrases (NP) similar to the dependency head intervene in the dependency. Neuroimaging studies converge in localizing such effects to Broca's area, showing that activity in Broca's area increases {{with the number of}} NP <b>interveners</b> crossed by a moved NP of the same type. To test if NP interference effects are modulated by adding an intervening clause boundary, which should by hypothesis increase the number of successive-cyclic movements, we conducted an fMRI study contrasting NP <b>interveners</b> with clausal (CP) <b>interveners.</b> Our design thus had two components: (I) the number of NP <b>interveners</b> crossed by movement was parametrically modulated; (II) CP-intervention was contrasted with NP-intervention. The number of NP <b>interveners</b> parametrically modulated a cluster straddling left BA 44 / 45 of Broca's area, replicating earlier studies. Adding an intervening clause boundary did not significantly modulate the size of the NP interference effect in Broca's area. Yet, such an interaction effect was observed in the Superior Frontal Gyrus (SFG). Therefore, the involvement of Broca's area in processing syntactic movement is best captured by memory mechanisms affected by a grammatically instantiated type-identity (i. e., NP) intervention...|$|R

50|$|According to the model, {{to promote}} a shift in needs, an <b>intervener</b> communicatively {{increases}} attention to how current needs are not being met or how needs expectancies are unfulfilled. Then the <b>intervener</b> advocates an alternative interpretation of needs and shows how it makes better sense {{of experience in the}} attempt to increase others' openness to this needs proposal. To prevent a shift in needs, an <b>intervener</b> foregrounds anomalies in the proposed interpretation of needs. Then the <b>intervener</b> advocates a way to account for anomalies in the currently existing interpretation of needs to attempt to maintain the current interpretation of needs. In both cases, communication drives social system change and continuity.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>intervener</b> {{services}} {{for individuals who}} are deaf-blind arose in Canada in the 1970s, and has been developing as a practice in the U. S. {{over the past two}} decades. In that time, significant efforts by many individuals across the nation have improved the availability of <b>intervener</b> services for children who are deaf-blind. Since 2002, there has been a national <b>intervener</b> task force that has developed valuable resources, including materials that raise awareness of <b>intervener</b> services and guidelines for <b>intervener</b> competencies. Families have educated policymakers about the role of interveners and the positive impact an <b>intervener</b> can have on the education of a child who is deaf-blind. State deaf-blind projects, part of the system of federal supports for this group of students, have developed creative ways to train interveners and support them in classrooms. Formal and informal collaborations are leading towards the development of a stronger national infrastructure to support this practice. Currently, a national set of recommendations, a national set of competencies for training interveners, national training modules and a national association are part of a strong foundation for promoting quality intervention services for individuals with deaf-blindness.|$|E

40|$|Why do {{third-party}} {{interventions in}} civil wars sometimes positively contribute to fast conflict resolutions and post-war development and sometimes backfire? To solve this puzzle, I present {{a conceptual framework}} that links the motives and methods of intervention to civil war outcomes and post-war development. Two contrasting motives, self-interest and humanitarian concerns, lead to different intervention types. Self-interest prompts states to undertake unilateral and biased intervention. Humanitarian concerns encourage states to engage in multilateral intervention through the UN with a biased position. <b>Interveners</b> are more prudent {{in the use of}} force. They resort to violent methods only when critical security interests are at stake or when extreme humanitarian disasters occur. The method of intervention reflects <b>interveners</b> 2 ̆ 7 motives and significantly influences civil war processes and post-war development. The effects of intervention on civil war duration and outcome, however, tend to be inconsistent with <b>interveners</b> 2 ̆ 7 intentions. I find no empirical evidence that external intervention is likely to make civil war shorter. Whether <b>interveners</b> are motivated by humanitarian concerns or self-interest, they tend to fail to achieve their best outcome: a faster victory for their protégé or a faster negotiated settlement. Instead, biased <b>interveners</b> succeed in retarding military victory by their protégé 2 ̆ 7 s rival. Neutral <b>interveners</b> play a role in delaying time until government victory, regardless of their intention. The effects of intervention on post-war development are somewhat consistent with <b>interveners</b> 2 ̆ 7 intention. Multilateral intervention motivated by humanitarian concerns tends to promote post-war well-being by increasing resources available for post-war reconstruction. On the other hand, unilateral intervention tends to impede the improvement of post-war quality of life. The use of force also has negative impacts on post-war development. The reason is that those interventions pursing self-interest produce a less-respondent government and reduce available resources. Military victory is more likely to improve post-war quality of life than is a negotiated settlement. However, the positive effects of military victory are realized only when a group wins a victory without biased support from foreign powers. I find that multilateral intervention using nonviolent methods and having an unbiased stance may be the best way for the international community to help post-war development...|$|R

50|$|The Court {{acknowledged}} three {{difficulties that}} were facing the parties, <b>interveners</b> and the Employment Court in this case.

The final difficulty was the lack of existing case law on the matter.|$|R

50|$|Like {{attention}} interventions, power interventions {{occur in}} communication interactions. The RSI model suggests that {{to encourage a}} power shift, <b>interveners</b> communicatively create social disorder by foregrounding anomalies in the current social hierarchy template. They advocate alternative ways of social organizing as the means to regain social order. To prevent a power shift and maintain the current social hierarchy, <b>interveners</b> communicatively foreground anomalies in the proposed template. They advocate ways {{to account for the}} anomalies in the current template. They attempt to dissuade openness to alternative ways of social organizing. In both cases, Brown concludes that communication drives social system change and continuity.|$|R
