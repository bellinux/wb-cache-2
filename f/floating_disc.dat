2500|$|Unlike car {{disc brakes}} that are buried within the wheel, bike disc brakes {{are in the}} {{airstream}} and have optimum cooling. Although cast iron discs have a porous surface which give superior braking performance, such discs rust {{in the rain and}} become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted or wavy to disperse rain water. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc [...] "floats" [...] on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a fixed caliper. A <b>floating</b> <b>disc</b> also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items. Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher center of mass:wheelbase ratio, so they experience more weight transfer when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern sport bikes typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Bikes that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.|$|E
2500|$|Mountain bike {{disc brakes}} may range from simple, {{mechanical}} (cable) systems, to expensive and powerful, multi-piston hydraulic disc systems, commonly used on downhill racing bikes. Improved technology {{has seen the}} creation of vented rotors for use on mountain bikes, similar to those on cars, introduced to help avoid heat fade on fast alpine descents. Although less common, discs are also used on road bicycles for all-weather cycling with predictable braking, although drums are sometimes preferred as harder to damage in crowded parking, where discs are sometimes bent. Most bicycle brake discs are made of steel. Stainless steel is preferred due to its anti-rust properties. Discs are thin, often about 2mm. Some use a two-piece <b>floating</b> <b>disc</b> style, others use a floating caliper, others use pads that float in the caliper, and some use one moving pad that makes the caliper slide on its mounts, pulling the other pad {{into contact with the}} disc. Because the [...] "motor" [...] is small, an uncommon feature of bicycle brakes is that the pads retract to eliminate residual drag when the brake is released. In contrast, most other brakes drag the pads lightly when released so as to minimise initial operational travel.|$|E

50|$|With {{the release}} of the AD&D Players Handbook in 1978, many players were {{intrigued}} by the connection of Greyhawk characters to magical spells such as Tenser's <b>floating</b> <b>disc,</b> Bigby's crushing hand, and Mordenkainen's faithful hound. The AD&D Dungeon Masters Guide, released the following year, also made references to the dungeons of Castle Greyhawk. Players' curiosity was further piqued by the ten Dungeons & Dragons modules set in Greyhawk that were published between 1976-1979. Several of Gygax's regular columns in Dragon magazine also mentioned details of his home campaign and characters that inhabited his world. Gygax was surprised when he found out that players wanted to use Greyhawk as their campaign world.|$|E
5000|$|Tenser: Tenser was {{a wizard}} played by Gygax's son Ernie. In the {{earliest}} days of Greyhawk, Ernie often gamed with Rob Kuntz (Robilar) and Terry Kuntz (Terik). At one point, using their combined forces of loyal henchmen, the three controlled access to the first level of the Greyhawk dungeons while they ransacked the lower levels. Tenser became the second character to reach the thirteenth (and bottom, at the time) level of the Greyhawk dungeons, when he noticed that Robilar was missing and went in search of him. Gary Gygax included the name Tenser in the names of two spells, Tenser's <b>floating</b> <b>disc</b> and Tenser's transformation.|$|E

50|$|In 1985 the Ducati F1 750 was released, {{based on}} the TT1 and TT2 racers, with full flow oil cooling rather than {{cylinder}} head bypass cooling, and cantilever rear suspension. The first production bikes used the same size valves as the 500 had, restricting performance. With its 1400 mm wheelbase, it was a smaller 750 than the world was used to, and ancillary parts were of mixed quality. Larger riders found it small, and the 16 in front wheel restricted tyre choice. Distinctive features included 38 mm Marzocchi front forks, fully <b>floating</b> <b>disc</b> brakes front and rear, hydraulically operated dry clutch, two into one exhaust, Nippon Denso instruments, and an aluminium petrol tank.|$|E

5000|$|Krillin {{has many}} {{abilities}} including, super-strength, super-speed, {{and the ability}} to fly using his ki energy, known as Bukū-jutsu (lit. [...] "Air Dance Technique"). His main techniques include the Kamehameha (lit. [...] "Turtle Destruction Wave"), an attack he learned from Master Roshi, which enables him to emit a powerful ki energy blast from his hands. Kakusandan (lit. [...] "Scattershots"), another chi attack, involves firing two blasts, one from each hand, and merging them before directing the blast above an opponent where it will break up and rain down on them, he was only seen using this twice—the first time was very successful as he managed to wipe out three Saibamen with it. From Tenshinhan, he obtained the Taiyōken (lit.

5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored <b>floating</b> <b>discs</b> {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} bikes had square-section alloy frames, 18-inch wheels {{front and}} rear and a large endurance-style fairing. The early version of the engine was 1052 cc in capacity and with greater similarity to the 750 cc than later versions. The frame was somewhat stiffer than the frame on the 750—indeed the box section is noticeably thicker when compared side to side. Handling was secure, but not particularly fast. The brakes consisted of two full <b>floating</b> <b>discs</b> at the front gripped by two sumitomo four-piston calipers and a small fixed disc gripped by a twin-piston caliper at the rear; Suzuki referred to this as the 'Deca Piston' set-up.Over the three years of production there were only minor changes, the largest being the switch to heavier three-spoke wheels on the last J model.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of fault {{diagnosis}} via integration of genetic algorithms (GA's) and qualitative bond graphs (QBG's) is addressed.

The QBG is adopted as the modeling scheme to generate a set of qualitative equations. The qualitative bond graph provides a unified approach for modeling engineering systems, in particular, mechatronic systems. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we have tested the proposed algorithm on an in-house designed and built <b>floating</b> <b>disc</b> experimental setup. Results from fault diagnosis in the <b>floating</b> <b>disc</b> system are presented and discussed.

The {{purpose of this}} retrospective study was to show the radiological evolution of the floating disc(s) {{and the relationship between}} <b>floating</b> <b>disc</b> degenera-tion and segmental lordosis, lumbar lordosis and pelvic incidence. Twenty patients, {{with a mean age of}} 49. 9 years, with symptomatic lumbar degenerative disc disease or low grade spondylolisthesis, who failed non-operative treatment and underwent fusion of 2 or more noncontiguous spinal segments, were includ-ed in this study. The radiographs of the floating discs were graded with the modified Gore System. The mean follow-up was 4. 2 years. Forty-seven levels were fused and 27 floating discs were studied (13 single, 7 double). Five out of 27 floating discs (18 %), in 4 patients, progressively degenerated. None of the floating discs degenerated more than two radio-graphic grades and none needed additional surgery. Postoperatively, 3 out of 5 degenerated floating discs had decreased segmental lordosis, while the other two had no change; this difference was not significant (p = 0. 08). Neither was there any significant correla-tion between <b>floating</b> <b>disc</b> degeneration and lumbar lordosis L 1 -S 1 (p> 0. 10) or pelvic incidence (p> 0. 10).

Results indicate the models predict wave-energy transmission accurately for small-amplitude waves and low-concentration arrays.
