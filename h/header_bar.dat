25|$|All Eagles {{took on a}} new plastic eggcrate-style grille {{divided into}} 24 squares at the front. The Eagle name moved to the grille <b>header</b> <b>bar.</b> Bumpers were updated so that their end caps flowed {{smoothly}} into the Kraton plastic wheelarches and rocker panel trim. The Sport package, carried over from 1980 on all three body styles, used the Spirit's hood and grille <b>header</b> <b>bar</b> trim starting in 1981. At , the Series 30 Eagle was also three inches shorter than the previous year.|$|E
2500|$|Exterior styling was {{slightly}} revised as all models used the [...] "power bulge" [...] hood, seen previously on the 1981-83 Eagle Series 50 models. The grille <b>header</b> <b>bar</b> and hood ornament/trim strip were deleted in the process. [...] "Shift-on-the-Fly" [...] capability {{was added to}} the Select Drive 4-wheel-drive system as standard equipment. A new key-fob-activated infrared remote keyless system with power locks was newly available as an option. Radios with digital tuning were also introduced.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the stainless steel <b>header</b> <b>bar</b> then used in the Isa Process cathode, the Kidd Process cathode used a solid copper <b>header</b> <b>bar,</b> which was welded onto the stainless steel sheet. This gave a lower voltage drop (by 8-10 millivolts) than the Isa Process cathode.|$|E

50|$|Falconbridge began {{marketing}} {{the technology in}} 1992, after many requests from other refinery operators. Thus, the Kidd Process created competition between two suppliers of permanent cathode technology. The main differences between them were the cathode <b>header</b> <b>bar,</b> edge stripping and the stripping machine technology.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the plate {{features}} a stainless-steel jacket that surrounds a solid-copper hanger bar, protecting it from corrosion. A corrosion-resistant resin inside the stainless steel jacket protects the conductive interior weld between the <b>header</b> <b>bar</b> and the plate. The hanger bar is then finished with high-quality sealing to prevent ingress of electrolytes into the conductive interior weld.|$|E
50|$|The focus then {{shifted to}} {{developing}} a stripping machine, to develop stainless steel cathodes incorporating the existing <b>header</b> <b>bars</b> and evaluating edge-strip technology. The company’s board of directors gave approval for {{the conversion of the}} refinery to the Kidd technology in April 1985. The conversion was completed in 1986 and the Kidd refinery became the third to install permanent cathode and automated stripping technology.|$|R
50|$|The return leg against Braga saw Andy Carroll {{get a big}} {{chance to}} equalise on aggregate, but his <b>header</b> hit the <b>bar</b> and Liverpool {{went out in the}} last 16. This was the first time since 2006 that Liverpool fans had no European quarter-final to look forward too, and the {{elimination}} was considered a disappointment.|$|R
50|$|Bannon {{played in}} Cork's first ever European game, against Torpedo Moscow in the 1989-90 European Cup Winners' Cup. Despite {{suffering}} from a virus, he played as the lone striker, and had Cork's only two chances - one <b>header</b> over the <b>bar,</b> one saved - as they lost 5-0 in Moscow. Bannon also played twice against Bayern Munich in the 1991-92 UEFA Cup. Overall, he made four appearances for Cork in Europe.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the launch}} of the new BBC News Website, which altered the <b>header</b> <b>bar</b> on that site, in October 2010, the new style of header was {{launched}} across the whole website, starting off with some of the larger, yet not obvious, sites, such as Doctor Who, first before relaunching all of the sites, including the homepage with the new look. This new style of header included the headings as before, but with the search box redesigned and aligned right, as with the links which are significantly smaller. Other links, such as BBC id login and mobile versions of the website also appear on the header, just {{to the right of the}} smaller BBC logo.|$|E
50|$|In January 2012, Lee {{was named}} {{man of the}} match in both legs of the Football League Trophy Northern Final, helping Chesterfield to a 3-1 win and their {{first trip to the}} new Wembley Stadium. In the final on 25 March 2012, Lee helped his team keep a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over the much fancied Swindon Town, making a crucial flying save to tip a <b>header</b> over the <b>bar</b> in the final minutes of the game.|$|R
50|$|The {{investment}} {{paid off}} as Crawley were challenging for promotion to the Football League and {{embarked on a}} remarkable F.A Cup run having beaten Championship side Derby County 2-1 in the third round, followed by a 1-0 win at League Two side Torquay United in the fourth round and setting up a dream tie at Old Trafford to face Manchester United in the fifth round. Crawley lost the game 1-0 in front of 9,000 Crawley fans and were denied a draw in the 93rd minute when Richard Brodie's <b>header</b> hit the <b>bar.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust unsupervised approach for extraction of data records from dynamic web pages using tag tree comparison. Extracting data {{records from the}} web pages involves following sequences. We first download the related web pages of interest on our system. Next we construct DOM trees for those pages using a parser. We then compare two or more web pages to eliminate the noisy unwanted data such as <b>header,</b> menu <b>bar,</b> navigation bar, advertisements, etc and find the region of interest called Data region or Object region. We then traverse subtrees of data region to detect individual data record and pull them in the XML file. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} in developing a fully unsupervised approach for extracting structured as well as semi-structured data records from the web pages. Our proposed system can extract data records from many commercial websites more precisely. Hence it can serve as a source for integrating information from various web sources which can be used for providing value added services such as comparative shopping, market intelligence, meta-querying and search...|$|R
5000|$|The {{case has}} brought anger and resentment towards milk {{producers}} and sowed uncertainty and confusion amongst the population. Queues formed outside Sanlu's offices for refunds. The Sanlu website was hacked {{several times and}} its name as displayed in the <b>header</b> <b>bar</b> changed to 三聚氰胺集团 ("The Melamine Group") in a play of words on the character [...] "三" [...] (number 3), {{which is the first}} word of Sanlu's Chinese name: 三鹿 (Three Deer); [...] "Melamine" [...] was also added as a product name by a hacker. As has been increasingly common practice, web users vented their anger on internet bulletin boards. Prevalent food scares have increased the number of online parodies circulated by netizens. Those inspired by Sanlu have been along themes of passing the buck, stones, or the virtues {{of not being able to}} urinate. Celebrities who have endorsed dairy products have also been mocked in photoshopped images.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} of Prevue Guide that were unavailable {{in the earlier}} full- and split-screen EPG Sr. versions were colorized listings backgrounds and program-by-program channel summaries. Between its already colored grid lines, which alternated blue, green, yellow and red with each half-hour listings cycle, each cable operator could choose to enable either red or light blue (rather than black) background colors for multiple channels of their choice. These backgrounds were usually used to highlight premium channels and pay-per-view services. Additionally, program-by-program channel summaries with light grey backgrounds, for up to four channels of each cable operator's choice, could be included within the scrolling grid. Appearing between each four-hour listings cycle, the names of channels (rather than times) would scroll up and slide into the grid's <b>header</b> <b>bar</b> {{one at a time}} (similar to the time bar that scrolled into the header at the start of each listings cycle), each followed by up to four hours worth of program-by-program listings for that channel alone. Prevue Guide could also display graphical weather icons, accompanied by local weather conditions, within its scrolling grid (as part of a segment known as Prevue Weather). These inserts were available to cable operators for an additional fee and appeared after each four-hour listings cycle.|$|E
5000|$|The Ford car was {{thoroughly}} updated in 1941, {{in preparation for}} a time of unpredictability surrounding World War II. The 1941 design would continue in an aborted 1942 model year and would be restarted in 1946 and produced until the more modern 1949 Fords were ready. During the initial year of this car, it evolved considerably. The front fenders came in three pieces, the theory being that small damage could be replaced easily. During the year, it evolved into two pieces with the lower front and back sections being joined. The hood risers changed, the early ones being the same as 1940 Fords, changing during the year to the better later version. The 1941 Convertible had no rear side windows, the only side windows being in the doors; in 1942, quarter windows were added so the rear occupants could see out.Five different coil/distributor arrangements were used during 1941, causing confusion for mechanics. Other variations were: two different positions for the generator, and three for the cooling fan — front of the crankshaft, front of the generator (rare) and on a bracket. This is thought to be the first Ford to offer an oil filter. The two interior heaters were a [...] "Southwind" [...] gasoline burner, which had the advantage of keeping one warm in winter at drive-in movies (provided a small electric fuel pump was used), and a more ordinary hot-water type. Both had window defrosters. It had an excellent radio, which could consume the battery in about two hours. Electric windshield wipers were available in addition to the vacuum-powered wipers. Three different convertible power top mechanisms (vacuum, electric screw, and hydraulic) and two different <b>header</b> <b>bar</b> latching systems were used. Rear suspensions sometimes had a sway bar, most did not. It had excellent brakes for the time, and the best handling of an ordinary car at the time. It was a very transitional car.|$|E
50|$|Robinson began Hereford's {{new season}} in the {{starting}} eleven. He scored on his first appearance, in the Herefordshire Senior Cup, and hit a hat-trick against Mostyn in the Welsh Cup, but was sent off in his first league match and again in his fifth. He was denied a goal as non-League club Atherstone Town held Hereford to a goalless draw in the FA Cup: the goalkeeper turned Andy Theodosiu's <b>header</b> onto the <b>bar,</b> Robinson headed the rebound back into the net, but it was disallowed because Theodosiu {{was lying on the}} goalline in an offside position. Robinson played intermittently, making seven league starts and four substitute appearances without scoring, and played his last Football League match on 25 April 1992 at the age of 21.|$|R
50|$|At home to Nottingham Forest, a 20 yd curled left-footed {{shot from}} Cotterill gave Birmingham a lead {{equalised}} {{late in the}} game by Britt Assombalonga. In the last few minutes, Assombalonga deflected Morrison's <b>header</b> over the <b>bar,</b> and the referee awarded a corner, a decision confirmed by his assistant. When protests continued, the fourth official informed the referee that he had clearly seen the player use his hand to clear the ball, and the referee duly awarded a penalty and sent off the offender. Caddis converted the penalty to give Birmingham a 2-1 win. After the match, it emerged that Forest manager Stuart Pearce had also seen the handball, so accepted that the correct ruling had been made, however unusual it was for a fourth official to become involved in on-field decision-making.|$|R
40|$|Presentation modeling, which {{captures the}} layout of an HTML page, is a very {{important}} aspect of modeling Web Applications (WAs). However, presentation modeling is often neglected during forward engineering of Web Applications; therefore, most of these applications are poorly modeled or not modeled at all. This paper discusses the design, implementation, and evaluation of a reverse engineering tool that extracts and builds appropriate UML presentation model of existing Web Applications. The tool consists of three steps. First, we identify and extract visual blocks and presentation elements of an HTML page such as navigation <b>bars,</b> <b>header</b> sections, text input, etc. In this step, we adopt the VIPS algorithm, which divides an HTML into semantically coherent blocks. Second, the identified presentation elements in step one are mapped to the most appropriate UML presentation model elements. Third, the resulting presentation model is made available in Magicdraw for manipulation. Our approach is applied and evaluated in the Goalzz home page. </span...|$|R
40|$|The {{reason for}} {{developing}} this software {{is that the}} existing statistical packages such as STATA, S-plus, MINITAB, or other not include mixtures modelling of zero-truncated Poisson model.

25|$|On {{the second}} weekend of February, heavy snow {{interrupted}} a second consecutive Parma home game, as the Crociatis Sunday meeting with Fiorentina was called {{off on the}} Saturday after a Friday blizzard and re-arranged for Wednesday 7 March. On 15 February, Parma faced Juventus in the rearranged 31 January meeting with the Old Lady on an unbeaten run of 25 competitive matches. They had last lost in the Tardini against Parma on 15 May 2011. Parma had Gabriel Paletta and Daniele Galloppa missing through injury and Juventus adopted the 3–5–2 formation that Parma had employed in recent games with January signing Stefano Ferrario making his debut. An early Giorgio Chiellini <b>header</b> hit the <b>bar</b> and it {{set the tone for}} the first half, as the Italian international's team dominated the chances, but failed to score. Parma came into it in the second half and Sebastian Giovinco had opportunities to give them the lead. Both sides had dubious penalty appeals turned down and usual second choice goalkeeper Nicola Pavarini continued his good form in goal. Recently departed Hernán Crespo had said an emotional goodbye to the fans before the match.|$|R
50|$|Birmingham {{lined up}} against Watford in a 3-5-2 formation, with six debutant free-transfer signings, three loanees (a fourth, Scott Allan, came on as a second-half substitute), and two 34-year-olds. Nikola Žigić was {{unavailable}} through injury. The {{difference between the}} teams lay in their finishing. Matt Green missed with only the goalkeeper to beat, Wade Elliott's powerful shot from distance was deflected onto the crossbar, and Dan Burn might have scored twice late on. Troy Deeney played a one-two with Fernando Forestieri and scored the only goal of {{the game with a}} low shot into the far corner after 11 minutes. For Birmingham's 2000th match in the second tier of English football, and Yeovil Town's first home game at that level, Hayden Mullins replaced Kyle Bartley in the starting eleven, playing at centre-half rather than his customary central midfield. The only goal of the game came just after half-time; Shane Ferguson's corner kick caused chaos as Byron Webster's attempted clearance rebounded off Danny Seaborne for an own goal. The goal was originally credited to Burn, who had scored the winner for Yeovil in the 2013 playoff final. Darren Randolph made a double save in the first half, and turned Webster's powerful <b>header</b> onto the <b>bar</b> with his leg in the second.|$|R
40|$|Automatic {{processing}} of Web documents {{is an important}} issue in the design of search engines, of Web mining tools, and of applications for Web information extraction. Simple text-based approaches are typically used in which most of the information provided by the page visual layout is discarded. Only some visual features, as the font face and size, are effectively used to weigh the importance of the words in the page. In this paper, we propose to use a hierarchical representation, which includes the visual screen coordinates for every HTML object in the page. The use of the visual layout allows us to identify common page components such as the <b>header,</b> the navigation <b>bars,</b> the left and right menus, the footer, and the informative parts of the page. The recognition of the functional role of each object is performed by a set of heuristic rules. The experimental results show that page areas are correctly classified in 73 % of the cases. The identification of different functional areas on the page allows the definition of a more accurate method for representing the page text contents, which splits the text features into different subsets according to the area they belong to. We show that this approach can improve the classification accuracy for page topic categorization by more than 10 % with respect to the use of a flat "bag-of-words" representation...|$|R
5000|$|On 3 December, Leipzig faced Schalke 04 {{at home on}} matchday 13. The match {{finished}} as a 2-1 win for RB Leipzig. RBL {{opened the}} scoring in the second minute from the penalty spot via Timo Werner. Two minutes later, Yussuf Poulsen missed two opportunities in a row to extend the lead for Leipzig. [...] Poulsen again missed an opportunity in the 29th minute, missing a metre away from goal. Two minutes later, Sead Kolašinac scored the equaliser for Schalke, after the ball was parried by RB goalkeeper Péter Gulácsi. Two minutes into the second half, Sead Kolašinac scored an own goal from a free kick from Leipzig's Emil Forsberg. Leipzig had further opportunities to score, but failed to capitalise. This includes a chance for Poulsen in the 64th minute from a corner, from Marcel Halstenberg in the 74th minute with a <b>header</b> onto the <b>bar,</b> and two opportunities for Naby Keïta in the 81st and 83rd minute. Leipzig goalkeeper Gulácsi preserved their lead with three consecutive saves in the 77th minute. The final opportunities fell to Poulsen in the 84th minute and Emil Forsberg in the 88th, yet both were unable to extend the lead. This proved to be enough, as Leipzig secured their 8th consecutive victory and maintained their position {{at the top of}} the table.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 January 1951, Newcastle, at {{one stage}} title favourites, were beaten 3-1 at Stamford Bridge and {{had fallen to}} fifth in the league, five points from top spot. They then turned their attentions to the FA Cup. Milburn scored {{one of the four}} goals which beat Bury in the 3rd round. Bolton Wanderers, {{inspired}} by two assists from Nat Lofthouse, led 2-1 early {{in the second half of}} the 4th round tie at St James'. Milburn settled [...] "a terrific meeting" [...] with two second half goals; the first after a sharp turn and shot from 15 yards and the second saw him beat the offside trap to run clear and score. He was denied a hat-trick when a late <b>header</b> struck the <b>bar</b> and rebounded to safety. A Robledo brace and another goal from Milburn helped beat Stoke City 4-2 in the next round and another Milburn strike helped defeat Bristol Rovers 3-1 in a sixth-round replay. In the semi-final against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 10 March at Hillborough, Milburn had a goal ruled out for offside in a tense 0-0 draw. In the replay four days later at Huddersfield, United recovered from a 1-0 deficit to win 2-1 thanks to another Milburn goal and a winner from Brennan after he was put clear by Milburn. Milburn score six goals up to the final and scored in every round played.|$|R
40|$|Research and {{development}} of a reliable dry land production system for common bean (Phaseolus vulgarisL.) based on low-cost direct seeding and direct harvest methods was initiated at the Crop Development Centre at the University of Saskatchewan in the late 1980 s. The target production area is a dry land spring wheat farming region in which lentil and pea production is well established. Effort is focussed on production of the pinto class. Three major potential improvements to the production system were identified: harvest equipment modification to improve direct harvest capability, development of early maturing germplasm with reliable expression of a crop canopy suitable for direct harvesting systems, and appropriate agronomy to improve the reliability of production. The research effort in harvest equipment modifications resulted in commercialization of a new design of lifter and reel assembly for combines equipped with floating cutter <b>bar</b> <b>headers.</b> Field scale evaluations showed that a 50 % reduction in cutter bar loss is possible with cultivars with Type III growth habit. Agronomy research for new production systems has been limited to development of improved rhizobial strains, but new areas of research will be explored as appropriate cultivars become available. Research {{in the area of}} germplasm development is specifically focussed on gains in early maturity and improvements in canopy structure, particularly for the pinto class. The ideal canopy structure for the production system is one in which all pods are situated above the combine cutter bar at the time of harvest. Specific improvements to the canopy structure include development of early maturing genotypes with elongated Type I growth habit, Type II growth habit or Type III growth habit without basal clustering of pods. In addition, an effort is underway to develop genotypes with shorter pods to maximize cutter bar clearance are under development and with pods with reduced lignin to minimize shattering and maximize cutter bar clearance. Reduction of lignin in pods may help reduce shattering at the time of harvest due to reduced dehiscence. Pods with reduced lignin tend to curve upward at the time of maturity, allowing better clearance of the cutter bar. Agronomic comparisons of F 2 -derived F 4 and F 5 lines showed that in some populations cutter bar losses can be reduced by up to 50 %...|$|R

On 23 October 2016, he netted the only goal helping his club to acquire a valuable win against Sint-Truidense V.V. for the Belgian Pro League. On 26 October 2016, a lackluster start by the home side Charleroi was punished after four minutes as Genk's Mbwana Samatta headed a corner towards the far post and there Karelis surprised everyone with his seventh goal of the season, opening the score in a 2-1 away loss. On 29 October 2016, he scored his second goal in a Pro League 2-1 home game against K.V.C. Westerlo, extended his run of scoring to a record of 5 matches, became the League top goalscorer so far.
