We describe {{the application of a}} novel volumetric software algorithm that is nearly fully automated and uses standard T 1 pre- and post-contrast MRI sequences. T 1 -weighted pre- and post-contrast images are automatically fused and normalized. The tumor region of interest is grossly outlined by the user. An atlas of the nasal mucosa is automatically detected and used to normalize levels of enhancement. The volume of <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> is then automatically calculated. We tested the ability of our method to calculate <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> volume with resection cavity collapse and when the <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> is obscured by subacute blood in a resection cavity. To determine variability in results, we compared narrowly-defined tumor regions with tumor regions that include adjacent meningeal enhancement and also compared different contrast enhancement threshold levels used for the automatic calculation of <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> volume. Our method quantified <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> volume despite resection cavity collapse.

We confirmed that TLR 9 signaling effectively elevated the expression of miR- 574 - 5 p in human lung cancer cells.

40|$|A {{cascade of}} fully {{convolutional}} neural networks is proposed to segment multi-modal Magnetic Resonance (MR) images with brain tumor into background and three hierarchical regions: whole tumor, tumor core and <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> core. The cascade {{is designed to}} decompose the multi-class segmentation problem into a sequence of three binary segmentation problems according to the subregion hierarchy. The whole tumor is segmented in the first step and the bounding box of the result {{is used for the}} tumor core segmentation in the second step. The <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> core is then segmented based on the bounding box of the tumor core segmentation result. Our networks consist of multiple layers of anisotropic and dilated convolution filters, and they are combined with multi-view fusion to reduce false positives.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR {{is being}} used {{increasingly}} as an intraoperative im-aging technique. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that intraoperative MR imaging increases the extent of tumor resection, thus improving surgical results in patients with high-grade gliomas. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with intracranial high-grade gliomas underwent 41 oper-ations. Using a neuronavigation system, tumors were resected in all patients to the point at which the neurosurgeon would have terminated the operation because he thought that all <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> had been removed. Intraoperative MR imaging (0. 2 T) was performed, and surgery, if necessary and feasible, was continued. All patients underwent early postoperative MR imaging (1. 5 T). By comparing the proportions of patients in whom complete resection of all <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> was shown by intraoperative and early postoperative MR imaging, re-spectively, the impact of intraoperative MR imaging on surgery was determined. RESULTS: Intraoperative MR imaging showed residual <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> in 22 cases (53. 7 %).

Results: Values of FA, CL and CP measured in the peri-tumoral edema were significantly high in the metastatic than primary high malignant glial tumors with high specificity (100 %) of the CP and high sensitivity of the CL (76. 5 %) among the three significant values, and no significant differences in the values of MD and CS.

We modified the traditional model-based postprocessing leakage-correction algorithm, assuming unidirectional contrast agent extravasation (Boxerman-Weisskoff model) {{to account for}} bidirectional contrast agent exchange between intra- and extravascular spaces (bidirectional model). For both models, we compared the goodness of fit with the parent leakage-contaminated relaxation rate curves by using the Akaike Information Criterion {{and the difference between}} modeled interstitial relaxation rate curves and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging by using Euclidean distance in 21 patients with glioblastoma multiforme. The bidirectional model had improved Akaike Information Criterion versus the bidirectional model in > 50 % of <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> voxels in all 21 glioblastoma multiformes (77 % ± 9 %; P 50 % of <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> voxels for 17 / 21 glioblastoma multiformes (62 % ± 17 %; P =. 0041).

In the current study, we examined recurrent GBM patients from both single and multicenter clinical trials to test whether baseline <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor</b> volume, including central necrosis, is a significant prognostic factor for OS in recurrent GBM. Included were 497 patients with recurrent GBM from 4 data sources: 2 single-center sites (University of Toronto, University of California Los Angeles) and 2 phase II multicenter trials (AVF 3708 G, Bevacizumab ± Irinotecan, NCT 00345163; XL 184 - 201, Cabozantinib, NCT 00704288). T 1 subtraction maps were used to define volume of contrast <b>enhancing</b> <b>tumor,</b> including central necrosis. Cox multivariable and univariate analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between tumor volume prior to second- or third-line therapy and OS. Both continuous measures of baseline tumor volume and tumors dichotomized into large (≥ 15 cc) and small (< 15 cc) tumors were significant predictors of OS (P<. 0001), independently of age and treatment. Univariate analysis demonstrated significant OS differences (P<. 05) between large (≥ 15 cc) and small (< 15 cc) tumors in patients under all therapeutic scenarios. Only patients treated with cabozantinib who previously failed anti-angiogenic therapy did not show an OS dependence on baseline tumor volume.
