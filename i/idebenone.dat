50|$|Two {{large-scale}} {{studies have}} demonstrated the benefits of <b>idebenone.</b> The Rescue of Hereditary Optic Disease Outpatient Study (RHODOS) evaluated the effects of <b>idebenone</b> in 85 patients with LHON who had lost vision within the prior five years. In this study, the group taking <b>idebenone</b> 900 mg per day for 24 weeks showed a slight improvement in visual acuity compared to the placebo group, though this difference was not statistically significant. Importantly, however, patients taking <b>idebenone</b> were protected from further vision loss, whereas the placebo group had a steady decline in visual acuity. Further, individuals taking <b>idebenone</b> demonstrated preservation of color vision and persistence {{of the effects of}} <b>idebenone</b> 30 months after discontinuing therapy. A retrospective analysis of 103 LHON patients by Carelli et al. builds upon these results. This study highlighted that 44 subjects who were treated with <b>idebenone</b> within one year of onset of vision loss had better outcomes, and, further, that these improvements with <b>idebenone</b> persisted for years.|$|E
50|$|<b>Idebenone,</b> {{combined}} with avoidance {{of smoke and}} limitation of alcohol intake, is the preferred standard treatment protocol for patients affected by LHON. <b>Idebenone</b> doses are prescribed to be taken spaced out throughout the day, rather than all at one time. For example, to achieve a dose of 900 mg per day, patients take 300 mg three times daily with meals. <b>Idebenone</b> is fat soluble, and may be taken with a moderate amount of dietary fat in each meal to promote absorption. It is recommended that patients on <b>idebenone</b> also take vitamin C 500 mg daily to keep <b>idebenone</b> in its reduced form, as it is most active in this state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Idebenone</b> is well absorbed {{from the}} gut but {{undergoes}} excessive first pass metabolism in the liver, so {{that less than}} 1% reach the circulation. This rate can be improved with special formulations (suspensions) of <b>idebenone</b> and by administering it together with fat food; but even taking these measures bioavailability {{still seems to be}} considerably less than 14% in humans. More than 99% of the circulating drug are bound to plasma proteins. <b>Idebenone</b> metabolites include glucuronides and sulfates, which are mainly (~80%) excreted via the urine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Idebenone</b> is a short-chain benzoquinone that {{interacts with}} the {{mitochondrial}} electron transport chain to enhance cellular respiration. When used in individuals with LHON, it is believed to allow electrons to bypass the dysfunctional complex I.

50|$|The {{movement}} disorders {{associated with}} ataxia {{can be managed}} by pharmacological treatments and through physical therapy and occupational therapy to reduce disability. Some drug treatments {{that have been used}} to control ataxia include: 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), <b>idebenone,</b> amantadine, physostigmine, L-carnitine or derivatives, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vigabatrin, phosphatidylcholine, acetazolamide, 4-aminopyridine, buspirone, and a combination of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E.|$|E

50|$|Treatment is {{dependent}} upon diagnosis and the stage at which the diagnosis is secured. For toxic and nutritional optic neuropathies, the most important course is to remove the offending agent if possible and to replace the missing nutritional elements, orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously. If treatment is delayed, the injury may be irreversible. The course of treatment varies with the congenital forms of these neuropathies. There are some drug treatments that have shown modest success, such as <b>Idebenone</b> used to treat LOHN. Often treatment is relegated to lifestyle alterations and accommodations and supportive measures.|$|E
50|$|The {{drug was}} {{approved}} for FA in Canada in 2008 under conditions including proof of efficacy in further clinical trials. However, on February 27, 2013, Health Canada announced that <b>idebenone</b> would be voluntarily recalled as of April 30, 2013 by its Canadian manufacturer, Santhera Pharmaceuticals, {{due to the}} failure of the drug to show efficacy in the further clinical trials that were conducted. In 2008, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) refused a marketing authorisation for this indication. As of 2013 the drug was not approved for FA in Europe nor in the US, where there is no approved treatment.|$|E

This has been met with limited success. The Swiss company Santhera Pharmaceuticals has started to investigate it for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases. In 2010, early clinical trials for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy have been completed.

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Idebenone</b> is a {{synthetic}} analogue of ubiquinone {{that may be}} beneficial {{in the treatment of}} Friedreich's ataxia. Since in previous pharmacokinetic trials only lower doses were studied, it was the aim of this study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of <b>idebenone</b> in higher doses of up to 2, 250 mg/day. METHODS: In this open, randomized trial, 25 healthy male subjects received first either a single oral dose of 150 mg or 750 mg of <b>idebenone,</b> then the same dose given at 8 -h intervals for 14 days. RESULTS: <b>Idebenone</b> and its metabolites appeared in the plasma quickly. Over 99 % of parent <b>idebenone</b> was metabolized, indicating a high first-pass effect. C(max) and AUC(0 -t) values for parent <b>idebenone</b> and its metabolites increased in a dose-proportional manner. There was virtually no accumulation of parent drug or metabolites following multiple dosing. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Idebenone</b> exhibited dose-dependent pharmacokinetics in daily doses up to 2, 250 mg. In 6 / 14 subjects, adverse events of mild to moderate severity were observed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Idebenone</b> [2, 3 -dimethoxy- 5 -methyl- 6 -(10 -hydroxydecyl) - 1, 4 -benzoquinone] is a {{synthetic}} analogue of coenzyme Q {{that is currently}} employed {{in the treatment of}} vascular and degenerative diseases of the central nervous system. There is some evidence to suggest that <b>idebenone</b> might function as an antioxidant; however, it has not been demonstrated whether this function pertains to the quinone or hydroquinone form of <b>idebenone.</b> Here we demonstrate that <b>idebenone</b> can scavenge a variety of free radical species, including organic radicals such as 2, 2 '-azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) and diphenylpicrylhydrazyl, peroxyl and tyrosyl radicals, and peroxynitrite. <b>Idebenone</b> can also redox couple with hypervalent species of Mb or Hb, thus preventing lipid peroxidation promoted by these species. Likewise, <b>idebenone</b> inhibits microsomal lipid peroxidation induced by ADP-iron complexes or organic hydroperoxides. In so doing, <b>idebenone</b> prevents the destruction of cytochrome P 450, which otherwise would accompany lipid peroxidation. Irrespective of the experimental system under investigation, <b>idebenone</b> functions by virtue of the electron-donating properties of the hydroquinone form. Redox coupling of this hydroquinone with free radicals generates the quinone compound, which per se lacks antioxidant activity. In many experiments, the antioxidant effects of <b>idebenone</b> become appreciable at approximately 2 microM, which is well in the range of plasma levels attainable in patients given oral doses of this drug. Moreover, comparative experiments have shown that the antioxidant efficiency of <b>idebenone</b> varies from no less than 50 % to slightly more than 100 % of that of vitamin E or Trolox. We would therefore propose that the neuroprotective effects of <b>idebenone</b> can be attributed, at least in part, to its ability to function as an antioxidant, involving redox cycling between hydroquinone and quinone...|$|E
40|$|IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: <b>Idebenone</b> is a {{synthetic}} short chain benzoquinone {{that acts as}} an electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, thereby, facilitating the production of ATP. In addition, <b>idebenone</b> is an antioxidant and can inhibit lipid peroxidation and may protect cell membranes and mitochondria from oxidative damage. High dose <b>idebenone</b> (Catena(®)) is approved in Canada for the symptomatic treatment of Friedreich's ataxia and is currently under clinical investigation {{for use in a}} number of mitochondrial and neuromuscular diseases. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review summarizes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and clinical efficacy/safety data of <b>idebenone</b> and its metabolites and provides an update of the clinical trials completed and in progress. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Following oral administration, <b>idebenone</b> is rapidly metabolized via oxidative shortening by a number CYP isoenzymes (CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 C 19, CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 3 A 4) to yield QS 10, QS 8, QS 6 and QS 4. <b>Idebenone</b> and these metabolites concomitantly undergo conjugation via glucuronidation and sulfatation to yield conjugated moieties represented as idebenone-C, QS 10 -C, QS 8 -C, QS 6 -C and QS 4 -C. Previous reports in the literature were only able to quantify plasma concentrations of <b>idebenone</b> measured together with its conjugates. More recently, highly sensitive and specific liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometric methods have been developed, allowing the quantification of the parent molecule <b>idebenone</b> and its main metabolite QS 10, separately. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: After absorption, <b>idebenone</b> is rapidly metabolized by first pass metabolism and shows dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects in daily doses up to 2250 mg. The recent development of advanced analytical techniques allows the detection of <b>idebenone</b> and unconjugated metabolites in plasma and consequently opens the possibility for evaluation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships which will be helpful to further understand the metabolism and therapeutic potential of <b>idebenone.</b> In clinical studies, <b>idebenone</b> was safe and well tolerated at doses up to 2250 mg/day...|$|E

Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was carried out and auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded pre-treatment, after four weeks treatment and after eight weeks treatmet. MMSE performance was significantly improved with treatment in both groups. Central P 300 latency was shortened in the group which was treated with <b>Idebenone</b> and Vinpocetine, {{but not in the}} group which was treated with <b>Idebenone</b> alone. Based on the obtained results, we were convinced that administration of <b>Idebenone</b> and Vinpocetine was very useful in the treatment of vascular dementia...|$|E

40|$|Four phase 1 {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to assess the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of <b>idebenone</b> (including parent drug and inactive metabolites QS 10, QS 6, and QS 4) and to evaluate {{the safety of a}} wide range of <b>idebenone</b> doses and regimens in healthy adult men. After a single oral dose of <b>idebenone</b> 150 mg, 750 mg, or 1050 mg in fasted or fed subjects, blood samples were taken for up to 72 hours. In one study, after a single oral dose and a 7 -day washout period, subjects received repeated doses of <b>idebenone</b> 150 mg or 750 mg every 8 hours for 14 days. In the repeated-dose study, urine samples also were taken. Plasma and urine samples were analysed with the use of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Non-compartmental standard pharmacokinetic methods were used. In these studies, a total of 69 subjects ranging in age from 19 to 41 years (body weight, 57 - 94. 6 kg) were included. Plasma concentrations of parent <b>idebenone</b> were low but increased in proportion to dose and increased approximately five-fold in the presence of food. Total QS 4 was the main metabolite in plasma and urine. The most common adverse events were loose stool, fatigue, headache, and disturbances in attention. <b>Idebenone</b> was well tolerated in single oral doses up to 1050 mg and in repeated daily doses up to 2250 mg. <b>Idebenone</b> showed linear pharmacokinetics after single and repeated oral dosing.

40|$|Leber's {{hereditary}} {{optic neuropathy}} (LHON) is an inherited disease caused by mutations in complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The disease {{is characterized by}} loss of central vision due to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dysfunction and optic nerve atrophy.

40|$|AbstractIn Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD), progressive loss of respiratory function leads to restrictive pulmonary disease and places patients at significant risk for severe respiratory complications. Of particular concern are ineffective cough, secretion retention and recurrent respiratory tract infections. In a Phase 3 randomized controlled study (DMD Long-term <b>Idebenone</b> Study, DELOS) in DMD patients 10 – 18 {{years of age}} and not taking concomitant glucocorticoid steroids, <b>idebenone</b> (900 [*]mg/day) reduced significantly the loss of respiratory function over a 1 -year study period. In a post-hoc analysis of DELOS we found that more patients in the placebo group compared to the <b>idebenone</b> group experienced bronchopulmonary adverse events (BAEs) : placebo: 17 of 33 patients, 28 events; idebenone: 6 of 31 patients, 7 events. The hazard ratios (HR) calculated “by patient” (HR 0. 33, p[*]=[*] 0. 0187) and for “all BAEs” (HR 0. 28, p[*]=[*] 0. 0026) indicated a clear <b>idebenone</b> treatment effect. The overall duration of BAEs was 222 days (placebo) vs. 82 days (<b>idebenone).</b> In addition, there was also a difference in the use of systemic antibiotics utilized for the treatment of BAEs. In the placebo group, 13 patients (39. 4 %) reported 17 episodes of antibiotic use compared to 7 patients (22. 6 %) reporting 8 episodes of antibiotic use in the <b>idebenone</b> group. Furthermore, patients in the placebo group used systemic antibiotics for longer (105 days) compared to patients in the <b>idebenone</b> group (65 days). This post-hoc analysis of DELOS indicates that the protective effect of <b>idebenone</b> on respiratory function is associated with a reduced risk of bronchopulmonary complications and a reduced need for systemic antibiotics...|$|E

40|$|Leber’s {{hereditary}} {{optic neuropathy}} (LHON) {{is one of}} the most frequent mitochondrial disorders. It is caused by mutations in genes of the mitochondrial DNA coding for subunits of the respiratory chain and leads to severe bilateral vision loss, from which spontaneous recovery is infrequent. Retinal ganglion cells show a selective vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction in LHON. <b>Idebenone</b> is the first medication approved for LHON. It is a short-chain benzoquinone, which is an analogue of coenzyme Q 10, but with distinct properties and mechanisms of action. <b>Idebenone</b> is a potent antioxidant and inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. Importantly, it facilitates electron flux directly to complex III, bypassing the dysfunctional complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby increasing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. In the Rescue of Hereditary Optic Disease Outpatient Study (RHODOS) randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, 85 patients with LHON were enrolled, in the first 5 years after symptom onset, and randomized to either <b>idebenone</b> 900 mg/d for 6 months or placebo. <b>Idebenone</b> was well tolerated, and although the prespecified primary end point (best recovery in visual acuity [VA]) did not reach statistical significance, all secondary end points (change in best VA, change of VA of best eye at baseline, and change of VA in all eyes) showed a trend toward visual recovery in favor of <b>idebenone.</b> An increasing body of evidence shows that <b>idebenone</b> is effective and safe for the treatment of patients with LHON, including a large retrospective open-label study, several case reports and case series, an expanded access program, and ongoing post-authorization clinical studies.
