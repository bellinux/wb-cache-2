5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is {{comparable to that of}} Hamlet who may have been based on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E
5|$|That night, Theresa is {{awakened by}} someone at her door. Mulder and Scully arrive at Theresa's house {{to find it}} being {{investigated}} by police, with Billy informing them that Theresa was taken {{in the night and}} that nobody knows what happened. Scully suddenly feels nauseous, much to Billy's concern, but she quickly shakes it off. Later, while investigating the reported crash site, Scully <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> and shaken just as Gary was. Mulder finds her nearly passed out on the ground.|$|E

5|$|The {{museum is}} {{constructed}} from bare reinforced concrete. The primary museum floor <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> six metres {{above the ground}} on huge piloti and is accessible via a free-standing staircase. The rhythmical facade comprises vertical elements that repeat outwards from the centre. Like the exterior, the interior is finished with rough concrete; {{the idea was to}} keep the surfaces plain so that nothing could distract the visitor from the contents of the exhibits.|$|E
5|$|Gaius instructs Merlin {{to deliver}} elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room {{he finds the}} poppet, but bluffs {{his way out of}} discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests to fall asleep. Merlin, {{realising}} what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea. The next day, Gaius gives Merlin a book on magic, under condition that he keep it hidden.|$|E
5|$|In Oregon, {{two teenage}} boys (Gary and Richie) are {{exploring}} {{the crash site}} when they encounter Deputy Miles, who denies any crash or the fire that {{was reported in the}} area. While they go through the area on their own, Gary <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> off the ground and shaken like a rag doll by an invisible force, and Richie, although he stands within a few feet of him, can't see him. Meanwhile, in Washington, Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy Miles, an abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior. The younger Miles tells him about Hoese's disappearance, and his concern that the abductions have begun again.|$|E
50|$|After Lifter {{arrived at}} the Bay Area in March 2009, {{it was used to}} place pre-fabricated {{falsework}} truss sections and the 28 box girder deck sections. Before the heavy deck sections for the Bay Bridge <b>were</b> <b>lifted,</b> the Left Coast Lifter raised a sunken tugboat in August 2009, USS Wenonah. The first deck section <b>was</b> <b>lifted</b> in February 2010, and the last deck section <b>was</b> <b>lifted</b> in October 2011.|$|R

5|$|Jack {{reaches a}} deal with Barbossa to operate a pirate fleet, but {{suddenly}} frees Will and duels Barbossa, while Elizabeth and Will fight off Barbossa's crew. Barbossa stabs Jack, but the latter is revealed {{to be under the}} curse, having taken a piece of gold from Cortez’s chest. Jack reveals the deception as a coup to win back the Pearl. Jack shoots Barbossa, and Will drops both coins into the chest, with his and Jack's blood on them. The curse <b>is</b> <b>lifted,</b> causing Barbossa to die from Jack's gunshot; the rest of Barbossa's crew, realizing that they are no longer immortal, surrender and are arrested.|$|E
5|$|The Duke pursues {{the group}} onto the bridge, setting off mines {{as he tries}} to catch up. With Brain {{navigating}} through the minefield, Snake manages to avoid most of the explosives, but the cab hits a mine and is blown in half, killing Cabbie. As the group flees on foot, Brain is killed when he steps on another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, and {{stands in the middle of}} the road, shooting at the Duke's car until he runs her down, killing her. Snake and the President reach the perimeter wall and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke opens fire on the wall, killing the guards and forcing Snake to dive for cover, but the President shoots the Duke dead. Snake <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> to safety, and the micro-explosives in his neck are neutralized.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Ila, a king cursed by Shiva and Parvati to {{be a man}} one month and a woman the next, appears in several {{traditional}} Hindu texts. After changing sex, Ila loses the memory of being the other gender. During one such period, Ila marries Budha (the god of the planet Mercury). Although Budha knows of Ila's alternating gender, he doesn't enlighten the 'male' Ila, who remains unaware of his life as a woman. The two live together as man and wife only when Ila is female. In the Ramayana version, Ila bears Budha a son, although in the Mahabharata Ila is called both mother and father of the child. After this birth the curse <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> and Ila is totally changed into a man who goes on to father several children with his wife.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{expansion}} draft, the trade limitation of allocated-for-same-country-allocated <b>was</b> <b>lifted.</b> [...] Players that were 'unevenly' traded once this restriction <b>was</b> <b>lifted</b> include Amy LePeilbet (to Kansas City), Karina LeBlanc (to Chicago), and Veronica Perez (to Washington).|$|R

5|$|The version by Aiken {{is perhaps}} the best known stage adaptation, {{released}} {{just a few months}} after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece. Most of Aiken's dialogue <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> verbatim from Stowe's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard. Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film. By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences. By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Assisted by {{the school}} janitor Mister One, and pursued by a {{grotesque}} scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the school grounds, Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the dome and the murder. They visit the lab and compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer {{and a pair of}} documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices—something confirmed when the computer is used to open a small hatch in the dome and students are shot dead as they attempt to flee—when the dome <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> twelve hours after her death is reported.|$|E
5|$|Quests are {{directly}} linked to Lightning's growth: as she completes quests, her stats are boosted, with the main story quests yielding the biggest boosts. Many side quests can only be obtained at certain times, since the real-time build of the world means NPCs are in constant movement, and only appear in certain places at a given time. Lightning can also accept quests from the Canvas of Prayers, a post board found in all the main locations. Upon completing NPC quests, Lightning is rewarded with a portion of Eradia, spiritual energy retrieved when a person's burden <b>is</b> <b>lifted.</b> Every day at 6 AM game-time, Lightning is drawn back into the Ark, a location where the in-game clock does not progress. Once there, Lightning gives her gathered Eradia to a tree called Yggdrasil: if she has gathered enough, the in-game clock is extended by a day. She can also restock on supplies and collect new equipment. Another feature in the game was Outerworld Services, a feature where players could take photos and share them, along with their personal stats and battle scores, on Facebook and Twitter. The Facebook features were disabled in April 2015. All Outerworld services were terminated in April the following year.|$|E

The ball must not <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> if another ball is in motion. The ball <b>lifted</b> must not <b>be</b> cleaned unless it was on the putting green.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Mario {{is invited}} to the centennial Star Festival by Princess Peach to {{celebrate}} the comet that passes overhead, Bowser invades the Mushroom Kingdom with a surprise attack in a fleet of airships. Summoning a gigantic flying saucer, Peach's entire castle is removed from its foundations and <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> into outer space. Mario is still at the castle's base until Kamek, one of Bowser's minions, launches Mario onto a small planet with his magic. On the planet, he meets an enchantress named Rosalina and her companions, the Lumas. Rosalina is a watcher of the stars, who uses the Comet Observatory to travel across the universe. However, Bowser has stolen all of the Power Stars that act as the Observatory's power source, rendering it immobile. Bestowed {{with the power to}} travel through space through one of the Lumas, Mario sets off on a journey across the universe to reclaim the Power Stars and restore power to Rosalina's observatory. Along the way, he finds friends from the Mushroom Kingdom such as Luigi and the Toads.|$|E
5|$|By {{reading the}} book, Gray learns that Léone {{is a victim}} of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into submission. The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood {{transfusion}} is needed and Gray offers his blood to save Léone. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to Léone, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that Gisèle is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gisèle but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> and Léone suddenly recovers. Gisèle and Gray cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.|$|E
