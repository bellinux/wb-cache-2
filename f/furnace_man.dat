On leaving Barrow Technical College at the age of 15, he started working at the mill as an apprentice joiner and competed at some music festivals. In 1936 he joined the police force and was stationed in Lancaster. He found his duties generally dull, although he was posted to guard the house where Dr Buck Ruxton had notoriously killed his wife and housemaid the previous year. During this time, he enjoyed performing with local musical societies. In 1938 he married Alice at St Paul's Church, Barrow, and the couple had one son, Ellis, born in 1942, who became an aeronautical engineer.|$|E

In serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it, boiling hot, over my hand and wrist. It hurt awfully, Joe. And the dear girl was so sorry! But Gen. Pinkney!--Joe, that old man nearly went distracted.

5000|$|An {{important}} act {{was passed}} in 1908 (Coal Mines Regulation Act 1908) limiting the hours of work for workmen below ground. It enacted that, subject to various provisions, a workman {{was not to be}} below ground in a mine for the purpose of his work, and of going to and from his work, for more than eight hours in any consecutive twenty-four hours. Exception was made in the case of those below ground for the purpose of rendering assistance {{in the event of an}} accident, or for meeting any danger, or for dealing with any emergency or work incompleted, through unforeseen circumstances, which requires to be dealt with to avoid serious interference in the work of the mine. The authorities of every mine must fix the times for the lowering and raising of the men to begin and be completed, and such times must be conspicuously posted at the pit head. These times must be approved by an inspector. The term [...] " [...] workman [...] " [...] in the act means any person employed in a mine below ground who is not an official of the mine (other than a fireman, examiner or deputy), or a mechanic or a horse keeper or a person engaged solely in surveying or measuring. In the case of a fireman, examiner, deputy, onsetter, pump minder, fanman or <b>furnace</b> <b>man,</b> the maximum period for which he may be below ground is nine hours and a half. A [...] must be kept by the authorities of the mine of the times of descent and ascent, while the workmen may, at their own cost, station persons (whether holding the office of checkweigher or not) at the pit head to observe the times. The authorities of the mine may extend the hours of working by one hour a day on not more than sixty days in one calendar year (s. 3). The act may be suspended by order in council in the event of war or of imminent national danger or great emergency, or in the event of any grave economic disturbance due to the demand for coal exceeding the supply available at any time. The act came into force on 1 July 1909 except for the counties of Northumberland and Durham where its operation was postponed until 1 January 1910.|$|E
25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) began {{organizing}} unskilled {{iron and}} steel workers into federal unions in 1901. Local groups of wire drawers, house men, tube workers, blast <b>furnace</b> <b>men</b> and others had all formed unions. The Federal Association of Wire Drawers was chartered in 1896, the Tin Plate Workers' Protective Association in 1899, the International Association of Blast Furnace Workers in 1901, and the International Association of Tube Workers in 1902. Most internationals disbanded after a short time, but many local federal unions became deeply entrenched in the workplace.|$|R
50|$|Many area {{residents}} resented the condemnation of their lands, {{especially when it}} was explained to them {{that most of the}} area was not to be flooded but rather to become a park. The former settlements of Tharpe, Tennessee; Model, Tennessee; and Golden Pond, Kentucky, were forcibly abandoned. The remains of a former iron <b>furnace,</b> <b>manned</b> in the 1850s by slave labor, are about all that remains of Model. Golden Pond was replaced by the headquarters of the area and retained as the postal address for it. There is a museum, a planetarium, and an environmental education area there.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{practice}} for ships {{was to have}} two furnaces in each boiler. Smaller boilers might only have one, larger boilers commonly had three.

Over {{the course of}} the next year revenues for STELLITE® alloy exceeded $ 1, 000, 000. As uses for the alloys grew so did the company. By 1918 sales were about $ 3, 600, 000.

50|$|In 1778 an iron furnace {{was built}} in the upper Sirhowy Valley by Thomas Atkinson and William Barrow, who came to the area from London.

[...] Rollo met Mr. Kennedy {{at the head}} of the cabin stairs, and he seemed very much rejoiced to learn that Waldron was found. Rollo led the way, and Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy followed him, until they came to a place on the deck, pretty well forward, where there was an opening surrounded by an iron railing, through which you could look down into the hold below. It was very far down that you could look, and at different distances on the way were to be seen iron ladders going from deck to deck, and ponderous shafts, moving continually, with great clangor and din, while at the bottom were seen the mouths of several great glowing <b>furnaces,</b> with <b>men</b> at work shovelling coal into them.|$|R
60|$|For instance. Glass beads are utterly unnecessary, {{and there}} is no design or thought {{employed}} in their manufacture. They are formed by first drawing out the glass into rods; these rods are chopped up into fragments of the size of beads by the human hand, and the fragments are then rounded in the <b>furnace.</b> The <b>men</b> who chop up the rods sit at their work all day, their hands vibrating with a perpetual and exquisitely timed palsy, and the beads dropping beneath their vibration like hail. Neither they, nor the men who draw out the rods or fuse the fragments, have the smallest occasion for the use of any single human faculty; and every young lady, therefore, who buys glass beads is engaged in the slave-trade, and in a much more cruel one than that which we have so long been endeavouring to put down.|$|R
50|$|As {{producer}} {{and director of}} Four Corners during the first 3 years of the program's life, Raymond brought events occurring {{all over the world}} into the homes of Australia's first generation of television viewers. In 1963, he set up the Special Projects Division for the Nine Network, establishing the first documentary unit in Australian commercial television. Between 1963 and 1968 he wrote, produced and presented over 70 one-hour documentaries, shot at home and abroad, including We, the Destroyers, with Alan Moorehead, which established the conservation genre in Australian television. Life and Death on the Great Barrier Reef (1969), Shell's Australia (1971-1975), Discover Australia's National Parks (1978), Pelican's Progress (1979), Out of the Fiery <b>Furnace</b> and <b>Man</b> on the Rim (1988) opened the eyes of all Australians to the world around them. His non-fiction books - from Australia's Wildlife Heritage (1975) and Australia: The Greatest Island (1979) to Fifty-Two Views of Rudy Komon (1999) and his three volumes of autobiography, offer unique insights into the natural and cultural world of 20th century Australia.|$|R

50|$|Frederick the Great, who {{supported}} Gotzkowsky from 1740, {{and had him}} buy Dutch and Italian paintings, took over the factory. The company is still known as the Royal Porcelain Manufacture (KPM). The manufacture was located in the Leipziger Strasse, not far from Potsdamer Platz where now the Bundesrat of Germany is located. The factory had twelve <b>furnaces</b> and 400 <b>men</b> in service. Frederick demanded of the Jewish traders to take his porcelain in their assortment. The former silk and porcelain factory was from 1825 up to 1851 {{in the possession of}} Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who had built a very representative mansion on the property.

40|$|Sperms are {{produced}} by a highly complex and poorly understood differentiation process known as spermatogenesis. Occupational exposure to high temperatures adversely affect testicular function causing partial or complete spermatogenic arrest. Dyers, cooks, blast <b>furnace</b> workers and <b>men</b> with varicocele are known to develop testicular hyperthermia, which leads to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) and azoospermia. Semen analysis of 125 infertile men (and 25 fertile controls following the WHO guidelines, 1999 showed azoospermia in 109 men and oligozoospermia in 16 men. Twenty azoospermic and 14 oligozoospermic men had high testiculoepididymal temperatures either due to occupational exposure to high temperature or varicocele. All the 14 oligozoospermic men showed a very high percentage of sperms with abnormal morphology, impaired motility and they were subclassified as OAT group. Observations made in this study reiterates that high intratesticular temperature causes partial or complete spermatogenic arrest and may lead to increased production of morphologically abnormal sperms with impaired motility. This inverse relationship of sperm function with elevated temperature has implications in clinical medicine both in understanding pathological states and for therapeutic measures...|$|R
40|$|Illustrations by Ann CrossOf {{the many}} state parks in Minnesota none is more {{appropriate}} than the Tower-Soudan State Park. Situated in the wooded highlands of the Lake Vermilion area, {{the park is}} within one of the State's most scenic areas {{and at the same}} time is a symbol to Minnesota's heritage -a monument to the vast iron ore resources that have been the backbone of the strength and wealth of the nation. The central feature of the park is the Soudan Iron Mine. This, the first iron mine in the State of Minnesota, was operated nearly continuously from its discovery in 1882 until 1962, when it was closed. Through its active life, the mine yielded a high-grade iron ore that brought premium prices in the iron ore market and provided employment for thousands of miners. Although the Soudan Mine was shut down because of the high cost of its operation and the reduced demand for its ore, in a sense its demise can be attributed to technological progress. Concurrently with the building of the large modern taconite plants, such as those on the Mesabi Range 20 miles to the south, the iron and steel industry has undergone revolutionary changes. The high-grade natural ores such as those from the Soudan Mine have been largely replaced by the marble-sized pellets of the taconite plants as the preferred feed for the steel <b>furnaces.</b> Steel <b>men</b> have found that through the use of pellets, production of the furnaces is greatly increased. As operation of the furnaces is the most costly of all the operations in steel making, it is little wonder that the demand today is for pellets rather than for the natural ores used in the past...|$|R
50|$|Alex {{is brought}} by the army, along with Zee, Simon and Lucy, to St Margaret's {{hospital}} where he, Simon and other Furnace creatures are studied by Panettierre and others while the plague's spreading through {{and out of the}} country. During the experiments, Alex drifts in and out of sleep where he experiences Furnace's memories. With Zee's visit, Alex realizes that he's expendable - he doesn't have any information about the nectar reproduction/annihilation or the whereabouts of the culprit. So Panettiere kills him but is resurrected by Sam. After Cross' death, Alex's considered <b>Furnace's</b> right-hand <b>man,</b> therefore, Sam and some berserkers help him and his friends to escape. With Panettiere and her army on their toes (they want to study Zee's immunity to the nectar), they spend the night in Alex's house, where he finds out that his parents haven't abandoned him as he remembers but have been trying {{to get him out of}} prison, and then they finally reach the island where Furnace is. At last, Alex meets Furnace who's still alive by being attached to a machine and wants Alex to be his heir - Alex is the only one who could handle the nectar and remember his history, and that's what the Stranger needs to survive. He accepts Furnace's offer, in doing so Alex's nectar is replaced by the Stranger's blood in Furnace's veins. Furnace is turned to dust and the Stranger manipulates Alex in continuing the war. However, with his friends' support Alex ends it by killing all of Furnace's creatures, including Simon, through telephatic images of freedom and peace. When Panettiere finally reaches them, she receives all of Alex's blood and dies while Alex's saved by receiving a nectar transfusion. Alex, Zee and Lucy are then brought to a military base where he's interrogated about what's happened. As time passes, the three of them and the whole world are trying to live a better, normal life, and Alex goes under the knife in order to become human again.|$|R
6000|$|And {{here we have}} at last an {{inevitable}} distinction. There must be work done by the arms, or {{none of us could}} live. There must be work done by the brains, or the life we get would not be worth having. And the same men cannot do both. There is rough work to be done, and rough men must do it; there is gentle work to be done, and gentlemen must do it; and it is physically impossible that one class should do, or divide, the work of the other. And it is of no use to try to conceal this sorrowful fact by fine words, and to talk to the workman about the honourableness of manual labour and the dignity of humanity. That is a grand old proverb of Sancho Panza's, 'Fine words butter no parsnips;' and I can tell you that, all over England just now, you workmen are buying a great deal too much butter at that dairy. Rough work, honourable or not, takes the life out of us; and the man who has been heaving clay out of a ditch all day, or driving an express train against the north wind all night, or holding a collier's helm in a gale on a lee-shore, or whirling white hot iron at a <b>furnace</b> mouth, that <b>man</b> is not the same {{at the end of his}} day, or night, as one who has been sitting in a quiet room, with everything comfortable about him, reading books, or classing butterflies, or painting pictures. If it is any comfort to you to be told that the rough work is the more honourable of the two, I should be sorry to take that much of consolation from you; and in some sense I need not. The rough work is at all events real, honest, and, generally, though not always, useful; while the fine work is, a great deal of it, foolish and false as well as fine, and therefore dishonourable; but when both kinds are equally well and worthily done, the head's is the noble work, and the hand's the ignoble; and of all hand work whatsoever, necessary for the maintenance of life, those old words, 'In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread,' indicate that the inherent nature of it is one of calamity; and that the ground, cursed for our sake, casts also some shadow of degradation into our contest with its thorn and its thistle; so that all nations have held their days honourable, or 'holy,' and constituted them 'holydays' or 'holidays,' by making them days of rest; and the promise, which, among all our distant hopes, seems to cast the chief brightness over death, is that blessing of the dead who die in the Lord, that 'they rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.' ...|$|R
