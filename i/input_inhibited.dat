Several features indicate that the relevant premotoneurones are distinct from segmental interneurones and located rostral to MNs. Thus, corticospinal volleys would have an indirect (propriospinal) pathway to upper limb MNs, {{in addition to the}} direct cortico-motoneuronal pathway. Slightly increasing the corticospinal input causes the facilitation to be reversed to inhibition. This is consistent with a well-developed system of inhibitory intemeurones activated by corticospinal and afferent <b>inputs</b> <b>inhibiting</b> propriospinal neurones (PNs). Corticospinal activation of these inhibitory interneurones would explain why propriospinally-mediated corticospinal EPSPs are weak in primate MNs after artificial (electrical or magnetic) activation of the corticospinal system by itself.

40|$|SummaryNeurons possess {{elaborate}} dendritic arbors which {{receive and}} integrate excitatory synaptic signals. Individual dendritic subbranches exhibit local membrane potential supralinearities, termed dendritic spikes, which control transfer of local synaptic input to the soma. Here, {{we show that}} dendritic spikes in CA 1 pyramidal cells are strongly regulated by specific types of prior input. While input in the linear range is without effect, supralinear <b>input</b> <b>inhibits</b> subsequent spikes, causing them to attenuate and ultimately fail due to dendritic Na+ channel inactivation. This mechanism acts locally {{within the boundaries of}} the input branch. If an input is sufficiently strong to trigger axonal action potentials, their back-propagation into the dendritic tree causes a widespread global reduction in dendritic excitability which is prominent after firing patterns occurring in vivo. Together, these mechanisms control the capability of individual dendritic branches to trigger somatic action potential output. They are invoked at frequencies encountered during learning, and impose limits on the storage and retrieval rates of information encoded as branch excitability...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of chemoreceptor (CR) gene expression by environmental signals and internal cues {{may contribute to}} the modulation of multiple physiological processes and behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans. We previously showed that KIN- 29, a homolog of salt-inducible kinase, acts in sensory neurons to regulate the expression of a subset of CR genes, as well as sensory behaviors. Here we show that the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL- 4 acts partly in parallel with KIN- 29 to regulate CR gene expression. Sensory <b>inputs</b> <b>inhibit</b> both EGL- 4 and KIN- 29 functions, and KIN- 29 function is inhibited in turn by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activation. EGL- 4 and KIN- 29 regulate CR gene expression by antagonizing the gene repression functions of the class II HDAC HDA- 4 and the MEF- 2 transcription factor, and KIN- 29, EGL- 4, and PKA target distinct residues in HDA- 4 to regulate its function and subcellular localization. While KIN- 29 acts primarily via MEF- 2 /HDA- 4 to regulate additional sensory signal-regulated physiological processes and behaviors, EGL- 4 acts via both MEF- 2 -dependent and -independent pathways.

40|$|Background: Short-latency afferent {{inhibition}} (SAI) {{results when}} somatosensory afferent <b>input</b> <b>inhibits</b> the corticospinal output from primary motor cortex (M 1). The present study examined SAI in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle in individuals with {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) and uninjured controls. Methods: Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) was evoked by stimulating the median nerve at the elbow at intervals of 15, 20 and 25 ms in advance of a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse over M 1. SAI was tested with the FCR at rest and also during ~ 20 % of maximum voluntary contraction. Corticospinal output was assessed through measuring both motor thresholds and motor evoked potential (MEP) recruitment curves. The afferent volley was assessed via the N 20 -P 25 amplitude of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and the amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) recorded over the median nerve at the elbow. Results: SAI is reduced in SCI in both the contracted and non-contracted FCR muscle. MEP recruitment curves and thresholds were decreased in SCI only in the active state and not the resting state. N 20 -P 25 amplitude was similar between groups in both the resting and active states although SNAP was significantly reduced in SCI at rest. Conclusions: We conclude that reduced SAI in SCI is likely attributed to neuroplasticity altering the intrinsic M 1 circuitry mediating SAI and/or reduced afferent input traversing a direct thalamocortical route to M 1. These data provide a new avenue of research aimed at identifying therapeutic approaches to alter SAI to improve upper limb function in individuals with SCI...|$|R
40|$|Gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp {{recordings}} {{were made}} from slices of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of adult rats to characterize the role of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in the circadian timing system. During the day, activation of GABA(A) receptors hyperpolarized the membrane of SCN neurons. During the night, however, activation of GABA(A) receptors either hyperpolarized or depolarized the membrane. These night-restricted depolarizations in a large subset of SCN neurons were capable of triggering spikes and thus appeared to be excitatory. The GABA(A) reversal potentials of SCN neurons revealed a significant day-night difference with more depolarized GABA(A) reversal potentials during the night than during the day. The emergence of depolarizing GABA(A) -mediated responses in a subset of SCN neurons at night can be ascribed to a depolarizing shift in GABA(A) reversal potential. The GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (12. 5 microM) increased the spontaneous firing rate of all SCN neurons during the day, indicating that spontaneous GABA(A) -mediated <b>inputs</b> <b>inhibited</b> the SCN neurons during this period. The effect of bicuculline (12. 5 microM) on the spontaneous firing rate of SCN neurons during the night was heterogeneous due to the mixture of depolarizing and hyperpolarizing GABA(A) -mediated inputs during this period. We conclude that GABA uniformly acts as an inhibitory transmitter during the day but excites a large subset of SCN neurons at night. This day-night modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission provides the SCN with a time-dependent gating mechanism that may counteract propagation of excitatory signals throughout the biological clock at day but promotes it at night...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{whether in}} human subjects indirect corticospinal excitation of upper limb motoneurones (MNs) relayed through presumed cervical propriospinal neurones (PNs) is paralleled by corticospinal activation of inhibitory projections to these premotoneurones. The responses to {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS), whether assessed as the compound motor-evoked potential (MEP) or the peak of corticospinal excitation elicited in the post-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of single motor units, were conditioned by weak volleys to musculo-cutaneous, ulnar and superficial radial nerves. Afferent volleys, which hardly modified the H reflex, significantly facilitated the corticospinal response produced by weak TMS. In PSTHs, the central delay of the peripheral facilitation of the peak of corticospinal excitation in MNs located {{at either end of}} the cervical enlargement was longer the more caudal the MN pool, suggesting an interaction in premotoneurones located rostral to the tested MNs. Small increases in the strength of TMS (≈ 2 - 5 % of the maximal stimulator output) caused the facilitation to disappear and then to be reversed to inhibition. The facilitatory and inhibitory effects had the same latencies and spared the initial 0. 5 - 1 ms of the corticospinal excitatory response. Both effects were more readily demonstrable when there was a co-contraction of the target muscle and the muscle innervated by nerve used for the conditioning stimulus. The above features suggest that the inhibition resulted from disfacilitation due to suppression of corticospinal excitation passing through the presumed premotoneuronal relay. The reversal of the facilitation to inhibition by stronger corticospinal volleys is consistent with a well-developed system of ‘feedback inhibitory interneurones’ activated by corticospinal and afferent <b>inputs</b> <b>inhibiting</b> the presumed propriospinal excitatory premotoneurones. It is argued that these findings might explain why simply stimulating the pyramidal tract or the motor cortex would fail to demonstrate this indirect corticospinal projection in the macaque monkey and in humans...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate this issue by measuring the timing of the amplitude modulation of laser evoked potentials (LEPs) due to conditioning non-painful stimuli. LEPs were recorded from 31 scalp electrodes in 10 healthy subjects after painful stimulation of the right arm (C 6 -C 7 dermatomes). Non-painful electrical stimuli were applied by ring electrodes on the second and third finger of the right hand. Electrical stimuli were delivered at + 50, + 150, + 200 and + 250  ms interstimulus intervals (ISIs) after the laser pulses. LEPs obtained without any conditioning stimulation were used as a baseline. As compared to the baseline, non-painful electrical stimulation reduced the amplitude of the vertex N 2 /P 2 LEP component and the laser pain rating when electrical stimuli followed the laser pulses only at + 150 and + 200  ms ISIs. As at these ISIs the collision between the non-painful and painful input is likely to take place at the cortical level, we can conclude that the late processing of painful (thermal) stimuli is partially inhibited by the processing of non-painful (cutaneous) stimuli within the cerebral cortex.

An intoxicating concentration of ethanol (50 mM) produced inhibitory effects on striatal large aspiny cholinergic interneurons (LAIs) and low-threshold spike interneurons (LTSIs). These effects persisted {{in the presence}} of tetrodotoxin and were due to an increase in potassium currents, including those responsible for medium and slow afterhyperpolarizations. In contrast, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) were directly excited by ethanol, which depolarised these neurons through the suppression of potassium currents. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) became hyperpolarized {{in the presence of}} ethanol, but this effect did not persist in the presence of tetrodotoxin and was mimicked and occluded by application of the M 1 muscarinic receptor antagonist telenzepine.

Aggregation-induced emission logic gates were fabricated {{based on the}} metal ion sensing of Phen- 1 TPE conjugates via control of the metal ions and solvents. In THF-water with fw = 90 %, Phen- 1 TPE exhibits a strong AIE effect, while the fluorescence is almost totally quenched upon the addition of Cu 2 + compared to other metal ions. Phen- 1 TPE works as an "INHIBIT" logic gate, with Cu 2 + and aggregation ("Agg") as the inputs and the fluorescence as the output.

40|$|In the {{mammalian}} inner ear, {{the gain}} control of auditory inputs is exerted by medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons that innervate cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs). OHCs mechanically amplify the incoming sound waves {{by virtue of their}} electromotile properties while the MOC system reduces the gain of auditory <b>inputs</b> by <b>inhibiting</b> OHC function. How this process is orchestrated at the synaptic level remains unknown. In the present study, MOC firing was evoked by electrical stimulation in an isolated mouse cochlear preparation, while OHCs postsynaptic responses were monitored by whole-cell recordings. These recordings confirmed that electrically evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs) are mediated solely by α 9 β 10 nAChRs functionally coupled to calcium-activated SK 2 channels. Synaptic release occurred with low probability when MOC-OHC synapses were stimulated at 1 Hz. However, as the stimulation frequency was raised, the reliability of release increased due to presynaptic facilitation. In addition, the relatively slow decay of eIPSCs gave rise to temporal summation at stimulation frequencies > 10 Hz. The combined effect of facilitation and summation resulted in a frequency-dependent increase in the average amplitude of inhibitory currents in OHCs. Thus, we have demonstrated that short-term plasticity is responsible for shaping MOC inhibition and, therefore, encodes the transfer function from efferent firing frequency to the gain of the cochlear amplifier. © 2011 the authors.

40|$|Some {{amphibian}} brain-melanotrope {{cell systems}} {{are used to}} study how neuronal and (neuro) endocrine mechanisms convert environmental signals into physiological responses. Pituitary melanotropes release alpha-melanophore-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), which controls skin color in response to background light stimuli. Xenopus laevis suprachiasmatic neurons receive optic <b>input</b> and <b>inhibit</b> melanotrope activity by releasing neuropeptide Y (NPY), dopamine (DA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) when animals are placed on a light background. Under this condition, they strengthen their synaptic contacts with the melanotropes and enhance their secretory machinery by upregulating exocytosis-related proteins (e. g. SNAP- 25). The inhibitory transmitters converge on the adenylyl cyclase system, regulating Ca(2 +) channel activity. Other messengers like thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH, from the magnocellular nucleus), noradrenalin (from the locus coeruleus), serotonin (from the raphe nucleus) and acetylcholine (from the melanotropes themselves) stimulate melanotrope activity. Ca(2 +) enters the cell and the resulting Ca(2 +) oscillations trigger alpha-MSH secretion. These intracellular Ca(2 +) dynamics can be described by a mathematical model. The oscillations travel as a wave through the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus where they may induce the expression of genes involved in biosynthesis and processing (7 B 2, PC 2) of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and release (SNAP- 25, munc 18) of its end-products. We propose that various environmental factors (e. g. light and temperature) act via distinct brain centers in order to release various neuronal messengers that act on the melanotrope to control distinct subcellular events (e. g. hormone biosynthesis, processing and release) by specifically shaping the pattern of melanotrope Ca(2 +) oscillations...|$|R

This technique is demonstrated using measurements taken on a steel beam test rig and a passenger rail vehicle. The performance of this technique is discussed and compared to traditional input/output modal analysis and an existing cepstrum-based OMA technique.

Recordings at multiple depths in the entorhinal cortex were first used to characterize field potentials evoked by stimulation of the parasubiculum in urethane-anesthetized rats. Current source density analysis showed that a prominent surface-negative field potential component is generated by synaptic activation in layer II. The surface-negative field potential was also observed in rats with chronically implanted electrodes. The response was maintained during short stimulation trains of up to 125 Hz, suggesting that it is generated by activation of monosynaptic inputs to the entorhinal cortex. The piriform cortex also projects to layer II of the entorhinal cortex, and interactions between parasubicular and piriform cortex inputs were investigated using double-site stimulation tests. Simultaneous activation of parasubicular and piriform cortex inputs with high-intensity pulses resulted in smaller synaptic potentials than were expected {{on the basis of}} summing the individual responses, consistent with the termination of both pathways onto a common population of neurons. Paired-pulse tests were then used to assess the effect of parasubicular stimulation on responses to piriform cortex stimulation. Responses of the entorhinal cortex to piriform cortex <b>inputs</b> were <b>inhibited</b> when the parasubiculum was stimulated 5 ms earlier, and were enhanced when the parasubiculum was stimulated 20 to 150 ms earlier.

Attention in this theory reflects both current and previous attentional allocation, so that attention can build up and decay across more than one attentional fixation over time.

By comparing current and acoustic stimulation, three distinct patterns {{of the distribution of}} adaptation mechanisms within the sensory network emerged: (1) balanced influence of both intrinsic and presynaptic adaptation mechanisms in an interneuron that summates over several receptor afferents (TN 1), (2) predominantly <b>inhibiting</b> <b>input</b> as the source for spike frequency adaptation in a cell that transmits both pattern representation and directional information (BSN 1), (3) primarily intrinsic, spiketriggered adaptation currents within an interneuron coding exclusively for direction (AN 2). The time courses of spike frequency adaptation differed significantly between the cells types. Using the adaptation time constants, we were able to predict signal transmission properties for the different cells. We conclude that the adaptation mechanisms differ greatly among interneurons within this sensory pathway and are a function of their role in information processing.

40|$|AMPA receptors mediate rapid glutamatergic {{synaptic}} transmission. In the mammalian cochlear nuclei, neurons receive {{excitatory input}} from either auditory nerve fibers, parallel fibers, or both fiber systems. The functional correlates {{of differences in}} the source of input were examined by recording AMPA receptor-mediated, miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode from identified neurons. Bushy, octopus, and T-stellate cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) and tuberculoventral cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) receive most of their excitatory input from the auditory nerve; fusiform cells receive excitatory inputs from both the auditory nerve and parallel fibers; cartwheel cells receive excitatory input from parallel fibers alone. mEPSCs from bushy, octopus, T-stellate, and tuberculoventral cells had significantly faster decay time constants (0. 35 – 0. 40 msec) than did those from fusiform and cartwheel cells (1. 32 – 1. 79 msec). Some fusiform cells had two populations of mEPSCs with distinct time courses. mEPSCs in cells with auditory nerve <b>input</b> alone were <b>inhibited</b> by philanthotoxin, a blocker of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, whereas mEPSCs in cells with parallel fiber input were not. Thus AMPA receptors postsynaptic to the auditory nerve differ from those postsynaptic to parallel fibers both in channel-gating kinetics and in their permeability to calcium. These results confirm the conclusion that synaptic AMPA receptors are specialized {{according to the source}} o...|$|R
40|$|The Charge {{controller}} {{regulates the}} voltage output from the solar panel {{which is used}} to charge the battery and also the fixed logic system for control and timing, with the help of voltage regulator (LM 7805 and LM 7812) to achieve a steady output, which was used to power the 555 -timer for the generation of pulses and Johnson counter, CD 4017 (CMOS counter/divider). The CD 4017 counter serves as a decade counter, decoder and synchronous counter. The decoder is clocked from the decade counter after a count of ten and its outputs are inverted and put into the clock <b>inhibit</b> <b>input</b> of ten synchronous counters. Based on the traffic flow data collected from the junction, timing was given to each of the roads so as. At the beginning of the counts, the first pulse is fed into the S-input of an RS-flip flop and the end of that same count is fed into the R-input of the same flip flop. The output of the RS flip flop is then fed into a transistor amplifier for amplification for the indicators. This is done for the Green and amber/yellow of all the roads while that of the Reds for the roads are fed into an inverter (CD 40106) and the outputs are fed into the amplifier en-route to the indicators (LEDs) ...|$|R
40|$|Most axons {{connecting}} the thalamus and cortex {{in both directions}} pass through the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), {{a thin layer of}} GABAergic cells adjacent to the thalamus, and innervate neurons there. The TRN, therefore, is in a strategic location to regulate thalamo-cortical communication. We recordedneuronsof the somatosensory regionof theTRN ina thalamocortical slice preparation and studied the spatial organization of their thalamic input using laser scanning photostimulation. We show that the thalamoreticular pathway is organized topographically for most neurons. The somatosensory region of the TRN can be organized into three tiers. From the inner (thalamoreticular) border to the outer, in a manner roughly reciprocal to the reticulothalamic pathway, each of these tiers receives its input from one of the somatosensory relays of the thalamus—the posterior medial, ventroposterior medial, and ventroposterior lateral nuclei. What is surprising is that approximately a quarter of the recorded neurons received input frommultiple thalamic regions usually located indifferent nuclei. Theseneuronsdistribute evenly throughout the thickness of theTRN. Our results, therefore, suggest that there exist a subpopulation of TRN neurons that receive convergent inputs from multiple thalamic sources and engage in more complex patterns of inhibition of relay cells. We propose these neurons enable the TRN to act as an externally driven “searchlight ” that integrates cortical and subcortical <b>inputs</b> and then <b>inhibits</b> or disinhibits specific thalamic relay cells, so that appropriate information can get through the thalamus to the cortex...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{erosion of}} bank toe {{materials}} {{is the dominant}} factor controlling the long-term rate of riverbank retreat. In principle, hydraulic bank erosion can be quantified using an excess shear stress model, but difficulties in estimating <b>input</b> parameters seriously <b>inhibit</b> the predictive accuracy of this approach. Herein a combination of analytical modeling and novel field measurement techniques is employed to improve the parameterization of an excess shear stress model as applied to the Lower Mekong River. Boundary shear stress is estimated using a model (Kean and Smith, 2006 a, 2006 b) for flow over the irregular bank topography that is characteristic of fine-grained riverbanks. Bank erodibility parameters were obtained using a cohesive strength meter (Tolhurst et al., 1999). The new model was used to estimate annual bank erosion rates via integration across the Mekong's annual flow regime. Importantly, the simulations represent the first predictions of hydraulic bank erosion {{that do not require}} recourse to calibration, thereby providing a stronger physical basis for the simulation of bank erosion. Model predictions, as evaluated by comparing simulated annual rates of bank toe retreat with estimates of bank retreat derived from analysis of aerial photographs and satellite imagery, indicate a tendency to overpredict erosion (root-mean-square error equals ± 0. 53 m/yr). Form roughness induced by bank topographic features is shown to be a major component (61 %– 85 %) of the spatially averaged total shear stress, and as such it can be viewed as an important factor that self-limits bank erosion. <br/...|$|R
