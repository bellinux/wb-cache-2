50|$|Bruscia (1987) and Wigram (2004) {{introduced}} {{a variety of}} improvisational techniques in their books. Among these, {{there are a few}} major therapeutic techniques. Imitating is a basic technique of empathy <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>music</b> therapist copies or repeats a client's response, after the response has been displayed. <b>The</b> <b>music</b> therapist focuses on any sound, rhythm, interval or even facial expression. Reflecting is a technique <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>music</b> therapist expresses <b>the</b> same moods or feelings which have been presented by the client. Rhythmic grounding is implemented by establishing a steady beat or rhythm, supporting the client's improvisation. The use of a rhythmic ostinato is an example of rhythmic grounding. Dialoguing is a process <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>music</b> therapist and <b>the</b> client communicate through their improvisations. Lastly, accompanying is a technique <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>music</b> therapist supports <b>the</b> client's improvisation by giving an accompaniment that consists of rhythm, melody, and chord progressions.|$|R
