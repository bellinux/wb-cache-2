5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with <b>fluoroscopy</b> to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
5|$|Imaging techniques, such as x-ray, <b>fluoroscopy</b> and {{ultrasound}} {{are typically}} {{used to help}} guide {{the placement of the}} applicators to their correct positions and to further refine the treatment plan. CAT scans and MRI can also be used. Once the applicators are inserted, they are held in place against the skin using sutures or adhesive tape to prevent them from moving. Once the applicators are confirmed as being in the correct position, further imaging can be performed to guide detailed treatment planning.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to video}} <b>fluoroscopy,</b> X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3mm in size, {{are placed in}} and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Video <b>fluoroscopy</b> uses x-ray {{radiation}} to produce moving {{pictures of the}} mouth during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of dysphagia because {{of its ability to}} take videos of the entire digestive tract during swallowing events. It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by <b>fluoroscopy</b> and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluoroscopy</b> {{is similar}} to {{radiography}} and X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) in that it generates images using X-rays. The original difference was that radiography fixed still images on film whereas <b>fluoroscopy</b> provided live moving pictures that were not stored. However, today radiography, CT, and <b>fluoroscopy</b> are all digital imaging modes with image analysis software and data storage and retrieval.|$|E
25|$|Self-expandable {{metallic}} stents {{are typically}} inserted {{at the time}} of endoscopy, usually with assistance with <b>fluoroscopy</b> or x-ray images taken to guide placement. Prior to the development of SEMS small enough to pass through the channel of the endoscopy, SEMS were deployed using <b>fluoroscopy</b> alone.|$|E
25|$|The 3D image {{itself can}} be {{overlaid}} colour-coded {{on top of the}} fluoroscopic image. Any change of the angulations of the C-arm will cause the workstation to re-calculate in real-time the view on the 3D image to match exactly the view of the live 2D <b>fluoroscopy</b> image. Without additional contrast agent injection the surgeon can observe device movements simultaneously with the 3D overlay of the vessel contours in the <b>fluoroscopy</b> image.|$|E
25|$|Placement of a {{weighted}} feeding tube (e.g. Dobhoff) into the duodenum after previous attempts without <b>fluoroscopy</b> have failed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluoroscopy</b> allows {{real-time}} X-ray video, for precise kinematics {{of moving}} bones. Markers opaque to X-rays can allow simultaneous tracking of muscle length.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{owing to}} {{technological}} convergence, the word <b>fluoroscopy</b> is widely {{understood to be}} a hypernym of all the earlier names for moving pictures taken with X-rays, both live and recorded. Also owing to technological convergence, radiography, CT, and <b>fluoroscopy</b> are now all digital imaging modes using X-rays with image analysis software and easy data storage and retrieval. Just as movies, TV, and web videos are to a substantive extent no longer separate technologies but only variations on common underlying digital themes, so too are the X-ray imaging modes. And indeed, the term X-ray imaging is the ultimate hypernym that unites all of them, even subsuming both <b>fluoroscopy</b> and 4DCT. However, it may be many decades before the earlier hyponyms fall into disuse, not least because the day when 4D CT displaces all earlier forms of moving X-ray imaging may yet be distant.|$|E
25|$|Indocyanine green <b>fluoroscopy</b> is a safe, {{minimally}} invasive and useful tool for surgical evaluation. Microsurgeons use indocyanine green lymphography {{to assist in}} LVA surgeries.|$|E
25|$|During this infant {{commercial}} development, many incorrectly {{predicted that}} the moving images of <b>fluoroscopy</b> would completely replace roentgenographs (radiographic still image films), but the then superior diagnostic quality of the roentgenograph and their already alluded safety enhancement of lower radiation dose via shorter exposure prevented this from occurring. Another factor was that plain films inherently offered recording of the image in a simple and inexpensive way, whereas recording and playback of <b>fluoroscopy</b> remained a more complex and expensive proposition {{for decades to come}} (discussed in detail below).|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluoroscopy</b> is an imaging {{technique}} {{that uses a}} fluoroscope, in coordination with either a screen or image-capturing device to create real-time images of patients' internal structures.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{the focus}} of the test, {{calcification}} within the artery walls, located in the outer edges of atheroma within the artery walls, is sometimes recognizable on <b>fluoroscopy</b> (without contrast injection) as radiodense halo rings partially encircling, and separated from the blood filled lumen by the interceding radiolucent atheroma tissue and endothelial lining. Calcification, even though usually present, is usually only visible when quite advanced and calcified sections of the artery wall happen to be viewed on end tangentially through multiple rings of calcification, so as to create enough radiodensity to be visible on <b>fluoroscopy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Esophageal SEMS {{are placed}} after a {{gastroscopy}} is performed {{to identify the}} area of narrowing. The area {{may need to be}} dilated in order to allow the gastroscope to pass. The tumour is usually better seen with the direct vision of endoscopy than on a fluoroscopic image. As a result, radio-opaque markers are usually placed {{on the surface of the}} patient in order to mark the area of narrowing on <b>fluoroscopy.</b> The SEMS is placed through the channel of the endoscope into the esophagus over a guidewire, marked on <b>fluoroscopy,</b> and mechanically deployed (using a device that sits outside of the endoscope) such that it expands when in position. Hypaque or other water-soluble dye may be placed through the passage to ensure patency of the stent on <b>fluoroscopy.</b> Enteric and colonic SEMS are inserted in a similar fashion, but in the duodenum and colon respectively.|$|E
25|$|Biliary SEMS {{are used}} to palliatively treat tumours of the {{pancreas}} or bile duct that obstruct the common bile duct. They are inserted {{at the time of}} ERCP, a procedure that uses endoscopy and <b>fluoroscopy</b> to access the common bile duct. The bile duct is cannulated with the assistance of a guidewire and the sphincter of Oddi that is located at its base is typically cut. A wire is kept in the bile duct, and the SEMS is deployed over the wire in a similar fashion as esophageal stents. The location of the SEMS is confirmed by <b>fluoroscopy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{surgeons}} do {{not only}} verify {{the placement of}} complex endografts intraoperatively, they also use their angiography system and the applications it offers for planning the procedure. As anatomy changes between a preoperative CT and intraoperative <b>fluoroscopy</b> because of patient positioning and the insertion of stiff material, a much more precise planning is possible if the surgeon performs an intraoperative rotational angiography, takes an automatic segmentation of the aorta, places markers for the renal arteries and other landmarks in 3D and then overlays the contours on 2D <b>fluoroscopy.</b> This guidance is updated with any change in C-Arm angulation/position or table position.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} ion {{channels}} often involves biophysics, electrophysiology, and pharmacology, while using techniques including voltage clamp, patch clamp, immunohistochemistry, X-ray crystallography, <b>fluoroscopy,</b> and RT-PCR. Their classification as molecules {{is referred to}} as channelomics.|$|E
25|$|When using pulsed <b>fluoroscopy,</b> {{radiation}} dose is only applied in prespecified intervals of time, thus less dose {{is used to}} produce the same image sequence. For the time in between, the last image stored is displayed.|$|E
25|$|Chest photofluorography, or abreugraphy (also called mass {{miniature}} radiography), is a photofluorography {{technique for}} mass screening for tuberculosis using a miniature (50 to 100mm) {{photograph of the}} screen of an X-ray <b>fluoroscopy</b> of the thorax, first developed in 1936.|$|E
25|$|Plain {{radiography}} generally {{refers to}} projectional radiography (without {{the use of}} more advanced techniques such as computed tomography). Plain radiography can also refer to radiography without a radiocontrast agent or radiography that generates single static images, as contrasted to <b>fluoroscopy.</b>|$|E
25|$|The CBCT scanner {{is mounted}} on a C-arm in the IR suite, which offers real time imaging with a {{stationary}} patient. This eliminates {{the time needed to}} transfer a patient from the angiography suite to a conventional computed tomography scanner and facilitates a broad spectrum of applications of CBCT during IR procedures. The clinical applications of CBCT in IR include treatment planning, device or implant positioning and assessment, intra-procedural localization, and assessment of procedure endpoints. CBCT is useful as a primary and supplemental form of imaging. It is an excellent adjunct to DSA and <b>fluoroscopy</b> for soft tissue and vascular visibility during complex procedures. The use of CBCT before <b>fluoroscopy</b> potentially reduces patient radiation exposure.|$|E
25|$|There {{are both}} {{technical}} measures taking by x-ray equipment manufacturers to reduce dose constantly and handling {{options for the}} staff to reduce dose depending on the clinical application. Among the former is beam hardening. Among the latter are frame rate settings, pulsed <b>fluoroscopy</b> and collimation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluoroscopy</b> {{produces}} real-time {{images of}} internal {{structures of the}} body in a similar fashion to radiography, but employs a constant input of x-rays, at a lower dose rate. Contrast media, such as barium, iodine, and air are used to visualize internal organs as they work. <b>Fluoroscopy</b> is also used in image-guided procedures when constant feedback during a procedure is required. An image receptor is required to convert the radiation into an image after it has passed through the area of interest. Early on this was a fluorescing screen, which gave way to an Image Amplifier (IA) which was a large vacuum tube that had the receiving end coated with cesium iodide, and a mirror at the opposite end. Eventually the mirror was replaced with a TV camera.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} {{radiation}} induced skin injuries {{was performed in}} 1994 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) followed by an advisory to minimize further fluoroscopy-induced injuries. The problem of radiation injuries due to <b>fluoroscopy</b> has been further addressed in review articles in 2000 and 2010.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{tubes are}} used in medical imaging among other uses. X-ray tubes used for continuous-duty {{operation}} in <b>fluoroscopy</b> and CT imaging equipment may use a focused cathode and a rotating anode to dissipate the large amounts of heat thereby generated. These are housed in an oil-filled aluminium housing to provide cooling.|$|E
25|$|Edison is {{credited}} with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses X-rays to take radiographs. Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate <b>fluoroscopy</b> screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm Röntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.|$|E
25|$|Imaging {{technologies}} are often essential to medical diagnosis, and are typically {{the most complex}} equipment found in a hospital including: <b>fluoroscopy,</b> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography (PET), PET-CT scans, projection radiography such as X-rays and CT scans, tomography, ultrasound, optical microscopy, and electron microscopy.|$|E
25|$|The double {{incision}} {{surgery and}} {{minimally invasive surgery}} seeks to reduce soft tissue damage through reducing {{the size of the}} incision. However, component positioning accuracy and visualization of the bone structures is significantly impaired. This can result in unintended fractures and soft tissue injury. Surgeons using these approaches are advised to use intraoperative x-ray <b>fluoroscopy</b> or computer guidance systems.|$|E
25|$|Local {{anesthetic}} nerve blocks are sterile {{procedures that}} can be performed {{with the help of}} ultrasound, <b>fluoroscopy</b> (a live X-ray), or CT. Use of any one of these imaging modalities enables the physician to view the placement of the needle. Electrical stimulation can also provide feedback on the proximity of the needle to the target nerve.|$|E
25|$|By comparison, the {{radiation}} dose from chest radiography (about 0.06 mSv) is {{a fraction of}} the annual naturally occurring background radiation dose. A chest CT delivers 5 to 8 mSv. A whole-body PET/CT scan can deliver 14 to 32 mSv depending on the protocol. The dose from <b>fluoroscopy</b> of the stomach is much higher, approximately 50 mSv (14 times the annual background).|$|E
25|$|For {{guidance}} regarding catheter positions {{during the}} examination, the physician mostly relies on detailed knowledge of internal anatomy, guide wire and catheter behavior and intermittently, briefly uses <b>fluoroscopy</b> {{and a low}} X-ray dose to visualize when needed. This is done without saving recordings of these brief looks. When the physician is ready to record diagnostic views, which are saved and can be more carefully scrutinized later, he activates the equipment to apply a significantly higher X-ray dose, termed cine, {{in order to create}} better quality motion picture images, having sharper radiodensity contrast, typically at 30 frames per second. The physician controls both the contrast injection, <b>fluoroscopy</b> and cine application timing so as to minimize the total amount of radiocontrast injected and times the X-Ray to the injection so as to minimize the total amount of X-ray used. Doses of radiocontrast agents and X-ray exposure times are routinely recorded in an effort to maximize safety.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{electronics}} {{were applied}} to <b>fluoroscopy</b> {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, when Frederick G. Weighart and James F. McNulty (1929-2014) at Automation Industries, Inc., then, in El Segundo, California produced on a fluoroscope the world’s first image to be digitally generated in real-time, while developing a later commercialized portable apparatus for the onboard nondestructive testing of naval aircraft. Square wave signals were detected on a fluorescent screen to create the image.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1980s onward, digital imaging {{technology}} was reintroduced to <b>fluoroscopy</b> after development of improved detector systems. Modern improvements in screen phosphors, digital image processing, image analysis, and flat panel detectors have allowed for increased image quality while minimizing the radiation dose to the patient. Modern fluoroscopes use caesium iodide (CsI) screens and produce noise-limited images, {{ensuring that the}} minimal radiation dose results while still obtaining images of acceptable quality.|$|E
25|$|Two {{forms of}} {{radiographic}} images are {{in use in}} medical imaging. Projection radiography and <b>fluoroscopy,</b> with the latter being useful for catheter guidance. These 2D techniques are still in wide use despite the advance of 3D tomography due to the low cost, high resolution, and depending on application, lower radiation dosages. This imaging modality utilizes a wide beam of x rays for image acquisition and is the first imaging technique available in modern medicine.|$|E
