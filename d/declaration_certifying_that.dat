40|$|The Java thread {{mechanism}} {{allows the}} exploitation of parallelism {{within the confines of}} shared memory multiprocessors by allowing multiple threads to be mapped onto distinct physical processors. Distributed memory machines, however, have been unable to harness the simplicity and elegance of this approach, their programming being reliant on more complex message-passing techniques. Java Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) implementations seek to redress this situation by allowing the thread model to be extended into the realm of distributed memory multicomputers. While a number of Java DSM systems have been implemented, up until now no direct comparison of them has been conducted. This project presents a survey of Java DSM implementations and introduces a multithreaded benchmark suite which can be used to compare the scalability and performance of such systems. Preliminary tests of a number of Java DSM systems were then undertaken using the suite. ii <b>Declaration</b> I <b>certify</b> <b>that</b> this report does not incorporate, without acknowledgment, any material previously submitted for a degree or diploma in any University; and that {{to the best of my}} knowledge and belief it does not contain any material previously published or written by another person except where reference is made in the text...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{compares the}} views of 54 indigenous and 29 Bengali students and five teachers of four schools of Rangamati on the existent teaching techniques of English classes at the secondary level. The researcher has observed three English text based classes and two grammar classes. A total of 83 students and five teachers were given two different sets of questionnaires to collect responses. The finds show that all classes were conducted by the teachers in both English and Bangla languages, and the indigenous learners were more comfortable to have a teacher from their own community. Moreover, all the students wanted to have interactive games and tasks in class. Though such tasks are given in the NCTB book English for Today, the teachers {{do not try to}} use them at all as they think that it is time consuming. The research can be used in the indigenous schools as an example to implement the most preferred and effective teaching techniques in English classes. 1 <b>Declaration</b> I <b>certify</b> <b>that</b> the work presented in this thesis is, {{to the best of my}} knowledge and belief, wherever contributions of other sources and information have been used, they have been acknowledged.

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} Internet access for {{businesses}} and individuals has seen an increasing demand on the IPv 4 address space and made IP addresses a valuable asset. As with any asset, a company’s IP address space must be managed well and protected {{from those who}} would damage or despoil it. A system to assist an organization with its efforts ought to be welcome indeed. The main goal of this project is to create such a system. The project analyzes some currently employed methods of IP address management and prevention of IP theft in particular. Methods such as layer- 2 -implemented theft prevention and passive reconnaissance tools are discussed and their shortcomings noted. A review of the pertinent literature is offered. The proposed solution, a combination of an active reconnaissance tool and record management system, is explained from both design and construction aspects. Finally, the system is evaluated and, based on its user reception and performance, recommendations are made for further work. <b>DECLARATION</b> I hereby <b>certify</b> <b>that</b> this dissertation constitutes my own product, tha...|$|R

2500|$|In 1975 Don Javier abdicated as the Carlist king {{in favor}} of Carlos Hugo and {{according}} to a source, he would have expelled Sixto from Carlism for refusing to recognize the decision. It {{is not clear what}} his view on the commencing Spanish transición was; following the 1976 Montejurra events he lamented the dead, and officially disowned political line of Don Sixto and called for Carlist unity. However, on a private letter, Don Javier claimed that at Montejurra [...] "the Carlists have confronted the revolutionaries", which has been interpreted as the followers of Don Sixto being the real Carlists according to Don Javier. Early March 1977 proved convulsive. On Friday 4th, accompanied by his son Sixto, he was interviewed by the Spanish press and his responses showed Carlist orthodoxy. That same day he issued a <b>declaration</b> <b>certified</b> by a Paris notary objecting to his name being used to legitimize a [...] "grave doctrinal error within Carlism", and implicitly disowned the political line promoted by Carlos Hugo. However in few days Don Javier issued another <b>declaration,</b> <b>certified</b> by a different Paris notary, confirming his oldest son as [...] "my only political successor and head of Carlism". In order to justify the first declaration, Carlos Hugo alerted the police that his father had been abducted by Sixto, an accusation which was denied publicly by Don Javier himself. Then it was Doña Madalena who declared that her husband had been taken by Carlos Hugo from hospital against medical advice and his own will, and that Carlos Hugo had threatened his father to sign the second declaration. Eventually Don Javier was transferred to Switzerland, where he died shortly; the widow blamed the oldest son and 3 daughters for his death.|$|R
