5|$|Traditional diamond mining {{has led to}} human-rights {{abuses in}} Africa and elsewhere. The 2006 Hollywood movie Blood Diamond helped to {{publicize}} the situation. Consumer demand for synthetic diamonds is increasing, albeit <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> base, as customers look for stones which are ethically sound, and are cheaper.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E
5|$|Alex - a 15-year-old boy <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{town with}} dreams of {{becoming}} an adventurer. Alex is a mostly silent protagonist, typical for a Japanese RPG he never speaks in the game, except for one cutscene where he confronts Ghaleon, {{and in the last}} cutscene of the game where he yells Luna's name.|$|E

5|$|Coming <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (which {{are also a}} form of external debt). Households also took on {{a large amount of}} debt, equivalent to 213% of disposable income, which led to inflation. This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E
5|$|Despite being <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> Episcopal {{university}} {{in the mountains of}} Tennessee, the team came to dominate football in the region during the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Like several other football powers of yore such as the University of Chicago, Sewanee today emphasizes scholarship over athletics.|$|E
5|$|Garran {{joked that}} the long work of the {{drafting}} committee breached the Factory Acts, the group (primarily Barton, Richard O'Connor, John Downer and Garran) often working {{late into the night}} preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention's last day, Barton had gone to bed exhausted in the small hours, Garran and Charles Gavan Duffy finishing the final schedule of amendments at breakfast time. The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which would ultimately, aside <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> amendment arranged at the last minute in London, become the Constitution of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Green Wings {{title is}} said to have come <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> plastic green man with wings that was in {{executive}} producer Peter Fincham's top pocket, and fell on Pile's desk. Fincham claimed it was not his, so Pile kept it. This plastic man appears {{at the end of the}} credits on every show.|$|E
5|$|Historically part of Lancashire, Worsley has {{provided}} evidence of Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity, including two Roman roads. The completion in 1761 of the Bridgewater Canal allowed Worsley to expand <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> village of cottage industries to an important town based upon cotton manufacture, iron-working, brick-making and extensive coal mining. Later expansion came after the First and Second World Wars, when large urban estates {{were built in the}} region.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{there was an}} old ferry road near the mouth of Little Wapwallopen Creek. A {{railroad}} bridge also crosses the creek. Historically, a road ran <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> settlement on Big Wapwallopen Creek to an even smaller one on Little Wapwallopen Creek, near where Church Road presently is. The Glen Brook Water Company once had plans to construct a dam on the creek and also on its tributary Pond Creek. The Wilkes-Barre Ice Company and the Hazleton Ice Company also dammed a stream in the creek's watershed in 1912 and 1916 respectively, forming the Ice Ponds.|$|E

5|$|Later work by Wolfram {{identifies}} the one-dimensional Rule 37R automaton as being particularly interesting in this respect. When {{run on a}} finite array of cells with periodic boundary conditions, starting <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> seed of random cells centered within a larger empty neighborhood, it tends to fluctuate between ordered and chaotic states. However, with the same initial conditions on an unbounded set of cells its configurations tend to organize themselves into several types of simple moving particles.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 1918 on {{the west}} bank of the River Jordan, Palestine, when his {{squadron}} was charging a strong enemy position, Ressaidar Badlu Singh realised that heavy casualties were being inflicted <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> hill occupied by machine-guns and 200 infantry. Without any hesitation he collected six other ranks and with entire disregard of danger he charged and captured the position. He was mortally wounded on the very top of the hill when capturing one of the machine-guns single handed, but all the guns and infantry had surrendered to him before he died.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{the site}} of the Ein Husub police station during the British Mandate of Palestine, the {{location}} was captured by the Israel Defense Forces in 1948. The village of Ir Ovot was founded in 1967, in an area deserted apart <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> military base and roadside cafe on the way to Eilat. It was founded by a group of American Jews led by former law student and court clerk Rabbi Simcha Pearlmutter, a Jew from Miami, Florida.|$|E

5|$|Ottoman {{records from}} 1906 show around 5,000 Circassians living in Amman and {{virtually}} no inhabitants who spoke Arabic. The city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision {{to construct the}} Hejaz Railway, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade. Because of its location along the railway, Amman was transformed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> village into a major commercial hub in the region.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk. II system, which allowed radar operators {{to determine whether a}} blip on their screen was a friendly aircraft. IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch out in time <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E
5|$|The Committee was {{established}} in September 1914, shortly after the German army occupied Brussels, under the name Comité Central de Secours et d'Alimentation ("Central Relief and Food Committee"). It was supported by voluntary contributions <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> group of notable financiers and businessmen, including Ernest Solvay, Dannie Heineman and Émile Francqui.|$|E
