In this paperwe investigate a packet routing and information <b>gathering</b> in lines, <b>rings</b> and trees. In information gathering all injected packets have the same destination. Information gathering is widely used inmany networks (e. g sensor networks). We also consider the multi destination routing in which the destination of a packet might be any node in the network. We model {{the problem of}} packet routing on a unidirectional line or ring or tree as follows. Anetwork ha...|$|R
40|$|SRDSW : 2014 IEEE 33 rd International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems Workshops, 6 - 9 Oct. 2014, Nara, JapanWe {{investigate}} in {{this paper}} the <b>gathering</b> problem on <b>ring</b> shaped networks where {{the aim is to}} ensure that a collection of identical, oblivious and asynchronous mobile robots meet (gather) in one location not known in advance. Robots operate in cycles that consist of three phases: Look, Compute and Move. During the first phase, robots take a snapshot to see the positions of the other robots. In the second phase, they make a decision to move or to stay idle. In the last phase, they move towards a computed destination if any. While most of the previous works in the discrete universe, under this setting consider that robots have an unlimited visibility i. e., each robot is able to see the position of all the other robots in the system, only few studies have been devoted recently to the case where robots have a restricted visibility. In our work, we continue the investigation aiming to characterize the cases in which the problem can be solved...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{describe}} the emergent interaction system of letterboxing in North America. Letterboxing is a hobby that can trace its roots to treasure hunting and orienteering. A letterbox is a container holding a logbook and carved rubber stamp found by following clues. Participants use the stamp to make an imprint in their personal journal, and in turn, they record their personal stamp and a message in the letterbox's logbook. Letterboxing has been growing rapidly in North America since its start in 1998; currently 21, 498 letterbox clues are listed on {{just one of the}} hobby's largest websites. I recruited 355 participants for this study through invitations on websites used by letterboxers. I conducted the research using a combination of descriptive qualitative methods and qualitative analysis of data from three open-ended questions gathered on an online survey instrument. I designed survey items to gather data that described the participants and their behaviors including demographics, participation activities, and communication activities. I then analyzed these data using frequencies, percentages, and cross tabulations. Participants in the study were predominantly white, female, under the age of 50 and educated. I used content analysis of survey data obtained through open-ended questions to identify impetus, motivation, and emergent behaviors. The impetus for participation varies from hearing about it from a friend or relative to publications and broadcasts. Others stumbled across letterboxing via Internet searches or by finding a letterbox in the woods unintentionally. The "thrill of the hunt," hiking, and a love of the outdoors are primary motivations for participation. Made possible by the interconnectivity of the Internet, an informal collective has emerged that embraces individual variants and claims it for its own in an online learning community. Community activities such as <b>gatherings,</b> web <b>rings,</b> talk lists, discussion boards, and postal letterboxing bring participants together, increase engagement, and build community around similar interests. Collaborative innovations, or emergent interactions of participants, create new forms of letterboxing and lead to experimentation, probing, learning, and enhancement of individual experience. A model of emergent interaction is presented in the conclusion section. Department of Educational StudiesThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|Otoliths from 10 {{northern}} Atlantic albacore of 40 - 44 cm fork length {{were collected}} and daily ring counts were taken. Four {{out of these}} 10 specimens were concurrently performing its respective 1 st dorsal spine cross-section ring reading. The otolith growth pattern of daily rings {{can be described as}} (1) a clear nuclei piled with constant oval shaped ring increment to about 12 counts, yet unfortunately, this segment was often lost; (2) followed by greater ring increment alongside the oval long axis direction for a period of time; (3) then followed by a sudden shifting of growth direction of about 60 degrees toward the oval short axis, {{in such a way that}} often produced a notch alongside the oval long axis. A In company with such growth pattern, four groups of daily <b>ring</b> <b>gatherings</b> can be identified. The spine cross-section, on the other hand, a symmetric structure alongside the sagital plane was observed. In principle, the ring mark that appeared at each side of the two structures should be identical. Often it is not the case. It is thus postulated that the least, or a common denominator, count of ring mark should be viewed as the most appropriate figure for the specimen. Judged by the totality of a spine cross-section ring mark, all four specimens contain only one ring, which is roughly at 200 - 250 daily ring counts of the same individual. Although evidence that the spine 1 st ring mark corresponds to a growth pattern change in daily rings seems to exist, further confirmative analyses are still needed. RÉSUM...|$|R
40|$|The compact multi-transiting planet systems {{discovered}} by Kepler challenge planet formation theo-ries. Formation in situ from disks with radial mass surface density, Σ, profiles {{similar to the}} minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) but boosted in normalization by factors & 10 has been suggested. We propose that a more natural way to create these planets in the inner disk is formation sequentially from the inside-out via creation of successive gravitationally unstable rings fed from a continuous stream of small (∼cm–m size) “pebbles”, drifting inwards via gas drag. Pebbles collect at the pres-sure maximum associated with {{the transition from a}} magneto-rotational instability (MRI) -inactive (“dead zone”) region to an inner MRI-active zone. A pebble ring builds up until it either becomes gravitationally unstable to form an ∼ 1 M ⊕ planet directly or induces gradual planet formation via core accretion. The planet may undergo Type I migration into the active region, allowing a new pebble ring and planet to form behind it. Alternatively if migration is inefficient, the planet may continue to accrete from the disk until it becomes massive enough to isolate itself from the accretion flow. A variety of densities may result depending on the relative importance of residual gas accretion as the planet approaches its isolation mass. The process can repeat with a new pebble <b>ring</b> <b>gathering</b> at the new pressure maximum associated with the retreating dead zone boundary. Our simple ana-lytical model for this scenario of inside-out planet formation yields planetary masses, relative mass scalings with orbital radius, and minimum orbital separations consistent with those seen by Kepler. It provides an explanation of how massive planets can form with tightly-packed and well-aligned system architectures, starting from typical protoplanetary disk properties.

40|$|The Kepler-discovered Systems with Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs), {{typically}} {{with several}} planets of Earth to super-Earth masses on well-aligned, sub-AU orbits may host {{the most common}} type of planets, including habitable planets, in the Galaxy. They pose a great challenge for planet formation theories, which fall into two broad classes: (1) formation further out followed by inward migration; (2) formation in situ, in the very inner regions of the protoplanetary disk. We review the pros and cons of these classes, before focusing on a new theory of sequential in situ formation from the inside-out via creation of successive gravitationally unstable rings fed from a continuous stream of small (~cm-m size) "pebbles," drifting inward via gas drag. Pebbles first collect at the pressure trap associated with the transition from a magnetorotational instability (MRI) -inactive ("dead zone") region to an inner, MRI-active zone. A pebble ring builds up that begins to dominate the local mass surface density of the disk and spawns a planet. The planet continues to grow, most likely by pebble accretion, until it becomes massive enough to isolate itself from the accretion flow via gap opening. This reduces the local gas density near the planet, leading to enhanced ionization and a retreat of the dead zone inner boundary. The process repeats with a new pebble <b>ring</b> <b>gathering</b> at the new pressure maximum associated with this boundary. We discuss the theory's predictions for planetary masses, relative mass scalings with orbital radius, and minimum orbital separations, and their comparison with observed systems. Finally, we discuss open questions, including potential causes of diversity of planetary system architectures, i. e., STIPs versus Solar System analogs.
