25|$|District Attorney <b>Gil</b> <b>Garcetti</b> {{elected to}} file charges in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, {{as opposed to}} Santa Monica, where the crime took place. The decision {{would prove to be}} highly controversial, especially after Simpson was acquitted. It likely resulted in a jury pool with more Latinos, blacks, Asian-Americans, and blue-collar workers than would have been found from Santa Monica.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{a similar}} case, {{in that it}} {{involved}} an assistant district attorney in a large city challenging a nationally known superior over a job action, came before the Court. In Garcetti v. Ceballos, a Los Angeles County prosecutor claimed the office of <b>Gil</b> <b>Garcetti</b> had retaliated against him {{with a series of}} adverse personnel moves after he questioned the veracity of a search warrant affidavit following a conversation with a defense attorney, to the point of testifying to them in a hearing. It was initially argued with O'Connor's seat vacant following her retirement, and the justices deadlocked. Following the appointment of Samuel Alito, it was reargued and he cast the deciding vote to reverse the Ninth Circuit and find that Ceballos had not been unduly deprived of his First Amendment rights.|$|E
25|$|Richard Ceballos {{had been}} {{employed}} since 1989 as a {{deputy district attorney}} for the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, {{which at the time}} was headed by <b>Gil</b> <b>Garcetti.</b> After the defense attorney in a pending criminal case contacted Ceballos about his motion to challenge a critical search warrant based on inaccuracies in the supporting affidavit, Ceballos conducted his own investigation and determined that the affidavit contained serious misrepresentations. Ceballos contacted the deputy sheriff who had sworn out the affidavit but was not satisfied by his explanations. Ceballos then communicated his findings to his supervisors and submitted a memorandum in which he recommended dismissal of the case. A meeting was subsequently held to discuss the affidavit with his superiors and officials from the sheriff's department, which Ceballos claimed became heated and accusatory of his role in handling the case. Despite Ceballos’ concerns, his supervisor decided to proceed with the prosecution. The criminal trial court held a hearing on the motion, during which Ceballos was called by the defense to recount his observations about the affidavit. The trial court nevertheless denied the motion and upheld the warrant.|$|E

500|$|The Chandlers' lawyer Mr. Feldman {{explicitly}} stated [...] "nobody bought anybody's silence". Bribery to not {{testify in}} a trial is a felony according to California Penal Code 138.

500|$|A {{week after}} the {{settlement}} of the Chandler's lawsuit was announced on January 25, 1994, L.A. District Attorney <b>Gil</b> <b>Garcetti</b> announced he supported amending a law that prohibits forcing {{people who say they}} have been sexually assaulted to testify in criminal proceedings. The amendment introduced into the state assembly the week of February 7 would have immediately allowed Garcetti to compel Jordan to testify. Around that time, Santa Barbara police interviewed the 13-year-old son of one of Jackson's former maids (who had told them her son had spent time with Jackson) and then arranged for him to see a therapist after he repeatedly denied being abused. [...] In a deposition, his mother stated when she asked the police about who she could speak to about her concerns about their meetings and phone conversations with her son without her present, they arranged for her and her son to see separate therapists. On April 11, 1994, the grand jury session in Santa Barbara was extended for an additional 90-day term to allow Sneddon to gather more evidence and prosecution sources admitted to being frustrated in their grand jury probe, failing to find direct evidence of the molestation charges. The final grand jury ultimately disbanded without ever returning an indictment against Jackson.|$|E

Three months after the incident, the LAPD unit investigating the shooting found that Lyga had acted according to department policy, and the department's shooting board recommended no disciplinary action.|$|E

5000|$|After the trial, {{there was}} {{widespread}} pressure on Los Angeles County district attorney <b>Gil</b> <b>Garcetti</b> to bring perjury charges against Fuhrman. Garcetti initially refused, saying that Fuhrman's use of racist language was [...] "not {{material to the}} case", a major element of proving perjury. However, many members of Garcetti's office made public statements on the issue, and Garcetti, citing the high emotions in his office about the Simpson case, opted to tender the decision to prosecute to Attorney General Dan Lungren, to avoid {{the appearance of a}} conflict of interest.|$|E
50|$|Since its {{creation}} {{until the end}} of 2011, the law had resulted in 13 executions and cost taxpayers $4 billion, according to a study co-authored by Loyola Law School professor Paula Mitchell. Mitchell and U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Arthur L. Alarcon estimated California was spending $184 million a year on lawyers, expert witnesses and secure prisons associated with the death row population created by Proposition 7. Ron Briggs, son of John Briggs, joined Heller and others in seeking to repeal Proposition 7, including Jeanne Woodford, a former warden at San Quentin State Prison, and former Los Angeles district attorney <b>Gil</b> <b>Garcetti.</b> Arguments for repeal have focused on the costs and the ethics of the death penalty.|$|E
5000|$|Many city officials, {{including}} Los Angeles County District Attorney <b>Gil</b> <b>Garcetti,</b> {{expressed a}} lack of confidence with Chief Parks' handling of the investigation. [...] On September 19, 2000, the Los Angeles City Council voted 10 to 2 to accept a consent decree allowing the U.S. Department of Justice to oversee and monitor reforms within the LAPD {{for a period of}} five years. The Justice Department, which had been investigating the LAPD since 1996, agreed not to pursue a civil rights lawsuit against the city. Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Police Chief Bernard Parks opposed the consent decree, but were forced to back down in the face of overwhelming support by the city council.|$|E
50|$|It {{would be}} more than 20 years before the Court again took a case turning on the private speech of public employees. In Garcetti v. Ceballos the respondent, another {{prosecutor}} in a large city, challenged as unconstitutional an adverse employment action by his superior, Los Angeles County District Attorney <b>Gil</b> <b>Garcetti.</b> He had recommended a case be dismissed after he had come to believe a deputy sheriff had made misrepresentations on a search warrant affidavit, which caused some friction between the district attorney's office and the sheriff's office and ultimately testified on the defense's behalf in an attempt to suppress the evidence obtained through the warrant. In response, he claimed, he was denied an expected promotion, demoted, and transferred to an outlying office.|$|E

His paternal grandfather, Salvador Garcetti, was born in Parral, Chihuahua, Mexico.

Max had immigrated to Mexico from Italy, where he married a Mexican woman and became a judge. His paternal grandmother, Juanita Iberri, was born in Arizona, one of 19 children born to an immigrant father from Sonora, Mexico and an Arizona-born mother whose father was Irish and mother was Mexican.

5000|$|Liddy, {{along with}} Sgt. Edward Ortiz and former Officer Michael Buchanan, {{were the first}} to be charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by then-Los Angeles District Attorney <b>Gil</b> <b>Garcetti</b> based on Perez's testimony. The {{criminal}} case against the Rampart officers revolved around a 1996 incident in which two reputed gang members were convicted of hitting Buchanan and Liddy with a pickup truck in an alley. Perez told authorities three years later that the officers made up the story to frame the pair. In a highly publicized trial in 2000, a Superior Court jury convicted the three officers of the charges, based on Perez's testimony. Afterward, however, Judge Jacqueline Connor vacated the verdicts, saying she had made a “fatal error” in not recognizing that jurors might have misread some [...] "jargon" [...] in the police report that unintentionally lent support to the claim that the officers had lied.|$|E
50|$|Garcetti {{has always}} been an avid urban photographer. During his time as {{district}} attorney he would carry a small camera with him at all times.
