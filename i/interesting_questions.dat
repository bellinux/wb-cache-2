D'Addario commented, [...] "the film raises <b>interesting</b> <b>questions</b> about authority, only somewhat intentionally." [...] He {{noted the}} dated bits observing, [...] "Truth in Numbers? {{may well be}} coming too late." [...] D'Addario concluded his assessment by noting {{that at the time}} of his review, the Wikipedia article for the film was under threat of being deleted: [...] "According to the site, the entry for Truth in Numbers? is being considered for deletion– it links to few other articles on the site, and is an 'orphan.' Given the tenor of Truth in Numbers?, which combines avid interest in Wikipedia with wide-eyed dismay at much of its particulars, this is either very surprising or not surprising at all." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1936, the Russian–born {{economist}} Wassily Leontief {{built his}} model of input-output analysis from the 'material balance' tables constructed by Soviet economists, which themselves followed earlier {{work by the}} physiocrats. [...] With his model, which described a system of production and demand processes, Leontief described how changes in demand in one economic sector would influence production in another. In practice, Leontief [...] estimated the coefficients of his simple models, to address economically <b>interesting</b> <b>questions.</b> [...] In production economics, [...] "Leontief technologies" [...] produce outputs using constant proportions of inputs, regardless {{of the price of}} inputs, reducing the value of Leontief models for understanding economies but allowing their parameters to be estimated relatively easily. In contrast, the von Neumann model of an expanding economy allows for choice of techniques, but the coefficients must be estimated for each technology.|$|E

Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] gave the episode two out of four, said that there was nothing exciting in [...] "Marauders" [...] and that the action sequences towards the end were unrealistic because despite all the apparent violence, not a single person even gets injured during the scene. He called the general premise [...] "classic trek", but that it lacked depth and didn't pose any <b>interesting</b> <b>questions.</b> He summed it up by saying it was [...] "a bloodless, light-as-a-feather action show with handsome production values but absolutely and positively no edge." ...|$|E

500|$|Nolan {{has denied}} the film criticizes the Occupy {{movement}} and insists {{that none of}} his Batman films are intended to be political: [...] "I've had as many conversations {{with people who have}} seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of <b>interesting</b> <b>questions</b> in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' – well, obviously, that's not true." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Sakaguchi {{named the}} main {{character}} after his mother, Aki, who died in an accident several {{years prior to the}} production of the film. Her death led Sakaguchi to reflect on what happened to the spirit after death, and these thoughts resurfaced while he was planning the film, eventually taking the form of the Gaia hypothesis. He later explained that the theme he wanted to convey was [...] "more of a complex idea of life and death and spirit", believing {{that the best way to}} portray this would be to set the film on Earth. By comparison, Final Fantasy video games are set in fictional worlds. Dan Mayers from Sight & Sound stated the film followed the same theme typically found in Final Fantasy video games: [...] "A party of heroes averts impending global holocaust by drawing on their individual skills, gaining knowledge through challenges and emerging victorious with new-found love and respect for themselves and their companions." [...] Writing in the book Robot Ghosts and Wired Dreams, Livia Monnet stated the film remediated [...] "the notion of life in the neovitalistic, evolutionary biology of Lynn Margulis and in contemporary theories on artificial life", going on to state that the film's exploration of the Gaia hypothesis raised <b>interesting</b> <b>questions</b> regarding the life and death process of both cinema and digital media, as well as contemporary life sciences, cybernetics, philosophy and science fiction. The concept of artificial life and resurrection was also discussed, and compared to similar themes in the 1914 book Locus Solus; the Phantoms in The Spirits Within were considered to be brought to life by various forces: by the alien planet's red Gaia and then by human spiritual energy.|$|E
2500|$|If {{it really}} is a single animal and not a chimera, Protoavis would raise <b>interesting</b> <b>questions</b> about when birds began to diverge from the dinosaurs, but until better {{evidence}} is produced, the animal's status currently remains uncertain. Furthermore, paleobiogeography suggests that true birds did not colonize the Americas until the Cretaceous; the most primitive lineages of unequivocal birds found to date are all Eurasian. Certainly, the fossils are most parsimoniously attributed to primitive dinosaurian and other reptiles as outlined above. However, coelurosaurs and ceratosaurs are in any case not too distantly related to the ancestors of birds and in some aspects of the skeleton not unlike them, explaining how their fossils could be mistaken as avian.

Some criticisms contained in it have been [...] very useful to me in revising the corresponding chapters of the [...] present work. In several of Mr. Venn’s opinions, however, I do not [...] agree.

60|$|In spite, however, {{of the new}} {{possibility}} of progress in philosophy, the first effect, {{as in the case}} of physics, is to diminish very greatly the extent of what is thought to be known. Before Galileo, people believed themselves possessed of immense knowledge on all the most <b>interesting</b> <b>questions</b> in physics. He established certain facts as to the way in which bodies fall, not very interesting on their own account, but of quite immeasurable interest as examples of real knowledge and of a new method whose future fruitfulness he himself divined. But his few facts sufficed to destroy the whole vast system of supposed knowledge handed down from Aristotle, as even the palest morning sun suffices to extinguish the stars. So in philosophy: though some have believed one system, and others another, almost all have been of opinion that a great deal was known; but all this supposed knowledge in the traditional systems must be swept away, and a new beginning must be made, which we shall esteem fortunate indeed if it can attain results comparable to Galileo's law of falling bodies.|$|E

In that case the bird, if he knows the secret, will fly to fresh water and drown his tormentor. Whether all the ducks have this wisdom, or whether it is confined to a few rare birds, there is no present means of knowing. I have seen three different eiders practice this bit of surgery myself, and have heard of at least a dozen more, all of the same species, that were seen in fresh ponds or rivers, dipping their heads under water repeatedly. In either case two <b>interesting</b> <b>questions</b> suggest themselves: first, How did a bird whose whole life from birth to death is spent on the sea first learn that certain mussels will drown in fresh water? and, second, How do the other birds know it now, when the need arises unexpectedly? ...|$|E
