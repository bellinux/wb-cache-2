40|$|Instruments {{aimed for}} mobile {{measurement}} of <b>dry</b> road <b>marking</b> retroreflectivity are commercially available. Is {{it possible to}} predict other performance parameters, such as wet road marking retroreflectivity, daylight luminance coefficient and skid resistance, from mobile measurements? The hypothesis is that such predictions {{should be possible to}} accomplish by simulataneous measurement of <b>dry</b> road <b>marking</b> retroreflectivity and macro-texture. From mobile measurement of <b>dry</b> road <b>marking</b> retroreflectivity and macro-texture, empirical models for other performance parameters have been developed. The results show that {{it should be possible to}} assemble a mobile measurement system which can register all road marking performance parameters in the regulations...|$|R
5000|$|Film may be rinsed in a dilute {{solution}} of a non-ionic wetting agent to assist uniform drying, which eliminates <b>drying</b> <b>marks</b> caused by hard water. (In very hard water areas, a pre-rinse in distilled water {{may be required}} - otherwise the final rinse wetting agent can cause residual ionic calcium on the film {{to drop out of}} solution, causing spotting on the negative.) ...|$|R
40|$|During failure {{analysis}} on high voltage I 3 T 50 products, {{it was found}} that irregular Nsinker regions were present in the top region of the wafer. This Nsinker distortion, also called POCl 3 deformation, was shown during {{failure analysis}} to be linked to certain binnings within the yield loss. A decoration technique has been developed to detect POCl 3 deformations inline with KLA, and it is shown that <b>drying</b> <b>marks</b> in trenches in the Deep Trench Isolation (DTI) module are the root cause of POCl 3 deformation. An improved drying technique has been put in place, thus preventing the defects observed...|$|R

30|$|Thanks to {{two major}} merits of TiO 2 coating, when a {{compound}} (either an organic soil or a pollutant) is {{present on the}} surface of nano-TiO 2 coating, it can be degraded by redox reactions involving highly reactive transient species in the presence of UV light. Then, the degradation products are either stored in the coating or washed off the surface by rain water. In addition, Nano-TiO 2 coating is also super-hydrophillic and has high water spreading speed; the super hydrophilicity prevents the formation of water droplets. Water molecules will spread flat immediately to form a thin and uniform water film. This means once there is rain, the rain water forms a uniform film on the coated solar panel surface, which accelerates runoff water spreading and flow, that removes soiling and deters the formation of <b>drying</b> <b>marks</b> as well, and finally results in a better energy generation.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study has, as previously, been to answer two {{important}} questions: - To which degree is the retroreflectivity in the Swedish regulations fulfilled? - How has the performance fluctuated over time?
