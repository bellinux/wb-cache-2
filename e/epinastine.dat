40|$|Background: <b>Epinastine</b> {{hydrochloride}} (<b>epinastine)</b> is a second-generation histamine Hi-receptor antagonist {{widely used}} as an anti-allergic and anti-pruritic. To explore possible new aspects of the anti-pruritic mechanism of <b>epinastine,</b> in particular any effects on the peripheral nervous system, we examined epinastine's effects on sensory neurons using cultured murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Methods: We performed a quantitative assessment of neurite growth and substance P (SP) release from isolated DRG in the presence versus the absence of <b>epinastine.</b> Mechanism(s) of epinastine’s effects on sensory neurons were detected by examining its neurotoxicity, inhibitory action on nerve growth factor (NGF), and modulatory function on NGFreceptors. Results: The percentage of DRG with outgrowing neurites, total number of neurites, and average extension length of neurites were decreased by <b>epinastine</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. <b>Epinastine</b> did not exhibit any evidence of neurotoxicity on sensory neurons, degradation and inactivation ability on NGF, or effects on expression of NGF receptors. Also, no effects on neural progenitor cells of {{the central nervous system}} in culture were observed. <b>Epinastine</b> suppressed capsaicin-induced SP release from DRG neurons in a dosedependent fashion. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that <b>epinastine</b> has inhibitory effects on sensory neuronal growth, which may explain its clinical effects including potent anti-pruritic activity...|$|E

Isolated guinea pig and human airway preparations were suspended in organ baths containing modified Krebs-Henseleit solution. Electrical field stimulation was applied to elicit cholinergic contractions. <b>Epinastine</b> produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the cholinergic contraction in guinea pig airways and pretreatment with methysergide (5 -HT 1 / 2 / 7 antagonist) significantly attenuated these inhibitory effects of <b>epinastine.</b> Pretreatment with tropisetron (5 -HT 3 / 4 antagonist), ketanserin (5 -HT 2 antagonist), SDZ 216 - 525 (5 -HT 1 A antagonist) or phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic antagonist) had no effect. <b>Epinastine</b> did not displace the concentration-response curve to acetylcholine.

40|$|Electrical field {{stimulation}} (EFS) of guinea-pig airways, in vitro, evokes an excitatory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (eNANC) contraction {{mediated by}} release of tachykinins from sensory nerve endings. <b>Epinastine</b> (WAL 801 CL) is an antihistaminic drug with binding affinity at certain other receptors, including alpha-adrenergic receptors and various serotonin (5 -HT) receptor subtypes. It {{is used in}} asthma treatment; however, its mechanism of action remains to be fully defined. We have investigated whether <b>epinastine</b> could modulate the eNANC contraction in guinea-pig airways in vitro, and have tried to elucidate its receptor mechanism. <b>Epinastine</b> (0. 1 - 100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the noncholinergic contraction, with a maximum inhibition of 91 +/- 7 % at 100 microM. Pretreatment of the tissues with combined 5 -HT 1 / 5 -HT 2 antagonists, methysergide (1 microM) or methiothepin (0. 1 microM), significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of <b>epinastine</b> on the noncholinergic contraction. Pretreatment with tropisetron (1 microM), a 5 -HT 3 antagonist, ketanserin (10 microM), a 5 -HT 2 antagonist, thioperamide (10 microM), a histamine H 3 antagonist, or phentolamine (10 microM), an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, however, had no effect. Chlorpheniramine (10 microM), another histamine H 1 receptor antagonist without significant 5 -HT receptor binding affinity, did not produce any inhibition of the eNANC contraction. <b>Epinastine</b> (100 microM) did not displace the dose-response curve to exogenously applied substance P (0. 01 - 10 microM). These results suggest that <b>epinastine,</b> although identified as a 5 -HT antagonist, acts as a 5 -HT 1 agonist and that it inhibits the noncholinergic contraction in guinea-pig airways through stimulation of a prejunctional 5 -HT 1 -like receptor, located to sensory nerves. status: publishe...|$|E

Subjects and methods: This was a prospective, randomized, case-control study involving two institutions. The subjects were patients diagnosed with SAC at two institutions between February and March in 2014. To examine the clinical effects of seasonal treatment, 0. 05 % <b>epinastine</b> and 0. 1 % olopatadine were administered, and their effects were investigated every 2  weeks (Stage 1). To {{evaluate the}} clinical effects of preseasonal therapy, in January 2015, the same eye drop preparations as adopted in Stage 1 were administered to patients {{who had participated in}} Stage 1 and provided consent to participate in this study, and their effects were investigated every month (Stage 2). Results: In Stage 1, the 0. 05 % <b>epinastine</b> group consisted of 43 patients, and the 0. 1 % olopatadine group consisted of 42 patients. There were significant improvements in the total symptom and objective finding scores at each time point after administration in comparison with those before its baseline, but {{there were no significant differences}} between the two groups. In Stage 2, the 0. 05 % <b>epinastine</b> group consisted of 15 patients, and the 0. 1 % olopatadine group consisted of 14  patients. The rate of change in the total symptom score in comparison with that at the baseline of preseasonal treatment was significantly higher in the 0. 1 % olopatadine group 1 month after the start of treatment, suggesting symptom deterioration (P= 0. 025). There was no significant difference in the rate of change in the total objective finding score between the two groups.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>epinastine,</b> a {{selective}} octopamine antagonist in invertebrates, in Caenorhabditis elegans. Specifically, its ability to block the inhibitory action of octopamine on C. elegans-isolated pharynx was assayed.

Octopamine inhibited the 5 -HT-induced pumping in a concentration-dependent manner (threshold 1 - 5 ?M) with a 61 ± 11 % inhibition with 50 ?M (n = 5). <b>Epinastine</b> (0. 1 ?M) antagonized the inhibitory response to octopamine (P < 0. 001; n = 15).

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{compare the}} effects of topical {{antiallergic}} eyedrops in relieving the {{signs and symptoms of}} patients with allergic conjunctival pathology. METHODS. In this multicenter, single-masked, randomized study, 240 patients with signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis were randomized to receive 1 of the following 8 treatments twice daily: cromolyn sodium/chlorpheniramine maleate, diclofenac, <b>epinastine,</b> fluorometholone, ketotifen, levocabastine, naphazoline/antazoline, and olopatadine. Clinical signs and symptoms were evaluated by a masked operator using a 10 -point scale at the moment of enrollment (day 0) and at weeks 1, 2, and 4. The percentage of patients achieving at least a small (at least 50 % reduction of the total scale score) or a good (at least 75 %) improvement of signs and symptoms was calculated at each visit. Tolerability was also evaluated as the duration of discomfort after instillation. RESULTS. All drugs gave some improvement in symptoms in more than 85 % of cases. <b>Epinastine</b> and olopatadine obtained at least a good relief of symptoms in 37 % and 33 % of cases at week 1. At the end of the study, good improvement of symptoms was obtained in at least 70 % of patients by <b>epinastine,</b> ketotifen, fluorometholone, and olopatadine, whereas a 75 % improvement for signs was obtained only by fluorometholone and ketotifen.

40|$|Activation of the {{adenosine}} A receptor subtype by the agonist N#{ 176 }- 2 -(4 -aminophenyl) ethyladenosine {{is shown}} here to induce bronchospasm (increased pulmonary resistance and de-creased pulmonary compliance) in BDE strain rats. The effect is substantially reduced by pretreating the rats with compound 48 / 80, disodium cromoglycate (30 p,g/kg) or <b>epinastine</b> (10 ig/kg), which {{is compatible with}} involvement of mast cells. It is also substantially reduced by combined vagotomy and atropin-ization or by pretreatment with the NK receptor antagonist L- 659, 877, suggesting involvement of neuropeptide-mediated neural pathways. The mechanism by which activation of the adenosine A receptor induces bronchospasm is distinct from the mechanism by which activation of the adenosine A 1 recep-tor induces bronchospasm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Three {{dopamine}} receptor genes {{have been}} identified that are highly conserved among arthropod species. One of these genes, referred to in honey bees as Amdop 2, shows a close phylogenetic relationship to the a-adrenergic-like octopamine receptor family. In this study we examined in parallel the functional and pharmacological properties of AmDOP 2 and the honey bee octopamine receptor, AmOA 1. For comparison, pharmacological properties of the honey bee dopamine receptors AmDOP 1 and AmDOP 3, and the tyramine receptor AmTYR 1, were also examined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using HEK 293 cells heterologously expressing honey bee biogenic amine receptors, we found that activation of AmDOP 2 receptors, like AmOA 1 receptors, initiates a rapid increase in intracellular calcium levels. We {{found no evidence of}} calcium signaling via AmDOP 1, AmDOP 3 or AmTYR 1 receptors. AmDOP 2 - and AmOA 1 -mediated increases in intracellular calcium were inhibited by 10 µM edelfosine indicating a requirement for phospholipase C-β activity in this signaling pathway. Edelfosine treatment had no effect on AmDOP 2 - or AmOA 1 -mediated increases in intracellular cAMP. The synthetic compounds mianserin and <b>epinastine,</b> like cis-(Z) -flupentixol and spiperone, were found to have significant antagonist activity on AmDOP 2 receptors. All 4 compounds were effective antagonists also on AmOA 1 receptors. Analysis of putative ligand binding sites offers a possible explanation for why <b>epinastine</b> acts as an antagonist at AmDOP 2 receptors, but fails to block responses mediated via AmDOP 1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that AmDOP 2, like AmOA 1, is coupled not only to cAMP, but also to calcium-signalling and moreover, that the two signalling pathways are independent upstream of phospholipase C-β activity. The striking similarity between the pharmacological properties of these 2 receptors suggests an underlying conservation of structural properties related to receptor function. Taken together, these results strongly support phylogenetic analyses indicating that the AmDOP 2 and AmOA 1 receptor genes are immediate paralogs...|$|E
40|$|There is {{established}} concept that dendritic cells (DCs) play essential {{roles in the}} development of allergic immune responses. However, the influence of H 1 receptor antagonists on DC functions is not well defined. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the effect of <b>epinastine</b> hydrochloride (EP), the most notable histamine H 1 receptor antagonists in Japan, on Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f) -pulsed mouse bone marrow-derived DCs in vitro and in vivo. EP at more than 25 [*]ng/mL could significantly inhibit the production of IL- 6, TNF- and IL- 10 from Der f-pulsed DCs, which was increased by Der f challenge in vitro. On the other hand, EP increased the ability of Der f-pulsed DCs to produce IL- 12. Intranasal instillation of Der f-pulsed DCs resulted in nasal eosinophilia associated with a significant increase in IL- 5 levels in nasal lavage fluids.

40|$|Aggression is a {{behavioural}} {{strategy for}} securing resources (food, mates and territory) and its expression is {{strongly influenced by}} their presence and value. While {{it is known that}} resource holders are generally highly aggressive towards intruding consexuals and usually defeat them, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not known. In a novel intruder–resident paradigm for field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus), we show that otherwise submissive losers of a preceding aggressive encounter readily fight and often defeat aggressive winners after occupying an artificial shelter. This aggression enhancing effect first became evident after 2 min residency, and was maximal after 15 min, but absent 15 min after shelter removal. The residency effect was abolished following non-selective depletion of biogenic amines from the central nervous system using reserpine, or semi-selective depletion of octopamine and dopamine using α-methyl-tyrosine, but not following serotonin depletion using α-methyl-tryptophan. The residency effect was also abolished by the treatment with phentolamine, an α-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or <b>epinastine,</b> a highly selective octopamine receptor blocker, but not by propranolol, a ß-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or by yohimbine, an insect tyramine receptor blocker.

The levels of angiogenesis factors, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in culture supernatants, were examined by ELISA. We also examined mRNA expression for the angiogenesis factors by RT-PCR. EP significantly inhibited the production of KC, TNF, and VEGF induced by IgE-dependent mechanism at more than 25 ng/mL. Semiquantitative analysis using RT-PCR showed that EP also significantly reduced mRNA expressions for KC, TNF, and VEGF. These results strongly suggest that EP suppresses angiogenesis factor production through the inhibition of mRNA expression in mast cells and results in favorable modification of clinical conditions of allergic diseases.

40|$|The {{influence}} of anti-allergic drugs, <b>epinastine</b> hydrochloride (EP) and disodium cromoglycate (DSCG), on the co-stimulatory molecule expression was examined using in vitro cell culture technique. Spleen cells obtained from BALB/c mice 10 days after immunization with haemocyanin absorbed to aluminium hydroxide were cultured {{in the presence}} of 100. 0 microg/ml haemocyanin and various concentrations of the agents. Low concentrations (< 1. 5 x 10 (- 4) M) of EP and DSCG did not influence spleen cell blastic activity induced by antigenic stimulation, whereas these agents caused significant inhibition of spleen cell activation when 2 x 10 (- 4) M of the agents were added to cell cultures. EP and DSCG also did not affect blastic activity of sensitized splenic T cells by anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody stimulation even when these cells were cultured {{in the presence of}} 2 x 10 (- 4) M of the agents. We next examined the {{influence of}} EP and DSCG on the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on spleen cells in response to antigenic stimulation. Sensitized spleen cells were cultured in the presence of 2 x 10 (- 4) M of the agents and the expression of molecules were examined by flow cytometer 24 h later.

40|$|Background: Biogenic amines are {{implicated in}} {{reinforcing}} associative learning. Octopamine (OA) {{is considered the}} invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline and several studies in insects converge {{on the idea that}} OA mediates the reward in appetitive conditioning. However, it is possible to assume that OA could have a different role in an aversive conditioning. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we pharmacologically studied the participation of OA in two learning processes in the crab Chasmagnathus granulatus, one appetitive and one aversive. It is shown that the aversive memory is impaired by an OA injection applied immediately or 30 minutes after the last training trial. By contrast, the appetitive memory is blocked by OA antagonists <b>epinastine</b> and mianserine, but enhanced by OA when injected together with the supply of a minimum amount of reinforcement. Finally, double-learning experiments in which crabs are given the aversive and the appetitive learning either successively or simultaneously allow us to study the interaction between both types of learning and analyze the presumed action of OA. We found that the appetitive training offered immediately, but not one hour, after an aversive training has an amnesic effect on the aversive memory, mimicking the effect and the kinetic of an OA injection. Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate that the role of OA is divergent in two memory processes of opposite signs: on the one hand it would mediate the reinforcement in appetitive learning, {{and on the other hand}} it has a deleteriou...|$|E

Olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 1 % ophthalmic solution (Patanol&reg;) was introduced to the market in Japan in October 2006. In a conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) test, olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 1 % ophthalmic solution significantly suppressed ocular itching and hyperemia compared with levocabastine hydrochloride 0. 05 % ophthalmic solution, and the number of patients who complained of ocular discomfort was lower in the olopatadine group than in the levocabastine group. Conjunctival cell membrane disruption was observed in vitro in the ketotifen fumarate group, <b>epinastine</b> hydrochloride group, and azelastine hydrochloride group, but not in the olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 1 % ophthalmic solution group, which may potentially explain the lower discomfort felt by patients on instillation. Many other studies in humans have revealed the superiority of olopatadine 0. 1 % hydrochloride eye drops to several other anti-allergic eye drops. Overseas, olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 2 % ophthalmic solution for a once-daily regimen has been marketed under the brand name of Pataday&reg;. It is expected that olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solutions may be used in patients with a more severe spectrum of allergic conjunctival diseases, such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis or atopic keratoconjunctivitis, in the near future.

40|$|Locusts {{have two}} large collision-detecting neurons, the {{descending}} contralateral movement detectors (DCMDs) that signal object approach and trigger evasive glides during flight. We {{sought to investigate}} whether vision for action, when the locust is in an aroused state rather than a passive viewer, significantly alters visual processing in this collision-detecting pathway. To do this we used two different approaches {{to determine how the}} arousal state of a locust affects the prolonged periods of high-frequency spikes typical of the DCMD response to approaching objects that trigger evasive glides. First, we manipulated arousal state in the locust by applying a brief mechanical stimulation to the hind leg; this type of change of state occurs when gregarious locusts accumulate in high-density swarms. Second, we examined DCMD responses during flight because flight produces a heightened physiological state of arousal in locusts. When arousal was induced by either method we found that the DCMD response recovered from a previously habituated state; that it followed object motion throughout approach; and—most important—that it was significantly more likely to generate the maintained spike frequencies capable of evoking gliding dives even with extremely short intervals (1. 8 s) between approaches. Overall, tethered flying locusts responded to 41 % of simulated approaching objects (sets of 6 with 1. 8 s ISI).

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundOlopatadine {{hydrochloride}} is an antiallergic {{agent with}} histamine H 1 receptor antagonistic action. We investigated {{the effects of}} olopatadine on passive anaphylaxis reaction- and compound 48 / 80 -induced conjunctivitis in rats. MethodsAllergic conjunctivitis was induced in rats passively sensitized by injection of rat anti-ovalbumin (anti-OVA) serum into the upper subconjunctiva of the right eye, followed by intravenous administration of the antigen and Evans blue dye. After 30 min, the amount of dye leaking into the conjunctiva was measured. Non-allergic conjunctivitis was induced in rats by injection of compound 48 / 80. Olopatadine or other reference compounds were orally given 1 h before the challenge. ResultsThe amount of dye leaking into the conjunctiva following passive anaphylaxis was significantly inhibited by oral administration of 0. 01 - 1 mg/kg olopatadine and the ID 50 value was 0. 093 mg/kg. In the control group, pathological examination revealed edema and lymphocyte infiltration in the conjunctiva and the palpebral skin. Olopatadine, at 0. 03 and 0. 3 mg/kg, reduced the grade of these pathological findings. The other antiallergic drugs (1 mg/kg loratadine, 0. 3 mg/kg <b>epinastine,</b> 0. 3 mg/kg cetiridine, 1 mg/kg ebastine, 30 mg/kg fexofenadine and 3 mg/kg chlorpheniramine), when administered orally, inhibited the passive anaphylaxis reaction-induced vascular hyperpermeability of the conjunctiva, {{as was the case}} with olopatadine hydrochloride. Subconjunctival administration of compound 48 / 80 induced vascular hyperpermeability, which is presumably mediated by histamine release. Oral administration of 0. 1 and 1 mg/kg olopatadine significantly inhibited the amount of dye leakage. ConclusionOrally administered olopatadine is expected to improve allergic conjunctivitis...|$|E
40|$|Objective - To {{investigate}} whether artificial tears and cold compress {{alone or in}} combination provide a treatment benefit and whether they were as effective as or could enhance topical antiallergic medication. Design - Randomized, masked clinical trial. Participants - Eighteen subjects (mean age, 29. 5 ± 11. 0 years) allergic to grass pollen. Intervention - Controlled exposure to grass pollen using an environmental chamber to stimulate an ocular allergic reaction followed by application of artificial tears (ATs), 5 minutes of cold compress (CC), ATs combined with CC, or no treatment applied at each separate visit in random order. A subset of 11 subjects also had <b>epinastine</b> hydrochloride (EH) applied alone and combined with CC in random order or instillation of a volume-matched saline control. Main Outcome Measures - Bulbar conjunctival hyperemia, ocular surface temperature, and ocular symptoms repeated before and every 10 minutes after treatment for 1 hour. Results - Bulbar conjunctival hyperemia and ocular symptoms decreased and temperature recovered to baseline faster with nonpharmaceutical treatments compared with no treatment (P? ? 0. 05). At all measurement intervals, symptoms were reduced for both EH and EH combined with CC than CC or ATs alone or in combination (P?<? 0. 014). Conclusions - After controlled exposure to grass pollen, CC and AT treatment showed a therapeutic effect on the {{signs and symptoms of}} allergic conjunctivitis. A CC enhanced the use of EH alone and was the only treatment to reduce symptoms to baseline within 1 hour of antigenic challenge. Signs of allergic conjunctivitis generally were reduced most by a combination of a CC in combination with ATs or EH...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine induces airways {{obstruction}} {{in subjects}} with asthma, but the receptor subtype responsible remains unknown. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the pharmacological profile of adenosine receptor subtypes mediating contraction and to investigate the mechanism in normal and passively sensitized human airway tissues. Contraction of bronchial rings isolated from resected lung tissue of patients with lung carcinoma was measured in response to nonselective adenosine receptor agonists, 5 -AMP and 5 '-(N-Ethylcarboxamido) adenosine, and A(1) receptor agonist, N(6) -cyclopentyladenosine, in the absence and presence of selective adenosine receptor antagonists. Pharmacological antagonists, chemical ablation of airway sensory nerves using capsaicin, and passive sensitization of tissue with serum from subjects with atopy and asthma was used to investigate the mechanism of contraction. Human bronchial tissue contracted in a concentration-dependent manner to adenosine agonists that showed a rank order of activity of A(1) > A(2 B) >> A 2 (A) = A 3. The maximum contractile response to N(6) -cyclopentyladenosine (231. 0 ± 23. 8 mg) was significantly reduced in tissues chemically treated with capsaicin to desensitize sensory nerves (desensitized: 101. 6 ± 15. 2 mg; P < 0. 05). Passive sensitization significantly augmented the contraction induced by adenosine A(1) receptor activation (sensitized: 389. 7 ± 52. 8 mg versus nonsensitized; P < 0. 05), which was linked to the release of leukotrienes, and not histamine (MK 571 : 25. 5 ± 1. 7 mg; <b>epinastine</b> 260. 0 ± 22. 2 mg versus control; P < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{pheromone}} {{release and}} also the male responsiveness to pheromone in nocturnal moths are controlled by circadian pacemakers. In Manduca sexta the circadian rhythm in the calling behaviour of female moths with a maximum {{at the end of}} the scotophase is correlated with peaks in the male flight activity. Furthermore circadian changes in the concentration of the biogenic amine octopamine (OA) in the hemolymph and brain modulate the moth´s sensitivity and responsiveness to pheromone. In addition the injection of OA into the hemolymph improved pheromone-source finding in wind tunnel experiments time-dependently. The OA-dependent sensitization of the male behavior might be partly due to central effects and partly due to the augmentation of the pheromone transduction. To investigate the time-dependent modulation of the pheromone transduction of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), OA and its precursor tyramine (TA) were applied via the recording electrode in long-term tip recordings of single trichoid sensilla of M. sexta. To search for time-dependent differences the recordings were performed at Zeitgebertime (ZT) 22 - 1, 1 - 4 or 8 - 11 (ZT 0 = lights on). The trichoid sensilla were stimulated with the main pheromone component bombykal (BAL) in a non-adapting protocol for 180 min. The perfusion of the sensillar lymph with OA and TA increased both the sensillar potential (SP) amplitude and the action potential (AP) frequency at ZT 8 - 11 but not at ZT 22 - 1. Furthermore the ORNs are adapted on the level of the AP response with beginning of the photophase and the application of OA and TA disadapts the ORNs at ZT 8 - 11. In addition the endogenous adaptation in the AP distribution in BAL responses at ZT 8 - 11 was antagonized by OA and TA. OA but not TA also increased the spontaneous AP frequency by increasing the number of bursts and by prolonging the bursts, without affecting the generation of single APs. Furthermore the OA-receptor antagonist <b>epinastine</b> (EPI) decreased the AP frequency strongly at ZT 8 - 11 and to a lesser extent at ZT 22 - 1, without affecting the SP. Also the spontaneous AP frequency was reduced by EPI to the same extent at ZT 22 - 1 and ZT 8 - 11. At ZT 22 - 1 EPI shifted the AP distribution in BAL responses from phasic to tonic responses. These results show that OA is the key factor in the time-dependent modulation of the pheromone-sensitivity of ORNs and that OA could be obligatory for the generation of strong and phasic BAL responses and thus could be necessary for a high pulse resolution of the ORNs. Because the majority of OA receptors is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclases it was determined whether cAMP mimics the OA-dependent disadaptation. The membrane-permeable cAMP analogue 8 -bromo cAMP (8 bcAMP) increased the SP amplitude in recordings at ZT 1 - 4 and ZT 8 - 11 but not at ZT 22 - 1. Furthermore 8 bcAMP antagonized an endogenous adaptation in the mean SP amplitude at ZT 1 - 4 and partly at ZT 8 - 11. In contrast, 8 bcAMP did not affect the normalized initial AP frequency or the distribution of APs in responses and did not antagonize the endogenous shift to lower mean AP frequencies at ZT 8 - 11. In addition, 8 bcAMP increased the spontaneous AP frequency in recordings at ZT 8 - 11. Furthermore, the ORNs are also adapted on the level of the spontaneous activity with beginning of the photophase and 8 bcAMP disadapts the ORNs at ZT 1 - 4 and ZT 8 - 11 by increasing both the number of bursts and spikes. In contrast, OA strongly increased the mean spontaneous AP frequency at ZT 8 - 11 by predominantly increasing the number of bursts. Thus, 8 bcAMP only partly mimics the OA-dependent effects. Our results suggest that OA at least activates an adenylyl cyclase, additional OA-dependent effects on the Ca 2 +-levels are discussed. Because adapting pheromone stimuli cause rises of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in trichoid sensilla of M. sexta, we wanted to determine whether cGMP decreases the pheromone-sensitivity of ORNs in a time-dependent manner. The membrane-permeable cGMP analogue 8 -bromo cGMP (8 bcGMP) adapted the AP response but not the SP. Perfusion with 8 bcGMP decreased the initial AP frequency and the numbers of APs in the first 100 ms of the BAL response. Furthermore, the decrease in the 8 bcGMP-dependent AP frequency was stronger in recordings at ZT 8 - 11 than at ZT 1 - 4. In addition, at ZT 8 - 11 8 bcGMP enhanced the endogenous shift from phasic to tonic responses. Furthermore 8 bcGMP altered the waveform of spontaneous APs by increasing their peak-to-peak amplitude and by prolonging the negative phase. Thus, we hypothesize that additionally to changes in the OA concentration during the photophase, elevated cGMP levels underlie a daytime-dependent decrease in pheromone sensitivity and a decline in the temporal resolution of pheromone pulses...|$|E
