25|$|Despite initial {{failures}} {{and the slow}} progress of Local 77’s new campaign, Local 77 gained momentum as they received more support from students and faculty. In the spring of 1966, Shirley Ramsey, {{one of the first}} black food service workers to be promoted to cashier, was requested by a supervisor to perform pie-cutting duties in the dining hall, a task outside the range of her <b>job</b> <b>description.</b> When Ramsey refused the supervisor’s request, she was fired from her job. Consequently, Ramsey filed a claim through the grievance procedure, believing that race was a determining factor for the reason that she was singled out by her employer to perform a task outside of her <b>job</b> <b>description.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Relevance of <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> when {{comparing}} positions - every company {{has its own}} nomenclature for work positions, often based on the company's history or inherited from a parent company.

25|$|Feminist history {{combines}} {{the search for}} past female scholars with a modern feminist perspective on how history is affected by them. While many mistake it as women’s history, feminist history does not solely focus on the retelling of history from a woman’s perspective. Rather, it is interpreting history with a feminist frame of mind. It is also {{not to be confused}} with the history of feminism, which recounts the history of the feminist movements. Feminist historians, instead, include “cultural and social investigations” in the <b>job</b> <b>description.</b> Feminist history came into being as women began writing accounts of their own and other women’s lives. A few of these, such as Susan B. Anthony and Audre Lorde, documented histories of their feminist movements. Afterword, a fever drove women onward to be historically minded and create women’s archives.|$|E

For Final Fantasy VII, Toriyama designed events such as the ones taking place at the Honey Bee Inn. As the designers were given much artistic freedom, he would often create cutscenes that were unlikely to be approved and thus were eventually changed or removed. Toriyama also wrote and directed many of the scenes revolving around the romance between Aerith Gainsborough and Cloud Strife. He tried to make Aerith an important character to the player in order to maximize the impact of her death later in the plot.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} cadets {{choose the}} Citizen-Leader Track to pursue civilian careers or officer training or officer candidate training programs after graduation, or attend professional or graduate schools. Eighty-three {{percent of the}} Citizen-Leader Track cadets had a job or graduate school offer in hand upon graduation in May 2016. Recently, Northrop Grumman funded six scholarships for Citizen-Leader Track cadets or Military-Leader Track cadets not on scholarship which included an opportunity to intern with Northrop Grumman as well. Citizen-Leader Track cadets participate in an exercise called Job-Ex, where the junior and senior cadets learn to write a <b>job</b> <b>description,</b> freshman and sophomore cadets apply to those jobs, the upperclass cadets review them, and then they conduct panel interviews with the underclass cadets, so they can learn from their peers what is successful in an job interview. The upperclass cadets learn what interviewers expect, so they can improve their interviewing skills as well. The Rice Center Board of Advisors, made up from executives from organizations like Northrop Grumman, Union Pacific, Dell, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations, advise the Corps staff on curriculum and skill sets cadets need to develop to be more employable after graduation.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many women}} were doing jobs that men had {{previously}} {{done during the}} war, there were still pay distinctions between the two sexes. Equal pay was rarely achieved as employers wanted to avoid labour costs. Skilled work was often broken down into smaller tasks and labelled skilled or semi-skilled and then paid according to women's pay rates. Women who were judged to be doing ‘men’s work’ were paid more than women who {{were thought to be}} doing ‘women’s work’ and the employers' definition of this varied regionally. Women were receiving closer wages to their male counterparts; however despite the government's expressed intentions, women continued to be paid less than men for equivalent work and were segregated in terms of <b>job</b> <b>description,</b> status, and the hours they put in. In 1940 Ernest Bevin persuaded engineering employers and unions to give women equal pay to men since they were taking on the same tasks that men previously had; this became the Extended Employment of Women Agreement. Generally, pay increases depended on the industry; industries that were dominated by women before the war, like textiles and clothing, saw no changes in pay. However the gap between male and female earnings narrowed by 20-24% in metals, engineering and vehicle building and by 10-13% in chemicals, which were all deemed important to the war effort. Overtime hours also differed, with women getting 2–3 hours and men 9-10 a week. Women’s hours were still regulated because of their responsibilities {{to take care of their}} family and household.|$|E

500|$|Scholes's Manchester and Salford Directory for 1797 shows Perrins as a [...] "victualler and engineer", {{living at}} the Fire Engine public house, 24 Leigh Street. (The street is listed as being off George Street, which was in turn off Great Ancoats Street. It is now called George Leigh Street.)

500|$|Less certain was {{the choice}} for the vice presidency, which {{contained}} little definitive <b>job</b> <b>description</b> in the constitution. The only official role {{of the vice president}} was {{as the president of the}} Senate, a duty unrelated to the executive branch. The Constitution stipulated that the position would be awarded to the runner-up in the presidential election, or the person with the second highest amount of electoral votes. Because Washington was from Virginia, many, including Washington himself (who remained neutral on the candidates) assumed that a vice president would be chosen from one of the northern states to ease sectional tensions. In an August 1788 letter, Thomas Jefferson wrote that he considered John Adams and John Hancock, both prominent citizens from Massachusetts, to be the top contenders. He suggested John Jay, James Madison, and John Rutledge as other possible candidates. In January 1789, upon hearing that Adams would probably win the vice presidency, Washington wrote to Henry Knox, saying [...] " [...] entirely satisfied with the arrangement for filling the second office." ...|$|E

Erikson said that initially they gather with the standard guitar-bass-drum and keyboard gear, and as they pass around different ideas and implement them the songs take form in any which way a session takes them. [...] "Once we started on the album proper, it became a Garbage record, which is any number of approaches to writing a recording. There were no rules, certainly", he explained. A song like [...] "Automatic Systematic Habit" [...] features more electronics than guitars, and [...] "Big Bright World", a guitar-heavy song, involves configurations that make some of the guitars sound like synths.

500|$|At the {{invitation}} of his cousin John Amory Lowell, James Russell Lowell was asked to deliver a lecture at the prestigious Lowell Institute. Some speculated the opportunity {{was because of the}} family connection, offered as an attempt to bring him out of his depression. Lowell chose to speak on [...] "The English Poets", telling his friend Briggs that he would take revenge on dead poets [...] "for the injuries received by one whom the public won't allow among the living". The first of the twelve-part lecture series was to be on January 9, 1855, though by December, Lowell had only completed writing five of them, hoping for last-minute inspiration. His first lecture was on John Milton and the auditorium was oversold; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon. Lowell, who had never spoken in public before, was praised for these lectures. Francis James Child said that Lowell, whom he deemed was typically [...] "perverse", was able to [...] "persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents". While his series was still in progress, Lowell was offered the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages at Harvard, a post vacated by Longfellow, at an annual salary of $1,200, though he never applied for it. The <b>job</b> <b>description</b> was changing after Longfellow; instead of teaching languages directly, Lowell would supervise the department and deliver two lecture courses per year on topics of his own choosing. Lowell accepted the appointment, with the proviso that he should have a year of study abroad. He set sail on June 4 of that year, leaving his daughter Mabel in the care of a governess named Frances Dunlap. Abroad, he visited Le Havre, Paris, and London, spending time with friends including Story, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Leigh Hunt. Primarily, however, Lowell spent his time abroad studying languages, particularly German, which he found difficult. He complained: [...] "The confounding genders!
