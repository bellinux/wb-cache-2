50|$|Consistories, forming {{executive}} {{body of a}} state church, had often great powers through {{the authority of the}} secular government. In history, before separating executive and juridical competences, consistories of Lutheran state churches with central executive powers, therefore usually consisting of jurisprudents and clergy, did also function as courts appointed to regulate ecclesiastical affairs. At times the consistories were parastatal offices in charge of all (Protestant) denominations (e.g. in Bremen-Verden) or even all religions (e.g. in Prussia, see Evangelical Church in Prussia from 1808 to 1816) in the respective territory. While Lutheran churches often still did not form legal entities distinct from the state, the consistories {{turned out to be the}} oldest body of many modern regional Protestant church bodies, which developed into <b>independent</b> <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{financial}} conglomerates and insurance groups, enterprise risk management {{is becoming increasingly}} important in controlling and managing the different <b>independent</b> <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> in the group. The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess and relate risk concentration and joint default probabilities of the group’s legal entities in order to achieve a more comprehensive picture of an insurance group’s risk situation. Risk concentration is measured using the con-cept of economic capital. We further examine the impact of the type of dependence structure on results by comparing linear and nonlinear dependencies using different copula concepts under certain distributional assumptions. Our results show that even if financial groups with different dependence structures do have the same risk concentration factor, joint default probabilities of different sets of subsidiaries can vary tremendously...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. After {{defining}} {{the essential elements}} of Aristotelian citizenship, the article proposes to apply these criteria in its search for {{the equivalent of a}} citizen within the corporate polis. It argues that shareholding managers are the best positioned among a firm‟s constituents or stakeholders in fulfilling the role of corporate citizens. Greater participation by management not only in the control but also in the ownership of firms brings about benefits for the firm as a whole and for the managers themselves, as organizational citizenship behavior literature, among others, suggests. KEY WORDS: Aristotle, corporate citizenship, stakeholder management, managerial capitalism, organizational citizenship behavior Beyond the metaphor of corporate ci t izenship Although we normally treat business organizations as <b>independent</b> <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> carrying out activities in pursuit of particular goals, they only exist thanks to the objectives and the resources of their human incorporators. Corporations are collective instruments created by individual citizens to achieve ends which they, otherwise, would be unable to reach as effectively. Those ends are most likely to have a sociopolitical dimension and reflect the values of the communit...|$|E
40|$|Since {{there is}} no {{regulation}} on a group company in Indonesia, {{it has its own}} loophole in the law about the liability of holding company in co-financing subsidiaries although Law No. 40 / 2007 on Corporation states that a holding company and a subsidiary are <b>independent</b> <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> The conclusion of the research was that the holding company, Chuan Son Huat Industrial Group (CSH) which co-financed its subsidiary, PT. Cemerlang Selaras Wood Working (PT. CSWW) cannot be categorized as money because it does not meet the elements of the phrase, ‘in amount of money 2 ̆ 7, and the phrase, ‘based on the agreement 2 ̆ 7. It is recommended that, in having legal certainty concerning law and liability in group companies, Law No. 40 / 2007 on Corporation be completed and strengthened. The judges who pronounce judgment on bankruptcy cases and other cases which involve holding companies and subsidiaries should be guided by the principles of legal person, separate legal entity, limited liability, and piercing the corporate veil in order to create legal certainty...|$|E

40|$|Holding {{company as}} {{matter of fact}} In the 19 th century the concept of {{artificial}} legal persons as <b>independent</b> <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> separate from their shareholders was created. The joining of companies into corporate groups is in contradiction with the abovementioned concept. Nevertheless, corporate groups are a reality and every legislator {{had to deal with}} this issue and create sufficient legislation, considering the protection of minority shareholders {{on the one hand and}} the possibilities of the evolution of corporate groups on the other hand. Current Czech legislation regarding corporate groups is more than 10 years old and yet there are still contradictions in the interpretation of the basic provisions of the law of corporate groups amongst experts. My thesis is divided into two parts: the first part consists of the interpretation of the basic provisions of the Commercial Code regarding corporate groups. I used all the basic methods of interpretation, especially the comparison of different expert opinions to provide complex and clear interpretation. The goal of the first part was to point out the abovementioned contradictions and offer my own point of view to readers. In the second part of the thesis, I focused on the option of the holding company to force the controlled company to enter into an [...] ...|$|E
40|$|During the {{organisation}} of the Hungarian ecclesiastical {{system at the}} turn of the 11 - 12 th centuries, cathedral monasteries came into being, initially populated by Benedictine monks and canons. The canons of cathedral chapters in Hungary lived in vita communis until the end of the 12 th century. Henceforth, cathedral chapters were regarded as <b>independent</b> <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> The 13 th century was a period of expansion for the canons in Hungary. In the first part of the century, canons, with the help of the king and bishops, extended their remarkable influence over the country’s clergy and obtained a considerable share in the tithe income of country churches. In the second half of the 13 th century and having established their wealth and consciousness, the canons also attempted to strengthen their position in opposition to prelates. This period may be characterised by the clashes between bishops and cathedral chapters. The latter were appointed by the king from the ranks of court priests, which seriously limited the social status of canons who were unable to develop a consistent policy against the prelates. A prosopographical analysis of this ecclesiastic group leads to several conclusions, as presented in this paper. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologi...|$|E
40|$|April 2016, {{arguably the}} biggest {{structural}} change {{the public sector}} in Scotland has seen in recent years will come fully into effect. From that date, {{in most parts of}} the country, new Integrated Joint Boards will become responsible for a wide range of health and social care services presently provided by Councils and Health Boards. These Integrated Joint Boards will be <b>independent</b> <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> with full autonomy and capacity to act on their own behalf. The Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Act 2014 sets out the legislative framework for integrating health and social care. It sets down the functions which must be delegated by Councils and Health Boards to Integrated Joint Boards, primarily services related to adults and older people. However, Councils and Health Boards may also choose to include other services, for example services covering the health and social care of children, where there is local agreement to do so. As a result, the public sector landscape of the future is likely to be less uniform than it is at present. Although other structural reforms such as the merger of Colleges, or the creation of a single police service and single fire and rescue service, have already taken place, these changes were very much sector specific. The integration of health and social care services stretches across both the local government and health sectors but only covers some of their functions. As a result, the change is much bigger in both scale and complexity. The purpose of this paper is not to examine the operational challenges associated with all structural reforms, such as making appointments, arranging accommodation, organising support services and planning for the integration of ICT systems, albeit they themselves represent a considerable challenge. Instead, this paper seeks to identify the key challenges associated with the integration of health and social care which, to a large extent, will determine the success or otherwise of the reforms...|$|E
