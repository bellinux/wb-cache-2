40|$|Abstract. Self-consolidating {{concrete}} (SCC) has {{the potential}} to significantly reduce costs associated with concrete construction. SCC is a highly <b>flowable,</b> nonsegregating <b>concrete</b> that has a variety of advantages over conventional concrete (CC). However, SCC is not without its problems, which can include increased creep and shrinkage, as well as decreased bond and shear strength. The goal of this research project was to evaluate the creep, shrinkage, and shear behavior of a chemically-based SCC mix. One of the benefits of a chemically-based approach is the potential to eliminate the negative side effects of many SCC mixes. The investigation included development of the mix design, construction and testing of creep and shrinkage specimens, and construction and testing of full-scale beam specimens to evaluate the shear behavior. The results indicate that a chemically-based SCC performs as well or better than conventional portland-cement concrete...|$|R

40|$|Several {{series of}} tests {{involving}} various binder combinations, water-binder ratios, and high-range water-reducing admixture-binder ratios were conducted to optimize mixture proportions for <b>flowable</b> high-performance <b>concrete</b> (HPC). Test methods used include the standard slump, slump-flow spread, and rheology test procedures. Test samples were made with freshly mixed paste, mortar and concrete. Measured data were used to calculate volumetric fractions of coarse aggregate and filling ratios of sand and to correlate the flow characteristics of tested paste, mortar, and concrete. The analytical results indicate that a slump value of at least 235 mm and slump-flow spread of 500 mm or more under conditions {{where there is no}} aggregate segregation are considered viable indicators for producing flowable HPC. In fact, flowable HPC does behave like Bingham fluid, and its flow behavior can be characterized by two Bingham parameters g and h that can be calculated from torque T and rotational speed of spindle N measured during the rheology tests using the flow of HPC meter (FHPCM) of the authors' design.

40|$|The {{workability}} of <b>flowable</b> High-Performance <b>Concrete</b> (HPC) is nowadays mainly {{measured using}} conventional test {{methods such as}} the slump lest or the slump-flow test. These single-point tests do not seem sensitive enough to characterize the high-workability of HPC. Due to the fluid consistency and uniformity of fresh HPC, {{it is possible to}} describe its flow properties by using a rheological test method. To evaluate the flowability based on rheology, fresh HPC is regarded as a two-phase material composed of a matrix phase and a particle phase. In the study, the effects of materials and proportioning on the rheological properties were investigated experimentally. A new rheometer was established by conducting a two-point test to Investigate the flow behaviour of high strength HPC. Test results show that the high strength HPC with good uniformity and without tendency of segregation can possess the properties of rheology according to Bingham's equation. An increase of the fraction of mortar in HPC can lead to a more distinct the rheological behaviour. Moreover, it is found that the application of a rheological method can provide more stable results than any other test method in describing the flowability of high strength HPC.

In addition to SCC, innovative materials such as High Volume Fly Ash Concrete (HVFAC) also provide a significant potential to produce more cost effective mixtures for Cast-in-Place (CIP) concrete. Since the 1930 ’s, fly ash – a pozzolanic material – {{has been used as a}} partial replacement of portland cement in concrete to improve the material’s strength and durability, while also limiting the amount of early heat generation.

Traditionally, HVSI assessment is based on visual judgment and is therefore severely limited by human error, low efficiency, and work tedium. As such, the present study developed and implemented a methodology for automatically evaluating SCC stability. This was done in several steps: first, converting the image of a typical concrete sample (a cut surface with various shades of grey) into a binary image of light colors (aggregates) and dark colors (concrete cement), identifying aggregate sizes, detecting the mortar layer thickness, and finally, using statistical analysis to derive the HVSI. Algorithms were developed for each phase and were implemented using standard coding languages. In effect, the methodology digitally processes a given concrete sample image and assesses its stability in terms of HVSI.

Standard concrete tests such as compressive strength, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, permeability, freeze/thaw resistance, and coefficient of thermal expansion were determined for the mixes and compared. Core blocks were cast using both mixes and composite cores were drilled. The cores were tested and their composite split-tensile strengths were compared to the split-tensile strengths of cylinders made from the respective mixes. A third concrete mix was made by increasing the superplasticizer dosage in the hybrid concrete mix to create a self-consolidating concrete (SCC) mix with a 24 -inch spread.

40|$|ABSTRACT: High-strength {{concrete}} (HSC) {{and glass}} fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are materials utilized in bridge construction to lower cost, reduce construction time, and increase service life of bridge structures. Recently, high-strength self-consolidating concrete (HS-SCC), a highly <b>flowable</b> <b>concrete</b> {{that does not}} require vibration, has been developed as a viable alternative to HSC for use in situations with congested steel or a need for rapid construction. Coupling HS-SCC with GFRP bars could create durable structures built rapidly. Several performance related issues remain to be investigated such as the behavior of prestress loss, shear, creep, shrinkage, thermal gradients, mechanical property development, time dependent behavior, and serviceability under varying loads before HS-SCC can be implemented in prestress applications. Two prestressed precast pedestrian bridges designed for rapid construction in Rolla, Missouri, USA, were constructed of HSC and HS-SCC to differentiate the mechanical and material properties between the two materials. In addition, the precast deck panels were reinforced with mild steel and GFRP to determine differences in the interaction between the reinforcement and decking materials. Instrumented systems and material tests were used to monitor the mechanical and material properties. This paper reports the results from fabrication through erection. In addition, a service load test is planned...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCement {{concrete}} pavement slabs used in highway construction are planer structures. Apart from regular factors considered in analysis of {{concrete pavement}}s, temperature effects influence the slab size, joint spacing and temperature reinforcement design. The thermal performance of concrete pavement {{is governed by}} its thermal properties viz. coefficient of thermal expansion, specific heat and thermal conductivity. Studies have been undertaken to assess the thermal properties of normal concrete. The measurement of thermal conductivity for Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) has been proposed in this paper. SCC is a highly <b>flowable</b> and non-segregating <b>concrete.</b> SCC {{has the ability to}} flow through congested reinforcements efficiently irrespective of the structure geometry. An experimental program has been undertaken, to assess the thermal conductivity values for M- 40 grade of SCC mixes with manufactured sand. Class C flyash {{has been used as a}} cement replacement material. Perlite has been used as fine sand replacement material. The thermal conductivity values were measured using Guarded Hot Plate method (ASTM C 177) as recommended in ACI 122 R. This paper is an attempt to present the experimental results obtained for thermal conductivity studies undertaken on M- 40 grade of SCC with optimized flyash dosage and perlite dosage...|$|R
40|$|Self-consolidating {{concrete}} (SCC) is {{a specially}} proportioned hydraulic cement concrete {{that enables the}} fresh concrete to flow without segregation. Because of its high workability, SCC flows into narrow spaces and form corners, and around closely-spaced steel reinforcement {{without the need for}} mechanical vibration. In seismic regions such as Utah and part of Colorado in Transportation Region 8, the need for a large amount of confinement reinforcement to provide the required ductility often results in columns and joint regions with excessive steel congestion. Steel congestion hinders the placement and proper consolidation of conventional concrete. There are also cases when concrete repair and/or replacement are needed to fix localized damage in bridge structural elements following a seismic event. Highly <b>flowable,</b> yet non-segregating, <b>concrete</b> would be needed to perform the repairs. The high flowability and robustness of SCC make it ideal for the construction and repair of bridge columns and joints designed to meet seismic detailing. There is an evident lack of research to investigate the ductility and shear strength of SCC bridge columns and joints under seismic loads. In this proposed study, experimental and analytical work will be performed to evaluate the ductility and shear strength of columns and joints unde...|$|R
40|$|Self-consolidating {{lightweight}} aggregate concrete (SCLC) {{is a highly}} <b>flowable</b> and lightweight <b>concrete.</b> In this study, the properties of SCLC and prestressed SCLC members were tested and compared with those made of normal-weight self-consolidating concrete (SCC). The test results show that SCLC {{can be used for}} prestressed concrete members. The use of {{lightweight aggregate}}s with a particle density larger than 1100 kg/m 3 can avoid the serious segregation of fresh concrete. In addition, the SCLC designed in this study can meet most of the SCC Rank 2 test standards, except for the V-funnel test. The water contained in the lightweight aggregates supplied sustained curing, so the level of drying shrinkage of the SCLC was lower than that of the conventional SCC. However, the level of creep of the SCLC was higher than that of the conventional SCC, because normal-weight aggregates are more able to inhibit the change of the concrete’s volume. On-site test results show that after 180 days of prestressing, the prestress loss was about 5. 35 – 6. 83 % for the full-size SCLC members, which was smaller than that for the conventional SCC members (about 8. 19 – 9. 06 % loss) ...|$|R
