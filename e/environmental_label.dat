40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project is to analyse how companies perceive {{the costs and benefits}} from <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling.</b> The project only covers two labels: - the Nordic ‘Swan’ and the European ‘Flower’. The majority of the companies have to high or some extent achieved their objectives regarding the labels. Moreover, most companies believe that <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> improves image. One third of the companies state that the benefits from labelling exceed the costs they have encountered. However, {{more than half of the}} companies do not feel that they have gained important advantages from <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling,</b> e. g. from additional sales and earnings. With regards to the costs, <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> does not necessitate high investments in new technology, recruitments, education etc. In other words, the cost barriers are in general small and most companies are able to defray the costs of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling.</b> In conclusion, most companies have at least to some extent achieved their goals, whereas the economic impacts from <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> have so far been limited. This does not necessarily imply that <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> is without importance. On the contrary, <b>environmental</b> <b>labels</b> hold a number of potentials that make them attractive to companies. However, the prospects of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> depend on the values, attitudes and behaviour of all relevant stakeholders. Based on the results from the project, we have listed a number of recommendations for the companies, the customers and the administrators, which might stimulate the future development of environmentally labelled goods and services: * Companies. Even though companies in general do not experience substantial advantages from <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling,</b> the labels might have a number of indirect effects, which might increase the companies’ competitiveness in the long run. For instance, <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> might improve the companies’ image and serve as a door opener for Side 5 Miljømærker og effekter new markets. Furthermore, the costs of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> are very limited. However, companies also have to realise that <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> is not a panacea, which automatically generates a number of positive impacts. * Customers. It is often concluded that customers care about the environment and are willing to pay a price premium for environmentalfriendly goods and services. However, this is not always the case. The results indicate that the customers’ actual purchasing behaviour is not necessarily in accordance with ‘green’ purchasing policies. For instance, a number of companies have experienced that the public procurement practises are inconsistent with formal policies. Realising that the public sector is the driver of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> much has to be done in order to improve the public procurement: - e. g. through education, campaigns and political action. * Administrators. In general, companies are not pleased with the fee structure of the labelling schemes. They think it would be fairer to impose the fees on the companies who do not produce eco-labelled products. Moreover, when eco-labels in general do not increase profit of products and services, the fees inevitable become an impediment to the future growth of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling.</b> In general, there is a need to align the fee structure as well as the administrative procedures to the actual costs and advantages of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling...</b>|$|R

When consumers in opinion polls are asked if their purchasing decisions would be influenced by information on environmental or ethical aspects of products, the majority seem very ready to say yes. However, evidence for actual behavior along these lines is still limited. The paper presents an empirical analysis of the effect of a certified <b>environmental</b> <b>label</b> (the Nordic Swan), using a large Danish consumer panel with detailed information on actual purchases from the beginning of 1997 to January 2001 (weekly observations). In 1997, few products with the Nordic Swan label were available on the Danish market, as Denmark did not join the program of the other Nordic countries until April, 1997. Since then a considerable number of brands of different products in the Danish market have obtained the label, and the data includes information on purchases before and after a number of brands obtained the Swan label. In the paper we use a multinomial logit model to quantify the effect of the Swan label on consumers' choices among different brands of toilet paper, paper towels and detergents. It does appear that the Nordic Swan label has had a significant effect on Danish consumers' brand choices for toilet paper and detergents, corresponding to a willingness to pay for the certified <b>environmental</b> <b>label</b> of 10 - 17 % of price of the labelled products.

40|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important in the decision making process of consumers and producers. A credible <b>environmental</b> <b>label</b> can only be established if it is issued by a neutral or state organisation {{on the basis of}} scientifically derived criteria. This holds true for the Blue Angel issued by the German Institute for Quality Control and Designation e. V. (RAL, Deutsches Institut f G und Kennzeichnungen). A growing number of environmental labels are being introduced through internal declarations of single companies or groups choosing their own criteria. The credibility of such declarations, in the opinion of consumers, is generally slight. A case study of dispersion paints labelled with the Blue Angel indicates that environmental consciousness of' consumers can, {{with the help of a}} credible <b>environmental</b> <b>label</b> be transformed into higher market penetration of a labelled product. Proce differences between labelled and competing non-labelled products should be moderate, as in general the willingness to pay more for an environmentally friendly product is not pronounced. Applying the results of the case study on dispersion paints to other products is restricted by the fact that consumers are not necessarily as directly affected by negative environmental effects of these products as they are by the toxic fumes emitted by paints containing solvents. Given a less significant direct effect on consumers, the sales and price dynamics should be lower than the behaviour observed for dispersion paints...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Environmental labels on products and services have been increasingly significant in influencing consumer purchasing and represent a crucial communication of the environmental credentials of products and companies. Yet their importance to industrial designers, who are recognised as having significant influence over {{the environmental impact of}} products, is less known. The overall aim of this research project is to investigate factors affecting the implementation of UK environmental labels by in-house industrial designers in UK Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). A review of the literature on industrial designers and environmental labels found that there was a gap in knowledge surrounding the factors affecting how and whether in-house industrial designers implement labels in their work, and what understanding they have. In response to the literature review a number of research questions were generated, which influenced the direction of this emergent, exploratory research. A Preliminary Study was set up to collect qualitative data from practicing industrial designers in UK SMEs on their recognition and use of <b>environmental</b> <b>label</b> schemes. A mock-up Resource was consequently developed that provided the information the Preliminary Study participants claimed to need. During the Main Study the Resource was used as an elicitation tool to further probe designers‟ understanding and use of labels. Subsequently, three Case Studies were conducted with UK SMEs who have implemented labels on their products, to identify elements of best practice. The in-house SME designers in the study appeared to have knowledge of <b>environmental</b> <b>label</b> types and schemes. Both this and designers‟ position within their companies especially in terms of their input on design briefs moderates their ability to implement labels. The cooperation and contribution of colleagues is also significant to the effective application including driving their use and being willing to include them in the product development process from early stages to impact on success or effectiveness. It is suggested that a whole company approach is needed. This thesis provides an original contribution to knowledge on in-house designers' capability to implement labels; understanding of designers' current knowledge and use of labels; and the role of designers in all SMEs, not just those engaged in ecodesign or using environmental labels...|$|E

Free access to paperPurpose: The {{pressure}} on the food industry and {{society as a whole}} to evolve towards more sustainable production and consumption has increased in recent years. There are a number of drivers that can help reduce environmental impacts including legislative instruments, retail marketing and consumer choices and demand. One driver that has received attention recently is the use of product labels, either on a single issue or on multiple issues (using omni-labelling). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report on a framework that emerged from a wider study exploring effective approaches to <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> of food products. Approach: The study reviewed techniques for assessing the environmental impacts of food production and undertook a consultation with industry and consumer experts to ascertain their views (using multi-criteria mapping) on the practicality and efficacy of environmental labelsFindings: The wider study found that although the science is not sufficiently robust to develop an outcome-based, environmentally broad, omni-label at this time, there is a role for <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> in conjunction with other initiatives to improve the sustainability of food production and consumption. The framework presented aims to support this role and help improve the practicality and efficacy of <b>environmental</b> <b>labels.</b> It provides a series of interrelated guidelines which provide a basis for developing more effective, robust, credible and practical <b>environmental</b> <b>labels</b> for food. Practical implications: The framework can be used to design new, or evaluate existing labelling schemes, to identify opportunities for improvements. The process is illustrated with an application to four existing schemes. Originality/value: Eco-labelling of food products is gaining interest globally, but there are numerous issues that need to be fully understood in order to develop credible and robust labelling systems...|$|R

The analysis considers the stages of collection, treatment and distribution of potable water through the regional network, whilst the use stage of water is not included. Methods The selection of a methodological pattern coherently with the requirements of an <b>environmental</b> <b>label</b> such as the EPDs aims at allowing comparability among different studies. Results The analysis shows the shares of impacts along the life cycle chain, i. e. outputs by well fields and spring groups, purification and desalination plants, water losses in the waterworks, electrical consumption of waterworks systems and impacts of network maintenance. As concerns Global Warming Potential (GWP), the impact of purification plants represents a 6 - 7 % share of the total, whilst desalination 74 %. Water losses in the waterworks show an impact of 15 - 17 %, the contribution owing to electrical consumption of waterworks systems and network maintenance results to be 3 %. Desalination plants represents the major contribution to all the considered impact categories. Conclusions As concerns management issues, the most relevant impact categories resulted to be GWP, non-renewable energy resources and water consumption. Since the results for non-renewable energy resources are strictly connected to GWP emissions,, carbon footprint and water footprint can be profitably used as single issue indicators without the risk of burden shifting in studies aiming to evaluate the impact of potable water distribution...|$|E
