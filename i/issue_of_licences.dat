40|$|The Court (Grand Chamber) {{ruled that}} Article 49 TFEU must be {{interpreted}} as not precluding, in principle, national legislation, such as that at issue in the cases before the referring court (Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Asturias), which imposes some restrictions on the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences</b> {{for the opening of}} new pharmacies (i. e. establishment of limits based on population density or minimum distance between pharmacies). Nevertheless, Article 49 TFEU precludes such national legislation in so far as the basic ‘ 2 800 inhabitants’ and ‘ 250 metres’ rules prevent, in any geographical area which has special demographic features, the establishment of a sufficient number of pharmacies to ensure adequate pharmaceutical services, that being a matter for the national court to ascertain. The answer to {{the second part of the}} questions referred by the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Asturias was that Article 49 TFEU, read in conjunction with Article 1 (1) and (2) of Directive 85 / 432 /EC and Article 45 (2) (e) and (g) of Directive 2005 / 36 /EC, {{must be interpreted}} as precluding discriminatory criteria, such as those set out in points 6 and 7 (c) of the Annex to Decree 72 / 2001 (Asturias), under which licensees for new pharmacies are to be selected...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} whether new entry via mobile licensing in Europe has had any longer-term consequences for competition. Design/methodology/approach – A database is presented covering certain recent periods and the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences</b> {{for the provision of}} 2 G, 3 G and 4 G mobile services. Findings – It would appear that new entry has had very little overall effect on competition, although Hutchison Whampoa has, almost uniquely, forced a response from incumbents via a strategy of low prices, albeit without gaining significant market share at their expense. Research limitations/implications – Interpretation of databases cannot by its very nature be entirely free from ambiguity. Practical implications – In practice, given that very few 4 G (long-term evolution) licence regulations have reserved spectrum for new entrants, it may be presumed that most regulators in European countries have already observed that such new entry as is likely to be attracted will take the form of poorly funded companies from outside the mobile sector rather than incumbents from other countries. Social implications – Choice of incumbent network is being reduced, although mobile virtual network operators remain active. The implications for prices and service quality are for now a matter of debate. Originality/value – The databases underpinning this analysis are not available from other sources in the private or public domain in the form presented in this paper...|$|E
