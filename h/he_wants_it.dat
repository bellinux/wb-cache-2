5|$|While Silva had an {{impending}} fight with Franklin, {{he was still}} asked about his future with Jackson. Indeed, {{in an interview with}} Fighters Only Magazine, Silva reiterated his desire to fight Jackson for a fourth time, and added that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> to be the final fight of his career. He also said that he no longer has problems with Jackson outside of the cage. Silva ended by saying that he spoke with Jackson at UFC 95 in London, England, and the two shook hands.|$|E
5|$|After Amy (a playable character) {{complains}} about being bored, a bird wearing a Chaos Emerald necklace crashes into her in Sonic Adventure. She keeps the bird safe from E-100 Alpha, one of Eggman's robots. Amy later meets Sonic, and invites {{him to an}} amusement park (where they become separated). Alpha reappears, imprisoning Amy and the bird on Eggman's airship the Egg Carrier. Another Eggman robot, E-102 Gamma, orders Amy to give the bird to him; she refuses, asking him why <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>it.</b> He does not know, and changes his mind when she tells him he is missing out on love. E-102 Gamma lets them leave and, touched, Amy becomes his friend before she escapes into the ship's interior. On the deck, Eggman confronts her and grabs the bird's Chaos Emerald. Sonic and Gamma appear, and when Sonic tries to destroy Gamma Amy defends him. Sonic agrees to spare Gamma, and Amy leaves with Tails. She later sees {{a photo of the}} bird and its parents (whom Eggman has also stolen) in its necklace. When Amy looks for them in the jungle, she again finds the Egg Carrier. The bird's parents emerge on the deck; Alpha appears, and injures Amy's bird. Amy destroys Alpha, and waves goodbye to the three departing birds.|$|E

500|$|Though as a {{minor league}} prospect, analysts derided his {{defensive}} potential, with one calling him [...] "terrible", he progressively improved. Late in 2013, Sandberg commented on his defensive improvement: [...] "I see tremendous progress on his footwork out there, his reads on balls, his quickness, his reacting to the hops and getting the hop <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b> <b>It</b> looks like he's really worked on his glove play, just using the glove along with his strong accurate arm. It's a very true ball that he throws over there. It's got a lot on it. I've {{seen a lot of}} improving developments since I saw him in mid-February. He's come a long way." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} that when Ceawlin and Cuthwine took Bath, they found the Roman baths still operating to some extent. [...] Nennius, a ninth-century historian, mentions a [...] "Hot Lake" [...] {{in the land of}} the Hwicce, which was along the Severn, and adds [...] "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes. [...] If <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> <b>it</b> will be a cold bath; and if he wants a hot bath, it will be hot". [...] Bede also describes hot baths in the geographical introduction to the Ecclesiastical History in terms very similar to those of Nennius.|$|E
500|$|Mutual were {{patient with}} Chaplin's {{decreased}} rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his aforementioned {{concern about the}} declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations, Chaplin's primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business manager, told the press, [...] "Charlie [...] be allowed {{all the time he}} needs and all the money for producing [...] the way <b>he</b> <b>wants...</b> <b>It</b> is quality, not quantity, we are after." [...] In June 1917, Chaplin signed to complete eight films for First National Exhibitors' Circuit in return for $1million. He chose to build his own studio, situated on five acres of land off Sunset Boulevard, with production facilities of the highest order. It was completed in January 1918, and Chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures.|$|E

500|$|Selman commented in {{an audio}} {{commentary}} for [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] that [...] "the {{thing that really}} got the [...] writers excited about the episode was this very specific version of future Bart." [...] Greaney identified this version as [...] "the guy who blames everyone else and tells everyone else {{that they used to}} be cool, that it's everyone else's fault that his life hasn't gone the way <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> to go." [...] The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully also noted that future Bart is {{the kind of person who}} is [...] "always waiting for some big sort of cash payoff that he feels he's owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that's gonna come sooner or later." [...] Greaney said that everyone in the writing room recognized these traits from people they knew and therefore everyone contributed to the episode by suggesting lines for Bart to say and things for him to do.|$|E
500|$|After {{news of his}} mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might {{attempt to}} escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison {{punishment}} box. After being released from the box, receiving word that his mother's burial is completed and being told to forget about her, Luke is determined to escape. Under {{the cover of a}} Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is later recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but not before one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies from strain caused by struggling through barbed-wire fences. After his capture and return, the Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, [...] "What we've got here is failure to communicate.

500|$|The {{museum has}} so far {{received}} pledges from four men—an Icelander, a German, an American and a Briton—to donate their penises. Canadian film-maker Zach Math comments that the American, Tom Mitchell, [...] "is an ordinary guy but he has this quirk where he thinks of his penis as a separate entity from his body— Elmo. He has this dream that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> {{to be the most}} famous penis in the world." [...] According to Sigurður, Mitchell [...] "wanted to have his penis cut off even during his lifetime and then visit the museum." [...] Mitchell sent a cast of his penis to serve as a substitute in the meantime, along with photographs of it dressed up as Santa Claus and Abraham Lincoln. The donor also tattooed his penis with the Stars and Stripes to make it look more appealing. He says that [...] "I've always thought it'd be really cool for my penis to be the first true penis celebrity" [...] and has made it the star of its own comic book, Elmo: Adventures of a Superhero Penis.|$|E

500|$|Bath {{may have}} been the site of the Battle of Badon (500 AD), in which King Arthur is said to have {{defeated}} the Anglo-Saxons. The town was captured by the West Saxons in 577 after the Battle of Deorham; the Anglo-Saxon poem The Ruin may describe the appearance of the Roman site about this time. A monastery was founded at an early date– reputedly by Saint David although more probably in 675 by Osric, King of the Hwicce, perhaps using the walled area as its precinct. Nennius, a 9th-century historian, mentions a [...] "Hot Lake" [...] {{in the land of the}} Hwicce along the River Severn, and adds [...] "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes. If <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> <b>it</b> will be a cold bath; and if he wants a hot bath, it will be hot". Bede described hot baths in the geographical introduction to the Ecclesiastical History in terms very similar to those of Nennius. King Offa of Mercia gained control of the monastery in 781 and rebuilt the church, which was dedicated to St. Peter.|$|E
500|$|Another {{issue is}} the extent to which Kahn {{deliberately}} introduced elements into some of his buildings that give them the ageless atmosphere of ruins. [...] Kahn himself spoke of [...] "wrapping ruins around buildings", although in the context of another project. In his essay [...] "Louis I. Kahn and the Ruins of Rome," [...] Vincent Scully argues that Kahn followed this practice in several of his buildings, including this library, saying, [...] "And in his library at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, Kahn won't even let it become a building; <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> to remain a ruin. [...] The walls don't connect at the top. [...] They remain like a hollow shell". [...] Romaldo Giurgola, on the other hand, avoids this interpretation in the entry he wrote for Louis Kahn in the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects. In it, while discussing the arrangement of exterior components of Kahn's National Assembly Building of Bangladesh, Giurgola wrote, [...] "This relationship with daylight was the determining element behind this solution, rather than the formal desire to 'create ruins,' as some critics have suggested." [...] In the very next paragraph Guirgola describes the chamfered corners of the library at Phillips Exeter by saying only that Kahn used this device to show that the structural importance of the corner is greatly reduced in buildings like the Exeter library that are constructed with reinforced concrete and other modern materials.|$|E

2500|$|The {{problems}} with his memory had become embarrassing to Emerson and he ceased his public appearances by 1879.

2500|$|According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and {{theories}} behind parkour {{are an integral}} aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> [...] "to be alive" [...] and [...] "for people to use it". Châu Belle explains it is a [...] "type of freedom" [...] or [...] "kind of expression"; that parkour is [...] "only a state of mind" [...] rather than a set of actions, {{and that it is}} about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers. Traceur Dylan Baker says, [...] "Parkour also influences one's thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles". A study by Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Yale {{sought to}} recruit Fitzpatrick to return {{once again to}} that school. [...] At the time, one paper wrote: [...] "It is no {{exaggeration to say that}} today Fitzpatrick stands head and {{shoulders}} over every trainer in the country, just as Yost outshines rival football coaches. [...] And without Fitzpatrick, Yost could not produce the winning football teams he does." [...] A team from Yale visited Fitzpatrick in June 1905 but left Ann Arbor with the report that it was [...] "impossible to get Keene away from Michigan." [...] It was said: [...] "Keene is located there, with everything pleasant and just as <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>it,</b> and they say they won't let him go and he says he can't come. [...] So Yale must give up hoping for him." [...] Fitzpatrick {{declined to comment on the}} offers and said, [...] "Ann Arbor is a good place to live in and I like the Michigan spirit." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to feedback from players, Zero Time Dilemma {{was intended to}} be more suspenseful than Virtue's Last Reward: Uchikoshi and the game's producer decided that, as Zero Time Dilemma is the final Zero Escape game, they should no longer hold back and instead do what they had always wanted to do. Because of the life-and-death theme, they felt that there would be less of an impact if they had held back, and that they instead should make the violence in the game [...] "extreme" [...] to make the player's choices hit home. According to Uchikoshi, the development team wanted the player to feel worried, and that the game would be done as <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> without any changes done for the sake of age ratings: they had originally considered aiming for a CERO D age rating – 17 years or older – but decided to aim for a Z age rating instead, which is the highest age rating in Japan, as they felt they could not get the visual and emotional impact they wanted within a D rating. Despite this, CERO ended up assigning the game a D rating.|$|E
2500|$|As of May 2017, the end {{results of}} 25 years of {{breeding}} to reawaken the hunting instinct {{have been a}} success. It has resulted in dogs that are very eager to please their masters. It {{has resulted in a}} gun dog with extreme intelligence, a relentless drive to catch its quarry, and strong swimming skills that requires special training: their aptitude is second only to the British Border Collie and thus the hunting Standard Poodle requires the gunman to be quite specific as to what he wants and how <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> done. Unlike other spaniels and retrievers, Standard Poodles will attempt to solve a problem independently and need to be told specifically what is wanted when tracking and retrieving a bird. Because they are highly intelligent, harsh or violent training methods do not work with this dog breed in the field-corrections must be timely, given with precision and the trainer must have a firm but kind hand; an overbearing owner training his dog to hunt will find his Standard poodle terrified of his master and the entire experience, and refusing to budge an inch towards the water or into the brush.|$|E
2500|$|Lone Wolf {{was one of}} {{the first}} Indian artists to paint other Indians, and Indian subjects. He was also one of the first Indian artists to be academically trained in art. [...] He was known for both his {{painting}} and sculpting skills. He played a [...] "significant role" [...] in capturing the events of the American West during the latter part of the 1800s and the early part of the 1900s. He had personal experience, as well as his tribe's personal knowledge of people and events. He was the first Indian to achieve national recognition as an artist, creating over 500 paintings. He was influenced and encouraged by Thomas Moran, who he met during his time wrangling at the Grand Canyon, and his style has been compared to that of Frederic Remington and Charles Marion Russell. Russell also encouraged and instructed Lone Wolf in his early career. Lone Wolf had his first solo show in Los Angeles in 1917. The headline in the Los Angeles Times about the exhibition read, [...] "Vance Thompson Discovers Wonderful Indian Artist, An Artist With a Vision." [...] In that article, Vance Thompson said of Lone Wolf, [...] "The message he has to give is his own; and already he has shaped – if he has not perfected – a distinct, individual and interesting technique." [...] He went to say, [...] "It is a rare thing to discover an artist. I have seen the young painters pass in droves through the schools and salons of Paris, and in 20 years I can claim to have been the discoverer of only one great artist. Now I like to think that I have, at last, discovered another and he is an artist who has authentic vision, sincerity and a brush which is already capable of doing precisely the thing <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> to..." ...|$|E
