40|$|A {{system of}} {{orthonormal}} functions representing the eigenmodes of an optical resonator with perfectly spherical mirror surfaces {{has been described}} in the literature. In real experiments, however, the wave front of the <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> will be deformed by surface irregularities or index inhomogeneities inside components traversed by the beam. We describe quantitatively the relative power transferred out of the fundamental mode into higher-order modes by these irregularities...|$|R

40|$|Accurately {{setting the}} path length around {{the machine is}} central to the proper {{operation}} of the CEBAF accelerator. The CEBAF main accelerator consists of two recirculating superconducting linacs operating at 1497 MHz fundamental frequency. The electron beam can recirculate up to five times through the two linacs before it is extracted to the experimental halls. In order to obtain maximum energy gain and minimum energy spread through the linacs, all passes should arrive {{at the beginning of the}} linacs in phase at the crest of the RF cycle. In this paper we explain how the arrival times of higher <b>pass</b> <b>beams</b> are measured with respect to the first pass to less than one degree of RF phase and how the path length around the machine is adjusted. Following a brief introduction to the CEBAF design and some local nomenclature, these topics will be discussed: differential RF phase measurements of time delay, the energy method of cresting the higher <b>pass</b> <b>beams,</b> results obtained with the measurement techniques, future plans and improvements to the devices, and finally, a set of conclusions. 3 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab...|$|R

Strong men {{patted him on the}} back and urged him gruffly to say {{what he had to say}} and laugh afterwards. Mr. Grummit turned from the window, and in a slow and stately fashion prepared to retire for the night. Even the sudden and startling disappearance of Mrs. Grummit as she got into bed failed to move him.|$|R

First the beam current threshold of the instability was calculated by the linear two-beam theory of ion trapping. Then a computer program based on weak-strong model was written to simulate {{the interaction between the}} ions and the beam, the tracking results successfully reproduced the betatron side bands observed experimentally, and gave a more reasonable growth time of the instability. 1...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for using SRF {{cavities}} in particle accelerators is that their large apertures result in low beam impedance and higher thresholds of deleterious beam instabilities. As a charged particle <b>beam</b> <b>passes</b> through a cavity, its electromagnetic radiation field is perturbed by the sudden increase of the conducting wall diameter in the transition from the small-diameter beampipe to the large hollow RF cavity. A portion of the particle's radiation field is then [...] "clipped off" [...] upon re-entrance into the beampipe and left behind as wakefields in the cavity. The wakefields are simply superimposed upon the externally driven accelerating fields in the cavity. The spawning of electromagnetic cavity modes as wakefields from the <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> is analogous to a drumstick striking a drumhead and exciting many resonant mechanical modes.|$|R

40|$|Following {{a series}} of {{injection}} tests, the first attempts to <b>pass</b> <b>beam</b> around both directions of the LHC were successful and led rapidly to circulating beam in the counter clockwise direction (beam 2) and many turns of beam 1. Unfortunately the beam commissioning was curtailed by the incident in sector 34. However, measurements performed during this first commissioning period showed that the magnet model of the machine had delivered optics close to nominal and also very good performance of beam instrumentation and supporting software. Details of the machine set-up and the commissioning procedures are given. The measurements performed and the key results from this period are described...|$|R

This line and the RHIC first sextant currently contain the following complement of beam instrumentation: stripline position monitors, ionization loss monitors, video profile monitors, and commercial current transformers. Over several years, these systems have been designed and bench tested to assure a desired performance level. Using data from laboratory tests and the recent single <b>pass</b> <b>beam</b> tests, attained performance will be reported. Finally, experience from the beam based tests will {{be applied to the}} design criteria for the future collider ring instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|The fast beam-ion {{instability}} (FBII) {{has been}} studied experimentally at the Pohang Light Source. As the vacuum pressure increased by turning-off all ion pumps or by injection of Helium gas into the storage ring, the FBII was spontaneously excited. The oscillation amplitude, ion frequency, and bunch size blow-up were first measured for individual bunches from the snapshots of the bunch train taken by a streak camera and a single <b>pass</b> <b>beam</b> position monitor. By measuring the bunch-by-bunch parameters along the bunch train, we obtained important parameters of the FBII: bunch size blow-up factor of 2 σy, and the amplitude of oscillation {{by a factor of}} 1. 5 σy. ...|$|R
50|$|Quartz iodine lamps, using {{elemental}} iodine, {{were the}} first commercial halogen lamps launched by GE in 1959. Quite soon, bromine {{was found to have}} advantages, but was not used in elemental form. Certain hydrocarbon bromine compounds gave good results. Regeneration of the filament is also possible with fluorine, but its chemical reactivity is so great that other parts of the lamp are attacked. The halogen is normally mixed with a noble gas, often krypton or xenon. The first lamps used only tungsten for filament supports, but some designs use molybdenum - an example being the molybdenum shield in the H4 twin filament headlight for the European Asymmetric <b>Passing</b> <b>Beam.</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{inadvertent}} or unwanted {{angular deviation}} to a <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> can be introduced by any single optical component within an optical system. The problem arises {{due to an}} imperfect tilt alignment of the optical component or manufacturing defects which results {{in a slightly different}} response than expected from an ideally aligned/manufactured component. The resulting beam deviation can plague any well-designed optical system that assumes the use of ideal components. The problem is especially introduced by non-ideal lenses, transparent plates and optical windows. Here we present a simple method of manually introducing a deviation error angle which we assume to be constant for all beam incidence angles over the paraxial range. Comment: 6 Pages, 2 Figure...|$|R
40|$|An {{achromatic}} Interaction Region (IR) design {{concept is}} presented {{with an emphasis}} on its application at an electron-ion collider. A specially-designed symmetric Chromaticity Compensation Block (CCB) induces an angle spread in the <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> such that it cancels the chromatic kick of the final focusing quadrupoles. Two such CCB's placed symmetrically around an interaction point (IP) allow simultaneous compensation of the 1 st-order chromaticities and chromatic beam smear at the IP without inducing significant 2 nd-order aberrations. Special attention is paid to the difference in the electron and ion IR design requirements. We discuss geometric matching of the electron and ion IR footprints. We investigate limitations on the momentum acceptance in this IR design...|$|R
40|$|Laser Diode Array (LDA) {{appears to}} be most {{efficient}} means of transferring power from Earth to satellites and between satellites, in terms of mass and size, of various laser configurations. To form large-scale-array amplifier (LSAA), element LDA's must generate well-defined diffraction-limited beams. Coherent matching of phases among LDA's enables system to generate good beam pattern in far field over thousands of kilometers. By <b>passing</b> <b>beam</b> from master laser through number of LDA amplifiers simultaneously, one realizes coherence among amplified output beams. LSAA used for transmission of power with efficiency of approximately 80 percent into receiver of moderate size at 5, 000 km. Also transmits data at high rates by line-of-sight rather than fiber optics...|$|R

The telescope is comprised of six CMS PSI 46 pixel plaquettes, arranged as three stations of horizontal and vertical planes, with the CAPTAN system for data acquisition and control. The purpose of the pixel telescope is to measure beam profiles produced by bent crystals under various conditions. The telescope electronics inside the beam pipe initially were not adequately shielded from the image current of the <b>passing</b> <b>beams.</b> A new shielding approach was devised and installed, which resolved the problem.
