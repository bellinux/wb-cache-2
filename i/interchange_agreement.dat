Concorde service began in 1979 between Dallas-Fort Worth and Washington, D.C., with service to Paris and London on interchange flights with Air France and British Airways. Flights between Dallas-Fort Worth and Washington Dulles airports carried Braniff cockpit and cabin crews, while British or French crews flew across the Atlantic.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between observable patient and doctor verbal and non-verbal behaviors {{and the degree of}} enablement in consultations according to the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) (a patient-reported consultation outcome measure). Methods: We analyzed 88 recorded routine primary care consultations. Verbal and non-verbal communications were analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) and the Medical Interaction Process System, respectively. Consultations were categorized as patient- or doctor-centered and by whether the patient or doctor was verbally dominant using the RIAS categorizations. Results Consultations that were regarded as patient-centered or verbally dominated by the patient on RIAS coding were considered enabling. Socio-emotional <b>interchange</b> (<b>agreements,</b> approvals, laughter, legitimization) was associated with enablement. These features, together with task-related behavior explain up to 33...|$|R

50|$|Power pooling is used {{to balance}} {{electrical}} load over a larger network (electrical grid) than a single utility. It is a mechanism for interchange of power between two and more utilities which provide or generate electricity For exchange of power between two utilities there is an <b>interchange</b> <b>agreement</b> which is signed by them, but signing up an <b>interchange</b> <b>agreement</b> between each pair of utilities within a system can be a difficult task where several large utilities are interconnected. Thus, it is more advantageous to form a power pool with a single agreement that all join. That agreement provides established terms and conditions for pool members and is generally more complex than a bilateral agreement.|$|E

50|$|The bus {{interchange}} facility {{opened in}} 1979 was basic. The {{location of the}} station meant the land and airspace on which it was located was highly valuable.

The round trip routing of this interchange flight was Houston-Dallas/Fort Worth-Seattle-Anchorage-Fairbanks with Seattle, Washington serving as the interchange point where flight and cabin crews were changed from one airline to the other.

5000|$|In 1963 Delta {{entered an}} <b>interchange</b> <b>agreement</b> with Pan American World Airways {{allowing}} it to fly to Europe; in 1970 the airline entered the [...] "wide-body" [...] jet era. Delta purchased Northeast Airlines in 1972, expanding in the northeastern United States with routes to Canada, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and Miami. In August 1979 Delta was the first airline {{in the world to}} board one million passengers at one airport in one month (Atlanta). In 1984 the company started Delta Connection linking feeder airlines flying to smaller cities to Delta nodes. The same year, Delta began flying to Honolulu International Airport, Hawaii, with L-1011s. Delta started flights to Tokyo, Japan, from Portland, Oregon, on March 2, 1987. The following month, Delta merged with Western Airlines of Los Angeles and absorbed its hubs at Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, which brought access to the West, Mexico, and Western Canada and made Delta the fourth largest U.S. carrier and fifth largest world carrier.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{creation}} of the National Railway, in cases where connection was being made between the two railways, an [...] "interchange ticket" [...] was issued and the fare was collected. This was carried over from the time before the establishment of Manchukuo, when such interchange agreements had been made with the privately owned railways that were later nationalised. Mantetsu's official currency was the Korean yen, while the National Railway the used Haikwan tael. After calculating the fares for the sections on the company and national lines separately, they were converted to the currency used by the railway owning the station where the ticket was being bought, based on a standardised conversion rate, and the two fares were then added together to determine the final ticket price. For example, if a ticket was bought for a trip from Dalian to Jilin, the price was payable in Korean yen, as Dalian was on Mantetsu; if the ticket was for a trip from Jilin to Dalian, it was payable in taels, as Jilin was on the National Railway. The <b>interchange</b> <b>agreement</b> also limited where such interchange tickets could be bought, and so they were available for purchase only at major stations.|$|E

At one point, Continental Airlines was operating Boeing 737-300 jet service on a [...] "cross-town" [...] route between Hobby and Houston Intercontinental as a feeder service for its IAH hub as well as flying nonstop service between HOU and its Newark hub. In 2008 the airport handled 8.8 million passengers.

30|$|Within the U.S. port terminal, {{the terms}} of the Uniform Intermodal <b>Interchange</b> <b>Agreement</b> (UIIA) require that the {{equipment}} provider make known equipment return locations prior to 1600 Â h. Otherwise, the motor carrier will return the equipment to the location where it was originally interchanged. Some equipment providers do this on their own websites or through group efforts such as www.returnlocation.com. The UIIA {{is in the process of}} building a matrix for all equipment providers on their own website. Recently, however, supply chain partners have been unilaterally changing standard terms for their own benefit, disrupting the carrier plans. We suggest that the carrier alliances could have a greater role in equipment returns within ports as part of a Service Agreement.|$|E

This paper describes the solutions that introduce the open-EDI system properties. 1 Introduction Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) has been progressing steadily during the last decade, after the open systems interconnection (OSI) basic Reference Model was adopted in 1980 and since the information technology has provided world-wide connectivity and inter-exchange of digital data across multiple systems and diverse applications.

40|$|Communication {{processes}} in the commercial sectors {{are more and more}} using the services offered by the telecommunication industry. This is also due for the electronic data interchange (EDI) of business data which represents one of the most recent teleservices. This trend leads to the standardization of the data exchange, where EDIFACT (Electronic Data Interchange For Administration, Commerce and Transport) seams to be the global standard for the forseeable future. However, the EDIFACT standard approach includes a number of shortcomings that keep many firms and organizations from participating in this area of electronic commerce. One of the worst shortcomings is that in order to be generally valid EDIFACT is too complex in its structure and consequently too hard to read and navigate. The `real' data interchange between two business partners is usually based on a very small subset of the generally valid standard. Therefore, a detailed functional <b>interchange</b> <b>agreement</b> to define the format [...] ...|$|E
