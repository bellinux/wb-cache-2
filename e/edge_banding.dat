50|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>banding</b> is used {{to cover}} the exposed sides of {{materials}} such as plywood, particle board or MDF, increasing durability and giving {{the appearance of a}} solid or more valuable material. Common substitutes for edgebanding include face frames or molding. <b>Edge</b> <b>banding</b> can be made of different materials including PVC, ABS, acrylic, melamine, wood or wood veneer.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> was {{a manual}} process {{requiring}} ordinary carpentry tools and materials. In modern applications, particularly for high-volume, repetitive manufacturing steps such as cabinet doors, <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> {{is applied to}} the substrate by an automated process using a hot-melt adhesive. Hot melt adhesives can be water or solvent based and may consist of various raw materials including EVA, PUR, PA, APOA, and PO. A substrate primer may also be used as a bonding agent between the adhesive and the substrate. Thicker edge bandings typically require a slight concavity to provide a tight glue line. The thickness can vary from [...]018" [...] to 5mm or even more. The machine that applies the <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> is called edgebander. An edgebander bonds the <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> to the substrate, trims the leading and trailing edges, trims top and bottom flush with the substrate, scraps any surplus, and buffs the finished edge.|$|E

In this experiment real size square shape kitchen cabinet have been manufactured using screw and two types of board, bare MDF without <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> and melamine overlaid MDF with <b>edge</b> <b>band,</b> both were exposed to accelerated aging test. Totally 50 boxes have been constructed and tested. 25 boxes manufactured with bare MDF and without <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> and 25 boxes (which were exactly similar) with melamine overlaid MDF with <b>edge</b> <b>band.</b> Total of five treatments (including control samples) which were only different in aging time, have been implemented on cabinets. Then the stiffness of these kitchen cabinets has been evaluated. Results of statistical analysis showed {{that the effect of}} treatments on the stiffness of melamine overlaid MDF cabinets with <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> is significant at 1 % level (confidence level of 99 %). Comparison of T 1 (control) and T 5 (harshest) treatment showed that in both board types structure nearly 10 % decrease in cabinet stiffness happened. The same rate of reduction after the harshest aging in stiffness of both types of cabinets compared to their control samples was observed. Nevertheless cabinets manufactured with melamine overlaid MDF with <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> have demonstrated {{more than three times the}} stiffness of the cabinets manufactured of bare MDF without <b>edge</b> <b>band.</b> This proves that the effect of overlaid and <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> in increasing stiffness of cabinets is very outstanding...|$|R
40|$|We {{proposed}} a minimal model {{to describe the}} Floquet band structure of two-dimensional materials with light-induced resonant inter-band transition. We applied it to graphene to study the band features caused by the light irradiation. Linearly polarized light induces pseudo gaps (gaps are functions of wavevector), and circularly polarized light causes real gaps on the quasi-energy spectrum. If the polarization of light is linear and along the longitudinal direction of zigzag ribbons, flat <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> appear in the pseudo gaps, and if is in the lateral direction of armchair ribbons, curved <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> can be found. For the circularly polarized cases, <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> arise and intersect in the gaps of both types of ribbons. The <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> induced by the circularly polarized light are helical and those by linearly polarized light are topologically trivial ones. The Chern number of the Floquet band, which reflects the number of pairs of helical <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> in graphene ribbons, can be reduced into the winding number at resonance.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} and wooden dowels {{are being used}} increasingly {{in the construction of}} furniture frames and inner decoration. Yet there is little information available concerning the withdrawal strength of various fasteners, and, in particular, dowels in composite materials edged solid wood edge bandings. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the withdrawal strengths of 6, 8, 10 mm diameter dowels produced from beech with respect to edge of a medium-density fiberboard (MDF) or particleboard (PB) edged with 5, 10 and 15 mm thickness of solid wood <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> of uludag fir, bonded with different adhesives.

40|$|The {{future of}} {{cellular}} radio ICs {{lies in the}} integration of an ever-increasing number of bands and channel bandwidths. This paper presents a transceiver together with the associated discrete front-end components. The transceiver supports 4 <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and 9 WCDMA bands (l-VI and Vlll-X), while the radio can be configured to simultaneously support the 4 <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and up to 5 WCDMA bands: 3 high bands (HB) and 2 low bands (LB). The RX is a SAW-less homodyne composed of a main RX and a diversity RX. To reduce package complexity with so many bands, we chose to minimize the number of ports by using single-ended RF interfaces for both RX and TX. This saves seve ral package pins, but requires careful attention to grounding. The main RX has 8 LNA ports and the diversity RX has 5, with some LNAs supporting multiple bands. On the TX side, 2 ports are used for all <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and 4 for the WCDMA bands...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} for {{the examination of}} specimens at low electron beam intensity has been presented. Sections micrographed with this technique showed numerous knife scratches and frequently contained bands running parallel to the knife <b>edge.</b> <b>Banding</b> with an average spacing of 0. 2 Âµ appeared to result from periodic distortion produced by impact of the knife. At the beam intensities customarily employed, differential sublimation and probably flow of the methacrylate resulted in obliteration of the bands and all but the deepest knife scratches. In addition, changes in the size, shape, and orientation of certain structures were noted. Artifacts resulting from incineration or sublimation of tissue components fixed in formalin were illustrated, and the suggestion was made that such instability to the electron beam accounted in part for the differences observed in osmium- and formalin-fixed tissues. The deformation revealed in serial sections was discussed, and {{it was pointed out}} that shortening in the axis perpendicular to the knife edge was associated with elongation in the axis parallel to the cutting edge, the elongation usually occurring locally without change in the width of the section. It was noted that the material causing contamination of the surface of sections during examination exhibited no structure but caused progressive loss of contrast...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} protocols used in stereoscopic 3 D (S 3 D) displays {{have many}} parameters {{that affect the}} visibility of temporal artifacts. Flicker is visible at low presentation rates. Motion artifactsâjudder, <b>edge</b> <b>banding,</b> and edge blurâare salient at low capture rates. Different stereoscopic techniques can introduce distortions in apparent depth. For example, temporal interlacing (i. e., alternating presentation to the two eyes) can cause depth distortions for objects moving horizontally across the screen. Spatial interlacing (i. e., presenting information to the two eyes simultaneously, but with alternate pixel rows going to different eyes) avoids depth distortions, but causes a reduction in effect spatial resolution. We performed a psychophysical experiment to measure perceptual thresholds for three temporal artifacts in S 3 D displays: flicker, motion artifacts, and depth distortions. We used a stereoscope consisting of two CRTs running at 200 Hz. A high-precision synchronizer drove the two CRTs thereby allowing us to simulate {{a wide variety of}} S 3 D display protocols accurately. We measured the visibility of the three artifacts while varying presentation rate, capture rate, object contrast, and object velocity. We tested both temporal- and spatial-interlacing protocols. From the results, we developed a perceptual model of artifact visibility in S 3 D displays...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} waste materials resulted in the furniture manufacturing process as components for wood-plastic composites. The composites are produced from industrial byproducts, such as shavings and ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), without coupling agent. The two components are derived from industrial processes of furniture manufacturing: the first one consists of wood residues resulted from planing machine as planer shavings, and the second one from ABS <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> operation. A wide array of mixtures varying from 100 % ABS to 50 % ABS: 50 % shavings were used to produce eight variants of boards. Density was determined for each board and the method for the determination of ABS particle size distribution by oscillating screen method using sieve apertures up to 4 mm was also applied, {{in order to establish}} the particle fractions and the distribution of their sizes. Based on ABS properties, several technologies of manufacturing wood-plastic composites from the waste materials were tested {{and one of them was}} selected. The results of the first stage analysis, when the physical integrity and the compactness of the panelsâ structures were tested, have shown that a maximum proportion of 30 % of wood shavings is accepted in the mixture. On the other hand, the low density of the boards and their porous structure recommend further investigations for thermal and sound insulation application...|$|E

40|$|A sawmill {{operations}} were studied {{to know the}} coefficient of utilization and the dimensional quality of the timber located in the Sierra Sur of Oaxaca, Mexico. This was done during the transformation of pieces of wood in the Pinus spp. at the facilities of the Specialized Unit of Communal Forest Resources, located {{in the village of}} Santa Cruz Itundujia. A total of 101 pieces of wood were analyzed using the Samalian formula; the pieces had varied diametric measures, length of 2. 63 m, and a volume of 63. 37 and 58. 35 m 3, with and without bark. To determine the efficiency of sawed wood, the pieces of wood were classified in groups of eight diametric categories andÂ seven of conical shape. The study of time and movement included analysis of observations per sampling in intervals of two minutes to the three principal sections of the sawmill (saw, <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> machine, and circular saw). When the pieces of wood were processed, 1875 planks were generated with a 19. 05 mm of thickness; the production was evaluated in third and fourth class which was located with the decimal metric system, symbolizing 30. 12 m 3 of sawed wood. The coefficient of progress rate was 44. 18 % with and without bark, indicating that from every 1 m 3 r without bark, 216 of sawed wood is processed and to obtain 1000 pt, 4. 62 meters m 3 r of woodrollsare is required.

40|$|The {{assignment}} of this master thesis consists of initiating power, subcarrier allocation in a dynamic FFR based scheme designed for multi-cell OFDMA networks {{and to enhance}} the throughput of all center users in bandwidth hungry borrower cells (overloaded cells) which was previously degraded by original FFR 3 scheme {{as a result of}} partitioning of system bandwidth into center and <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> respectively. The method uses band borrowing to compensate center userâs throughput loss in a semi and fully overloaded system. The scheme uses dynamic programming method (0 / 1 knapsack problem) to bargain an <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> on various power levels and tends to check the best combination (power and sub-carrier) which the system can utilize while still maintaining acceptable throughput loss for the users {{at the edge of the}} neighboring cell (lender cell). The algorithm consists of generating a borrowing request to neighboring cells for utilizing their <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> by the overloaded borrower cell if their average center user throughput reaches below a minimum threshold value set in the system. The borrowing method uses 0 / 1 knapsack problem to capture an <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> based on limiting factors of total cost in average throughput losses by neighbors (Ci) and Un (tolerable mean user edge user throughput loss by lending cell). While solving knapsack problem the lender (neighbors) will check Ci and Un before granting the right to use its <b>edge</b> <b>band.</b> The later stage requires reducing subcarrier power level in order to utilize the lenders <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> using "soft borrower" mode. The borrowed sub-carriers will be activated take power from the original center band sub-carriers of the overloaded cell by taking into account the interference between the lender and the borrower. In case of negative (0) reply from the lender cell after the first request, multiple requests are generated at reduce power level at every step to order to acquire more bands. If a neighbor has band borrowing requests from multiple overloaded base stations, the band will be granted to the one which gives minimal loss in terms of throughput to the lender cell. The simulation results are analyzed w. r. t reuse- 1 and FFR 3 scheme of a multi cell regular and irregular scenarios comprising of lightly to heavily overloaded cells with various subcarrier allocation patterns. An overhead and time assessment is also presented between borrower and lender cells. Simulation results show an increase of 60 % in center userâs throughput w. r. t original FFR 3 scheme with an acceptable loss of 18 % at the edges in complex overloaded scenarios while the overall system throughout increases by 35 %...|$|R
