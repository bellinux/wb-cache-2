40|$|Abstract. The {{search space}} of {{constraint}} satisfaction problems (CSPs) {{can be reduced}} by using <b>value</b> <b>interchangeability.</b> This notion consists of aggregating subsets of values that behave similarly on the future branches of the search. BT-CPR [8], is a typical backtracking algorithm using <b>value</b> <b>interchangeability.</b> It uses the Cartesian product representation of the search space (CPR) which aggregates partial solutions and proves particularly useful for finding and representing all solutions of a CSP. It is assessed that maintaining arc-consistency (MAC) is the most efficient general algorithm for solving hard problems. A few work on combining MAC with CPR exists. In this paper we study comparatively two other possible alternatives of MAC-CPR. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>interchangeability</b> of <b>values</b> in CSPs, {{based on}} an approach where a single value {{in the domain of}} a variable can be treated as a combination of &quot;sub-values&quot;. An algorithm for removing overlapping sub-values is presented. The resulting CSPs take less time to find all solutions and yield a more compactly-representable, but equivalent, solution set. Experimental results show that, especially in loose problems with large numbers of solutions, dramatic savings in search cost are achieved. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{there are}} many general methods for case retrieval, case {{adaptation}} usually requires problem-specific knowledge {{and it is still}} an open problem. In this paper we propose a general method for solving case adaptation problems for the large class of problems which can be formulated as Constraint Satisfaction Problems. This method is based on the concept of <b>interchangeability</b> between <b>values</b> in problem solutions. The method is able to determine how change propagates in a solution set and generate a minimal set of choices which need to be changed to adapt an existing solution to a new problem.

40|$|In [Fre 91], Freuder {{defined the}} notion of <b>interchangeability</b> of <b>values</b> in a CSP, whose purpose {{is to reduce the}} size of the problem without losing any solution.

This paper explores this latter notion : firstly the partial pre-orders on domain values induced by the substitutability relation are emphasized; then these pre-orders are used to improve standard algorithms of resolution such as backtracking or forward-checking, for the task of computing a single solution : the size of the problem is reduced by filtering techniques that preserve the satisfiability.

40|$|Symmetry {{breaking}} in CSPs has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Various general schemes {{have been proposed}} to eliminate symmetries during search. In general, these schemes may take exponential space or time to eliminate all symmetries. This paper studies classes of CSPs for which symmetry breaking is tractable. It identifies several CSP classes which feature various forms of <b>value</b> <b>interchangeability</b> and shows that symmetry breaking can be performed in constant time and space during search using dedicated search procedures. Experimental results also show the benefits of symmetry breaking on these CSPs, which encompass many practical applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Symmetry in {{constraint}} {{problems can}} be exploited to greatly improve search performance. A form of symmetry {{that has been the}} subject of considerable research is <b>value</b> <b>interchangeability.</b> Automatically detecting full interchangeability is thought to be intractable, so research has focused on either discovery of local interchangeability or programmer knowledge of full interchangeability. This paper shows that full dynamic substitutability can be broken in a CSP by reformulating it as a SAT problem. No analysis is necessary, space requirements are modest, solutions are collected into Cartesian products, and unit propagation enforces forward checking on the CSP. In experiments on unsatisfiable problems, better results are obtained than with standard SAT encodings. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is devoted to}} define monthly-qualified gestational reference intervals for plasma renin, aldosterone and cortisol as derived by transverse or longitudinal approaches. Reference intervals refer to 95 % confidence interval, 90 % tolerance interval, the 95 % predictive interval, {{in addition to the}} mean plus or minus the standard error and standard deviation. By applying both methodological approaches it has been found that plasma renin and aldosterone exhibit a progressive gestational increase. By contrast, cortisol shows an initial increase and thereafter stays on the same values. Statistical analysis revealed the transversally [...] and longitudinally [...] derived reference intervals to be not statistically different. Because of such a similarity, laboratory medicine can interchangeably use both kinds of reference intervals for estimating the normality of plasma renin, aldosterone and cortisol values in a single case of pregnancy. This <b>interchangeability</b> of <b>values</b> leads to simplify the methodology for measuring plasma renin and aldosterone in pregnancy since {{it is not necessary to}} standardize the gestational nomograms for renin-sodium and/or aldosterone-sodium relationship. This is a real way to reduce the costs and to optimize the compliance in the monitoring of pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Many {{propagation}} {{and search}} algorithms {{have been developed}} for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). In a standard CSP all variables are existentially quantified. The CSP formalism can be extended to allow universally quantified variables, in which case the complexity of the basic reasoning tasks rises from NP-complete to PSPACE-complete. Such problems have, so far, been studied mainly in the context of quantified Boolean formulae. Little work has been done on problems with discrete non-Boolean domains. We attempt to fill this gap by extending propagation and search algorithms from standard CSPs to the quantified case. We also show how the notion of <b>value</b> <b>interchangeability</b> can be exploited to break symmetries and speed up search by orders of magnitude. Finally, we test experimentally the algorithms and methods proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of the research experiment of conducting hydrochemical observation of the Olechówka River in Łódź and its flow from the river source until its estuary. The main aim of the research was to set tendencies of changes in waters flowing down from municipal reception basin with developed rain drain system and in waters flowing into bathing areas at the same time. Along with the flow of the river, 12 measuring-research points were established. In each of those points, measurements of the discharge rate and mean flow velocity of water in the channel were performed, which enabled to set average time of the flow of water between individual measuring-research points. The time of storing water in reservoirs was taken into consideration. The total time of the flow of water in the Olechówka River amounted to 856 h and 15 min. The analyses included in situ measurements (T, pH, SEC), analytical determinations Cl−, NH 4 +, NO 3 −, TN, PO 43 −, TP and Oxidability. The <b>interchangeability</b> of <b>values</b> of tested indicators and discharge point out to their decrease along with the increase of water flowing in the riverbed. There were self-cleaning processes identified in the Olechówka River: dilution and denitrification, along with the accumulation of total phosphorus in the river flow...|$|R
40|$|We have {{proposed}} a method for dynamically posting symmetry breaking constraints to eliminate <b>value</b> <b>interchangeability</b> [1]. We now extend this method to work with any type of symmetry breaking constraint for any type of symmetry. We prove that this method is correct in general. That is, it only eliminates symmetric solutions. We also identify some simple conditions when it eliminates all symmetric solutions. We illustrate the method with a common type of symmetry where both variables and values partition into interchangeable sets, and a polynomial number of symmetry breaking constraints breaks an exponential number of symmetries. This hybrid approach inherits good properties of both dynamic and static symmetry breaking methods: we can have fast and efficient propagation on the posted symmetry breaking constraints, yet we do not conflict with the branching heuristic...|$|R
40|$|Constraint satisfaction- {{a method}} for {{representing}} and solving many AI problems in a very elegant manner- is a well-studied research area of recent years. Freuder observed that some constraint satisfaction problems are fashioned so that certain domain values of constraint variables are interchangeable. The use of such knowledge can increase search efficiency drastically by reducing the problem. In this paper we carry on these considerations and give a formal foundation of interchangeabilities by the notion of domain partitions induced by equivalence relations. We show how these domain partitions {{can be used in}} a very accurate manner by the majority of existing constraint propagation algorithms and introduce a novel backtrack procedure exploiting such <b>interchangeabilities</b> of domain <b>values.</b> Both theoretical analysis and experiments indicate that our proposed approach is an improvement of Freuder's use of neighborhood interchangeability and has very good behavior for certain problem types. ...|$|R
40|$|In [6], Freuder defines {{several types}} of {{interchangeability}} to capture the equivalence among the values of a variable in a discrete constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), and provides a procedure for computing one type of local interchangeability. In this paper, we first extend this procedure for computing a weak form of local interchangeability. Second, we show that the modified procedure {{can be used to}} generate a conjunctive decomposition of the CSP by localizing, in the CSP, independent subproblems. Third, for the case of constraints of mutual exclusion, we show that locally interchangeable values can be computed in a straightforward manner, and that the only possible type of local interchangeability is the one that induces locally independent subproblems. Finally, we give hints on how to exploit these results in practice, establish a lattice that relates some types of interchangeability, and identify directions for future research. 1 Introduction <b>Interchangeability</b> among the <b>value</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Since the {{discovery}} of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) the screening for prostate carcinoma has changed dramatically. In particular, an additional determination of PSA-subgroups such as the free PSA (fPSA) and the respective ratio fPSA/PSA (%fPSA), as well as the complexed PSA (cPSA), have improved this new markers diagnostical performance. The number of various, commercially available assays has been continuously increasing in the last twenty years. It has, however, been observed that different assays for the determination of total and free prostate-specific antigen (tPSA and fPSA) provide discordant results. These assay-dependent variations could lead to misinterpretations of individual PSA (and especially %fPSA-) values as well as to erroneous clinical decisions regarding prostate carcinoma. Apart the use of different antibody-combinations, other causes for these discordant results could be non-uniform assay calibration and non-equimolar detection of the various PSA forms. Equimolar-response assays and PSA reference materials, compiled by the WHO, have been developed in order to adjust PSA calibration. Since their introduction, though, several manufacturers (e. g., Beckman Coulter, Roche Diagnostics, and Diagnostic Products Corp.) have changed their assay platforms, and the few available comparison studies, with limited numbers of assays and small numbers of samples, have not yet fully characterized the current situation. Focusing on the clinically important tPSA range up to 10 µg/l, I have therefore evaluated and characterized five frequently used fPSA and tPSA assay combinations (in one case cPSA instead of fPSA) in terms of the following criteria: the <b>interchangeability</b> of PSA <b>values</b> among the assays, their respective equimolar characteristics, and the diagnostic accuracy as estimated by the ROC analyses, with particular emphasis on the percentage ratios of fPSA to tPSA (%fPSA). Sera from 468 patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and 330 men with no evidence of prostate cancer (NPCa) have been measured with the tPSA and fPSA assays by Abbott (AxSYM), Beckman Coulter (Access), Diagnostic Products Corporation (Immulite 2000), and Roche (Elecsys 2010), together with the tPSA and complexed PSA (cPSA) assays by Bayer (ADVIA Centaur). Within the two thirds of examined sera, a concentration from 0 to 10 µg/l has been measured. Estimated by the use of certain control materials supplied by the manufacturers, commercial control materials, and in-house serum pools, the between-run imprecision profiles of the measurements have been quite low, demonstrating a high reliability of all five examined assays. Method comparisons (Passing and Bablok regressions, BlandAltman, and the so-called Mountain plots) have shown, moreover, assay-dependent results for tPSA, fPSA, and %fPSA. With, for example, the Access tPSA values taken as 100 %, the tPSA concentrations have varied from 91 % (AxSYM and ADVIA Centaur) to 113 % (Immulite), causing variations in the number of patients previously classified according to the commonly recommended tPSA cutoffs for performing a biopsy. Different %fPSA values have also led to assay-dependent results of the ROC analysis, which has also pointed to the importance of the diagnostic accuracy. The molar response plots have indicated that among all the examined sera the free and the bound PSA have been measured in an equimolar fashion only by the AxSYM tPSA. The other tPSA assays have shown equimolar characteristics only in certain ranges, namely, Centaur within the so-called grey-zone ranging from 0 to 10 µg/l, and Immulite and Elecsys only among the sera with %fPSA values under 25 %. Whereas on the one hand, this study has demonstrated that the interchangeability of the tPSA, the fPSA, and the %fPSA values obtained by the commercial PSA assays is inadequate, on the other, it has emphasized the fact that the attention to this issue may minimize misinterpretations of the PSA results obtained by different assays. Clinicians should, in this respect, be aware of existing assay-depending differences as well as of biological variations of PSA. A standardization of PSA-measurements has so far, not been reached yet. Assay-dependent reference intervals should, therefore, be established...|$|R
