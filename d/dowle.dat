2500|$|The British {{hard rock}} band Whitesnake has {{released}} twelve studio albums, seven live albums, nine compilation albums, three box sets, two extended plays (EPs), 40 singles, nine video albums and 29 music videos. Formed in Middlesbrough in 1978 by vocalist David Coverdale, the band originally featured guitarists Micky Moody and Bernie Marsden, bassist Neil Murray, keyboardist Peter Solley and drummer Dave <b>Dowle.</b> The group's debut EP Snakebite {{was released in}} June 1978 and reached number 61 on the UK Singles Chart. After replacing Solley with Jon Lord, the band released their debut full-length album Trouble later in the year, which reached number 50 on the UK Albums Chart. 1979's Lovehunter reached number 29 on the chart. Lead single [...] "Long Way from Home" [...] charted at number 55.|$|E

The album was also the band's first to register on the US Billboard 200, reaching number 90. The album's lead single [...] "Fool for Your Loving" [...] reached number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. The group's first live release, Live... in the Heart of the City, reached number 5 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum by the BPI. 1981's Come an' Get It and 1982's Saints & Sinners also both reached the UK top ten, with the former reaching a peak of number 2 (the band's highest to date). Three singles from across the two albums reached the UK Singles Chart top 40.|$|E

50|$|How {{far north}} the Mortimer family's hunting rights {{extended}} is debatable, {{but it may}} have included the whole area in south east Shropshire of which they were overlords {{at the time of}} Domesday Book. While they may have had hunting rights there, much of the woodland in fact belonged to other manors, such as Upper Arley and Kinlet. A large tract of woodland {{on the north side of}} the <b>Dowles</b> Brook was Kingswood, a detached township of the parish of Stottesdon. The town of Bewdley, a Mortimer foundation, may have been cut out of the forest. Far Forest was until recent times part of the borough of Bewdley, though separated from the rest of it by New Parks, which were in Rock parish. Most rights to land in the forest belonged to these medieval manors.|$|R
50|$|The forest covers an area {{in local}} terms of 2,634 {{hectares}} (6,509 acres), or on the larger scale 26.34 km2 and is noted for its variety of wildlife. Although now the Wyre Forest has been much deforested, it still extends from east of the A442 at Shatterford, north of Kidderminster in the east, almost to Cleobury Mortimer {{in the west and}} from Upper Arley in the north to Areley Kings, near Stourport in the south. It {{is one of the largest}} remaining ancient woodlands in Britain. The Forestry Commission looks after around half of today's forest. Around two-thirds of the forest has been designated as an SSSI (1,753.7 Ha), while a further fifth (549 Ha) is listed as a National Nature Reserve. The <b>Dowles</b> Brook flows through the heart of the forest, and the A456 road also runs through the southern edge of the woodland.|$|R

40|$|Riverine {{physical}} {{habitats and}} habitat utilization by fish {{have often been}} studied independently. Varying flows modify habitat composition and connectivity within a stream but its influence on habitat use is not well understood. This study examined brown trout (Salmo trutta) and bullhead (Cottus gobio) utilization of physical habitats that vary with flow in terms of size and type, persistence or duration, and frequency of change from one state to another, by comparing groundwater-dominated sites on the River Tern (Shropshire) with surface runoff-dominated lowland, riffle-pool sites on the <b>Dowles</b> Brook (Worcestershire). Mesohabitat surveys carried out at two-month intervals on a groundwater-dominated stream and on a surface runoff-influenced stream showed differences in habitat composition and diversity between {{the two types of}} rivers. The temporal variability in mesohabitat composition was also shown to differ between the two flow regime types. In the groundwater-influenced stream, mesohabitat composition hardly varied between flows whereas in the flashy stream it varied to a great extent with discharge. Habitat suitability curves for brown trout and bullhead were constructed to predict the potential location of the fish according to flow. The resulting prediction maps were tested in the field during fish surveys using direct underwater observation (snorkelling). Under the groundwater-influenced flow regime brown trout displayed a constant pattern of mesohabitat use over flows. Mesohabitats with non-varying characteristics over flows and with permanent features such as large woody debris, macrophytes or any feature providing shelter and food were favoured. Biological processes, such as hierarchy, life cycle and life stage appeared to {{play a key role in}} determining fish habitat use and to a greater extent than physical processes in these streams. Bullhead observations in the flashy river showed that mesohabitat use varied with flow but that some mesohabitats were always favoured in the stream. Pools and glides were the most commonly used mesohabitat, due to their stability over flows and their role as shelter from harsh hydraulic conditions and as food retention zones. The presence of cobbles was also found to be determinant in bullhead choice of habitat. In this flashy environment, physical processes such as flow and depth and velocity conditions appeared to be a more decisive factor in bullhead strategy of habitat use than biological processes. This research shows that: 1. Though differences in habitat use strategies between the two flow regimes can in part be attributed to differing ecology between the species, flow variability affects fish behaviour. 2. A stable flow regime allows biological processes to be the main driving force in determining fishbehaviour and location. A highly variable environment requires fish to develop behaviour strategies in response to variations in hydraulic conditions, such as depth and velocity, which constitute the key factor in determining fish location...|$|R
50|$|In January 1978 David joined ex-Deep Purple singer David Coverdale {{in his new}} band Whitesnake. Joining David <b>Dowle</b> in {{the band}} was another ex-member of the Streetwalkers, {{keyboard}} player, Brian Johnston, although he would be replaced {{within a couple of}} months by Pete Solley.

By August 1978, another change of keyboard player was announced with Coverdale's old Purple buddy Jon Lord adding his considerable experience to the band. This line-up undertook a major UK tour in October and November 1978 and released an album Trouble in December of that year.
