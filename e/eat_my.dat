500|$|In 2002, Woodall and Constantine won a Royal Television Society Award {{for their}} work on What Not to Wear, in the {{category}} of best factual presenter. The show itself was nominated for the Features Award at the BAFTAS in both 2002 and 2003. The pair have given makeovers to various celebrities in What Not to Wear specials, including Jeremy Clarkson in 2002, who later commented [...] "I'd rather <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> own hair than shop with these two again". After success with viewing figures on BBC Two, the show was promoted to the more mainstream BBC One in 2004. The show has also been broadcast internationally in over 20 countries.|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} co-hosting What Not to Wear for five series, she and Woodall gained {{recognition}} {{for their work}} on the show, winning a Royal Television Society Award in 2002 for being the best factual presenters. In 2002, Constantine advised Jeremy Clarkson on a celebrity version of What Not to Wear. After Clarkson appeared on the show, Nasir Khan stated [...] "I'd rather <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> own hair than shop with these two [...] again". Adding to its success, the show was nominated for the Features Award at the BAFTAS in both 2002 and 2003. On the show Big Impression, impressionist Ronni Ancona took to spoofing Constantine's presenting techniques on What Not to Wear, {{just one of the}} shows on which Constantine's character has been spoofed.|$|E
500|$|The second aria, [...] "" [...] (I <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> {{little bit}} of bread with joy and heartily leave to my {{neighbor}} his own.), is dancing and accompanied by two obbligato parts, oboe and violin. They express in vivid figuration in the violin and a slightly simplified version in the oboe the text [...] "" [...] (a happy spirit, a thankful heart, that gives praise). Hofmann observes that the aria depicts a [...] "pastoral idyll with a rustic musical scene – {{a tribute to the}} Enlightenment utopia of simple, happy country life." [...] The violin's figuration suggests the drone of bagpipes or hurdy-gurdy. The voice leaps in upward sixths, in [...] "folk-like character" [...] and conveying [...] "contented tranquillity". Mincham notes that the first four notes of the oboe ritornello are the first four notes of the closing chorale turned to major.|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of TGS with Tracy Jordan gather to watch the season finale of Jack's summer reality show hit MILF Island, a series the plot of which is {{described}} as [...] "25 Super-Hot Moms, 50 eighth grade boys, no rules." [...] The staff soon discover {{that one of them}} told a reporter for The New York Post that Jack was a [...] "Class A Moron" [...] and that [...] "He can <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> poo." [...] They then spiral into an argument as they try to find out who made the statement. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) later recalls that he heard Liz, in an elevator, making the statement to the journalist. Liz makes a false promise that she will tell Jack that it was her to avoid him hearing the truth from Kenneth. Liz finally reveals the truth to Jack only to find out that he already knew it was she who said it, and he's not going to fire her—instead, she has to put together a new TV series for MILF Islands manipulative competitor Deborah.|$|E
500|$|Boam and Cuse did {{not intend}} for the series to be {{historically}} accurate. Their aim was to create an action-adventure with a modern feel. Cuse told USA Today, [...] "We're not approaching this show {{as if we were}} doing a period piece. We see it as a contemporary program. Our characters just happen to be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities. The Indiana Jones movies were period pieces too, but you never thought of them that way." [...] Anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series. The show was intended to be family friendly, so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations. Boam said, [...] "In the two-hour pilot Brisco doesn't even once have to shoot his gun. Our violence is cartoonish. There is no pain and suffering." [...] Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements, billboards, and even a trailer shown in movie theaters. When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993, Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell [...] "isn't the next big television star, I'll <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> desk".|$|E
500|$|Merton Council {{had been}} recommending that Wimbledon {{move to a}} site in nearby Beddington, but this {{proposal}} fell through soon after the move to Selhurst Park. With the inflation in costs {{brought on by the}} foundation of the FA Premier League in 1992, the club soon began to lose money heavily. Rumours that the groundshare would eventually result in the Dons and the Eagles merging led Hammam to say [...] "I’d rather die and have vultures <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> insides than merge with Crystal Palace". In 1992 the Greyhound Racing Association offered to redevelop Wimbledon Stadium (less than a mile from Plough Lane) into a 15,000-seater dog racing and football ground. Hammam was outraged two years later when the council, attempting to retain the Plough Lane site for public use, refused to sanction its sale for a supermarket redevelopment that Hammam said would finance a new ground at the dog racing site. Hammam angrily declared he would look elsewhere, and threatened to change the club's name and remove the double-headed eagle device, a symbol of Wimbledon Borough, from the team's badge. [...] "We have been betrayed," [...] he told the press. [...] "The council say they want us back, {{but when it comes to}} taking action they don't want to know." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{staff of}} The Line of Best Fit ranked [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] at number 6 {{on their list}} of the 50 Best Tracks of 2013 and wrote that it was [...] "easily {{one of the most}} vital pop songs of the year". Rolling Stone ranked the {{recording}} at number 23 on their list of the 50 Best songs of 2014 and compared the song's production to that of Lorde's music and the lyrics to those of Kesha's songs. Chris Jordan of Asbury Park Press deemed it {{as one of the best}} singles of that year and stated that [...] "it was refreshing to hear the debauchery depicted" [...] in the song. Echoing this thought, Chris DeVille of Stereogum ranked the track at number 26 on his list of Top 50 Pop Songs of 2014 and confessed that: [...] "For a song that derives much of its appeal from being out-of-control and over-the-top, 'Habits' is a work of extreme poise and precision from a pop songwriter with a blindingly bright future." [...] Entertainment Weekly 's Miles Raymer selected the line [...] "I <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> dinner in my bathtub / Then I go to sex clubs / Watching freaky people gettin' it on" [...] on his list of the best lyrics of 2014 and wrote that it was [...] "one of the most interesting images to come out of a pop singer's mouth this year".|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 {{during the}} show's second series, Jeremy Clarkson and Lesley Joseph {{appeared}} in a special episode, where Constantine and Woodall gave them a fashion makeover. After Clarkson appeared on the show, he commented [...] "I'd rather <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> own hair than shop with these two again". During the process of choosing which celebrity to give a makeover, Constantine and Woodall {{compiled a list of}} who they thought were the worst dressed celebrities. Also in 2002, Constantine and Woodall won a Royal Television Society Award, for being the best factual presenters. The show was also nominated for the Features Award at the BAFTAS in both 2002 and 2003 but was beaten both times.|$|E
2500|$|Both Johnny Marr and Morrissey have {{repeatedly}} {{said that they}} will not reunite the band. In 2006, Morrissey declared, [...] "I would rather <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> own testicles than reform the Smiths, and that's saying something for a vegetarian." [...] When asked why in another interview the same year, he responded, [...] "I feel as if I've worked very hard since the demise of the Smiths and the others haven't, so why hand them attention that they haven't earned? We are not friends, we don't see each other. Why on earth would we be on a stage together?" [...] In a February 2009 interview on BBC Radio 2, he said, [...] "People always ask me about reunions and I can't imagine why... the past seems like a distant place, and I'm pleased with that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "I'll Do It" [...] was {{described}} as Montag getting [...] "racy" [...] due to the song's sexually explicit lyrics stating to [...] "come <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> panties off of me." [...] Montag addressed the issue by stating [...] "I love it. I'm a very sexual person and I'm married, so it's okay. I think every woman ... has an alter ego. We all have that really sexual, fun side. I just thought the lyrics were so fun and so sexy. They empower women. That song, when my friends hear it, they feel sexier. They have more fun, because the song is like, 'I'll do whatever you want, but I'm still kind of in charge here.' The lyrics are definitely a little edgy - and I'm sorry to the little girls - but I am married. Eat the panties off when you're married." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book {{sold more}} than one million copies in the first month {{following}} publication; its sales during its first week of availability set a record for a non-fiction book. [...] The success of the book surprised many in the publishing industry, who thought Simon & Schuster had overpaid for the work. It also surprised pundits who had doubted her selling power, including CNN's Tucker Carlson, who had said, [...] "If they sell a million copies of this book, I'll <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> shoes and my tie. I will." [...] (Once past the million mark, Clinton appeared on Carlson's show to present him with a shoe-shaped chocolate cake.) [...] Clinton's energetic promotion of the book, which included signing an estimated 20,000 copies (causing her to require ice and wrist support treatments), was credited for part of the success. [...] By 2007, she had earned over $10 million from the book.|$|E

The following year, at age 15, he heard health food pioneer Paul Bragg give a talk on health and nutrition, focusing on the [...] "evils of meat and sugar". Bragg's message had a powerful influence on LaLanne, who then changed his life and started focusing on his diet and exercise. In his own words, he was [...] "born again", and besides his new focus on nutrition, he began working out daily (although earlier, while serving during World War II as a Pharmacist Mate First Class at the Sun Valley Naval Convalescent Hospital, LaLanne stated that he started in bodybuilding at [...] "age 13"). Describing his change of diet, LaLanne stated, [...] "I had to take my lunch alone to the football field to eat so no one would see me <b>eat</b> <b>my</b> raw veggies, whole bread, raisins and nuts.
