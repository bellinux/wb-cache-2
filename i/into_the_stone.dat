5|$|Property {{changes since}} the {{original}} construction include the front terrace, entranceway and landscaping. The former front lawn and flower beds were paved over, {{and a new}} driveway was cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> wall north of the original large stone arch over the first driveway.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the ruins}} of Castell y Bere still stand on a rocky outcrop, with {{protective}} ditches cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> on {{the south and east}} sides. The entrance to the castle lies on the west side, where the barbican, probably built by Edward I, contains two gatetowers, overlooking the stone steps approaching the inner gate. Through the barbican is the castle courtyard, containing a large well and the remains of several internal buildings of uncertain date.|$|E
5|$|Childe {{has been}} {{considered}} the principal contributor to archaeological methodology {{in the first part}} of the 20th century. His theoretical approach blended together Marxism, diffusionism, and functionalism. Childe was critical of the evolutionary archaeology which was dominant during the 19thcentury. He believed that those archaeologists who adhered to it placed a greater emphasis on artefacts themselves rather than their makers. He recognised flaws in the technological-based three-age system first developed by Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, rejecting its evolutionary chronology that divided prehistory <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stone</b> Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age by noting that many of the world's societies were still effectively Stone Age in their technology. He nevertheless saw it as a useful model for analysing socio-economic development when combined with a Marxist model. He therefore used technological criteria for dividing up prehistory into three ages, but instead used economic criteria for sub-dividing the Stone Age into the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, rejecting the concept of the Mesolithic as useless.|$|E
50|$|A common trait is megalithic art carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> of <b>the</b> chambers' {{walls and}} roofs. Abstract designs were favoured, {{especially}} spirals and zig-zags.|$|R
50|$|This {{interpretation}} {{is related to}} the fact that <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> make whistling sounds on a windy day, presumably because of multiple reach-through holes bored under different angles <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> in prehistoric times.|$|R
50|$|Over the centuries, {{the rope}} {{of the church}} bell has worn a deep crevice <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> of <b>the</b> church wall beneath the bell tower.|$|R
5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E
5|$|Items include granite pavers {{that have}} {{memories}} of past Hillsboro citizens carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> and photographs etched onto glass. Photographs range from pioneer times {{to life in}} the 1990s. There are also letters etched in glass from people such as Albert E. Tozier, Robert Summer, Chavela Mendoza, Lester C. Mooberry, Mary Ramsey Wood, George Iwasaki, and Howard Vollum. Gunfights, hangings, funerals, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the Great Depression, and an outbreak of diphtheria in the 1890s are among the events represented. More recent photographs show the defunct Oregon Electric Railway, which the westside line often uses the old right-of-way of the former line, and employees at Intel dressed in cleanroom suits.|$|E
5|$|The front {{entrance}} of the 1931 office building, on {{the southeast corner of}} the block, faced south on John Street towards Downtown Seattle and had the newspaper's name etched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> above the main entrance; the sign was supplemented for several decades by an ornate golden sign with the newspaper's letterhead that was installed above the main entrance. The exterior of the office building had subtle details, including etched columns and aluminum grillwork on the windows, forgoing ornaments for a simpler design that emphasized its mass. The main entrance was behind an elaborate aluminum gate, decorated with octagons, spirals and floral patterns. At the sides of the entrance were limestone panels with floral patterns carved into relief.|$|E
6000|$|Luke was right, as a brief {{examination}} proved. Then the boy {{turned to}} the window, an affair less than a foot square, having over it several iron bars set firmly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones.</b> [...] "No thoroughfare there," [...] was his comment.|$|R

5000|$|Like most karst areas, Cedars of Lebanon State Forest is drained {{in large}} part by {{underground}} streams. The water in the forest probably ends up in nearby streams, such as Hurricane Creek. [...] These streams empty <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stones</b> River's J. Percy Priest Lake impoundment, which is located just a few miles to the west.|$|R
5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E

25|$|Meadow Run Waterslides have unique {{geologic}} formations for exploration. There are ripples and potholes {{that have}} been carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> by {{years and years of}} powerful currents and spinning rocks. Visitors to the park are permitted to ride these natural waterslides.|$|E
50|$|In both {{construction}} and in size—it is a circular site measuring 75 m in diameter—this tomb differs from most European burials from the Bronze Age. Most importantly, the cists are adorned with petroglyphs. <b>The</b> images carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> depict people, animals (including birds and fish), ships, lurs being played, symbols, and a chariot drawn by two horses and having four-spoked wheels.|$|R
50|$|The earlier rituals were {{augmented}} by the Stonehenge Free Festival, loosely organised by the Politantric Circle, held between 1972 and 1984, {{during which time}} the number of midsummer visitors had risen to around 30,000. However, in 1985 the site was closed to festivalgoers by English Heritage and the National Trust. A consequence {{of the end of}} the festival in 1985 was the violent confrontation between the police and New Age travellers that became known as the Battle of the Beanfield when police blockaded a convoy of travellers to prevent them from approaching Stonehenge. Beginning in 1985, the year of the Battle of the Beanfield, no access was allowed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> at Stonehenge for any religious reason. This 'exclusion zone' policy continued for almost fifteen years and until just before the arrival of the twenty-first century, visitors were not allowed to go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> at times of religious significance: the two Solstices (Winter and Summer) and two Equinoxes (Vernal and Autumnal).|$|R
50|$|Passage tombs of the cairn type {{often have}} {{elaborate}} corbelled roofs rather than simple slabs. Megalithic art {{has been identified}} carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones</b> at some sites. The passage itself, {{in a number of}} notable instances, is aligned {{in such a way that}} <b>the</b> sun shines <b>into</b> <b>the</b> passage at a significant point in the year, for example at sunrise on the winter solstice or at sunset on the equinox.|$|R
25|$|The fourth clarity factor {{which is}} {{assessed}} is a characteristic's nature. The characteristic's nature determines {{whether it is}} internal (extending <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone)</b> or external (limited {{to the surface of}} the stone). Internal characteristics automatically exclude the diamond from the Flawless, and Internally Flawless categories. External characteristics exclude the diamond from the Flawless category.|$|E
25|$|Carved high in Mount Behistun of Kermanshah, one {{can find}} the Behistun inscription, a text etched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> of the {{mountain}} describing {{the manner in which}} Darius became the king of Persia, after the previous ruler (Cambyses II), and how he overthrew the magus usurper of the throne. In this inscription Darius also details his satraps and delineates his position as the king and emperor of the Persian empire.|$|E
25|$|The carvings {{and designs}} were most usually {{completed}} before the stone was erected, though some stones {{show signs of}} being carved in place. The designs were pecked or ground <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> surface. Deep-grooved cuts and right-angle surfaces indicate the presence of metal tools. Stone tools were used to smooth the harsh cuts of some designs. Nearly all the stones were hand carved, but some unusual stones show signs {{that they could have}} been cut with a primitive type of mechanical drill.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, Roark {{is unable}} to find a client willing to build {{according}} to his vision. He walks away from opportunities that involve any compromise of his standards. Broke, he takes a job as a laborer in a quarry. The quarry belongs to Francon's father and is near their summer home. The vacationing Francon visits the quarry on a whim.

25|$|There was a rearguard {{action to}} the north of Penrith. The Manchester Regiment was left behind to defend Carlisle and after a siege by Cumberland had to surrender, to face hanging or transportation. Many died in Carlisle Castle, where they were imprisoned in brutal {{conditions}} along with Scots prisoners whom Morier allegedly painted to depict the kilted clansmen in battle. Many of the cells there still show hollows licked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> walls, as prisoners had only the damp and moss on these stones to sustain themselves.|$|E
25|$|Seals {{are usually}} carved by {{specialist}} seal carvers, {{or by the}} users themselves. Specialist carvers will carve the user's name <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> {{in one of the}} standard scripts and styles described above, usually for a fee. On the other hand, some people take to carving their own seals using soapstone and fine knives, which are widely available and is cheaper than paying a professional for expertise, craft and material. Results vary, but it is possible for individuals to carve perfectly legitimate seals for themselves.|$|E

Later, obsessed by the mysterious stone, Pippin took it out of Gandalf's hands while the wizard slept, putting a rock in its place. Looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone,</b> he had a terrifying {{encounter}} with Sauron himself. In fact, Pippin is the only character in the book who is shown to speak directly to Sauron. To keep Pippin safe from Sauron's forces, Gandalf {{brought him to the}} city of Minas Tirith, separating him from his friends.|$|E
25|$|Digby died of {{fever and}} {{dysentery}} in Damascus on 11 August 1881, and {{was buried in}} the Protestant Cemetery. She was buried with her horse in attendance at the funeral. Upon her footstone – a block of pink limestone from Palmyra – is her name, written in Arabic by Medjuel in charcoal and carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> by a local mason. After her death her house was rented and the family of the young H. R. P. Dickson were among its tenants. A small part of the house still survives today, still in the ownership of the same family who purchased it from Abdul Medjuel's son in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two different types}} of relief. There are carvings of a hand with a back plate that are very closely related technically and formally with complete sculptures. In addition, there are also flat reliefs, in which the figures are only a few centimeters carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stone.</b> These reliefs are continuing Assyrian and Persian, or pre-Hellenistic, traditions and are visually similar to paintings. Here, as in the painting, there are narrative representations. The figures are mostly frontally facing the viewer. Especially in southwest present-day Iran, in ancient Elymais, many rock reliefs were carved in open air sites in this style. Their execution is mostly rather coarse.|$|E

40|$|Background : Ectopic {{migration}} of IUD into bladder and urethra with subsequent formation of ston {{on it is}} among the rare complications of IUD. Two women, 38 and 45 years old with recurrent bladder stone due to their IUDs inserted 5 - 6 years before were admitted with urinary irritation symptoms. In primary cystoscopy, no trace was found of either IUDs or their penetration <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stones.</b> <b>The</b> <b>stones</b> were broken by electrohydraulic, however with further observation in the subsequent admissions and a thorough investigation, it was realized that the IUD prong had penetrated about 0. 5 cm into bladder and formed <b>stones.</b> Since <b>the</b> IUDs could not be removed by cystoscope, {{in order to prevent}} the next recurrence and formation of cystovaginal fistula, <b>the</b> IUDs and <b>stones</b> were removed by cystostomy.
