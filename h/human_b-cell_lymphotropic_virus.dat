40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} several techniques currently available (commercial kits and in-house assays) for diagnosing human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>viruses</b> types 1 and 2 in {{two groups of}} patients enrolled at HIV/AIDS specialized care services in São Paulo: Group 1 (G 1), n =  1608, 1237 male/ 371 female, median age 44. 3 years old, majority using {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART); G 2, n =  1383, 930 male/ 453 female, median age of 35. 6 years old, majority HAART naïve. Enzyme immunoassays [(EIA) Murex and Gold ELISA] were employed for human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>viruses</b> types 1 and 2 screening; Western blotting (WB), INNO-LIA (LIA), real-time PCR pol (qPCR), and nested-PCR-RFLP (tax) were used to confirm infection. Samples were considered human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>viruses</b> types 1 and 2 positive when there was reactivity using {{at least one of the}} four confirmatory assays. By serological screening, 127 / 2991 samples were positive or borderline, and human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> infection was confirmed in 108 samples (three EIA-borderline) : 56 human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 [G 1 (27)  + G 2 (29) ]; 45 human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 2 [G 1 (21)  + G 2 (24) ]; one human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1  + human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 2 (G 2); six human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> [G 1 (2)  + G 2 (4) ]. Although there were differences in group characteristics, human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>viruses</b> types 1 and 2 prevalence was similar [3. 1 % (G 1) and 4. 2 % (G 2), p =  0. 113]. The overall sensitivities of LIA, WB, qPCR, and PCR-RFLP were 97. 2 %, 82. 4 %, 68. 9 %, and 68. 4 %, respectively, with some differences among groups, likely due to the stage of human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> infection and/or HAART duration. Indeterminate immunoblotting results were detected in G 2, possibly due to the seroconversion period. Negative results in molecular assays could be explained by the use of HAART, the occurrence of defective provirus and/or the low circulating proviral load. In conclusion, when determining the human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> infection, the findings highlight that there is a need to consider the blood samples with borderline results in screening assays. Of all the tested assays, LIA was the assay of choice for detecting human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 and human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 2 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 -infected patients...|$|R

Cardiopulmonary bypass transiently alters {{lymphocyte}} subsets, {{resulting in a}} reduction in CD 4 + T cells {{and an increase in}} CD 8 + T cells. We proposed that cardiovascular operations and human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I infection may act synergistically, resulting in serious damage to cell-mediated immunity. Methods: A total of 517 consecutive patients who were preoperatively screened for anti-human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I antibody and underwent cardiovascular operations with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled in this study. Of the 517 patients, 82 (16 %) had positive test results for anti-human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I antibody. The surgical outcome of patients with positive and negative results for anti-human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I antibody was analyzed retrospectively. Results: There was no difference between the 2 groups with respect to early mortality. Distribution of survival curve was also not significantly different (P =. 5; mean follow-up duration, 2. 4 ± 1. 8 years [range, 0 - 9. 4 years] and 3. 2 ± 2. 8 years [range, 0 - 9. 8 years]) in the groups with positive and negative antibody results, respectively). In particular, long-term follow-up did not reveal adult T-cell leukemia or human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I–associated myelopathy, and occurrence of neoplasm did not differ between groups. Early infectious complication was, however, significantly higher in the group with positive antibody results than in the group with negative results (P =. 02). Logistic regression analysis revealed human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I infection as a significant risk for this complication (P =. 04; odds ratio, 2. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 5. 8). Conclusion: A combination of human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type I infection and cardiovascular operation is believed to increase the potential risk of infectious complications shortly after the operation. However, this synergistic effect seems to be transient and has little influence on long-term prognosis. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2000; 120 : 699 - 706...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the pain in}} patients infected with human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1, clinically and epidemiologically. Methods: This systematic review was based on The PRISMA Statement. Four reviewers searched PUBMED, SciELO, LILACS and BIREME for data from observational studies and clinical trials (n ≥  30) regarding pain prevalence, characteristics, and associated factors in patients with human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1. No limits on publication date or language were established. Studies {{that did not have}} pain as an outcome measure or not involving human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 infected patients were excluded. Results: A total of 3013 articles (including duplicates) were found of which seven met the predetermined criteria. The most common pain region was the lower back (53. 0 %). Non-neuropathic type (ranging from 52. 6 % to 86. 8 %) was more frequent in human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 -associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis participants, and neuropathic pain was more common in human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 carriers (53. 1 %). The pain was mostly reported as moderate or severe. One study showed that chronic pain was negatively associated with quality of life. Discussion: Pain is a common complaint in human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 infected patients, with lower back pain as the most frequent site. Pain can either be nociceptive, neuropathic, or both, is frequently severe, and negatively affects quality of life.

To assess {{the implications of the}} virus for healthcare systems it is essential to know its past and present prevalence. The widely cited estimate that 10 - 20 million people are infected with human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 worldwide was calculated from data that are now 25 years old. This estimate may therefore no longer reflect the global epidemiology. The objective {{of this study was to}} collate published data that are truly representative of the general population through a systematic review of the literature. Fifty-nine relevant studies were identified and the 17 that met the inclusion criteria were all cross-sectional designs; none reported incidence. The prevalence of human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 1 was highest in the two studies of Japanese islands (36. 4 %; 95 % CI: 29. 9 - 42. 8) and lowest in studies from Mongolia, Malaysia and India.

Detailed analysis of the coding potential, however, revealed that MarB 43 is probably forced to use the human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type 2 /STLV- 2 env-tax-rex splice-acceptor homologue and that the proximal pX auxiliary proteins p 12 (I), p 13 (II), p 30 (II) and p 27 (I) seem to have lost their function.

Efficient infection and spread in humans differs between simian foamy <b>virus,</b> simian <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus,</b> and simian immunodeficiency virus, but seems also to differ among the different viruses from the same simian lineage, {{as illustrated by the}} different spread of HIV- 1 M, N O, P or for the different HIV- 2 groups. Among the four HIV- 1 groups, only HIV- 1 group M has spread worldwide, and the actual diversity within HIV- 1 M (subtypes, circulating recombinants) is the result of subsequent evolution and spread in the human population. HIV- 2 only spread to some extent in West Africa, and similarly as for HIV- 1, the nine HIV- 2 groups have also a different epidemic history. Four types of human T <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus,</b> type 1 to 4, have been described in humans and for three of them simian counterparts (simian T lymphotropic virus- 1, - 2,- 3) have been identified in multiple nonhuman primate species.

Culturing HTLV-II–infected PBMC that spontaneously proliferate (SLP/) re-sulted in greater mRNA expression {{and production of}} interferon-g, interleukin (IL) - 4, and IL- 5, with a concomitant decrease in IL- 10, than was seen with nonproliferating (SLP 0) and normal PBMC. While IL- 2 mRNA expression was higher, production was lower in SLP / PBMC than in SLP 0 and normal PBMC, implying that the proliferating cells are utilizing IL- 2. Neutralization of IL- 2 resulted in partial inhibition, suggesting that other cytokines also affect SLP. Addition of recombinant IL- 10 inhibited the proliferation of SLP / PBMC. Further, blocking costimulatory signals with monoclonal antibodies against CD 80 /CD 86 resulted in increased IL- 10 production with concomitant inhibition of SLP. The mechanism(s) underlying HTLV-II–associated SLP in vitro involve increased utilization of IL- 2 and down-regulation of IL- 10.

40|$|Expansion of {{pancreatic}} b-cells {{is a key}} goal {{of diabetes}} re-search, yet induction of adult <b>human</b> <b>b-cell</b> replication has proven frustratingly difficult. In part, this reflects {{a lack of understanding}} of cell cycle control in the <b>human</b> <b>b-cell.</b> Here, we provide a com-prehensive immunocytochemical “atlas ” of G 1 /S control mole-cules in the <b>human</b> <b>b-cell.</b> This atlas reveals that the majority of these molecules, previously known to be present in islets, are actually present in the b-cell. More importantly, and in contrast to anticipated results, the <b>human</b> <b>b-cell</b> G 1 /S atlas reveals that almost all of the critical G 1 /S cell cycle control molecules are located in the cytoplasm of the quiescent <b>human</b> <b>b-cell.</b> Indeed, the only nuclear G 1 /S molecules are the cell cycle inhibitors, pRb, p 57, and variably, p 21 : none of the cyclins or cdks necessary to drive <b>human</b> <b>b-cell</b> proliferation are present in the nuclear com-partment.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> I (HTLV-I) {{infection}} {{is linked to}} the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). HTLV-I infection of healthy CD 4 + T cells is known to take place through cell-to-cell contact with infected T cells. We consider a compartmental model for the transmission dynamics of the HTLV-I infection. The force of {{infection is}} assumed to be of a general form, and the result-ing incidence term contains, as special cases, the bilinear and the standard incidences. Our mathematical analysis establishes that the global dynamics of T-cell infection are completely de-termined by a basic reproduction number R 0. If R 0 1, in-fected T cells always die out. If R 0 > 1, HTLV-I infection becomes chronic, and a unique endemic equilibrium is globally stable in the interior of the feasible region. 1 Introduction.

Compared with HTLV-I seronega-tives, haplotypes of IL 6 (660 G/ 635 C/ 236 G) and IL 10 (6653 C/ 1116 G) {{were significantly associated with}} HTLV-I infection in children independent of maternal provirus load and duration of breast-feeding (odds ratio [OR], 4. 5 [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 1. 2 – 17. 6], and OR, 3. 5 [95 % CI, 1. 4 – 9. 0], respectively). Our findings are the first, to our knowledge, to suggest that host variation in both proinflam-matory and anti-inflammatory genes could influence sus-ceptibility to HTLV-I infection.

40|$|Recombinant retroviruses {{containing}} the trans activator genes of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) type II and human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type III were constructed. The trans activator genes tat II and tat III were {{inserted into the}} murine retroviral vector pZIPNEOSV(X) 1. Recombinant plasmids were transfected into the psi 2 and psi AM packaging cell lines that produce murine leukemia virions containing no retroviral RNA. Functional tat II and tat III gene products were expressed as demonstrated by trans activation of HTLV type I and II and human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> type III long terminal repeat-directed gene expression in the respective infected cells.
