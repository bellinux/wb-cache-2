The high efficacy and potential rapid adoption of <b>Bt</b> <b>corn</b> has raised concerns that the ECB will develop resistance to Bt. The Environmental Protection Agency has responded to these concerns by requiring farmers to plant refuge corn. Current refuge requirements are based on models that do not consider the value of dynamically varying refuge in response to increased scarcity and diminished control over time or the importance of backstop technologies currently being developed. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate dynamically optimal refuge requirements with the arrival of alternative backstop technologies and to compare the results to an optimal static refuge policy. The results show that a dynamically optimal refuge requirement only provides modest benefits above a static optimum. The results also show how the type of backstop technology and characteristics of ECB population dynamics affect the optimal refuge requirement. ...|$|R

Our analytical approach involved both deterministic and semi-stochastic modeling for dietary comparative analyses of FB 1 exposures originating from <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> Bacillus thuringiensis (<b>Bt)</b> -corn, conventional non-Bt corn and distiller’s dried grains with solubles (DDGS) derived from <b>Bt</b> and/or non-Bt <b>corn.</b> Results from both deterministic and semi-stochastic demonstrated a distinct difference of FB 1 toxicity in feed between <b>Bt</b> <b>corn</b> and non-Bt corn.

Deterministic results closely mirrored but tended to slightly under predict the mean result for the semi-stochastic analysis.

Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that is toxic to certain species of insects. While agricultural biotechnology and more specifically Bt crops have been extensively evaluated in a scientific setting, they have rarely been evaluated in the purchasing environment where consumers and primary producers actually make buying decisions. Canadian surveys have found that most Canadians have heard of biotechnology and many of its applications (Angus Reid Group Inc., 1995).

40|$|As the world’s most {{abundant}} and widespread pollinator, honey bees (Apis mellifera) {{play a critical}} role in our food security and make an important contribution to the human economy. Because of their global importance to agriculture, there has been a great deal of consternation surrounding the widespread recent decline of honey bee populations 1. Amid the sometimes wild speculation about what might be causing these declines, it has been suggested in several popular media outlets that pollen from <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>Bt</b> crops might be poisoning honey bees 2, 3. It should be emphasized, however, that there are not any scientific publications indicating that Bt crops have anything to do with honey bee declines. All studies performed to date support the contention that Bt toxins, called Cry proteins, are in fact toxic to only a narrow range of insect groups. For example, the Bt transgenes that have so far been incorporated into crops such as corn and canola are toxic to Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) or Coleoptera (beetles). Although there is the possibility that these Cry proteins are toxic to certain taxa, such as caddisflies (Trichoptera), that are closely related to the target group 4, hymenopterans (bees, wasps, and ants) are not closely related to beetles or butterflies and moths, and in the laboratory no toxicity test has ever shown Cry proteins to cause any harm to hymenopterans. Nonetheless scare stories about Bt crops and bees keep circulating. The question is whether, given the absence of evidence implicating Bt crops in honey bee declines, is there anything more that can be done to eliminate this worry once and for all? In order to fully lay to rest the worry about Bt pollen and honey bee declines, there is indeed an additiona...|$|R
