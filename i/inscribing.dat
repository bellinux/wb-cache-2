5|$|A normal tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{for which}} every tile is topologically {{equivalent to a}} disk, the intersection of any two tiles is a single connected set or the empty set, and all tiles are uniformly bounded. This means that a single circumscribing radius and a single <b>inscribing</b> radius {{can be used for}} all the tiles in the whole tiling; the condition disallows tiles that are pathologically long or thin.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a covering (so called to {{distinguish it from}} a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling {{can be obtained by}} <b>inscribing</b> a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.|$|E
5|$|Other {{peculiar}} calendars include ancient Greek calendars. These were nominally lunar, {{starting with}} the New Moon. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens <b>inscribing</b> dates by both the civic calendar and ton theoi, by the moon. The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as games or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism {{may have been used}} as a politically neutral form of timekeeping. Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Karol Wojtyła, {{archbishop}} of Kraków, was elevated to the papacy as Pope John PaulII — the first Slavic pope ever, {{and the first}} non-Italian pope in 455 years. Also that year, UNESCO approved the first ever sites for its new World Heritage List, including the entire Old Town in <b>inscribing</b> Kraków's Historic Centre Kraków is classified as a global city with the ranking of high sufficiency by GaWC.

Kraków is home to Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest universities in the world and traditionally Poland's most reputable institution of higher learning.|$|E
5|$|The Mourning Parents, {{one male}} and one female figure, are {{reclining}} {{on either side}} of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by <b>inscribing</b> the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.|$|E
5|$|Allward chose a {{relatively}} new construction method for the monument: limestone bonded to a cast concrete frame. A foundation bed of 11,000 tonnes of concrete, reinforced with hundreds of tonnes of steel, served as the support bed for the memorial. The memorial base and twin pylons contained almost 6,000 tonnes of Seget limestone. Sculptors carved the 20 approximately double life-sized human figures on site from large blocks of stone. The carvers used half-size plaster models produced by Allward in his studio, now {{on display at the}} Canadian War Museum, and an instrument called a pantograph to reproduce the figures at the proper scale. The carvers conducted their work year-round inside temporary studios built around each figure. The inclusion of the names of those killed in France with no known grave {{was not part of the}} original design, and Allward was unhappy when the government asked him to include them. Allward argued that the inclusion of names was not part of the original commissioning. Through a letter to Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission in October 1927, Allward indicated his intention to relegate the names of the missing to pavement stones around the monument. The collective dismay and uproar of the commission forced Allward to relent and incorporate the names of the missing on the memorial walls. The task of <b>inscribing</b> the names did not begin until the early 1930s and employed a typeface that Allward designed for the monument.|$|E
5000|$|In geometry, an <b>inscribed</b> planar {{shape or}} solid {{is one that}} is {{enclosed}} by and [...] "fits snugly" [...] inside another geometric shape or solid. To say that [...] "figure F is <b>inscribed</b> in figure G" [...] means precisely the same thing as [...] "figure G is circumscribed about figure F". A circle or ellipse <b>inscribed</b> in a convex polygon (or a sphere or ellipsoid <b>inscribed</b> in a convex polyhedron) is tangent to every side or face of the outer figure (but see <b>Inscribed</b> sphere for semantic variants). A polygon <b>inscribed</b> in a circle, ellipse, or polygon (or a polyhedron <b>inscribed</b> in a sphere, ellipsoid, or polyhedron) has each vertex on the outer figure; if the outer figure is a polygon or polyhedron, there must be a vertex of the <b>inscribed</b> polygon or polyhedron {{on each side of the}} outer figure. An <b>inscribed</b> figure is not necessarily unique in orientation; this can easily be seen, for example, when the given outer figure is a circle, in which case a rotation of an <b>inscribed</b> figure gives another <b>inscribed</b> figure that is congruent to the original one.|$|R
