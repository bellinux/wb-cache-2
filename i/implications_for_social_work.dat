5000|$|Upon {{defining}} and describing marginalization {{as well as}} the various levels in which it exists, one must now explore its <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> practice. Mullaly (2007) describes how [...] "the personal is political" [...] and the need for recognizing that social problems are indeed connected with larger structures in society, causing various forms of oppression amongst individuals resulting in marginalization (p. 262). It is also important for the social worker to recognize the intersecting nature of oppression. A non-judgmental and unbiased attitude is necessary {{on the part of the}} social worker. The worker must begin to understand oppression and marginalization as a systemic problem, not the fault of the individual (Mullaly, 2007).|$|E
50|$|The praxis {{intervention}} method {{could be}} extended to the professional social work practice in facilitating the social workers themselves and their clients overcoming personal or social mindsets that induce suffering or marginality. The praxis mode of social work depends on the sensibility that could be provoked in a given context: sensible towards one’s own biography, historical locatedness, spatial positioning and the interaction setting. The praxis intervention practice has its <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> education. A social work education based on praxis model could shape the students and teachers self-reflexive, sensible. Through this method, {{it may be possible}} for students gaining theoretical and practical skills. The method can be used in other branches of education and training like the management education, medical education, agriculture extension and other fields where the clientele really matter. However, the praxis model would be yielding better results if sufficient flexibility is maintained. It could be a model for providing companionship to people in need of self-exploration. Praxis intervention as a practice can be carried on to the extent it is possible for people {{to take care of themselves}} and to the extent people require professional companionship of the social work practice. Praxis intervention practice requires the professionals and the client participants to be self-reflexive and self-critical. The model provides opportunity for the social worker to undertake a reflexive inward journey to get rid of biases that affect her practice. The context that is not suitable for self-reflexivity or self-criticism is not suitable for praxis intervention practice either.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>work</b> {{is often}} seen as a {{straightforward}} response to self-evident human needs and problems or as the outcome of 'professional projects' pursued by social workers.

40|$|The study {{examined}} data about 8, 438 children placed in out-of-home care by Child Protection Services {{in a region}} in the Northern Italy, during the time span of 2008 - 2012, to understand whether out-of-home placements have led to an effective improvement in their conditions. Starting from literature analysis and available data, a range of outcome and process typologies was developed in order to analyse data. In particular, five outcome types (in family, stable; out of family, stable; adopted; on-going placement; unknown) and six process types (evolving; regressive; oscillating; static out-of-home; uncertain at home; undetectable) were detected. Each types was divided into sub-types. Than each child was given a tags attuned to an outcome and a process type. Descriptive analysis about outcomes and processes was carried out.

40|$|The ‘Global Mental Health’ (GMH) movement, an {{influential}} driver of transnational knowledge transfer {{in the field}} of mental health, advocates evidence-based strategies to ‘scale up’ services in low- and middle-income countries. As with debates on global and local frameworks <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>work,</b> there are concerns about marginalisation of knowledge that does not neatly fit the GMH discourse. This article analyses the professional and disciplinary structures that shape knowledge transfer in GMH and the <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>work's</b> engagement with the movement. Analysis of key documents and secondary literature identifies three key issues for GMH: its potentially negative impact on ‘local’ knowledge production; the challenges of accounting for culture and context; and the selective forms of evidence that are ‘allowed’ to contribute to GMH. Finding ways to encompass more ‘situated’ perspectives could reshape GMH in accord with its aspirations for participation by a wider range of stakeholders. <b>Social</b> <b>work's</b> values-based commitment to rights and empowerment, emphasis on embedded knowledge emerging from close links with practice, and theoretical engagement with social, cultural and political context, enable the profession to contribute significantly to this task.

40|$|This thesis explores {{discourses of}} reprivatization and depoliticization of women's caregiving. The {{research}} {{is set in}} the context of a twenty year period of economic decline in British Columbia. In 2002, the newly elected provincial government restructured health and social services, significantly changing access to the social safety net. The study explores the experiences of women who are multiple role caregivers in two small communities in northern British Columbia, and more particularly examines the meanings women make of the caregiving they do. Women in this study understand caregiving as both a duty and an honour, but most significantly as a delicately balanced web of relationships. Their ability to negotiate their movement between the public, private and economic spheres is primarily based on balancing those relationships with their economic needs. In doing so, they contest the state's insistence on defining their role as caregivers and insist that locating caregiving in either the public or private sphere be done by the women themselves, on their own terms. The <b>implication</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> is that of understanding the economic marginalization of caregivers as not strictly an argument for additional resources. The primary theoretical implication suggested by this thesis is the need to examine the structures of power and oppression and the development of agency rather than simply the development of programs and resources in response to perceived or identified need.
