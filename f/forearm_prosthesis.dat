40|$|Tactile {{feedback}} about, at least, hand aperture and grasping force, {{is required}} for (1) optimal control of a myoelectric <b>forearm</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> (2) to reduce {{the burden on the}} visual system and (3) to enable more subconscious use of the prosthesis. In this thesis, the possibilities of vibrotactile and electrotactile stimulation to provide this feedback to the user are investigated. Vibrotactile stimulation was preferred over electrotactile stimulation, because it is more comfortable and did not increase task durations. Several stimulation configurations (longitudinal vs. transversal oriented arrays and amplitude vs. frequency modulation, etc.) and different vibrotactile stimulators (an array of little coin motors and a C 2 tactor) have been compared in virtual grasping tasks. Most of the investigated options resulted in increased grasping performances compared to situations without feedback, with no large differences between the evaluated configurations and stimulators. Subsequently, hand aperture and grasping force feedback were successfully combined in one system and it was shown that this combination also enabled discrimination of object stiffness. Experiments that are more related to daily life practice were set up by adding distractive counting tasks, by incorporating EMG control, by including upper-limb loss subjects and finally by evaluating grasping performance in daily life grasping tasks performed with a real myoelectric <b>forearm</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Distractive tasks and EMG control did not reduce the grasping performance with vibrotactile feedback and no differences in grasping performance with vibrotactile feedback were found between healthy subjects and upper limb loss subjects. It was shown that vibrotactile feedback about hand aperture and grasping force can increase the grasping performance with a real myoelectric <b>forearm</b> <b>prosthesis</b> (for example in object identification) in situations where sight on the prosthesis is blocked. However, when visual feedback is available, no effect of the vibrotactile feedback was found after a short period of use, although subjects did perceive the feedback as helpful...|$|E
40|$|Background: User {{feedback}} about grasping force and hand aperture {{is very important}} in object handling with myoelectric <b>forearm</b> <b>prostheses</b> but is lacking in current prostheses. Vibrotactile feedback increases the performance of healthy subjects in virtual grasping tasks, but no extensive validation on potential users has been performed. Objectives: Investigate the performance of upper-limb loss subjects in grasping tasks with vibrotactile stimulation, providing hand aperture, and grasping force feedback. Study design: Cross-over trial. Methods: A total of 10 subjects with upper-limb loss performed virtual grasping tasks while perceiving vibrotactile feedback. Hand aperture feedback was provided through an array of coin motors and grasping force feedback through a single miniature stimulator or an array of coin motors. Objects with varying sizes and weights had to be grasped by a virtual hand. Results: Percentages correctly applied hand apertures and correct grasping force levels were all higher for the vibrotactile feedback condition compared to the no-feedback condition. With visual feedback, the results were always better compared to the vibrotactile feedback condition. Task durations were comparable for all feedback conditions. Conclusion: Vibrotactile grasping force and hand aperture feedback improves grasping performance of subjects with upper-limb loss. However, it should be investigated whether this is of additional value in daily-life tasks. Clinical relevance This study is a first step toward the implementation of sensory vibrotactile feedback for users of myoelectric <b>forearm</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Grasping force feedback is crucial for optimal object handling, and hand aperture feedback is essential for reduction of required visual attention. Grasping performance with feedback is evaluated for the potential users...|$|R
40|$|User {{feedback}} about grasping force or slip of objects {{is lacking in}} current myoelectric <b>forearm</b> <b>prostheses,</b> resulting in {{a high number of}} prosthesis abandonment, because a high level of concentration is required to hold an object. Several approaches to provide force feedback to the user via vibrotactile stimulation have been described in literature, but none of them have investigated the optimal stimulation parameters. This study describes an evaluation of three modulation techniques to provide force feedback. Furthermore, the same modulation techniques to provide slip feedback were evaluated, which has not been described before. The performance in virtual object holding tasks was significantly improved in most cases compared to the non-feedback situation, but at the cost of an increased task duration...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{currently}} available myoelectric <b>forearm</b> <b>prostheses</b> stay unused {{because of the}} lack of sensory feedback. Vibrotactile and electrotactile stimulation have high potential to provide this feedback. In this study, performance of a grasping task is investigated for different hand opening feedback conditions on 15 healthy subjects and validated on three patients. The opening of a virtual hand was controlled by a scroll wheel. Feedback about hand opening was given via an array of eight vibrotactile or electrotactile stimulators placed on the forearm, relating to eight hand opening positions. A longitudinal and transversal orientation of the array and four feedback conditions were investigated: no feedback, visual feedback, feedback through vibrotactile or electrotactile stimulation, and addition of an extra stimulator for touch feedback. No influence of array orientation was shown for all outcome parameters (duration of the task, the percentage of correct hand openings, the mean position error, and the percentage deviations up to one position). Vibrotactile stimulation enhances the performance compared to the nonfeedback conditions. The addition of touch feedback further increases the performance, but at the cost of an increased duration. The same effects were found for the patient group, but the task duration was around 25 % larger...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an adaptable Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for controlling virtual <b>forearm</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Direct physical performance measures (obtained score and completion time) for the requested tasks were calculated. Furthermore, bioelectric signals from the forehead were recorded using one pair of electrodes placed on the frontal region of the subject head to extract the mental (affective) measures while performing the tasks. By employing the proposed algorithm and above measures, the proposed HMI can adapt itself to the subject's mental states, thus improving the usability of the interface. The quantitative results from 15 subjects show that the proposed HMI achieved better physical performance measures in comparison to a conventional non-adaptive myoelectric controller (p < 0. 001) ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays <b>forearm</b> <b>prosthesis</b> are {{far from}} optimal, factors {{that need to be}} {{optimized}} are the mass, the price and the wear temperature of the prosthesis. This can be done by choosing cardboard as constructive material. In this report the relevant control mechanisms are investigated. A body powered prosthesis voluntary closing control is chosen as the activation mechanism. This mechanism has a new feature called passive closing. This feature enables the user to grip objects with di?erent grasp forces without exerting force with a harness. The created PLYOS prehensor can perform ?ve prehension patterns. The voluntary closing behavior of the prosthesis can be compared with the high end available prostheses, while being at least 30 % lighter than the competition. The generated pinch force of 15 N is generated with an actuation force of 35. 5 N. The plyos prehensor is also tested to lift 10 kg and it is able to do 20. 000 cycles of gripping (activation force 60 N) and lifting (15 N). The wet strength of the prosthesis is good, it does not jam when it is wet, while it stays strong. BMEBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{prostheses}} used by {{the majority}} of persons with upper limb amputations today offer a limited range of motion. Relative to anatomical joints transradial (below the elbow) prosthesis users lose {{at least two of the}} three degrees of freedom provided by the wrist and <b>forearm.</b> Some myoeletric <b>prostheses</b> currently allow for forearm pronation and supination (rotation about an axis parallel to the forearm) and the operation of a powered prosthetic hand. Body-powered prostheses, incorporating hooks and other cable driven terminal devices, have even fewer active degrees of freedom. In order to perform activities of daily living, an amputee must use a greater than normal range of movement from other anatomical body joints to compensate for the loss of movement ca{{used by the}} amputation. By studying this compensatory motion of prosthetic users, the mechanics of how they adapt to the loss of range of motion in a given limb and specific tasks were analyzed. The purpose of this study is to create a robotic based kinematic model that can predict the compensatory motion of a given task using given subject data in select tasks. The tasks used in this study are the activities of daily living: opening a door, drinking from a cup, lifting a box, and turning a steering wheel. For the model the joint angles necessary to accomplish a task are calculated by a simulation for a set of prostheses and tasks. The simulation contains a set of configurations that are represented by parameters that consist of the joint degrees of freedom provided by each prosthesis, and a set of task information that includes joint constraints and trajectories. In the simulation the hand or prosthesis follows the trajectory to perform the task. Analysis of tasks is done by attaching prosthetic constraints to one of the arms of the upper body model in the simulation, other arm maintains an anatomical configuration. By running the model through this simulation with different configurations the compensatory motions were found. Results can then be used to select the best prosthesis for a given user, design prostheses that are more effective at selected tasks, and demonstrate some possible compensations given a set of residual joint limitations with certain prosthetic components, by optimizing the configuration of the prostheses to improve their performance...|$|R
40|$|Epub 2013 Aug 28 BACKGROUND: The role of arm motion {{during the}} long jump has been well studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{quantify}} the effect of forearm mass on impulse and the kinematics of the flight phase in an upper limb amputee. CASE DESCRIPTION AND METHODS: A world-record paralympic long jumper carried out jumps in three conditions: wearing his usual <b>forearm</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and with 0. 3 and 0. 4 kg added mass. A motion capture system including force plates was used to record the jump. FINDINGS AND OUTCOME: At take-off, the addition of 0. 4 kg to the prosthesis decreased the vertical velocity of the centre of mass but increased horizontal velocity. These modifications were associated with an increase in landing distance and an improvement of the synchronization between arms. CONCLUSION: Increasing forearm mass appears to improve long jump performance. Further studies need to evaluate the optimal prosthetic mass for both training and competition. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This biomechanical analysis of the long jump highlighted the effects of changing prosthesis mass on performance. This methodological approach may be useful in the context of sport and performance research...|$|E
40|$|User {{acceptance}} of myoelectric forearm prostheses is currently low. Awkward control, lack of feedback, and difficult training are cited as primary reasons. Recently, researchers {{have focused on}} exploiting the new possibilities offered by advancements in prosthetic technology. Alternatively, researchers could focus on prosthesis acceptance by developing functional requirements based on activities users are likely to perform. In this article, we describe the process of determining such requirements and then the application of these requirements to evaluating {{the state of the}} art in myoelectric <b>forearm</b> <b>prosthesis</b> research. As part of a needs assessment, a workshop was organized involving clinicians (representing end users), academics, and engineers. The resulting needs included an increased number of functions, lower reaction and execution times, and intuitiveness of both control and feedback systems. Reviewing {{the state of the art}} of research in the main prosthetic subsystems (electromyographic [EMG] sensing, control, and feedback) showed that modern research prototypes only partly fulfill the requirements. We found that focus should be on validating EMG-sensing results with patients, improving simultaneous control of wrist movements and grasps, deriving optimal parameters for force and position feedback, and taking into account the psychophysical aspects of feedback, such as intensity perception and spatial acuity...|$|E
40|$|The {{real-time}} adaptation {{between human}} and assistive devices {{can improve the}} quality of life for amputees, which, however, may be difficult to achieve since physical and mental states vary over time.

Bioelectric signals are recorded using one pair of electrodes placed on the frontal face region of a user to extract the mental (affective) measures (the entropy of the alpha band of the forehead electroencephalography signals) while performing the tasks. By developing an effective algorithm, the proposed HMI can adapt itself to the mental states of a user, thus improving its usability. The quantitative results from 16 users (including an amputee) show that the proposed HMI achieved better physical performance measures in comparison with the traditional (nonadaptive) interface (p value < 0. 001).

40|$|Background: After {{an upper}} limb {{amputation}} a prosthesis {{is often used}} to restore the functionality. However, the frequency of prostheses use is generally low. Movement kinematics of prostheses use might suggest origins of this low use. The aim {{of this study was to}} reveal movement patterns of prostheses during basic goal-directed actions in upper limb prosthetic users and to compare this with existing knowledge of able-bodied performance during these actions. Methods: Movements from six users of upper extremity prostheses were analyzed, three participants with a hybrid upper arm prosthesis, and three participants with a myoelectric <b>forearm</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Two grasping tasks and a reciprocal pointing task were investigated during a single lab session. Analyses were carried out on the kinematics of the tasks. Findings: When grasping, movements with both prostheses showed asymmetric velocity profiles of the reach and had a plateau in the aperture profiles. Reach and grasp were decoupled. Kinematics with the prostheses differed in that the use of upper arm prostheses required more time to execute the movements, while the movements were less smooth, more asymmetric, and showed more decoupling between reach and grasp. The pointing task showed for both prostheses less harmonic movements with higher task difficulty. Interpretation: Characterizing prosthetic movement patterns revealed specific features of prosthetic performance. Developments in technology and rehabilitation should focus on these issues to improve prosthetic use, in particular on improving motor characteristics and the control of the elbow, and learning to coordinate the reach and the grasp component in prehension.
