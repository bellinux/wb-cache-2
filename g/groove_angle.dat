40|$|International audienceMarciniak-Kuczynski (M-K) {{model is}} the widely used method to {{theoretically}} obtain the forming limit curves (FLCs) of the sheet metal. However, in the applications of the M-K model, FLCs are generally assumed not {{to be dependent on}} the initial <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> of the model, and are achieved with a zero <b>groove</b> <b>angle.</b> Nowadays, under positive strain paths, there is little research about whether the initial <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> has influence on the limit strains and what the influence is. In addition, during the deduction of the M-K algorithm, the material's constitutive models with simple expressions are generally used, which cannot describe accurately the interacting effects of temperature and strain rate on forming limits. Therefore, above limitations greatly affect the accuracy of the predicted forming limits. In this work, three modified complex constitutive models (Voce, Ludwik and Khan-Huang-Liang model), considering the interacting effects of temperature and strain rate, are implemented into M-K model to investigate the sheet formability of AA 5086 under different temperatures (20, 150 and 200 °C) and strain rates (0. 02, 0. 2 and 2 s- 1). With the algorithm developed in this work, the influences of the initial <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> on limit strains and FLCs are investigated. Results show that the initial <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> has distinguishing influences on limit strains under different strain paths. When the strain path is in the range from 0 to 0. 4, forming limits are always achieved with a zero <b>groove</b> <b>angle.</b> While when the strain path is not in the range from 0 to 0. 4, limit strains depend greatly on the initial <b>groove</b> <b>angle.</b> The limit strains obtained with a zero <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> in the literatures overestimate clearly its true sheet formability. Finally, the calculated limit strains are compared with experimental data obtained by Marciniak test under different forming conditions. Therefore, this work could provide an effective method to obtain the sheet formability more accurately by the M-K model...|$|E

40|$|Modern factory {{crushing}} units process prepared {{sugar cane}} through sets of counter-rotating grooved rolls. A typical unit in Australia would process {{in excess of}} 600 tonnes of material per hour. Throughput and extraction performance {{is strongly dependent on}} material behaviour, the geometry and surface condition at the roll bagasse interface. Factories use welding procedures to arc roughen the tips of grooves in an effort to increase friction. Although industry procedures appear ad hoc it is clear that some level of roughness is crucial to performance. A similar statement can be made in respect to roll grooving given the wide variation in adopted practice. This project involved an experimental investigation into the effects of interface friction on bagasse compaction between grooved steel platens. An apparatus was developed for use in the SOE MTS testing facility. A factorial design experiment involving 105 tests randomised in blocks was conducted to discover the interaction between friction (the dependent variable) and <b>groove</b> <b>angle,</b> compaction, and roughness (independent variables). The results indicate that roughness, <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> and compaction significantly affect friction coefficient. While roughness and <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> contribute to increase friction coefficient, compaction causes a marked decrease. Observations on samples of bagasse exhibiting pure shear suggest that the frictional forces generated at the interface cannot be sustained by the shear strength of bagasse. Comparisons between friction coefficient and shear coefficient showed that the friction coefficient values approach the shear coefficient values under particular geometric and loading conditions. An empirical model was developed to explore variables. The effect of <b>groove</b> <b>angle,</b> degree of roughness (location and size of roughened asperity) and sample compaction on friction has been ascertained...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Australian sugar {{industry}} utilizes rolling almost exclusively for extraction of sucrose from prepared sugarcane. The feeding and extraction performance of rolling mills is strongly {{dependent on the}} friction coefficient between counter−rotating rolls and the fibro−porous sugarcane blanket. Rolls are circumferentially grooved and roughened with weld droplets to assist juice drainage and maximize friction between rolls and blanket.

This article develops a multi−variate empirical regression equation based on the experimental measurements of previous investigators to describe the dependence of the interfacial friction coefficient on normal pressure, <b>groove</b> <b>angle,</b> and relative rubbing speed. The friction coefficient was found to decrease exponentially with increasing normal pressure, decrease linearly with increasing rubbing speed, and increase with decreasing <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> in accordance with simple wedge theory...|$|E

However, it is difficult to use these arc sensors in narrow gap welding because the arc stability and sensing accuracy are not satisfactory.

Both the single and multipass welds showed satisfactory bead morphology, tensile strength and toughness especially at higher groove angles of 60 and 750 for the selected range of welding current and speeds. The weld metal compositions showed considerably high presence of Ni, Mn and Si with little loss of other alloying elements. The weld properties were primarily affected by the heat input per unit length of weld and the <b>groove</b> <b>angle.</b> The maximum ultimate tensile strength and toughness of the welds were found to be around 845 MPa and 125 J, respectively, for a heat input of 1. 38 kJ/mm and a <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> of 75 degrees. The use of metal cored filler wires could enhance the welding speed by 20 % and filler wire deposition rate by 42 % compared to that with the solid wires. Overall, the present study showed that the pulsed current gas metal arc welding of medium to high thickness P 91 steels using metal cored filler wires could provide higher deposition rate and welding speed, and enhanced weld bead properties in comparison to solid wires.

Concepts are developed for the so-called "apparent" absorptance of a V-groove cavity, {{as well as for the}} "effective" absorptance of a V-grooved surface. These concepts are formulated in closed form mathematical equations, which facilitate both the optimization of V-grooved surfaces and their engineering design. In order to verify the theoretical analysis, experiments are carried out on 34 V-grooved brass specimens. In addition, the experiments are meant to provide information about the behaviour of such surfaces used for solar energy collection. For that purpose, the specimens are exposed to simulated sunlight, and their effective absorptances, as well as their absorption efficiencies, are determined by a calorimetric method. The highlights among the results are: 1. V-grooves - carefully optimized and applied to a solar energy absorbing surface - can raise its absorptance almost to unity and improve its absorption efficiency. 2. Best performances at elevated temperatures can be expected from using metal surfaces which are provided with specular V-grooves having a small <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> (< 30 ⁰). 3. The optimal <b>groove</b> <b>angle</b> is dependent on (1) the reflection properties of the surface, (2) the absorptance of the surface material, and (3) the ratio of groove depth to width of land which occurs between grooves...|$|E
