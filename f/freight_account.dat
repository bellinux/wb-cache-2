50|$|Freight {{transportation}} is carried {{by a variety}} of networks. The largest percentage of US freight is carried by trucks (60%), followed by pipelines (18%), rail (10%), ship (8%), and air (0.01%). Other modes of transportation, such as parcels and intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>accounted</b> for about 3% of the remainder. Air freight is commonly used only for perishables and premium express shipments. The difference in percentage of rail's share by ton-miles and by weight (10% vs 38%) is accounted for by the extreme efficiency of trains. A single railroad locomotive may pull fifty boxcars full of freight while a truck only pulls one. Trucks surpass trains in the weight category due their greater numbers, while trains surpass trucks in the ton-miles category due to the vast distances they travel carrying large amounts of freight.|$|R

50|$|Freight cost reports can be {{generated}} to compare the freight costs for forwarders and the customers may use such reports to flag out service failures, negotiate for better freight deals or the opportunity to consolidate the shipments to a forwarder for a better rate. Customers can simulate the freight cost calculation for new freight rates or packages proposed by the forwarder and determine if this is suitable for their business model.With large fluctuations in the surcharges, the accounts department will have lower visibility in accruing freight cost. By choosing a freight invoice verification model, a customer can forecast the freight cost to be accrued for accounting purposes. This translates to lesser risk and more predictability in cash flow for the company. Akzo Nobel’s automated freight audit process has also instilled tighter controls over their <b>freight</b> <b>accounting</b> by eliminating human communication and intervention {{from the point of}} the freight quote to the payment process. By controlling the human communication and minimizing human intervention, the audit process will be unbiased and less likely to deviate from the proper process.|$|R

40|$|Air freight {{transport}} plays {{a vital role}} in Germany’s foreign trade and contributes to Germany’s position as one of the leading exporting countries worldwide. Although the volume of air <b>freight</b> <b>accounts</b> for only 1. 5 percent of the exports measured in tons, the value of air freight exports amounts to 25 percent of Germany’s external trade. In particular, air {{freight transport}} forms an important part of logistic concepts and supply chains of commercial and industrial enterprises for the shipment of high-value and time-sensitive goods. However, only relatively little research has been conducted in air transport with regard to the spatial differentiated generation and distribution of air freight compared to the state of research in passenger transport. The main research objective is to gain advanced insights and a profound understanding of the demand generating determinants and structures of air freight on a regional scale and its distribution patterns in the transportation system. In particular, the paper aims to investigate the generation of the disaggregated industry-specific air freight demand in Germany and its interdependencies with the economic activities on a regional level. Building on these findings, the distribution of the regionally generated air freight is explored by modelling the airport choice behaviour of the air freight forwarders using a discrete choice approach. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of three empirical studies using the a survey of Chilean Manufactures. The first two chapters of this dissertation evaluates the productivity impact of exporting and service outsourcing. The last chapter evaluates selection mechanisms into exporting. The first chapter examines productivity and exporting. I find that asymmetric responses, between exporters and non-exporters, to changes in the domestic lending rate can cause propensity-score-matching-difference-in-differences to underestimate the effect of export entry if these asymmetries are not accounted for in propensity-score-matching. Further, this chapter shows show a significant productivity effect of export entry after allowing unobserved time effects to interact with unobserved plant fixed effects. I find that export entry can cause firms to be as much as 20 percent more productive on average than they would have been if they did not export after I allow these macroeconomic time effects to have different impacts based on treatment status using a newly developed method by Hsiao, Ching, and Wan (2012). This paper highlights the use of general models, such as HCW, as a tool to help researchers test possible misspecification that can arise when unobserved heterogeneity interacts with the macro-environment and the unobserved effects are not netted out with propensity-score-matching. In the second chapter, I measure the productivity impact of outsourcing business services. Firm level studies on the impact of service adoption have remained sparse and when they do exist, the identification issue of selection is not addressed in a rigorous way. The work in this dissertation identifies the productivity effect of service adoption, while controlling for selection. I find that <b>freight,</b> <b>accounting</b> and advertising service outsourcing can boost productivity but I do not find any productivity effects for foreign technical support. The last Chapter evaluates the selection effect into exporting. I cannot find any evidence showing that productivity alone causes export entry. However, I do identify entrepreneurial type and business service outsourcing as two factors that increase productivity as well as increase the likelihood of entering foreign markets...|$|R

40|$|Air {{transport}} {{provides a}} suitable way of transport for special types of freight such as emergency freight (spare parts, documents), high-value freight (gold, currency, and artwork) and perishables (pharmaceuticals, fresh food, cut flowers) as these products have very short shelf life {{and benefit from}} fast transit times. Air transport is also {{responsible for most of}} the value added. As stated by Boeing, even though air <b>freight</b> <b>accounts</b> for fewer than 2 per cent of total tonnage transported, it represents almost 40 per cent of aggregate value of total world trade, proving that it is a link of paramount importance for the global supply chains. Descriptive models can aid decision makers in their understanding of the response of global air freight flows to external factors such as the global economy and technological innovation and provide a quantitative underpinning of forecasts and of business cases for investment. Although in the air freight transport business, use is often made of long term forecasts, there is little shared knowledge about which methods should be preferred, and hardly any literature at the scientific level. Transport models were originally developed for passengers and ensuingly applied in freight. Although it is accepted that the four-step transport modelling methodology is a fitting framework for freight, many fundamental differences exist between them such as diversity in decision makers, commodities transported, mode properties, the networks etc. In the particular case of air freight transport, these elementary dissimilarities call for an adaptation of the existing methods, towards a modelling framework better suited for the airborne movement of goods. There lacks a strategic model for air freight flows at the global scale that overcomes the insufficiencies of passenger oriented models. This research contributes to the literature by formulating a model for global air freight demand and network flows. The results of the model are presented in the form of international air freight flows, followed by results on a regional level, sensitivity analysis and validation. The model is found to produce realistic results within the rational range set by observed air freight volumes.

40|$|Following the Hatfield {{accident}} in October 2000, {{the cost of}} running Britain’s railways has increased very sharply, leading to considerable debate about whether current cost levels are reasonable. This paper seeks to inform this debate by assessing post-Hatfield cost and TFP levels (2000 / 01 to 2001 / 02) against the historical precedents set by British Rail and the early experience of the newly-privatised industry (1963 to 1999 / 00). The results show that industry cash costs rose by 47 % between 1999 / 00, the last financial year before Hatfield, and 2001 / 02 - but, surprisingly, with train operating costs (TOCs and <b>freight</b> operators) <b>accounting</b> for 42 % of this growth. The results also show that the post-Hatfield cost spike is unprecedented when compared against historical benchmarks, indicating that recent cost rises cannot simply {{be explained by the}} investment cycle or so-called “bow-wave” effects. Furthermore, according to the preferred models, post-Hatfield productivity levels are lower than at any time over the last four decades.

40|$|<b>Freight</b> {{transportation}} <b>accounts</b> for 9 % {{of total}} greenhouse gas (GHG) {{emissions in the}} United States. The contributions of each of five freight transportation modes to total freight transportation GHG emissions are 60, 6, 5, 13, and 16 percent for truck, rail, air, water, and pipeline, respectively. There is growing interesting in reducing GHG emissions in freight transportation. Fifty-nine strategies are identified as potential best practices for these reductions. Total estimated GHG emissions reductions by 2025 for all practices is 4. 6 × 108 tons CO 2 eq., which is 42 % of 2025 GHG emissions if no best practice is implemented. For the truck mode, 2025 GHG emissions could be reduced by 28 percent compared to 2003 levels. Of other four modes, 2025 GHG emissions could increase by 20, 8, 22, and 9 percent, respectively, compared to 2003 levels, which is smaller than the increase if no best practices are implemented. For thirteen practices for which costs were assessed quantitatively, ten practices may produce net cost savings concurrent with substantial reductions in GHG emissions. Based on current prices, switching from petroleum to biodiesel can reduce GHG emissions but increase total costs. Inter-modal shifts could lead to potentially larger reductions. For example, a shift from truck to rail modes can reduce GHG emissions per ton-mile by 85 percent, even when truck transport at the start {{and end of the}} trip are considered.

40|$|Purpose: As one of largest energy consumers, the {{transport}} sector (TS) has significant impacts on the environment. Shenzhen, a developed megacity in South China, plays {{a leadership role in}} promoting the development of energy efficient vehicles in China. Methods: This paper aims to assess the carbon footprint (CF) of the TS in Shenzhen via a Streamlined Life Cycle Assessment method. Consequently, the current environmental performance of the TS is evaluated and improvement potentials are examined. Results and discussion: The results show that CF has gained rapid growth over the past decade {{at an annual rate of}} 15. 3 %, closely corresponding with the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (18. 9 %) in Shenzhen. The total CF in 2013 was estimated as 50. 7 million tons (ranging from 41. 7 to 59. 9). Road based <b>freight</b> transport <b>accounts</b> for the largest share of the TS’ emissions. The most significant contributors in this sector are: light duty trucks, urban public transport bus service, and passenger air transport. Meanwhile, this study took new energy vehicles into consideration in order to explore the range of CF mitigation potential in Shenzhen. The potential carbon abatement is not significant in comparison with the impact growth derived from the increasing freight and passenger transport based on the assumption that {{the transport}} intensity and its annual growth rate maintain at the current levels. Conclusions: This study offers a useful approach to evaluate the available options for sustainable transport system planning in Shenzhen. For carbon emissions reductions from the TS, policies and technological innovations are essential to facilitate the transition to a low carbon TS. In addition, the methodology developed in this study could be used for assessing CF in other sectors. Huabo Duan, Mingwei Hu, Jian Zuo, Jiasong Zhu, Ruichang Mao, Qifei Huan...|$|R
