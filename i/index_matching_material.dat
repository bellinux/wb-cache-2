40|$|In a {{semiconductor}} {{light emitting}} diode (LED) {{a large proportion of}} the light produced will be internally reflected when it strikes the end face of the LED at a semiconductor-air interface. This is due to the high index of refraction of most LED semiconductor materials. This problem may be partially overcome by modification of the shape of the LED by a reverse taper of the sides of the LED. Light is redirected by the taper to strike the interface at an angle closer to normal. This allows light to exit the LED that would be totally internally reflected in an untapered LED. The novelty of the present invention lies in the tapering of the sides of the LED for increased through transmission of light. Prior art devices have made use surface modifications such as roughening, addition of guiding layers, use of <b>index</b> <b>matching</b> <b>materials</b> and hemispherical shaping of the emitting end of the LED. Current technology LEDs have a transmission efficiency of only a few percent. An increase in this efficiency would be of great value to any technology that makes use of LEDs for light generation.

We present materials and strategies of using printed MJ solar cell structures to bypass the challenges in conventional multijunction cell design. Firstly, microscale, quadruple junction (InGaP/GaAs/InGaAsNSb//Ge), four-terminal solar cells are fabricated by printing-based assembly with a refractive <b>index</b> <b>matched</b> interface <b>material</b> As 2 Se 3. We obtain solar cells with measured efficiencies of 43. 9 % at concentrations exceeding 1000 suns, and modules with efficiencies of 36. 5 %. Secondly, we present a printed MJ cell architecture with low refractive indices as interfaces, providing further enhanced capabilities in photon recycling and photon extraction. Experiments demonstrate that thin-film GaAs devices printed on low-index substrates exhibit improved photon recycling, leading to increased open-circuit voltages, consistent with theoretical predictions.

40|$|We discuss {{residual}} lens {{effects in}} multi-view switchable auto-stereoscopic lenticular-based 2 D/ 3 D displays. With {{the introduction of}} a switchable lenticular, it is possible to switch between a 2 D mode and a 3 D mode. The 2 D mode displays conventional content, whereas the 3 D mode provides the sensation of depth to the viewer. The uniformity of a display in the 2 D mode is quantified by the quality parameter modulation depth. In order to reduce the modulation depth in the 2 D mode, birefringent lens plates are investigated analytically and numerically, by ray tracing. We can conclude that the modulation depth in the 2 D mode can be substantially decreased by using birefringent lens plates with a perfect <b>index</b> <b>match</b> between lens <b>material</b> and lens plate.

50|$|Polyphenyl ethers (PPEs) possess good optical clarity, a high {{refractive}} index, {{and other}} beneficial optical properties. Because of these, PPEs {{have the ability}} to meet the rigorous performance demands of signal processing in advanced photonics systems. Optical clarity of PPEs resembles that of the other optical polymers, that is, they have refractive indices of between 1.5 and 1.7 and provide good propagation of light between approximately 400 nm and 1700 nm. Close refractive <b>index</b> (RI) <b>matching</b> between <b>materials</b> is important for proper propagation of light through them. Because of the ease of RI matching, PPEs are used in many optical devices as optical fluids. Extreme resistance to ionizing radiation gives PPEs an added advantage in the manufacture of solar cells and solid-state UV/blue emitters and telecommunication equipment made from high-index glasses and semiconductors.|$|R
40|$|The {{enhancement}} of heat transfer from fuel rods to coolant of a Liquid Metal Fast Reactor (LMFR) decreases the fuel temperature and, thus, improves the safety {{margin of the}} reactor. One of the mechanisms that increases heat transfer consists of large coherent structures that can occur across the gap between adjacent rods. This work investigates the flow between two curved surfaces, representing the gap between two adjacent fuel rods. The aim is to investigate {{the presence of the}} aforementioned structures and to provide, as partners in the EU SESAME project, an experimental benchmark for numerical validation to reproduce the thermal hydraulics of Gen-IV LMFRs. The work investigates also the applicability of Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) as Refractive <b>Index</b> <b>Matching</b> (RIM) <b>material</b> for optical measurements. The experiments are conducted on two half-rods of 15 mm diameter opposing each other inside a Perspex box with Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA). Different channel Reynolds numbers between Re = 600 and Re = 30, 000 are considered for each P/D (pitch-to-diameter ratio). For high Re, the stream wise velocity root mean square v rms between the two half rods is higher near the walls, similar to common channel flow. As Re decreases, however, an additional central peak in v rms appears at the gap centre, away from the walls. The peak becomes clearer at lower P/D ratios and it also occurs at higher flow rates. Periodical behaviour of the span wise velocity across the gap is revealed by the frequency spectrum and the frequency varies with P/D and decreases with Re. The study of the stream wise velocity component reveals that the structures become longer with decreasing Re. As Re increases, these structures are carried along the flow closer to the gap centre, whereas at low flow rates they are spread over a wider region. This becomes even clearer with smaller gaps. </p...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} phase optical recording mediums are photopolymers. In these materials, the use of an <b>index</b> <b>matching</b> component permits a better conservation of the stored information and, additionally, the study of the molecules migration and shrinkage/swelling phenomena separately. In general, the transmitted beam has the information of the thickness and refractive index modulation mixed. Therefore, we propose the introduction of a coverplate besides with an <b>index</b> <b>matching</b> liquid in order to improve the characterization and the conservation. The <b>index</b> <b>matching</b> techniques have been classically used for holographic recording materials. In principle, to obtain an accurate <b>index</b> <b>matching</b> we have to choose a liquid with refractive index very close to the mean of the polymer one. Then, when shrinkage takes place during recording, mainly due to the polymerization, the liquid will fill up the generated grooves minimizing the diffractive effects produced by the relief structure. In fact, in this work we study different <b>index</b> <b>matching</b> components for different photopolymers.
