50|$|Throughout {{his career}} Newmark {{developed}} a simple, yet powerful and widely used method for analyzing complex structural components and assemblies under {{a variety of}} conditions of loading and for calculating the stresses and deformations in soil beneath foundations. He also was an engineer on the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Since there was an oil and energy shortage, high unemployment rate, and high inflation in the 1970s, the country had to do something to help conserve and utilize the natural resources available to them inside the country. Once oil was discovered in Alaska, there was a need for a design to get the oil quickly and efficiently down to the refineries. The Alaskan terrain offered many diverse challenges for a normal underground pipeline, thus Newmark was consulted to design sections of the pipeline near the fault lines. Since Newmark had done numerous studies on the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>earthquakes</b> on structures, he had the ideal background to tackle such a revolutionary feat.|$|E

25|$|One {{positive}} {{aspect of}} soil liquefaction is {{the tendency for}} the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>earthquake</b> shaking to be significantly damped (reduced) for the remainder <b>of</b> the <b>earthquake.</b> This is because liquids do not support a shear stress and so once the soil liquefies due to shaking, subsequent earthquake shaking (transferred through ground by shear waves) is not transferred to buildings at the ground surface.|$|R
30|$|Seismic {{intensity}} and peak ground accumulation (PGA) are two common proxies representing {{the degree of}} seismic energy and often used to explore the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>earthquakes</b> on landslides. The PGA distribution map released by USGS (www.usgs.gov) is rather irregular in the 5 -km buffer area of the Araniko Highway because the buffer area is relatively small and there are perhaps significant errors generated by numerical simulation and limited stations. Therefore, we preferred to analyze the correlation between coseismic landslides and seismic intensity in this study. The seismic intensity map of the Gorkha earthquake was produced by China Earthquake Administration (CEA) (Fig.  1). Only VIII and IX intensity zones appear in the study area, which have the landslide number density values 0.32  km- 2 and 3.5  km- 2, respectively (Fig.  14). Despite merely two data points, these data show a positive correlation with the coseismic landslides, i.e. the place with larger seismic intensity has a higher landslide number density.|$|E

The result of the internship is presented in the following report that investigated the phenomenon of liquefaction under seismic conditions. The most serious direct <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>earthquakes</b> on buildings and structures is ground shaking. However earthquake shocks might pose other hazards in the form of soil liquefaction, which can result in considerable financial losses. Some soils such as quicksands and quickclays can give rise to major problems when disturbed by ground shaking. The ground vibrations produced by an earthquake lead to a decrease in the effective stress and in the shear strength of the soil which in turn trigger the liquefaction...|$|E

Evidence also suggests that the 1994 Northridge quake has played a role in shaping the time trend of the impact of this risk factor.
