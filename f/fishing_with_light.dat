As soon as men {{knew how to make}} fires, they must have discovered that some kind of fish are attracted to light. Fishing with torches was eventually improved with the use of fuel oil, kerosene, gas and electricity, so that throughout the centuries, the light fishery have used fires, torches, acetylene, kerosene, gas and electric incandescent and fluorescent lamps, as fishing lights. Many countries in the world have some methods of <b>fishing</b> <b>with</b> <b>light,</b> but Japanese light fishery is the largest light fishing industry in the world. The light fishery is able to economize the energy or equipment through contriving optimum light intensity, optimum light wave length that conform to visibility of fish. Nowadays we have to review coastal fisheries, the light fishery ought to be developed as the fisheries controlled for resources management...|$|E

In order to find out the way to solve those problems, Set-Net fishing was proposed {{to be used as a}} kind of tool for the coastal fisheries management development. Set-Net does not function only to harvest fisheries resources but its construction also provided shelter and substrate for living marine organism to create their communities in the food chain of coastal marine ecosystem. Seven small scale fishermen groups of Mae Rumpheung beach which located on the east coast of the Gulf of Thailand, were selected as the experimental samples and site for case study in Thailand. Over two hundred fishermen have generally earned their lives on this coastal waters with seven types of fishing gears: crab bottom gillnet, crab trap, squid trap, squid jigging, fish trap, handlines and fish gillnet. Some commercial fishing boats from other area are also presently operated anchovy purse seine and anchovy <b>fishing</b> <b>with</b> <b>light</b> on this area. So that they should pay high responsibility on their own coastal resources and environmental conservation under the concept of decentralization policy. One set of set-net "Otoshi-ami" was constructed and installed at 14 meters depth fishing ground of coastal waters, five groups of fishermen were arranged for fishing operation alternately under control of the Set-net Operation Administrative and Management Committee. It could harvest various species of their coastal resources mainly yellowstrip scad, round herring, sardine, indian mackerel, Indo-Pacific mackerel and squid. There are also a lot of fishes and others marine organism gathering and living around and on the set-net construction both pelagic and demersal species. It is shown that the coastal resources communities were developed around the set-net area more than other empty area of this waters. So that, the vicinity area around set net construction is become a good fishing ground for small-scale fishing activities, however it should be managed by the committee or the cooperative in future...|$|E

50|$|Fish {{have evolved}} {{sophisticated}} ways of using colouration. For example, prey fish have ways of using colouration {{to make it}} more difficult for visual predators to see them. In pelagic fish, these adaptations are mainly concerned with a reduction in silhouette, a form of camouflage. One method of achieving this is to reduce the area of their shadow by lateral compression of the body. Another method, also a form of camouflage, is by countershading in the case of epipelagic fish and by counter-illumination in the case of mesopelagic fish. Countershading is achieved by colouring the <b>fish</b> <b>with</b> darker pigments at the top and lighter pigments at the bottom in such a way that the colouring matches the background. When seen from the top, the darker dorsal area of the animal blends into the darkness of the water below, and when seen from below, the lighter ventral area blends into the sunlight from the surface. Counter illumination is achieved via bioluminescence by the production of light from ventral photophores, aimed at matching the light intensity from the underside of the <b>fish</b> <b>with</b> the <b>light</b> intensity from the background.|$|R
