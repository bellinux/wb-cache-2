Euroregions are administrative-territorial {{structures}} {{intended to}} promote cross-border cooperation between neighbouring local or regional authorities of different countries located along shared state borders. They are widely known tools of cooperation among the regions. Having integrated structures {{and their own}} financial resources, euroregions are able to address a variety of cross-border topics such as health, research and development, education and training, waste management, environmental protection, tourism and leisure, rescue and security, transport and communication infrastructure, mobility of people, and business cooperation. This paper explores the main characteristics and problems of euroregions as institutions in the Baltic Sea Region {{and especially in the}} regions bordering the Third countries. First, it describes euroregions; then it focuses on their compositions and roles and main issues confronting them with reference to the empirical research carried out among the thirty-five cross-border cooperating organisa-tions. The new legal instrument for euroregions deserves special attention since it provides a basis under public law for <b>decentralised</b> trans-European <b>cooperation</b> between regional and/or local authorities. The article concludes with a discussion of the needs and associated development opportunities available to euroregions within the Baltic Sea Region...|$|R

The literature available identifies among the main features of <b>decentralised</b> <b>cooperation</b> the leading role of LAs, the involvement {{of different types of}} actors in both territories and the establishment of relationships between actors of distant communities/territories based on mutual exchange/learning and ultimately on reciprocity. The study focuses on the <b>decentralised</b> <b>cooperation</b> policy implemented since the late nineties by Trentino in three municipalities in the Balkans and in a rural district in Mozambique, which is currently still on-going. Aim of the research is to assess whether the ambitious assumptions of <b>decentralised</b> <b>cooperation</b> policies have been put into practise and to what extent. The paper draws attention on how local authorities and non-state-actors interact in defining <b>decentralised</b> <b>cooperation</b> policies, setting priorities and implementing programmes. In particular the paper analyses the evolution of the ambitious objectives set within the four case studies, the extent to which priorities were set in a spontaneous way, often not explicit, and how they changed over time, influenced by the ideals motivating each organisation involved. The research shows also that while most of the criteria commonly adopted for defining <b>decentralised</b> <b>cooperation</b> were put into practice, the concept of mutual exchange remained less operational within programmes and projects. The research identifies exceptions in those cases when the actors developed professional interest in establishing a partnership with local counterparts...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a consistent, information-theoretic basis for understanding of coordination and <b>cooperation</b> <b>decentralised</b> multi-sensor multi-platform systems. Autonomous systems composed of multiple sensors and multiple platforms potentially have significant importance in applications such as defence, search and rescue mining or intelligent manufacturing. However, the effective use of multiple autonomous systems requires that an understanding be developed of the mechanisms of coordination and cooperation between component systems in pursuit of a common goal. A fundamental, quantitative, understanding of coordination and <b>cooperation</b> between <b>decentralised</b> autonomous systems is the main goal of this thesis. This thesis focuses on the problem of coordination and cooperation for teams of autonomous systems engaged in information gathering and data fusion tasks. While this is a subset of the general cooperative autonomous systems problem, it still encompasses a range of possible applications in picture compilation, navigation, searching and map building problems. The great advantage of restricting the domain of interest in this way is that an underlying mathematical model for coordination and cooperation can be based on the use of information-theoretic models of platform and sensor abilities. The information theoretic approach builds on the established principles and architecture previously developed for decentralised data fusion systems. In the decentralised control problem addressed in this thesis, each platform and sensor system {{is considered to be a}} distinct decision maker with an individual information-theoretic utility measure capturing both local objectives and the inter-dependencies among the decisions made by other members of the team. Together these information-theoretic utilities constitute the team objective. The key contributions of this thesis lie in the quantification and study of cooperative control between sensors and platforms using information as a common utility measure. In particular, * The problem of information gathering is formulated as an optimal control problem by identifying formal measures of information with utility or pay-off. * An information-theoretic utility model of coupling and coordination between decentralised decision makers is elucidated. This is used to describe how the information gathering strategies of a team of autonomous systems are coupled. * Static and dynamic information structures for team members are defined. It is shown that the use of static information structures can lead to efficient, although sub-optimal, decentralised control strategies for the team. * Significant examples in decentralised control of a team of sensors are developed. These include the multi-vehicle multi-target bearings-only tracking problem, and the area coverage or exploration problem for multiple vehicles. These examples demonstrate the range of non-trivial problems to which the theory in this thesis can be employed...|$|R

Our study begins with a discussion of the evolution of value perceptions in the history of economic thought. Starting with a view on value as a coordination mechanism that defines meaningful action within a certain context, we associate the price system with the establishment of capitalism and the industrial economy. We then discuss its relevance to the information economy, exhibited as the techno-economic context of the sharing economy, and identify new modalities of value creation that better reflect the social relations of sharing. Through the illustrative case of Backfeed, a new system of value is envisioned, comprising three layers: (a) production of value; (b) record of value; and (c) actualisation of value. In this framework, we discuss the solutions featured by Backfeed and describe a conceptual economic model of blockchain-based <b>decentralised</b> <b>cooperation.</b> We conclude with a tentative scenario for blockchain technology that can enable the creation of commons-oriented ecosystems in a sharing economy...|$|E
40|$|The Martha 1 project {{objectives}} are {{the control and}} the management of a eet of autonomous mobile robots for transshipment tasks in harbours, airports and marshaling yards. Our presentation focuses {{on one of the}} most challenging and key problems of the Martha project: the multi robot cooperation. Indeed, high level missions are produced by a Central Station and sent to robots. It is then up to the robots to re ne their missions, to plan their actions and trajectories in the environment and to coordinate these actions and trajectories with the other robots. In particular, these coordinations occur in crossings, in lanes when unexpected obstacles require the robot to move in the opposite lane, and in open areas where robots need to synchronise their trajectories. We present a general concept for the control of a large eet of autonomous mobile robots which has been developed, implemented and validated in the framework of Martha. Numerous researches have been conducted in the autonomous mobile robot eld, nevertheless, the Martha project is the rst one to add the multi robot cooperation capabilities to such a large eet of robots. The Martha robots demonstrate advanced autonomous features including non-holonomic motion planning, environment modelling, sensor-based obstacle avoidance, and <b>decentralised</b> <b>cooperation</b> schemes at mission and trajectory levels. ...|$|E

This project, funded by the Regional Authority of Sicily, comes under the framework for <b>decentralised</b> <b>Cooperation</b> envisaged by Italian and EU law in relation to developing and transitional countries and economies. Over {{the first year of the}} project a procedure to aid collaboration between public bodies was perfected. A simple yet effective tool was created allowing citizens to actively participate in formulating ideas and projects for sustainable environmental development on the island of Djerba. A Local Area Management and Development (L. A. M. D.) model was adopted to achieve this and was boosted by two strategy tools: the GIS of the island of Djerba and a local development website. The strategic objective was to generate corporate governance that is truly “representative ” of the geographical area and to architect a set of concerted and programmed processes. Tangible results of the work undertaken are: the setting up of a GIS system, the active involvement in designing and launching a portal for local development and, lastly, the identification of a set of priority actions for development.

40|$|Decentralisation {{has become}} a major {{priority}} for international development cooperation in recent years. Yet its impact has often fallen well below expectations. A more critical examination of such cooperation is necessary {{in order to avoid the}} pitfalls of the past and identify best practice for the future. Decentralisation is an increasingly common feature of international cooperation today. This reflects a prevalent view among donor agencies that the strengthening of sub-national levels of government is a prerequisite for improved governance and sustainable development. However decentralisation is no panacea and the impact of national decentralisation programmes have often been disappointing. Two forms of international cooperation in support of decentralisation are identified: one that supports the central government unit spearheading the decentralisation process and another that directly supports individual municipalities, usually in the form of <b>decentralised</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Three structural problems are identified that reduce the effectiveness of international cooperation for decentralisation: the persistence of clientelism and local corruption, the tendency for larger urban municipalities to ‘capture’ the benefits of international cooperation, and the lack of institutional memory caused by the high rotation of municipal officials, which reduces the impact of donor-funded capacity-building projects. Finally, some initiatives are mentioned that seek to overcome these problems: support for national municipal associations, the dissemination of ‘good practice’ in municipal development and ‘demand-led’ programmes in support of municipal projects...|$|E

On the other hand communal wastewater disposal utilities have to dispose the wastewater. In addition to this water prices and wastewater charges shall also give financial incentives to water avoidance. The existing cost problem results {{of the structure of}} German water supply system and wastewater disposal systemwhich are in contrast to other European countries highly <b>decentralised.</b> <b>Cooperation</b> is one instrument to improve efficiency and effectiveness towards a sustainable water management. Cooperation is mainly directed to relationships between water utilities, independent of size and organization and should be realised on a voluntary basis. A cooperation could take place between two water supply utilities or between two wastewater disposal utilities or and between a water supply utility and a wastewater disposal utility. If necessary, communal and fiscal legislation have to be adapted to open the way for this strategic instrument. The key topic {{of this paper is to}} show possibilities for realizing synergies through cooperation in water and wastewater management on the example of the city Augsburg and the municipalities in the administrative districts Augsburg, Aichach-Friedberg, Donau-Ries and Dillingen.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the {{processes}} of Europeanisation and globalisation {{have resulted in a}} reduction of economic barriers between countries and an increasing pace of connectivity among them. For cross-border urban areas, facing increasing economic challenges and competition from large financial powerhouses such as London and Paris, ensuring cross-border economic integration has become a pivotal strategy. From the 1957 Rome Treaty, to current cohesion funds such as Interreg and legal cooperation mechanisms such as the EGTC, the EU has aimed to assist these areas in their challenges and ensure economic progress. The Greater Copenhagen Area, consisting of the cities of Copenhagen and Malmö and the Eurometropolis, comprising the cities of Lille, Kortrijk and Tournai, are two cross-border areas which have profited considerably from EU funding and have established various projects. Although both regions share many geographic and organisational similarities, their economic conditions and strategies differ considerably. While the Greater Copenhagen area has become a relatively developed area and established a <b>decentralised</b> <b>cooperation</b> structure based on Interreg funding, the Eurometropolis is defined by considerable local differences and, through the EGTC programme, has established a cross-border partnership of a legal nature. After several decades of EU regional financial assistance and increasing critical rhetoric towards EU policies, the thesis aimed at examing economic development in the Greater Copenhagen area and the Eurometropolis by focussing on two areas, namely infrastructure and mobility and employment. In the case of the former, the construction of the Oresund Bridge provided an opportunity for local authorities to enhance cooperation among local authorities and introduce new infrastructure projects. Further integration in Danish and Swedish employment markets was identified and aims to further enhance mobility between Copenhagen and Malmö. Development in the Eurometropolis in terms of mobility and employment has been significant, however, large infrastructure projects between the cross-border areas have not been realised, albeit the strong opportunities to do so. Considering the aforementioned developments, it is argued that EU influence has indeed provided for considerate economic development in both areas. Although progress in both infrastructure and mobility and employment has been indicated, the research has established as well challenges to further cross-border integration, some of which being a lack of national authorities to increase cross-border cooperation and their inability to fully advantage EU financial assistance...|$|E
