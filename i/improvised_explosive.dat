5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or <b>improvised</b> <b>explosive</b> device which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target.

During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E

Since being alerted for deployment, the brigade began conducting vigorous Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRE) training at Schofield Barracks. Among this training has been updated strategies for detection and clearance of <b>Improvised</b> <b>Explosive</b> Devices.

5|$|Chinook {{helicopters}} {{have been}} relied upon heavily {{to support the}} British forces in Afghanistan continuously {{since the start of}} the war in Afghanistan in 2001; Operation Snipe saw the helicopters used to assist the 1,000 British Commandos sweeping a region of southeathern Afghanistan. Due to the threat of <b>improvised</b> <b>explosive</b> devices (IEDs) scattered throughout the terrain by insurgents, transport helicopters have become highly valued and demanded units in this style of warfare. By April 2006 six Chinooks had been deployed by C-17 transport planes to Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan, in support of Operation Herrick. Two RAF Chinooks were lost in August 2009 during combat operations with the Taliban, one of which was brought down by enemy fire, in spite of warnings months before of Taliban plans to attack the helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Conversely {{almost any}} UAV could be piloted to crash onto a target in a suicide attack and most could be fitted with an <b>improvised</b> <b>explosive</b> warhead. However the primary {{use of a}} UAV or UCAV would be for {{recoverable}} flight operations carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with loitering in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving at the target potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, often have a unit cost that is not appropriate for regular one-time expandable mission use.|$|E

Among the dead were Aden Yabarow Wiish, who served as President of the Somali Olympic Committee, and Said Mohamed Nuir, Chief of the Somali Football Federation.

40|$|<b>Improvised</b> <b>explosives</b> may {{be based}} on {{smokeless}} gunpowder, fertilizers, or inorganic oxidizers such as nitrate (NO 3 -), chlorate (ClO 3 -), and perchlorate (ClO 4 -) salts. Identification is a priority for the military and law enforcement but due to their varying physical properties and complexity, identification can be challenging. Consequently, three methods {{have been developed to}} aid in presumptive and confirmatory detection. Smokeless powder contains plasticizers, stabilizers, dyes, opacifiers, flash suppressants, and other compounds. Identification of these additives can narrow down or identify the brands of smokeless powder used in a device. Fourteen organic smokeless powder components were identified by capillary electrochromatography (CEC) using a hexyl acrylate monolithic stationary phase coupled to UV detection and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS). The CEC-UV method efficiently detects all 14 organic components, while TOF-MS provides sensitivity and selectivity. A mixed smokeless powder component standard was analyzed and the composition of the additive package in commercial smokeless powders determined. Detection limits ranged from 1. 0 â€“ 3. 2 Î¼g/ml and analysis time was 18 minutes. Second, a procedure for the detection of urea nitrate (UN) and ammonium nitrate (AN) by infusion electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) was developed. Solubility tests were performed to find a solvent for both UN and AN that did not cause UN to dissociate. Two adduct ions were detected for each explosive: for AN, m/z 178 [2 AN+NH 4]+ and m/z 258 [3 AN+NH 4]+ ions, and for UN m/z 185 [UN+NO 3]âˆ’ and m/z 248 [UN+HNO 3 +NO 3]âˆ’. Specificity of the analysis was examined by mixing the explosives with various salts and interferents. Gas-phase adduct ions were useful in distinguishing between ion pairs and mixed salts. Finally, a paper microfluidic device (PMD) was developed as a presumptive test using colorimetric reagents for the detection of ions associated with <b>improvised</b> <b>explosives.</b> The device was configured to test for nitrate (NO 3 -), nitrite (NO 2 -), chlorate (ClO 3 -), perchlorate (ClO 4 -), and urea nitrate (UN). Proof of concept was performed using extracts of soil containing inorganic oxidizers. The development of these analytical methods allows the detection of smokeless powder components, fertilizers, and oxidizers and expands the suite of analytical methods available for the analysis of <b>improvised</b> <b>explosives...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Iraq War in Anbar Province, {{also known}} as the Al Anbar campaign, {{consisted}} of fighting between the United States military, together with Iraqi Government forces, and Sunni insurgents in the western Iraqi province of Al Anbar. The Iraq War lasted from 2003 to 2011, but the majority of the fighting and counterinsurgency campaign in Anbar took place between April 2004 and September 2007. Although the fighting initially featured heavy urban warfare primarily between insurgents and U.S. Marines, insurgents in later years focused on ambushing the American and Iraqi security forces with <b>improvised</b> <b>explosive</b> devices (IED's), large scale attacks on combat outposts, and car bombings. Almost 9,000 Iraqis and 1,335 Americans were killed in the campaign, many in the Euphrates River Valley and the Sunni Triangle around the cities of Fallujah and Ramadi.|$|E

50|$|The use of Colorimetric {{test kits}} for {{explosive}} detection {{is one of}} the oldest, simplest, and most widely used methods for the detection of explosives.

Where a change has not occurred between the two images, the pixels remain the same. When the pixels are different, a change has occurred.|$|R
