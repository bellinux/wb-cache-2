5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E
5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout {{and organization of}} <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, and courted their votes by attending meetings {{of gay and lesbian}} organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor Dianne Feinstein in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Brunei's {{stake in}} the {{ownership}} of the hotel drew controversy in April 2014 when he initiated {{the first phase of}} a three-phase plan to adapt Brunei's legal system to include aspects of Sharia law implicating his approval of the persecution of <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> complex legal system there (a two part system involving separate courts and legislation for Islamic and non-Islamic citizens). In protest, a United States national LGBT advocacy organization, the Gill Action Fund, canceled its reservation to hold a conference of major donors at the Beverly Hills Hotel and demanded a refund of its deposit. The hotel management responded by issuing a statement asserting that it does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Fashion designers Brian Atwood and Peter Som subsequently called for wider protests, urging the fashion industry to boycott all of the hotels owned by the Dorchester Collection.|$|E
25|$|In his 2006 book King and I: My Life with Graham Kennedy, {{published}} by celebrity agent Anthony Zammit, broadcaster Rob Astbury stated that Kennedy {{and he had}} been lovers. Kennedy is portrayed as <b>homosexual</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2007 biopic The King.|$|R

50|$|George Takei, {{who played}} Hikaru Sulu <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} Star Trek series, is openly <b>homosexual.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1960s {{when the show}} was airing, Takei's sexuality was considered an open secret by the Star Trek fanbase, as his sexuality was not explicitly acknowledged by fans and fellow Star Trek actors or producers, but Takei himself did actively take part in LGBT pride campaigns.|$|R
5|$|In 1937 Wilson {{settled for}} a while in the United States, {{teaching}} at the Curtis Institute of Music. He retired from singing and returned to the United Kingdom in 1942 where he began a second career as an administrator. He initially worked for the BBC, then after the war was appointed music director of the newly created Arts Council of Great Britain; in 1948 he was knighted for his services in that post. That same year he became the BBC's director of music, and infamously engineered the enforced retirement of the BBC Symphony Orchestra's chief conductor, Adrian Boult. The following year he became deputy general administrator of the Royal Opera House, in which post he secured the premiere staging of Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress in 1951. Unhappy with being subordinate to the Royal Opera's general administrator, David Webster, Wilson resigned from his post in June 1955 and started a campaign against <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> musical profession. Wilson ended his career as principal of the Birmingham School of Music, 1957–1960.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{representations}} of <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Japanese media tend towards caricature {{on the basis}} of stereotypes of sexual or behavioral deviance (e.g. the actually straight Hard Gay), there are several examples of transgender persons with popular celebrity status in Japan such as Haruna Ai. Support for LGBT rights has been expressed by corporate executives and Olympic athlete Dai Tamesue.|$|E
25|$|The {{park was}} known as a {{location}} for clandestine meetings of <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days before the decriminalization of homosexuality in Canada in the 1960s. Its reputation as a meeting place persisted for decades afterward. In 1985, a group of five young teenage boys from Toronto suburbs went to High Park and beat to death a 40-year-old male librarian.|$|E
5|$|Music {{critics have}} {{frequently}} commented on <b>the</b> recurring theme <b>in</b> Britten's operas from Peter Grimes onward of the isolated individual {{at odds with}} a hostile society. The extent to which this reflected Britten's perception of himself, pacifist and <b>homosexual,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> England of the 1930s, 40s and 50s is debated. Another recurrent theme is the corruption of innocence, most sharply seen <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Turn of the Screw.|$|R

25|$|On 4a Calle de la Paz, today Ezequiel Montes, one of {{the first}} raids against <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city took place in 1901, in which 41 men were detained. One of these men was the {{son-in-law}} of then-President Porfirio Díaz, but his case was dismissed. This event has associated the number 41 with homosexuality in Mexico, which has caused it not to be used in police and military designations to this day.|$|E
25|$|Francis Spellman, Cardinal Archbishop of New York (died 1967) {{was long}} {{rumored to have}} been gay, {{according}} to a book by John Cooney, who said that many whom he interviewed took his homosexuality for granted. In addition, a book published in 1998 claims that during World War II, Spellman was carrying on {{a relationship with a}} chorus boy in the Broadway revue One Touch of Venus. Spellman defended Senator Joseph McCarthy's 1953 investigations of subversives and <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> federal government.|$|E
25|$|This {{element of}} {{cognitive}} liberty {{has been raised}} {{in relation to a}} number of state-sanctioned interventions in individual cognition, from the mandatory psychiatric 'treatment' of <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US before the 1970s, to the non-consensual administration of psychoactive drugs to unwitting US citizens during CIA Project MKUltra, to the forcible administration of mind-altering drugs on individuals to make them competent to stand trial. Futurist and bioethicist George Dvorsky, Chair of the Board of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies has identified this element of cognitive liberty as being of relevance to the debate around the curing of autism spectrum conditions. Duke University School of Law Professor Nita Farahany has also proposed legislative protection of cognitive liberty as a way of safeguarding the protection from self-incrimination found in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, {{in the light of the}} increasing ability to access human memory.|$|E

500|$|Tyndall {{presented}} {{himself as an}} agnostic although expressed admiration for what he claimed were the moral values of Christianity. Tyndall called for a [...] "complete moral regeneration of the national life".

[...] He expressed the view that the NF [...] "was itself by no means immune to this sickening cult", and he disapproved of the presence of <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> party.

500|$|Next, Albert Goldman (then an English {{professor}} at Columbia University) and author and playwright Gore Vidal debated homosexuality, {{with an emphasis}} on the presence of <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creative arts. Goldman asserted that homosexuality [...] "is just one of a number of...things all tending toward the subversion, toward the final erosion, of our cultural values." [...] Vidal, asserting that homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality, countered by saying [...] "The United States is living out some mad Protestant nineteenth-century dream of human behavior....I think the so-called breaking of the moral fiber of this country is one of the healthiest things that's begun to happen." ...|$|E

While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. [...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd never seen anything like it. Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E
500|$|The United States {{military}} had a long-standing policy that service members {{found to be}} homosexual or to have engaged in homosexual conduct were to be court-martialed for sodomy, imprisoned and dishonorably discharged. However, with the mobilization of troops following the United States' entry into World War II, it became impractical to convene court-martial boards of commissioned officers and some commanders began issuing administrative discharges instead. Several waves of reform addressing the handling of <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military resulted in a 1944 policy directive that called for homosexuals {{to be committed to}} military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists, and discharged under Regulation 615-360, section 8 as [...] "unfit for service". It is unknown exactly how many gay and lesbian service members were given blue discharges under this regulation, but in 1946 the Army estimated that it had issued between 49,000 and 68,000 blue discharges, with approximately 5,000 of them issued to homosexuals, while the Navy's estimates [...] of blue-discharge homosexuals was around 4,000. The period of time covered by these estimates is unclear.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of a}} {{transition}} that included moving from Youngstown to Minneapolis to attend college at the University of Minnesota, Schiff shortened his name from the original Schiffhauer {{as a result of}} his parents' shame and refusal to acknowledge his sexuality in the small conservative town of Youngstown NY where the family attended church in a conservative Roman Catholic Parish (St. Bernard's, Youngstown, NY). [...] However, Robert and Rita Schiffhauer, Gary's parents, soon joined the PFLAG Chapter in nearby Buffalo, NY in order to understand and support their son which they continued to do throughout their lives. [...] Schiff's official public statement is that he shortened his name in an effort to move athe memories of bullying that he said made his youth [...] "an act of survival". In October 1992, he and six other students protested against the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and its compliance with a longstanding ban on <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military. The seven protesters interrupted a meeting of the University Board of Regents, demanded the expulsion of the ROTC from campus, and handcuffed themselves to the Regents' chairs. Wearing signs that read [...] "$old," [...] suggesting that their human rights had been traded for Federal grant money, Schiff and the six other students were arrested by University Police and each charged with misdemeanors.|$|E
25|$|Given the marginalized {{position}} of <b>homosexuals</b> <b>in</b> society, <b>the</b> metamessage that flows almost inevitably from excluding same-sex couples {{from such an}} important social institution is essentially that society considers such relationships to be less worthy of respect, concern and consideration than relationships involving members of the opposite sex.|$|R
