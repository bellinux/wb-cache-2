500|$|The male call can {{be heard}} {{at any time of}} day and {{consists}} of an unusual hissing-type sound, starting as a series of one-second sibilant bursts about a second apart repeated more rapidly until they become a constant hiss lasting 7–10s. Described as [...] "rp, rp, rp, rp, rrrrrp", the sound is produced when single muscular contractions click the tymbal inward, buckling 7–9 of the tymbal ribs, each of which produces a pulse. This occurs alternately on the two tymbals and is rapidly repeated at a frequency of about 143Hz (in groups of four except when the cicada is in distress– when they are ungrouped and at a lower frequency), giving a pulse repetition frequency of around 1050 per second, with a relatively broad sound frequency range of 7.5–10.5kHz, that has a <b>dominant</b> <b>frequency</b> (at which the peak energy is observed) of 9.5–9.6kHz.|$|E

2500|$|Communication {{is carried}} out with clicks, creaks, and buzzes at a <b>dominant</b> <b>frequency</b> of about 60kilohertz, which {{is thought to be}} used for echolocation. Bony fish and fish eggs, cephalopods, and {{crustaceans}} are taken as food. Observations of captive animals indicate food may be taken into the mouth by suction. Irrawaddy dolphins are capable of squirting streams of water that can reach up to 1.5 m; this distinct behavior has been known for herding fish into general area for hunting. They do this sometimes while spyhopping and during feeding, apparently to expel water ingested during fish capture or possibly to herd fish. Some Irrawaddy dolphins kept in captivity have been trained to do spyhopping on command. The Irrawaddy dolphin is a slow swimmer, but swimming speeds of [...] were reported when dolphins were being chased in a boat.|$|E
30|$|When {{a signal}} {{contains}} multiple <b>dominant</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the traditional TFPF cannot consider the different <b>dominant</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{at the same}} time, so the de-noising effect is poor.

40|$|To track {{evolution}} of autonomic responses during orthostasis {{in men and}} women, we used discrete pseudo-Wigner distribution based time-frequency analysis to compute <b>dominant</b> <b>frequencies</b> and spectral powers in RR intervals and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP). Data were collected from 38 healthy volunteers (22 men, 16 women) during 10 min supine posture followed by 30 min of 70 0 head up tilt. The RR intervals were computed from ECG and systolic blood pressure was and spectral amplitudes of RR intervals were integrated in two regions viz., Low Frequency (LF) region defined between 0. 05 - 0. 15 Hz and High Frequency region (HF), {{sometimes referred to as}} respiratory frequency region, defined as mean breathing frequency of the individual +/- one standard deviation. <b>Dominant</b> <b>frequencies</b> of RR intervals in the LF region decreased in both men and women. There {{were no significant differences between}} men and women as far as the SBP data were concerned for the <b>dominant</b> <b>frequencies,</b> however women had higher values than men. <b>Dominant</b> <b>frequencies</b> of RR intervals in the HF region increased both in men and women from supine to tilt.

2500|$|The {{continuation}} of Radio 4's rolling news {{service on the}} FM frequency has created friction at the BBC. [...] Radio news and current affairs have {{the backing of the}} deputy director-general John Birt to keep it running {{for the duration of the}} war. [...] But others see it as another example of empire-building by the expanding News and current affairs directorate. [...] And there is concern about other Radio 4 programmes which are now only being heard on poorer quality long wave. [...] Michael Green, controller of Radio, is resigned to being unable to reclaim FM until September (unless war ends sooner) when it becomes Radio 4's <b>dominant</b> <b>frequency.</b> [...] But, to reinforce the point that FM is not superseding his main service, most Radio 4 news and current affairs programs are banned from the FM schedule.|$|E

For practical considerations, the percentage of missing values was used at p=70% to determine if the spectrum could continue to capture the <b>dominant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Using a wider window length of m=600 and k=3 iterations, adaptively smoothed KZP algorithm was used to determine the spectrum for the simulated longitudinal dataset.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} difference {{schemes for}} systems of first order hyperbolic differential equations in two space dimensions, possessing the following characteristics: 1. The spatial discretizations are fourth order accurate. 2. The time discretization is of explicit Runge-Kutta type {{and is also}} fourth order accurate. 3. The scaled stability boundary is approximately 122. 4. The weights in the space discretizations and the Runge-Kutta parameters can be adapted {{in order to reduce}} the dispersion of dominant Fourier components. This method is illustrated by applying it to the shallow water equations simulating the motion of water in a shallow sea due to tidal forces. Since in such problems the <b>dominant</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the solution are known in advance, the method can take fully advantage of the possibility to tune the various parameters to these <b>dominant</b> <b>frequencies...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{richness}} {{of a sound}} or note a musical instrument produces is sometimes {{described in terms of}} a sum of a number of distinct frequencies. The lowest frequency is called the fundamental frequency, and the pitch it produces is used to name the note, but the fundamental frequency is not always the <b>dominant</b> <b>frequency.</b> The <b>dominant</b> <b>frequency</b> is the frequency that is most heard, and it is always a multiple of the fundamental frequency. For example, the <b>dominant</b> <b>frequency</b> for the transverse flute is double the fundamental frequency. Other significant frequencies are called overtones of the fundamental frequency, which may include harmonics and partials. Harmonics are whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency, such as ×2, ×3, ×4, etc. Partials are other overtones. There are also sometimes subharmonics at whole number divisions of the fundamental frequency. Most instruments produce harmonic sounds, but many instruments produce partials and inharmonic tones, such as cymbals and other indefinite-pitched instruments.|$|E
