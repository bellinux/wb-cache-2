In parallel, advanced forms ofinteractions are emerging such as tactile, mixed, tangible or spatial user interfaces, promoting ease of learning and use. To contribute to the democratization of 3 D Virtual Environments(3 DVE) and their use by persons who are not experts in 3 D and occasional users, simultaneously considering Computer Graphics and Human Computer Interaction design considerations is required. In this position paper, we first {{provide an overview of}} a new analytical framework for the design of advanced interaction techniques for 3 D Virtual Environment. It consists in identifying links that support the interaction and connect userâ€™s tasks to be performed in a 3 DVE with the targeted scene graph. We relate our work to existing modeling approaches and discuss about our expectations with regards to the engineering of advanced <b>interaction</b> <b>techniqu...</b>|$|E

Unlike others, our technique allows for seamless direct manipulation of both nearby objects and those at a distance. KEYWORDS Virtual reality, 3 D user interface, user interface metaphor. INTRODUCTION The human hand is an ideal direct manipulation input device for virtual reality (VR) [1]. Equipping the hand with a 6 degree-of-freedom sensor, such as the Polhemus Fastrak, we can map its position onto {{the position of a}} virtual hand in an immersive world and create the illusion that participants can touch, grasp and manipulate virtual objects using their own hands. This allows for natural and intuitive interaction with immersive worlds. However, using the hands as an input device imposes a significant constraint: users cannot interact directly with objects out of their reach [2]. We present a new <b>interaction</b> <b>techniqu</b> [...] ...|$|E

This consideration led the engineer to resolve the biological issues together with electronic and information disciplines and also advanced con trol, advanced technological materials and developed sensor systems. The subject has persuaded them to design solutions for problems related with living things and their environment. Bio - system engineering which has been developed for this purpose has beco me the application of technical knowledge aiming to fulfill the human requirements. The pursuit of bio - system engineering discipline are automation, new developed technologies, information technologies and human <b>interaction,</b> sensitive agriculture <b>techniqu</b> es, power and work machines, product technologies after harvest, structures and relation with environment, animal production technology, soil and water sources, rural development and planning. Bio - system engineering which covers such a wide area should re ach the solution by using its system engineering feature first and then determine the process parameters of the subjects that it resolves. Therefore it has to attribute the reason - result relation in every stage to quality parameters. Therefore, in this a nnouncement, the quality issues necessary for explaining the subjects dealt in bio - system engineering basis are examined {{one by one and}} solution models are created depending on these issues...|$|R
