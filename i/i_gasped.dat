5000|$|Despite her diverse {{literary}} interests, Blind remained {{devoted to}} poetry, {{as is evident}} in an 1869 letter to Richard Garnett: [...] "My only real intense life has been {{for a long time}} in writing, and when I cannot swim and float about in the enchanted waters of poetry I am like a fish out of water. <b>I</b> <b>gasp</b> and pant for want of the proper element to breathe in." [...] Blind's visits to Scotland in the 1870s and 1880s inspired two poems of considerable compass and ambition: the narrative poem [...] "The Prophecy of St. Oran" [...] (published in 1881, but written some years earlier) and [...] "The Heather on Fire" [...] (1886), a denunciation of the Highland clearances. Both are full of impassioned eloquence and energy, and [...] "The Prophecy" [...] in particular has an ample share of the quality Matthew Arnold called [...] "Celtic magic".|$|R
