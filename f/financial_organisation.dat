While the Cooperative has largely moved out of retail there is still a small bar which doubles as a live venue but otherwise it is now a <b>financial</b> <b>organisation</b> that cares for members' financial interests.|$|E
50|$|The {{primitive}} {{financial institutions}} of early England centred round the king's household. In other words, the royal preceded {{the national economy}} in importance. Revenue dues collected by the king's agents, rents, or rather returns of produce from land, and special levies for emergencies formed the main elements of the royal income which gradually acquired greater regularity and consistency. There is, however, little or no evidence of what modern governments recognise as <b>financial</b> <b>organisation</b> until the 11th century. The influence exercised from Normandy, which so powerfully affected the English rulers at this time, tended towards the creation of records of revenue claims {{as well as a}} central treasury.|$|E

An equal or larger amount was expended on the building of 500 parochial schools, and New College in Edinburgh for training clergy.

A spokesman, for the BBC responded: [...] "Although the BBC is funded by the UK government... a fundamental principle of its constitution and its regulatory regime is that it is editorially independent of the UK government." [...] Reports put the development in the context of criticism of the Russian government for curbing media freedom and strained UK-Russian relations. Reporters Without Borders condemned the move as censorship.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bad bank}} is a {{corporate}} structure to isolate illiquid and high risk assets {{held by a}} bank or a <b>financial</b> <b>organisation,</b> or perhaps a group of banks or financial organisations. A bank may accumulate a large portfolio of debts or other financial instruments which unexpectedly increase in risk, {{making it difficult for}} the bank to raise capital, for example through sales of bonds. In these circumstances, the bank may wish to segregate its [...] "good" [...] assets from its [...] "bad" [...] assets through the creation of a bad bank. The goal of the segregation is to allow investors to assess the bank's financial health with greater certainty. [...] A bad bank might be established by one bank or financial institution as part of a strategy to deal with a difficult financial situation, or by government or some other official institution as part of an official response to financial problems across a number of institutions in the financial sector.|$|E

40|$|<b>Financial</b> {{self-help}} <b>organisations</b> (SHOs) {{are often}} {{among the first}} private institutions identified as real or potential social security instruments. 1 For that, most studies refer to the obvious burial funds and other special purpose arrangements, but several also imply that a social security function {{can be attributed to}} the whole range of financial SHOs, in the sense that they supply lump sums that can be used for emergency payments. They are “a way of encouraging saving, and can be perceived as a form of social insurance ” (Van Ginneken, 1999 : 21). Still, there is a lack of detailed studies on how the social security function appears in practice. The host of examples where <b>financial</b> self-help <b>organisations</b> helped people to cope with adversities and deficiencies does not clarify whether this form of protection is equally available to all participants in all types of <b>financial</b> self-help <b>organisations.</b> Much remains unclear about how this dimension of <b>financial</b> self-help <b>organisations</b> is regulated, what kinds of problems emerge, and what their limitations are. 2 This chapter aims to investigate the social security function of <b>financial</b> self-help <b>organisations</b> in a concrete social setting. It shows that the <b>financial</b> self-help <b>organisations</b> examined here provide little direct protection against adversities and deficiencies. They can only be useful for this purpose if used in combination with other financial strategies, arrangements and institutions. Hence, the chapte...|$|R
