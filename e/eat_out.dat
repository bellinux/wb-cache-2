40|$|In our {{paper we}} examine the Western European and {{overseas}} trends of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> by analyzing relevant secondary data. Behind the increasing role of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> we can notice several economic social and value changes. One of the stressed factors is time, which has even changed food consuming habits. It is true both in national and international relations that consumers tend {{to rely on the}} services of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> increasingly to have more free time at their disposal. Consequently there is less and less time on food preparation and cooking so new eating trends are on their way. We assume international trends are also reflected in the domestic market of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> but in an altered form and their effect can be a bit delayed. Like on the level of food consuming preferences, dissonant trends also appear in <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> habits and, as a result the market is being further polarized. <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> leisure time, national trends, internatinal trends...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEating out is an {{emerging}} trend {{all over the}} world, especially now when eating in front of other people aren’t a taboo anymore. The popularization of this trend {{is evident from the}} beginning of the 90 s when the economies have gotten stronger, and since it has been growing. There are many forms of <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> and many locations where food can be consume away from our residence. This paper will be focusing on <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> during a vacation, when people are on holiday away from their home, and their residential city. The goal will be to stress the differences that exist between <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> at our hometown and <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> when in another city (or even more important abroad) on a vacation. To do so, we are going to introduce the reader to the meaning of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> and the locations where people can dine outside their home, focusing on the locations that are relevant for <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> on holidays. Then we are going to explain the basic behavior of people when consuming food during a vacation, focusing on the choices they make, the time when the food is consumed and so on. At the end we are going to make the difference between <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> on vacation and <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> in our hometown, so we can give some basic instructions to hospitality facilities owners on how to attract more people to dine at their facility...|$|R

This study examines how consumers' attitudes toward FAFH and their personal preferences influence their behavior of eating food away from home.

Empirical testing of consumers' FAFH behavior reveals several interesting and important findings. Results show that negative attitudes toward FAFH reduced consumers' frequency of <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> whereas the availability of healthy food, good service, and convenience in restaurants increased consumers' frequency of <b>eating</b> <b>out.</b> The policy implications of such study findings are discussed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} and assess actions {{by which the}} catering sector could be engaged in strategies for healthier <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> in Europe. DESIGN: A SWOT {{analysis was used to}} assess the participation of the catering sector in actions for healthier <b>eating</b> <b>out.</b> Caterers subsequently shortlisted essential actions to overcome threats and weaknesses the sector may face when engaging in implementing these actions. SETTING: Analysis undertaken in the European Union-supported HECTOR project on 'Eating Out: Habits, Determinants and Recommendations for Consumers and the European Catering Sector'. SUBJECTS: Thirty-eight participants from sixteen European countries reflecting a broad multi-stakeholder panel on <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> in Europe. RESULTS: The catering sector possesses strengths that allow direct involvement in health promotion strategies and could well capitalise on the opportunities offered. A focus on healthy eating may necessitate business re-orientations. The sector was perceived as being relatively weak in terms of its dependency on the supply of ingredients and lack of financial means, technical capacity, know-how and human resources. To foster participation in strategies for healthier <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> caterers noted that guidelines should be simple, food-based and tailored to local culture. The focus could be on seasonal foods, traditional options and alternative dishes rather than just on 'healthy eating'. Small-to-medium-sized enterprises have specific concerns and needs that should be considered in the implementation of such strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights a number of possible policy actions that could be instrumental in improving dietary intake in Europe through healthier <b>eating</b> <b>out...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Garfield's {{world has}} {{specific}} locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, {{a place he}} loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food {{is the center of}} most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often <b>eat</b> <b>out</b> at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon does take Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to. Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, [...] "I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts." ...|$|E
40|$|Avoiding food allergens when eating {{outside the}} home {{presents}} particular difficulties for food allergic (FA) and intolerant (FI) consumers {{and a lack of}} allergen information in restaurants and takeaways causes unnecessary restrictions. Across Europe, legislation effective from December 2014, aims to improve allergen information by requiring providers of non-prepacked foods to supply information related to allergen content within their foods. Using in-depth interviews with 60 FA/FI adults and 15 parents/carers of FA/FI children, we aimed to identify FA/FI consumers' preferences for written and/or verbal allergen information when <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> or ordering takeaway food. A complex and dynamic set of preferences and practices for written and verbal allergen information was identified. Overwhelmingly, written information was favoured in the first instance, but credible personal/verbal communication was highly valued and essential to a good <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> experience. Adequate written information facilitated implicit trust in subsequent verbal information. Where written information was limited, FA/FIs depended on social cues to assess the reliability of verbal information resources, and defaulted to tried and tested allergen avoidance strategies when these were deemed unreliable. Understanding the subtle negotiations and difficulties encountered by FA/FIs when <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> can serve as a guide for legislators and food providers; by encouraging provision of clear written and verbal allergen information, and training of proactive, allergen-aware staff. This, in tandem with legal requirements for allergen information provision, paves the way for FA/FIs to feel more confident in <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> choices; and to experience improved <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> experiences...|$|R
