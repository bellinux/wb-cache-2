He is stated to have sent many of his plays to Ladislav Stroupežnický (a famous Czech playwright) under his name and two pseudonyms, forming such a bundle of rejected works that Stroupežnický recalls they [...] "cost him 60 working days". He also encouraged Cimrman not to write to him and if possible [...] "not to write at all". After Cimrman replied on a familiar note, because they both studied at the same school, Stroupežnický never recovered.|$|E
40|$|This {{exposition}} accompanies twenty {{items of}} published materials submitted in partial fulfilment of the Ph. D. degree. It demonstrates {{the consistency of}} direction in my published contributions to the changes and developments in dance in education over a thirty year period. All the publications focus on content and methods of teaching dance and therefore address the perceived needs of teachers and students. A critical review of my work considers the relevance of my publications in this practical dance context. The evaluation of my role in developing and changing dance pedagogy takes account of the constant two way interaction between my reflective research in the practical dance context and the influences of : a) evolutionary developments in dance in education b) literature focused on content and methodologies for dance in education, and c) the <b>innovatory</b> <b>practices</b> of key teachers of dance. The exposition will show how these influences have affected my practice and publications. The overall aim of the exposition is to evaluate my publications as contributions to changes and developments {{in the practice of}} dance teaching. The exposition also aims to demonstrate the validity of my publications as responses to the wider problems and issues in dance in education prevalent from 1965 - 1996. The exposition is presented in four chapters. The introductory chapter identifies the main intentions and signals the practitioner bias of the study. Chapters 2 and 3 take a chronological path through the time span and evaluate my publications in relation to other publications which also focus _on content and methods of teaching dance in education. These chapters are prefaced with a chronological "map" to help the reader discern the interrelationships between the evolutionary developments, the writings of others and my publications. Chapter 4 is particularly concerned with evaluation of my main contributions to the changes and developments witnessed in dance teaching and learning in education during the period 1965 - 1996. Here, a consideration of the influence of key practitioners on my developing thinking and practice constitutes an important element in the evaluation of my contributions. The practitioner orientation of the exposition will possibly benefit from substantiation of my contributions in developments in dance in education beyond the submitted publications. To this end, the testimonials in Appendix 3 lend greater objectivity to the study...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the evolution of place-shaping over {{the past decade or so}} and its potential future direction, specifically relating to a UK context but with varying aspects of resonance internationally. The methodological approach and empirical originality is derived from practitioner encounters synthesised with theory. Three ‘waves’ of place-shaping are discernable: renaissance, recession mitigation and recovery. Conceptualising and examining the changing face of place-shaping practice, some broad place quality trends are identified. Asserting that renaissance interventions were heavily skewed towards enhancing the material aspects of city spaces it is suggested that recessions provide a useful interject to reflect on past practice, rethink future policies and sharpen skills. It is within such a climate that <b>innovatory</b> <b>practice</b> can flourish as (public, private and community) actors are challenged to seek alternative ways of working. Questioning the wisdom of cuts in quality, the paper calls for new ways of capturing place quality...|$|R
40|$|This {{article will}} {{consider}} the formative effect of boundaries between activities in directing and deflecting the attention of actors who are seeking to develop <b>innovatory</b> <b>practice</b> at these boundaries. Specific attention will be directed to practices of communication at these boundaries and also {{to the way in}} which these boundaries shape the practices of communication themselves. The concept of boundary strength will be developed and discussed. Its utility will be illustrated through reference to an investigation of the consequences of 3 very different examples of attempts at boundary crossing as Local Authorities in England attempt to develop integrated Children's Services from traditional collections of single service agencies (e. g., Education, Health, Social Services). The data will be drawn from a 4 year study of professional learning in and for interagency working directed by the authors and funded within the UK Economic and Social Research Council's Teaching and Learning Research Programme...|$|R
40|$|Blacksmithing has {{undergone}} a dramatic transformation in the last twenty five years. This study examines the changes and the context within which they have taken place. The effects upon {{the products of the}} blacksmith are considered through empirical research and practical work. The working methods and philosophies of blacksmiths representative of a continuity of traditions and <b>innovatory</b> <b>practice</b> are investigated through interviews and other approaches. From its origins as a rural and industrial craft, blacksmithing has emerged in the form of art-blacksmithing. Institutional and government intervention, new technologies and markets provide {{the context in which the}} ideologies and practices are examined. It is argued that these new blacksmiths are selfconscious designer-makers who are technically innovative, and commercially aware, operating successfully between and within the cultural and commercial arenas. In combining practical and decorative functionalism, and producing site-specific art work at a competitive price, artist blacksmiths successfully inhabit the worlds of art, industry, trade and craft, often simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} current training and employment opportunities for disabled people in Britain {{against a background}} of institutionalised discrimination within society. It attempts to identify examples of good <b>innovatory</b> <b>practice</b> funded by Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England in order to establish the extent to which training and employment opportunities are responsive to the needs of disabled people. It considers the current position of disabled people in society and work and the effects of reduced budgets and recent legislation on their training and employment opportunities. By surveying TEC programmes and analysing their qualities, common features of innovation are extracted. A detailed description of a particular project and the innovative methods used to combat traditional barriers and attitudes stemming from a medical perspective of disability forms a substantial part of the dissertation. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of the project and the implications for society of ensuring equal opportunity for all within training and employment...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a decade}} of {{independent}} academic research studies, official government audits and industrial reports and anecdotes now provide substantive evidence that main information and communication technology [ICT] systems either completely fail or more commonly do not provide their originally stated benefits to individuals, groups or organizations. Many of these findings point to a significant lack of emphasis in dealing with complex organizational factors associated with major ICT adoption. Typically, most of the analytical planning and resource emphasis is directed towards the technical and strategic aspects of the information systems design, development [or procurement], implementation and use. This paper will argue that much greater emphasis must be placed on developing the domain of organizational analysis to better understand ICT implementation issues concerned with structure, social and historical context, power, politics and culture. A previous paper [Wainwright and Waring, 2004] proposed a strategic model incorporating three analytical domains [technology, strategy and organisation] for managing the implementation of integrated information systems. This paper further develops this model by exploring the organizational domain in greater depth in order to surface elements concerning structural, social/historical, power/political and cultural issues which may impact the outcome of any ICT adoption. Some candidate organizational analysis methods are identified and then {{discussed in terms of}} their potential as a means to address complex organizational problems associated with technically dominated approaches to ICT adoption. The paper concludes with a call for more honesty, integrity and <b>innovatory</b> <b>practice</b> within organizations to provide more transparency for critical organizational problems and issues {{that need to be addressed}} prior to, during and after ICT adoption...|$|R

Responses to {{environmental}} and socio-economic {{changes in the}} Karangwangi traditional agroforestry system, South Cianjur, West Java. Biodiversitas 17 : 332 - 341. In the past, the swidden agriculture system (huma) was dominant in village frontiers of West Java; including in the Karangwangi Village of Cidaun Sub-district, Cianjur District, West Java Province. Culturally, each Karangwangi household owned a right to cultivate upland rice (huma) by felling mature forest (leuweung). Moreover, the land was planted by upland rice and other annual crops, such as corn, cassava, cucumber, and various beans. After harvesting rice and other annual crops, the land was fallowed and transformed into secondary forest (reuma) through natural succession. Moreover, the mature secondary forest (reuma kolot) could be opened for rice planting again {{in the following year}} or fallowed for more than 3 - 5 years. People will shift to another piece of mature secondary forest for rice planting. Today, because of increasing population, decreasing forests, and increasing market economic penetration, the Karangwangi people have predominantly practiced the swidden farming in the non-forest instead of the forest. The forests had culturally been converted to traditional agroforestry systems, such as mixed-garden (kebon tatangkalan), and homegarden (pekarangan). This paper discusses the process of evolution of the swidden farming and <b>innovatory</b> cultural <b>practice</b> among the Karangwangi community, South Cianjur, West Java, in management of th...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we report some of the {{outcomes}} of a study of professional learning {{that took place in}} cross school partnerships as they worked towards promoting creativity in schools. The methodology developed by Engestroumlm and his colleagues at The Centre for Developmental Work Research in Helsinki was adopted. This form of intervention involves the preparation and facilitation of workshops in which the underlying structural contradictions that are in play in emergent activities are highlighted and articulated {{in such a way that}} participants may engage with what may otherwise remain hidden and unexamined tensions. This approach is based on the writings of the early 20 th-century Russian school of social scientists—Vygotsky, Luria and Leontiev. A principal claim is that the development of creativity requires tools and contexts for such <b>innovatory</b> forms of <b>practice.</b> This study suggests that this claim is a partial representation of the development of creative activity...|$|R
40|$|Constructing a {{particular}} nation, that of early modern England, is seen {{here as a}} series of theatrical performances. Shakespeare's work is taken {{as a series of}} thought experiments. Some, like The Merchant of Venice, are reassuring that threatening circumstances and <b>innovatory</b> social <b>practices</b> are capable of being overcome or assimilated from the unknown to the known. Some, like King Lear and Hamlet, ponder the consequences of a failure to discover a resolution. Some writers have argued that England was historically quite early in beginning to conceive of itself as a nation, rather than as a population of possibly heterogeneous regions subject to a dynasty, a state of affairs summarized in the by now clich餠remark attributed to the Sun King, "L'Etat, c'est moi". For Shakespeare, if not for all of his contemporaries, the Englishman is a bit slow-witted, owing to his fondness for beef and red wine, but he is distinguishable from others and provides material for the second pieces of theater I look at. If there could be an Englishman, his experience with the absolutist pretensions of the Stuart monarchy allowed there to be a free-born Englishman (and, actually, Englishwoman). The two crucial battles of the English civil war, Marston Moor and Naseby, followed by the Army Debates of 1647 - 1649 form the stage for an at least aspiring egalitarianism we now know as the rights of man, or the rights of the civic person.

Implications for clinical practice, education and research] Prof. dr. Michel Probst KU Leuven, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy & UPC-KU Leuven, campus Kortenberg, Belgium Michel. probst@faber. kuleuven. be The field {{of mental health}} is currently an important policy issue. Different organisations are engaged in the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders. Today, {{one out of four}} people are faced with a mental dysfunction. Physiotherapy is a relative new but fast developing field in the area of mental health. The past ten years physiotherapists developed a range of clinical measures and treatment approaches to establish their role in mental health. Currently, there is sufficient evidence that physiotherapy, has a major contribution to wellbeing. In mental health care, physiotherapists are focused on the bio-psycho-social facets of the ‘body in action’. This bodily-directed approach is important as pain and other somatic and psychologic complaints are recurrent complaints. Exercise, body awareness and relaxation are import issues in the treatment and rehabilitation process. Physiotherapists are in the unique position to provide physical approaches that aim at symptom relief, confidence boosting and improvement of quality of life. This presentation wants to reach anchor points for professionalizing physiotherapy in mental health. More concrete, the recommendations of the declaration of the WHO (2005) have to be implemented as a guideline for the future. If physiotherapists want to be successful as one of the mental health services, it is a condition to develop high quality and <b>innovatory</b> clinical <b>practice,</b> education, research. These recommendations translated into the field of physiotherapy in mental health are for the clinical practice, education and research respectively: Physiotherapists have (1) to improve physiotherapy mental health care and (2) organize specific physiotherapy care for different ages.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of research and}} documentation in Psychiatric Physiotherapy Michel Probst KU Leuven, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences & UPC-KU Leuven, campus Kortenberg, Belgium Michel. probst@faber. kuleuven. be The field of mental health is currently an import policy issue. The World Health Organisation (WHO), the European commission, and different national governments are engaged in the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders. Today, {{one out of four}} people are faced with a mental dysfunction. Physiotherapy is a relative new, small, but fast developing field in both the clinical and scientific area of mental health. The past ten years physiotherapists developed a wide range of clinical measures and treatment approaches to establish the role of physiotherapy in mental health. Currently there is sufficient evidence that physiotherapy, with his specific approach and therapeutic interventions, has a major contribution to wellbeing and mental health. In mental health care, physiotherapists are focused on the biospsychosocial facets of the ‘body in action’. This bodily-directed approach is important within a psychiatric setting as pain and other somatic complaints are recurrent complaints in mental health disorders like depression, anxiety and posttraumatic disorders. Exercise, body awareness and relaxation are import issues in the treatment and rehabilitation process of these disorders. Physiotherapists are in the unique position to provide an extensive range physical approached that aim at symptom relief, confidence boosting and improvement of quality of life. If physiotherapists want to be successful as one of the mental health services, it is a condition sine qua non to further develop high quality and <b>innovatory</b> clinical <b>practice,</b> education, research in agreement with the recommendations of the declaration of the WHO in 2005. These recommendations translated into the field of physiotherapy are for the clinical practice, education and research respectively: -	Physiotherapists have (1) to improve physiotherapy mental health care and (2) organize specific physiotherapy care for different ages including children, adolescents and elderly and risk-related groups as persons with eating disorders, psychotic disorders,… Physiotherapists have (3) to ensure access to primary care for people with mental health problems and (4) provide treatment in 'community-based physiotherapy services for persons with severe mental health problems. -	In general, physiotherapy schools have (5) to disseminate quality information about mental health and (6) to promote mental health, because mental health and wellbeing are fundamental to {{the quality of life of}} all citizens.
