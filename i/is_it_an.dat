500|$|A {{great deal}} of the plot in [...] "Time Capsule" [...] {{revolves}} around the Twilight series of novels and films. The popular book series was written by Stephenie Meyer. At one point, while trying to persuade Leslie to include Twilight in the capsule, Kelly Larson begins telling the entire story of the Twilight series, including Meyer's birth and life story and shot-for-shot descriptions of the film adaptations. The stories are told from the perspective of high school student and outsider Bella Swan, who is pursued romantically by a vampire named Edward Cullen and a werewolf named Jacob Black. Elements of the story are raised in various scenes of [...] "Time Capsule", including when Tom tries to ask Lucy why she broke up with him: [...] "Is it because I'm not cool enough, like the normal kids compared to the vampires? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> Edward-Bella-Jacob type situation, where you like me but there's someone else you like more?" [...] Leslie claims to favor Harry Potter, the popular fantasy series by author J.K. Rowling, over Twilight.

500|$|Having {{spent almost}} two years working on the novel, Cleave decided upon using the dual narrative, as: [...] "This {{is a story of}} two worlds: the {{developed}} and the developing, and of the mutual incomprehension that sometimes dooms them to antagonism." [...] He found it technically challenging to write from a female perspective, but felt that it prevented him from unwittingly using his own voice to animate the characters, explaining: [...] "It forces me to listen, to think, and to write more precisely." [...] Kaminski accused Cleave of cultural appropriation, asking rhetorically: [...] "When a white male author writes as a young Nigerian girl, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> act of empathy, or identity theft?" [...] Cleave has responded by stating that he sympathises with those who feel he has no right to write {{from the perspective of a}} Nigerian girl, but feels that he does it well. He believes that the best mechanism for telling a story about crossing borderlines is to depict both sides. He conducted interviews with actual asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, a psychiatrist specialising in the trauma of child refugees, and members of London's Nigerian community, researching speech patterns to shape the [...] "quirks and cadences" [...] of Little Bee's narrative voice.|$|E
500|$|Fox {{issued a}} press release on January 11 {{previewing}} the episode's plot.

[...] As the press release purposely alluded to whether the episode was indeed originally {{part of the first}} season or from the parallel universe, one critic wrote that [...] "FOX [...] having fun with the fact that Fringe has alternate universes" [...] and that readers of the press release should [...] "take this with a grain of salt". According to Fox's media site, [...] "Unearthed" [...] was listed as the 21st episode of season one, despite its broadcast during the second season and inclusion in that season's DVD release as a special feature. Though one character had been killed off earlier in the second season, a former series regular appeared in the episode, sparking confusion among some viewers. As the broadcasting change went unexplained at the time, one media outlet speculated it was a marketing ploy on the network's part, believing the episode title was [...] "more than a stunning coincidence" [...] and that it was a reference to co-creator J.J.

2500|$|Stung by the criticism, Gwynn {{was miserable}} {{the rest of}} the season and became {{withdrawn}} and distrustful among his teammates. Conscious of being perceived as selfish, he altered his hitting style by attempting to pull the ball to move runners in situations where he would normally hit to the opposite field. Rumors that he might be traded affected his play. In September, Gwynn was upset when a figurine of his likeness was hanging in effigy in the Padres' dugout, and race became an issue due to the undercurrent of lynchings being evoked with Gwynn being black and Clark being white. The Padres said a groundskeeper was responsible, but Gwynn believed it was a cover-up. Clark denied any involvement. After breaking his right index finger mid-month in Atlanta while trying to make a catch at the wall, Gwynn missed the final 19 games of the season. He left the team for the season to avoid contact with the media and teammates. He was further upset that neither management nor other teammates came to his defense at the time. He later regretted saying he wanted to avoid his teammates in general instead of being more specific which ones he was referring to. [...] "It just involved one great guy, and that's Tony Gwynn, and anything they want to say about Tony Gwynn is going to be news. It got all blown out of proportion", Carter said. Gwynn countered, [...] "I've been doing the same things my whole career, playing the same way. Now, why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> issue? Because Jack Clark says it is." [...] Gwynn finished the season batting [...]309, ranking sixth in the league but the lowest average of any full season in his career; he had entered the season with a [...]332 career average. However, his 72RBI that season were a then-career high. He also began experiencing soreness and swelling in his left knee. The cartilage under his kneecap was wearing out, which doctors attributed to his playing basketball and baseball year-round for seven years from high school through college.|$|E
