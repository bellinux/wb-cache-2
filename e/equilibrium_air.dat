40|$|Recently {{developed}} second-order explicit shock-capturing methods, {{in conjunction}} with generalized flux-vector splittings, and a generalized approximate Riemann solver for a real gas are studied. The comparisons are made on different one-dimensional Riemann (shock-tube) problems for <b>equilibrium</b> <b>air</b> with various ranges of Mach numbers, densities and pressures. Six different Riemann problems are considered. These tests provide {{a check on the}} validity of the generalized formulas, since theoretical prediction of their properties appears to be difficult because of the non-analytical form of the state equation. The numerical results in the supersonic and low-hypersonic regimes indicate that these produce good shock-capturing capability and that the shock resolution is only slightly affected by the state equation of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>air.</b> The difference in shock resolution between the various methods varies slightly from one Riemann problem to the other, but the overall accuracy is very similar. For the one-dimensional case, the relative efficiency in terms of operation count for the different methods is within 30 %.
