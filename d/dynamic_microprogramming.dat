40|$|Some {{possibilities}} {{offered by}} microprogramming in {{the realization of}} computer systems implemented according to several architectures are investigated in this paper. The serial and the classical parallel (SISD, SIMD, multiprocessors) organizations are considered together with some approaches to the realization of modern distributed systems (local networks, Logic Machines, Configurable Computers). The microprogramming possibilities are examined by {{taking into account the}} type of microinstruction encoding (vertical vs. horizontal), the opportunity for <b>dynamic</b> <b>microprogramming</b> and the Control Part-Operation Part model, and by evaluating the influence of these factors on the optimization of some design parameters...|$|E
40|$|Various {{methods have}} been used in the past to {{implement}} the control structures of digital computers. Microprogramming is regarded as the most versatile approach to this end. It reduces the complexity and increases the flexibility of the control unit. Furthermore, <b>dynamic</b> <b>microprogramming</b> allows modification or reconstruction of the system architecture as viewed at the machine language level; such a system can be based on the "emulation" concept which utilizes microprogramming techniques to interpret various system architectures at the machine language level. A study of the process of emulation {{is the subject of this}} thesis. The thesis describes the main features of both the target and the host systems that affect the emulation process. The principles underlying the design of an emulator are also discussed. For this purpose, a Data General NOVA system has been emulated on the MICRODATA 1600 and evaluated. The thesis concludes with some recommendations for further work...|$|E
