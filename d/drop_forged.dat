2500|$|Tinner's snips, {{also known}} as tinner snips or tin snips, {{are one of the}} most popular type of snips. They are defined by their long handles and short blades.

Duckbill-pattern snips, {{also known as}} trojan-pattern snips, have blades that taper down from the pivot to the tip of the blades. The blade edges are also bevelled to more easily cut curves and circles or shapes. They are a lighter duty snip that can only cut up to 25 gauge mild steel.|$|E

The reciprocating assembly included a cast or forged steel crankshaft, <b>drop</b> <b>forged</b> steel connecting rods and cast aluminum pistons. The valvetrain consisted of a cast nodular iron camshaft, solid or hydraulic lifters, solid pushrods and shaft-mounted, malleable iron rocker arms (stamped steel on later hydraulic-cam engines).

40|$|In <b>drop</b> <b>forging,</b> {{the main}} {{requirements}} consist {{in the production}} of workpieces with pronounced straight or curved main axis while simultaneously maintaining a large variety of forms. The main customer of these drop-forged pieces is the vehicle manufacturing industry with dynamically high-stressed parts used for drives and undercarriages. The optimization of processes and systems for continuous forging process sequences for oblong workpieces with high dimensional and weight accuracies is represented in the form of realized process solutions. Focus is placed on the possible linking of cross-rolling on round- and flat-jaw cross-rolling machines as preforming and finished forming during the production of drop-forged parts and in the optimization of tool technology for the processing steps of <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> on hammers and presses. Selected application cases are the production of vehicle gear shafts by cross-rolling, the low-flash <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> of accurately weighted connecting rods and the opt imization of intermediate forms for <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> light metals by means of cross-rolling.
