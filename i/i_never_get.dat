500|$|Smith {{starred in}} {{and served as}} {{executive}} producer for the independent romantic comedy Waiting for Ophelia, which was released in 2009. She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003. She said: [...] "I loved it. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> to play parts like that. I always play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me." [...] Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she [...] "believe in this project, and my expectations have already been fulfilled by making the movie", and added: [...] "You can support art even if it's {{not going to make}} a zillion dollars." [...] It premiered on April 4, 2009 at the Phoenix Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{really love}} Holby and I'm {{surprised}} how much. What thrills me about Holby {{is that you}} get back what you put in. The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning up and saying the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E

500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually when you say 'no,' they hold it against you for the rest of your career. I've experienced that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Freaked, {{an arrogant}} movie star {{who has been}} {{transformed}} into a [...] "hideous mutant freak" [...] makes use of his deformity by performing the opening soliloquy, condensed by a local professor in subtitles for the [...] "culturally illiterate" [...] to the more succinct [...] "I'm ugly. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> laid." [...] One reviewer mentioned this as the best example of how the film seamlessly moves between highbrow and lowbrow culture.|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything". And so I {{have a list of}} questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, [...] "Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." [...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E

2500|$|On August 11, 1999, Greenlee Smythe {{made her}} debut. After winning the role, Budig further {{explained}} {{her interest in}} the part and her early portrayal of the character: [...] "This was a recurring role," [...] she stated. [...] "I didn't {{have to go in}} and test [...] the process proceeded swiftly." [...] Judy [...] told me that Greenlee was a bad girl who comes to Pine Valley and causes trouble. It was the summer; I figured there wasn't going to be anything going on in L.A. [...] why not go back to New York? Plus, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> to play the bad girl and delve into the dark side. I'm always playing the good girl. It's been exciting because the role has really come to fruition these past three months. Her dad's a drunk, her mother pays no attention to her, she lives with her grandmother [...] she's pathetically desperate, kind of like me. I'm kidding. I love her name; it's so debutante. I think she's {{going to continue to be}} a spoiler.|$|E
2500|$|American R singer-songwriter Ne-Yo {{was also}} {{involved}} in the album and wrote three songs which were produced by StarGate. When describing the process of working with him, Rowland said, [...] "Ne-Yo asked me what I wanted to talk about, and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'." [...] The first of these records, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off", was originally {{intended to be a}} single in the US. It is an [...] "up-tempo" [...] and fun record with lyrics such as [...] "Its like a job I that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> a break from/because haters never take a vacation." [...] Another collaboration titled [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] (later changed to [...] "Grown Woman") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim [...] "I'm grown!". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on [...] "Grown [...] Woman" [...] Rowland digs [...] "through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come yet how 'Grown and silly' she still is." [...] It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, [...] "Heaven and Earth", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a [...] "sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'." [...] According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from [...] "Heaven and Earth", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition.|$|E
