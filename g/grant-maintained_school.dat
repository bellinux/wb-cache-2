And admission is open to every child in Southwark irrespective of money or who their parents are". In fact, no child in Southwark was eligible to apply for admission to St. Olave's Grammar School, places were solely awarded based on academic ability and only to children from the London Borough of Bromley. No other children from her son's class or school went to St. Olave's that year or any other year. Neither did her son have to pass the entrance exam taken by all other pupils.|$|E

5000|$|... ‘Opting for Freedom: a {{stronger}} policy on grant-maintained schools’, Policy Study No 138, Centre for Policy Studies, 1994. This trenchant policy study arguably represents Brian Sherratt at his most influential {{in shaping the}} views of policy makers. He argued that, whereas the <b>grant-maintained</b> <b>schools</b> policy offered schools the chance of freedom from LEA control, the government's own hesitations over the policy were being exploited {{by members of the}} interest groups - heads, bureaucrats, and officials - whose present careers and future ambitions depended on the LEA system. The procedure for becoming grant-maintained had been allowed to develop into an obstacle course, while imposed central restrictions (such as the National Curriculum) meant that grant-maintained status in fact offered limited independence. Sherratt argued that government should aim to make all <b>schools</b> <b>grant-maintained</b> (i.e. independent of LEA control) as a matter of general policy, and that it should loosen the constraints placed on <b>grant-maintained</b> <b>schools</b> so as to make diversity and choice in education a reality.|$|R
