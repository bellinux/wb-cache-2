It draws on an ethnographic study with focus on an analysis of Individual Educational Plans and the dialogues connected to these plans. The result shows that documentation is not neutral; rather it is a way of creating reality or, as Foucault puts it, a “production of truth”. Although documentation can be seen as a tool for control, it can also be used as means of resistance. This article therefore seeks to contribute tothe understanding of the role of documentation practices in situationswhere parents and pupils are expected to have substantial influence...|$|E
40|$|Gallbladder {{diseases}} are {{very common in}} developed countries. Complicated gallstone disease represents the most frequent of biliary disorders for which surgery is regularly advocated. As regards, cholecystectomy represents a common abdominal surgical intervention; it can be performed as either an elective intervention or emergency surgery, {{in the case of}} gangrene, perforation, peritonitis or sepsis. Nowadays, the laparoscopic approach is preferred over open laparotomy. Globally, numerous cholecystectomies are performed daily; however, little evidence exists regarding assessment of post-surgical quality of life (QOL) following these interventions. To assess post-cholecystectomy QOL, in <b>fact,</b> <b>documentation</b> of high quality care has been subject to extended discussions, and the use of patient-reported outcome satisfaction for quality improvement has been advocated for several years. However, there has been little research published regarding QOL outcomes following cholecystectomy; in addition, much of the current literature lacks systematic data on patient-centered outcomes. Then, although several tools have been used to measure QOL after cholecystectomy, difficulty remains in selecting meaningful parameters in order to obtain reproducible data to reflect postoperative QOL. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the impact of surgery for gallbladder diseases on QOL. This review includes Medline searches of current literature on QOL following cholecystectomy. Most studies demonstrated that symptomatic patients profited more from surgery than patients receiving an elective intervention. Thus, the gain in QOL depends on the general conditions before surgery, and patients without symptoms profit less or may even have a reduction in QOL...|$|E

40|$|Software {{documentation}} is {{an important}} aspect of both software projects and software engineering in general. In <b>fact,</b> <b>documentation</b> engineering has become a popular sub-domain in the software engineering community. Unfortunately, the current perception of documentation is that it is outdated, irrelevant and incomplete. For the most part, this perception is probably true. Regrettably, the documentation concern cannot be resolved by simply mandating more and better documentation. This approach fails to resolve the problem as the solution ignores the fundamental goals of software engineering. The role of documentation in a software engineering environment is to communicate information to its audience and instill knowledge of the system it describes. Documentation should efficiently allow for future software development without hindering current progress. An engineered solution to the documentation problem would involve allocating appropriate resources to document adequate knowledge about the system to the extent that both current and future development will optimally benefit. Unfortunately, neither do we fully understand the impact of documentation on current or future development, nor what aspects of documentation contribute to its ability to communicate effectively. We do not really know to what extent we should document in order to balance the trade offs between, on the one hand, allocating too many resources for documentation thus hindering present development; and, on the other hand, not allocating enough resources and thus hindering future development. To complicate matters, increasing documentation resources does not necessarily improve future software development (the ultimate goal of documentation) because we do not really understand what defines documentation quality. Our research focuses on the issue of documentation quality. In particular, which attributes of documentation make it effective to the audience and how can this information be monitored and parameterized to provide a better perspective about the relevance of documentation in a software project...|$|E

In addition to qualitative interviews we have accomplished a survey study that included 178 school welfare officers throughout the country.

Even on those occasions when documentation is an obligation, they have an opportunity to choose how much they should expose the pupil. The study also shows on an uncertainty as regard to record in general and where the written words end up in particular. The school welfare officer seems to be comfortable in his/her free role, but still want some sort of guidelines to enhance the pupil’s equal rights.

There are no surviving muster rolls for the regiment; in <b>fact</b> the only <b>documentation</b> that exists for the unit is a list of prisoners captured on October 24, 1864, at Mound City, Kansas, during Price's Raid. Since General Sterling Price generally referred to his units by the name of the unit commander, the reports from Price's raid rarely contain the numerical designation of the unit. Because the names of the other 40 series regimental commanders are known, some historians have speculated that the 48th may have been the numerical designation of Colonel Charles H. Carlton's regiment. Like the other 40 series regiments, Carlton's regiment was raised in the summer of 1864. The only numerical designation known {{to be associated with the}} Carlton's regiment is the 28th Arkansas Cavalry. Another 40 series regiment, Colonel James H.

50|$|The Solomonic dynasty, {{formerly}} sovereign in Ethiopia, {{has long}} claimed descent from King Solomon of the Kingdom of Israel. For {{all of its}} circumstantial evidence, the well known claim is nonetheless unverifiable due to the <b>fact</b> that reliable <b>documentation</b> is lacking before the 13th century. Outside of this case in particular, similar oral traditions of various descents from antiquity exist in nations and amongst peoples {{from all over the}} continent. Amongst the Yorubas of West Africa, for example, there is a popular belief that the numerous members of the tribe are all descendants of Oduduwa, their semi-mythical emperor and founding father, who is believed to have reigned in the 11th century. Contemporary social status in their various kingdoms, therefore, is traditionally reckoned by what can be described as tanistry: If a person can claim to be a direct descendant of the emperor through the lines of his progeny (i.e. his children and grandchildren) as opposed to being an indirect one through those of his more distant relatives, then he or she is probably a dynastic member of one of the royal or high noble families within the contemporary Yoruba chieftaincy system. As with the aforementioned claim by the Ethiopians, however, genealogical verification is generally difficult in these cases due to an absence of written corroboration.|$|R

Yet it {{remains one of the}} greatest challenges when studying all but the few well-established model systems. The challenge is in part {{due to the fact that}} most species have yet to be described, vanishing taxonomic expertise and the relative inaccessibility of taxonomic information. Furthermore, identification keys and other taxonomic resources are based on complex, taxon-specific vocabularies used to describe important morphological characters.

Illustrations, photographs and translations have been sourced from the global community of taxonomists working with marine invertebrates and seaweeds. These can be used as single-language illustrated glossaries or to make customized translation tables. The glossary has been launched with terms and illustrations of seaweeds, tunicates, sponges, hydrozoans, sea anemones, and nemerteans, and already includes translations into seven languages for some groups.

Although many researches on Malay cultural artefacts in Malaysia, none of these documents has extensive information on sustainable user aesthetic experience knowledge. In <b>fact,</b> much <b>documentation</b> lingers on certain popular artefacts that typically known in Malay cultural design environment. Consequently, narrow understanding in local designers on Malay applied artefact due no rigorous research and limited documentation employing the design and the human science in user experience. This research shows that this knowledge comprehension can be expanded to higher level in both contexts of tangible and intangible for a new paradigm of Malay cultural product design. The {{purpose of this study}} is to systematize design-user interrelationship through aesthetic experience assessment on Malay Lawi Ayam (LA) artefact as a case study for establishing the Malay cultural product design knowledge. This study employed literature review and analytical observation on Malay Lawi Ayam weapon to document the characteristic of physical design and intangible knowledge for syntactic analysis. Then, this study conducted full participant observation and semi-structured interview to comprehend the aesthetic experience (AE) of the weapon user through pragmatic analysis and artefact usability evaluation. Finally, the study further undertook eye tracking test to investigate the eye behavioural responses and cognitive feedback in user pre-existent AE experience towards Malay Lawi Ayam design evaluation to amalgamate the knowledge between the artefact context (syntactic dimension) and the user context (pragmatic dimension). Drawing on Petersen’s methodology (2004) and Locher’s approach (2010) in relation to aesthetic interaction, the findings from the data analysis would include the; 1) design characteristic (physical and non-physical) and artefact terminology as factor that affects artefact effectiveness, 2) pragmatic knowledge and artefact usability of Malay Lawi Ayam user to understand the artefact usage through the body movement efficiency, and 3) cognitive knowledge from eye tracking evaluation to support the understanding of users’ eye behaviour on artefact design preference. These result expected to be a pioneer approach for Malay cultural product (MCD) knowledge preservation to assist the development of design in a new environment purposes. This research will present the literature on Malay Lawi Ayam, Aesthetic Experience, and design-user interaction. Then, the research methodology describes a comprehensive data acquisition strategy before presenting the expected results. This study contributes in; 1) Artefact classification knowledge of Malay Lawi Ayam from the comprehension on design characteristic, terminology and intangible knowledge (design philosophy), 2) Aesthetic experience knowledge through the understanding of artefact typology of Malay Lawi Ayam and user physical behaviour (movement) by integrating the syntactic findings into the pragmatic analysis, and 3) the development of a design-user interrelationship system (DUs) with the implementation of Malay design knowledge from artefact classification and artefact user’s aesthetic experience using technology of eye movement test.

40|$|Genres of Evidence uses {{four cases}} studies {{to argue that}} the {{distinction}} between historiographic and literary writing sharpened in England between 1770 and 1830, under the conditions of British colonial consolidation, understood as a textual as well as a political and economic enterprise. The dissertation assembles archival, historiographic and literary texts in order to study the collaborative scenarios of interpretation at work in fashioning readers, writers and genres. Genres of Evidence shows how transactions among writers and readers in diverse genres contributed to the crystallization of genre conventions, a process which {{played a role in the}} emergence of the concepts of fact and evidence—their origin, their textual form, and their relationship to empirical experience. The opening chapter recovers a story from the India Office Records about the alleged disappearance of a “beautiful Moor woman” from Madras, a colonial town in South India, and the efforts of colonial officials (George Andrew Ram, George Stratton, Lord Pigot, Warren Hastings) to articulate how textual forms of <b>fact</b> in archival <b>documentation</b> differed from those in the literary genre of the oriental tale. The second chapter discusses manipulations of the epistolary form in the Letterbook of John Bruce, the official historian of the East India Company at the turn of the nineteenth century. The third chapter analyzes how textual convergences between Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey and Catharine Macaulay’s epistolary history affect hierarchies of evidence for the historiography of eighteenth-century women’s writing. The final chapter argues that Lord Byron used genre conventions of oriental tales in “The Giaour” to implicate his readers in his empirical knowledge about Britain’s imperial politics. Engaging closely with scenes of reading and writing conventionally separated by disciplinary divisions, this project proposes a new approach to the study of genre by way of re-imagining the historical relationship between history and literature. Drawing on literary and historical scholarship about the Romantic period, “Genres of Evidence” suggests that textual interactions between the archives conventionally associated with each discipline offer a new and productive model for studying the history of writing...|$|R

Collections managers have recorded conservation, exhibition, loan and publication history, along with significant volumes of internal documentation of acquisition and storage, that support the custody and care of artefacts of significant cultural value. But the systems of documentation and classification that support the professional discourse of art history and the management of museum collections have failed to represent the interests, perspectives or passions of those who visit [use?] museum collections, both on-site and online. As museums move to reflect the breadth of their audiences and the diversity of their perspectives, so must museum documentation change to reflect concerns other than the traditionally art historical and museological. Social tagging offers a direct way for museums to learn what museum-goers see in works of art, what they judge as significant and where they find or make meaning. Wi thin the steve collaboration([URL] a group of art museums is collectively exploring the role of social tagging and studying the resulting folksonomy (Bearman & Trant, 2005; Chun, Cherry, Hiwiller, Trant, & Wyman, 2006; Trant & Wyman, 2006). Analysis of terms collected in the prototype steve tagger suggests that social tagging of art museum objects can in <b>fact</b> augment museum <b>documentation</b> with unique access points not found in traditional cataloguing. Terms collected through social tagging tools are being compared to museum documentation, to establish the actual contributions made by naÃ¯ve users to the accessibility of art museum collections and to see if social classification provides a way to bridge the semantic gap between art historians and art museumsâ publics...|$|R
40|$|The {{documentation}} process at Staatsolie refinery concerning the Test and Inspection turnaround (T&I), has many shortcomings. This fact {{has led to}} many problems during the T&I, a process that has a strict timeline and schedule that is very work intensive. During a T&I turnaround which takes place every 4 years, the plant at Staatsolie refinery is shut down. This costs money, because normal work is ceased. The <b>fact</b> that the <b>documentation</b> process has many shortcomings is therefore a crucial problem, because it has contributed to many documents not being created or documents gone missing. It has {{also contributed to the}} T&I getting behind schedule, which is a loss of money for Staatsolie. Furthermore it has hindered the creation of reports that need to be archived and accessible for at least 2 years. What the T&I turnaround requires is the ability to manage, store and share the documents acquired during the turnaround in a fast and reliable way. This can be achieved by using an information system, more specifically an Electronic Document Management System (EDMS). Such a system should allow users to store, access and modify information quickly and easily. The aim of this thesis is to select an EDMS for the T&I turnaround. This EDMS should allow users to store, access and modify information quickly and easily, and thus aid in keeping to the T&I schedule. It should also thoroughly remove the problem of missing documents or documents not being created. The start point of this thesis is an analysis of the T&I organization and the documents involved in the processes, to get a general idea of the working methodologies and deficiencies of the current system. These findings will then be used to set up a thorough requirements specification for a selection of an EDMS for the T&I turnaround. After the analysis has been made, this report will go on to evaluate and select the right tool for use at the refinery of Staatsolie. This evaluation and selection process is conducted using a basic information framework for EDM systems. For this evaluation, the output from the analysis is used to create an official Request for Proposal (RFP). This RFP is then sent out to multiple vendors. The vendors that reply are then tested against the selection criteria that were created by the project group at Staatsolie. Finally, a tool is selected and this vendor will then further design and implement this system for an effective Document Management System for the Test and Inspection turnaround.

40|$|The MAPPA {{project set}} itself another highly {{innovative}} aim, quite revolutionary for Italian archaeology: lifting {{out of the}} archives the documents containing the data of archaeological investigations and making this information easily accessible to everyone and for any need: from research to protection, from urban planning to quality tourism, or even just for simple learned curiosity. This is how MOD (MAPPA Open Data archaeological archive) was conceived, the first Italian archive of open archaeological data, in keeping with European directives regarding easy access to Public Administration data, and to Research data. The MOD allows users to download the raw documentation and the grey literature of archaeological interventions. Originally conceived to collect the documentation of the excavations carried out in Pisa, the MOD considerably grew as the months went by. Also in consideration {{of the results of}} a survey promoted by the MAPPA project on «Open data and Italian archaeology», which showed how the need to share data is strongly felt by the majority of the archaeological community, the MOD, a little at a time, has become the open data archive of Italian archaeology, where archaeologists can publish excavation data, in <b>fact</b> entering archaeological <b>documentation</b> in the MOD is a publication to all effects, whose authorship is protected by a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) code and a CC BY or CC BY SA license. The first step was to create a 1 (Tim Bernard Lee) star archive and to transform it step by step to a 5 star repository. This year the MOD entered in the list of recommended repositories of the Journal of Open Archaeological Data. So the new step was to provide the MOD with a standardised management of the metadata referred to the single dataset, defining a minimum set of information so as to guarantee correct use of the data. Each archaeological intervention is associated with all the related data, from archaeographic documentation, the structure and format of the digital data, according to a schema that describes the history of the archaeological intervention, the sources used for creating the dataset, the method and the structure of the data and the physical data relations. The MOD Metadata schema is based on Dublin Core and the ISO 19115 schemas. A particular relevance in the schema is given to the description of the methodological background of the archaeological intervention: who direct the intervention, in which year, with what kind of method and so on. This part of the metadata schema is fundamental to translate to future generation of archaeologists the subjective part of the archaeological record, because only the comprehension of the methodological background permit a real semantic interoperability...|$|R
40|$|This work aims at {{providing}} a comprehensive and, {{as far as}} possible, standard and widely supported approach to a dependable design of all electric ship integrated power systems. The proposed approach is based upon latest development of dependability theory made recently available, from its founding lexicon and taxonomy to investigation tools and relevant international rules. In its first part, this work analyses present rule requirements governing the discipline of designing an integrated power system serving an all electric ship. Analysis covers system definitions (what is what) in terms of taxonomy and associated concepts; system required performances {{both in terms of}} delivered services and in terms of reaction to anticipated reactions to predetermined fault scenarios. In its second part, this work briefly presents latest developments in the theory and in the tools theory brings along: lexicon, taxonomy, system analysis, benchmarking and enforcing techniques. During this development, emphasis is posed on the <b>fact</b> that design <b>documentation,</b> be it owners’ technical specification, classification society rule book or international standard, often recall dependability concepts, without fully exploiting the potential theory is promising, or the completeness of its definition corpus. In its third part, this work applies dependability concepts to a real case scenario, an integrated power system installed on a recent cruise ship vessel. This application, albeit suffering from an important lack of information, due to copyrighting and industrial intellectual property rights, produces an informative example on the enquiring method and relevant deliverable: a system model, obtained in a strongly standardized way that permits a comprehensive and accurate dependability study, to be realized using tools and techniques defined in international standard. Results of this analysis are, as a consequence of method strong structure, repeatable and consistent, and allow quick verification of requirements. Analysis results, even though partial and superficial owing to already mentioned lack of accurate information, are offering some original view points. They are commented and classified according to indexes defined earlier. In its fourth part, this works presents proposals to be applied to systems which exhibited low values of indexes. Such proposals are briefly analyzed in terms of index value variations; in doing this a quantification of improvement that could be obtained is given. Finally, in its fifth part, this work shortly presents future research directions to improve investigation method. This work reports elements of project management and maritime law as well, this in force of the multidisciplinary nature of dependability theory, and its repercussion on different sector of the marine industry, besides engineering. It is show how present method can fit the actual engineering process, and can provide a common language serving as substrate for various disciplines, like the ones mentioned...|$|R
