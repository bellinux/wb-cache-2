This would be the payment from the consumer for a newspaper, paying to call into a radio station or paying to receive cable. Subscriptions are also another form of <b>direct</b> <b>payment.</b> In this instance the customer would pay the company, normally a magazine or a comic book a set fee of money under a contracted time and receive weekly or monthly issues.Indirect payment is money companies earn outside of what the consumer pays for.

25|$|Wheat {{farmers are}} a major {{beneficiary}} of crop subsidies and other agricultural programs. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture data, from 1995 to 2012 the U.S. federal government paid over $39 billion in wheat subsidies, through <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> (2003â€“present) and production flexibility contracts (1996-2002), deficiency payments, crop insurance premium subsidies, price support payments (including loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, and certificates), counter-cyclical programs, market loss assistance, and other wheat programs. In 2012, wheat was the third most-subsidized crop, after corn and soybeans. Wheat farmers received $1.1 billion in subsidies in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Denver had a {{reputation}} as a wide-open town in the 1890s.

In addition to making <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> to authorities, Sam and Lou Blonger also engaged in election fraud for candidates from both parties, from Denver mayor Wolfe Londoner in 1890 to Congressman Robert W. Bonynge in 1902. Testimony in the latter case indicated that Blonger's network of steerers had already been in place for several years.|$|E

This conflict {{was followed by a}} successful public referendum, initiated by Fidesz, calling for the abolition of university tuition fees, <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> by insured patients on receiving medical attention, and daily fees at hospital by insured patients. This effectively stopped the restructuring of health care, while it remained completely publicly owned. Because of this the Liberals left {{the coalition}} and from then on the Socialists governed as a minority.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of welfare reforms have been {{introduced}} in the UK by Conservative led governments. The most high profile of these is Universal Credit (UC), which is currently being rolled out across the country. A key feature of UC {{is a change in}} the way the income related housing allowance for social housing tenants (Housing Benefit) is administered, as under UC, it is paid directly to tenants (<b>direct</b> <b>payment),</b> who are responsible for paying their rent. This represents a step change for them as for more than thirty years landlord payment has been the norm in the UK. There has been little research into <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> per se.

25|$|Intervention {{mechanisms}} {{have diminished}} significantly, for instance the Commission only intervenes on: common wheat, butter, and skimmed milk powder. The Health Check of the CAP agreed in November 2008 has added {{on a number}} of measures to help the farmers to respond better to signals from the markets and to face new challenges. Among a range of measures, the agreement abolishes arable set-aside, increases milk quotas gradually leading up to their abolition in 2015, and converts market intervention into a genuine safety net. Ministers also agreed to increase modulation, whereby <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> to farmers are reduced and the money transferred to the Rural Development Fund.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{study of}} 1,000 {{households}} in rural Bangladesh found that <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> to {{formal and informal}} healthcare providers and indirect costs (loss of earnings because of illness) associated with illness were deterrents to accessing healthcare from qualified providers. A community survey of 6,183 individuals in rural Bangladesh found a gender difference in treatment-seeking behaviour, with women less likely to seek treatment than to men. The use of skilled birth attendant (SBA) services, however, rose from 2005 to 2007 among women from all socioeconomic quintiles except the highest. A health watch, a pilot community-empowerment tool, was successfully developed and implemented in south-eastern Bangladesh to improve the uptake and monitoring of public-health services.|$|E

The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.|$|E

25|$|Subsidies {{may take}} the form of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> for financially {{unprofitable}} services, but support may also include indirect subsidies. For example, the government may allow free or reduced-cost use of state-owned infrastructure such as railways and roads, to stimulate public transport's economic competitiveness over private transport, that normally also has free infrastructure (subsidized through such things as gas taxes). Other subsidies include tax advantages (for instance aviation fuel is typically not taxed), bailouts if companies that are likely to collapse (often applied to airlines) and reduction of competition through licensing schemes (often applied to taxis and airlines). Private transport is normally subsidized indirectly through free roads and infrastructure, as well as incentives to build car factories and, on occasion, directly via bailouts of automakers.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially, these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels. One of these reforms entailed the modification of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.|$|E
25|$|There is {{dispute about}} the level of {{subsidies}} paid to the fossil fuel industry in Australia. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) argues that according to the definitions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), fossil fuel production and use is subsidised in Australia by means of <b>direct</b> <b>payments,</b> favourable tax treatment, and other actions. It is suggested these measures act as impediments to investment in renewable energy resources. Analysis by the ACF indicates that these provisions add up to a total annual subsidy of A$7.7billion, with the most significant component being the Fuel Tax Credits program that rebates diesel fuel excise to many business users. This analysis is disputed by the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) who argue that the ACF's definition of a subsidy differs from that of the OECD and that the fuel tax rebate schemes are in place to ensure that all producers are treated equally from a tax point of view. However, the IPA acknowledges that regardless of perceived issues with the ACF analysis, some level of fossil fuel subsidy is likely in existence.|$|E

40|$|In Japan, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from rice production, especially CH 4 emissions in rice paddy fields, are the primary contributors to global warming from agriculture. When prolonged midseason drainage for mitigating CH 4 emissions from rice paddy fields is practiced with environmentally friendly rice production based on reduced use of synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers, Japanese rice farmers can receive an agri-environmental <b>direct</b> <b>payment.</b> This paper examines the economic and environmental effects of the agri-environmental <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> on {{the adoption of a}} measure to mitigate global warming in Japanese rice farms using a combined application of linear programming and life cycle assessment at the farm scale. Eco-efficiency, which is defined as net farm income divided by global warming potential, is used as an integrated indicator for assessing the economic and environmental feasibilities. The results show that under the current <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> level, the prolonged midseason drainage technique does not improve the eco-efficiency of Japanese rice farms because the practice of this technique in environmentally friendly rice production causes large economic disadvantages in exchange for small environmental advantages. The <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> rates for agri-environmental measures should be determined based on the condition that environmentally friendly agricultural practices improve eco-efficiency compared with conventional agriculture...|$|R
25|$|For {{more than}} a year, the reparations ordinance, which had been {{introduced}} by Aldermen co-sponsors Joe Moreno and Howard Brookins Jr. in October 2013, had been stalled in the Chicago City Council. Political pressure began to build during {{the run-up to the}} 2015 Chicago mayoral primary. Mayor Emanuel was seeking a second term in office and faced four challengers, two of whom were African American. CTJM, Amnesty International, and other activists collected 40,000 signatures, which they delivered to Emanuelâ€™s office in December 2014, suggesting growing public support for the proposal. After a 2015 Valentine's Day Rally that attracted hundreds of supporters, a team of negotiators that included Taylor, fellow Peopleâ€™s Law partner Mogul, and advocates from CTJM, and Amnesty International began negotiations with the city of Chicagoâ€™s corporation counsel, Stephen Patton, on the terms of the reparations ordinance. The cityâ€™s initial offer did not include any <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> to victims or their families, a demand on which the team of negotiators refused to yield. Talks at first were strained. Various aldermen and staffers from the mayor's office and the law department got involved, and a compromise that would include financial payments to living victims, but not to the families of those who had died, was eventually brokered.|$|E

40|$|In Malaysia, sub-contractors have to {{bear with}} the current {{structure}} of payment mechanisms in the standard forms of contract, which are <b>payment</b> upon certification, <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> from the employer, and contingent or conditional payment.

2500|$|A {{review of}} post-2013 {{proposal}} by Prof. Alan Matthews underlines {{the lack of}} ambition in tackling the issue. [...] "This CAP reform {{was not intended to}} address the trade barriers used to keep some EU market prices higher than world market levels. The EU has reduced the effect of these barriers for a number of developing countries through extending the scope of preferential access under various trade agreements, and a further reduction is being negotiated in the WTO Doha Round. Nonetheless, developing countries will be disappointed that the opportunity was not taken in this reform to set a final date for the ending of export subsidies. A more ambitious CAP reform, in which the targeting of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> was pursued more insistently and coupled payments were phased out, would also have a greater effect in removing the remaining distortions caused by the CAP to world markets." [...] In another study, Prof. Matthews showed how linking EU farm subsidies to goals such as environmental protection could help farmers in poor countries, although much depends {{on the size of the}} payments and how they are made.|$|E
