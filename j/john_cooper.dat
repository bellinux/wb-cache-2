25|$|Skillet {{formed in}} 1996 with two members: <b>John</b> <b>Cooper,</b> former vocalist for Tennessee {{progressive}} rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor {{encouraged them to}} form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. <b>John</b> <b>Cooper,</b> the lead vocalist, explains {{that it was a}} joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet {{to come up with something}} unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.|$|E

25|$|Hobbs {{was born}} in Cambridge on 16 December 1882, the eldest of 12 {{children}} born to <b>John</b> <b>Cooper</b> Hobbs, a slater, and his wife Flora Matilda Berry.

Hobbs later wrote that, although he had a happy childhood, he had envied those who lived a more privileged life in Cambridge's more affluent areas and his childhood experiences left him with an sense of inferiority. The family moved house several times during this period.|$|E
