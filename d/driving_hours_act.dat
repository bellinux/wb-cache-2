40|$|For the intensively studied {{vehicle routing problem}} (VRP), two real-life {{restrictions}} {{have received}} only minor attention in the VRP-literature: traffic congestion and <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations. Traffic congestion causes late arrivals at customers and long travel times resulting in large transport costs. To account for traffic congestion, time-dependent travel times should be considered when constructing vehicle routes. Next, <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations, which restrict the available driving and working times for truck drivers, must be respected. Since violations are severely fined, also <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations should be considered when constructing vehicle routes, even more in combination with congestion problems. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a solution method for the VRP with time windows (VRPTW), time-dependent travel times, and <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations. The major difficulty of this VRPTW extension is to optimize each vehicle’s departure times to minimize the duty time of each driver. Having compact duty times leads to cost savings. However, obtaining compact duty times is much harder when time-dependent travel times and <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations are considered. We propose a restricted dynamic programming (DP) heuristic for constructing the vehicle routes, and an efficient heuristic for optimizing the vehicle’s departure times for each (partial) vehicle route, such that the complete solution algorithm runs in polynomial time. Computational experiments demonstrate the trade-off between travel distance minimization and duty time minimization, and illustrate the cost savings of extending the depot opening hours such that traveling before the morning peak and after the evening peak becomes possible...|$|R

40|$|Most {{solution}} {{methods for}} the {{vehicle routing problem}} with time windows (VRPTW) develop routes from the earliest feasible departure time. However, in practice, temporal traffic congestions make that such solutions are not optimal with respect to minimizing the total duty time. Furthermore, VRPTW solutions do not account for complex <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations, which severely restrict the daily travel time available for a truck driver. To deal with these problems, we consider the vehicle departure time optimization (VDO) problem as a post-processing step of solving a VRPTW. We propose an ILP-formulation that minimizes the total duty time. The obtained solutions are feasible with respect to <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations and they account for temporal traffic congestions by modeling time-dependent travel times. For the latter, we assume a piecewise constant speed function. Computational experiments show that problem instances of realistic sizes can be solved to optimality within practical computation times. Furthermore, duty time reductions of 8 percent can be achieved. Finally, {{the results show that}} ignoring time-dependent travel times and <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations during the development of vehicle routes leads to many infeasible vehicle routes. Therefore, vehicle routing methods should account for these real-life restrictions...|$|R

50|$|An {{electronic}} logging device (ELD) is {{electronic hardware}} that {{is attached to}} a commercial motor vehicle engine to record <b>driving</b> <b>hours.</b> The <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> of commercial drivers (truck and bus drivers) are regulated by a set of rules known as the hours of service (HOS). The Commercial Vehicle Driver Hours of Service Regulations vary in Canada and the United States. An ELD monitors a vehicle’s engine to capture data on whether the engine is running, whether the vehicle is moving, miles were driven, and duration of engine operation. Previously, paper logs or electronic on-board recorders (EOBR) were used for hours-of-service tracking. Even though an electronic on-board recorder (EOBR)-style log improves the accuracy of the data, the lack of a consistent data format meant that the logs needed to be regenerated to an equivalent “paper” format for review and enforcement. The Record of Duty Status (RODS) definition within the ELD legislation defines a consistent format for enforcement personnel to review, so the ELD Mandate was created.|$|R

40|$|Vehicle routing is {{a complex}} daily task for {{businesses}} such as logistic service providers and distribution firms. Planners have to assign many orders to many vehicles and, for each vehicle, assign a delivery sequence. The objective is to minimize total transport costs. These costs typically include the number of vehicles used and the total travel distance or time. Two general timing restrictions make vehicle routing particularly difficult: traffic congestion and <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations. As a result of traffic congestion, travel times depend {{on the time of}} departure. Therefore, vehicle routing also involves the subtask of optimizing each vehicle’s departure times (both from the depot and from the customers). Driving hours regulations - which pose restrictions on driving and working times (between breaks) - have to be taken into account, making departure time optimization particularly difficult. In this research, we study the Vehicle Routing Problem under time-dependent travel times and <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations. We propose a generic solution method for Vehicle Routing Problems that can handle various restrictions, such as vehicle capacities and time windows. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this method performs very well on problems which include <b>driving</b> <b>hours</b> regulations. Test results on Vehicle Routing Problems with traffic congestion are also very promising. Most delays caused by traffic congestion can be avoided by considering them when developing vehicle route plans. This is done by avoiding predictably busy areas during problematic hours. The solution methods proposed in this thesis are not limited to the problems they were initially designed for. We illustrate how they can be used in other studies, such as policy making, by analyzing vehicle routing from a distributed decision making perspective. In conclusion, there are various applications of the solution methods proposed in this thesis and they may allow for substantial improvements in practice...|$|R
