40|$|Background: While {{financial}} {{decision making}} has been barely explored, no study has previously investigated the neural correlates of individual {{decisions made by}} professional traders involved in real stock market negotiations, using their own financial resources. Aim: We sought to detect how different brain areas are modulated by factors like age, expertise, psychological profile (speculative risk seeking or aversion) and, eventually, size and type (Buy/Sell) of stock negotiations, made through Direct Access Trading (DAT) platforms. Subjects and methods: Twenty male traders underwent fMRI while negotiating in the Italian stock market using their own preferred trading platform. Results: At least 20 decision events were collected during each fMRI session. Risk averse traders performed a lower number of financial transactions with respect to risk seekers, with a lower average economic value, but with {{a higher rate of}} filled proposals. Activations were observed in cortical and subcortical areas traditionally involved in decision processes, including the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC, dlPFC), the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and dorsal striatum. Regression analysis indicated an important role of age in modulating activation of left NAcc, while traders' expertise was negatively related to activation of vlPFC. <b>High</b> <b>value</b> <b>transactions</b> were associated with a stronger activation of the right PPC when subjects' buy rather than sell. The success of the trading activity, based on a large number of filled transactions, was related with higher activation of vlPFC and dlPFC. Independent of chronological and professional age, traders differed in their attitude to DAT, with distinct brain activity profiles being detectable during fMRI sessions. Those subjects who described themselves as very self-confident, showed a lower or absent activation of both the caudate nucleus and the dlPFC, while more reflexive traders showed greater activation of areas involved in strategic decision making. Discussion: The neural correlates in DAT are similar to those observed in other decision making contexts. Trading is handled as a well-learned automatic behavior by expert traders; for those who mostly rely on heuristics, cognitive effort decreases, and transaction speed increases, but decision efficiency lowers following a poor involvement of the dlPFC...|$|R

It is now common for multiple organizations to operate in the same landscape in pursuit of different conservation goals. New objectives, such as maintenance of ecosystem services, will attract additional funding and new organizations to conservation. Systematic conservation planning helps in the design of spatially explicit management actions that optimally conserve multiple landscape features (e. g., species, ecosystems, or ecosystem services). But the methods used in its application implicitly assume that a single actor implements the optimal plan. We investigated how organizational behavior and conservation outcomes are affected by the presence of autonomous implementing organizations with different objectives.

The study was motivated by the fact that banks failed to ensure financial inclusion and to take advantage of unbanked market and this resulted in Econet seeing an opportunity and launched EcoCash. EcoCash has had a huge impact and its accounts exceed total bank accounts. Objectives of the study were to examine reasons for the emergence of EcoCash, to assess the influence of EcoCash on Zimbabwean banksâ€™ market, to explore strategies put in place by banks in light of entrance of EcoCash into the financial sector, to analyse sources of competitive advantage for Zimbabwean banks, and to propose a model that brings collaborative synergies between EcoCash and the Zimbabwean banks. The study reviewed literature related to strategy, competitive advantage, the emergence of MMT services in Africa and influence of MMT on banksâ€™ market. The study population was comprised of employees and managers in 16 commercial banks, RBZ, and BAZ. The researcher used a mixture of probability and non-probability sampling techniques. Self-administered questionnaires and structured interviews were used as research instruments. The study found out that EcoCash was prominent because commercial banks failed to exploit the unbanked informal market. EcoCash resulted in decline in bank deposits and clients closed their accounts. Nevertheless, commercial banks have competitive advantage in terms of being able to process <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>transactions,</b> and facilitate international transactions. The study recommended that there was need for commercial banks to ensure training of employees and to empower employees through participation in decision making. It was also important for the financial institution to ensure a high level of employee motivation. Motivation of employees would be starting point of ensuring customer satisfaction because human resources are sources of competitive advantage. Another recommendation was that commercial banks should invest in research and development and come up with new, unique products and research should be conducted so that banks are aware of expectations of clients. It was held that banks were facing stiff competition from EcoCash, therefore, they needed to ensure that alliances signed with other companies are effective. For example, the bank could have fully exploited its partnership with EcoCash and ensure convenience to clients. New strategic alliances, for example with funeral assurance companies like Nyaradzo, could be sought. The researcher recommended that a study on effectiveness of commercial banksâ€™ human resources strategies be conducted. This was {{because of the fact that}} the researcher discovered, during the conduct of study, that human resources are sources of competitive advantage for any company.

40|$|Remote {{transactions}} globally transfer {{trillions of}} dollars annually. Many of these information exchanges are mediated, implicitly or explicitly, by a complex web of agencies that add to costs and introduce additional opportunities for error or misconduct. Further, additional records are created {{as part of the}} audit and transaction process. These transaction records may be used to enhance performance and generate new transactions, and are consequently of value. Further, these records provide some protection against error or misconduct by allocating responsibility for each transaction component. The conventional approach to remote transaction security is to add complexity and layers of arbitration to minimise losses at the cost of ease of use and flexibility. This research examined transaction characteristics and explored means of reducing the additional costs while providing transactions with security, flexibility and scalability. The critical issue is the control of transaction information which is principally used for dispute resolution and audit. However, it may also be used for unethical and even illegal purposes. Conventional techniques for information security such as encryption, hashing and signatures are reviewed and, additionally, reduction in participant numbers coupled with broadening of the hardware basis has been explored and recommendations are made for securing particular electronic remote transactions. User-management of transaction components and information is discussed, along with user-based mediation of identity, however, some form of arbitration or adjudication relying on transaction records need be assumed. The principal threat to transaction records is not the anonymous hacker, but the obsolescence imposed by ongoing changes in hardware, software and organisational procedures. Conservation of paper documents is an established discipline however, conservation of electronic records and hardware require additional considerations. The credit card transaction is used as a basis {{for the development of a}} prototype to increase the security of transactions under user control but the processes and methods are applicable to a much wider variety of transactions and can be implemented in a secure, flexible format. A user controlled prototype scheme with electronic signature usage is defined and common attack avenues are examined. The prototype software was developed and tested on Nokia mobile phones and the transactions performed provided flexibility and scalability with strong security. User choices in security levels are implemented and each unique transaction is uniquely processed making the transactions resistant to a variety of attacks. It is considered that while “User mediation” is feasible and may become common in some transactions it is unlikely to replace arbitration in <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>transactions.</b> While self-enforcing transactions are feasible in arbitrated and adjudicated regimes with some form of pre-arranged context, the existence of selfenforcing transactions without pre-existing context is not yet decided. In summary, these methods may change the way many current transaction regimes and applications do business and in doing so, will alter the balance of power in transactions by putting control onto the user with concomitant transfer of costs...|$|R
