5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo <b>Dispatch</b> under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. The <b>Dispatch</b> published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of the <b>Dispatch</b> learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the credibility of the <b>Dispatch</b> and harmed Riley's reputation.|$|E

In regular missions, Marche's entire party ventures to a particular location to do battle. Many of these missions are used to advance the story. In encounter missions, Marche's group battles a rival mercenary clan by purchasing a mission or meeting them on the map. In <b>dispatch</b> missions, which do not involve battle, Marche temporarily sends away one member from his party. Area missions are usually a <b>dispatch</b> mission where Marche's clan can liberate certain regions to obtain bonuses and discounts at shops.|$|E

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Belgium, France, UK, the Netherlands, Norway and America already had the service of labor <b>dispatching,</b> and most of well-established <b>dispatched</b> work agencies were founded at that time. In Japan, labor <b>dispatching</b> started coming out in 1965. The employers of <b>dispatched</b> work agencies already hired or registered {{a certain amount of}} laborers, and <b>dispatched</b> them to the users enterprise to provide labor services when the enterprise had the demand. At that time, labor <b>dispatching</b> played matchmaker between the females, the older workers and <b>dispatched</b> work agencies. After 1975, due to the arising demand of many enterprises, <b>dispatched</b> work agencies grew rapidly.|$|R

In addition, according to the statistics of America Staffing Association, there were 90% American enterprises used the services provided from labor <b>dispatching</b> industry. That means the concept of labor <b>dispatching</b> has commonly existed in the American society. In Japan, since made the law of labor <b>dispatching</b> in 1985, labor <b>dispatching</b> has developed rapidly. After the law of labor <b>dispatching</b> putting in execution, there were 615 general <b>dispatched</b> work agencies, 3,266 specific <b>dispatched</b> work agencies, and 1.4 billion <b>dispatched</b> laborers. Until 1998, there were 3026 general <b>dispatched</b> work agencies, 6985 specific <b>dispatched</b> work agencies, and 9 billion <b>dispatched</b> labors. In a short span of 12 years, the population of <b>dispatched</b> labor has grown six times, and it still kept increasing. Especially after the law of labor <b>dispatching</b> of Japan has changed for the 4th time, it increased furiously.

ILO has approved the Convention Concerning Private Employment Agencies (NO. 181), there has two key point in this conventions: First, corrected the Convention Concerning Fee-Charging Employment Agencies(NO. 96). The activities of private employment agencies was not confined to placement services and job placement anymore but could be the employer to provide labors to the third party. Second, urged the international society members to attach importance on the flexibility of labor market.

40|$|In an {{increasing}} number of application domains, <b>dispatching</b> components are responsible for delivering upcalls to one or more application objects when events or requests arrive in a system. Implementing efficient, predictable, and scalable <b>dispatching</b> components is hard and implementing them for multi-threaded systems is even harder. In particular, <b>dispatching</b> components must be prepared to deliver upcalls to multiple objects, to handle recursive requests originated from application-provided upcalls, and often must collaborate with applications to control object life-cycles. In our distributed object computing (DOC) middleware research, we have implemented many <b>dispatching</b> components that apply common solutions repeatedly to solve the challenges outlined above. Moreover, we have discovered that the forces constraining <b>dispatching</b> components often differ slightly, thereby requiring alternative solution strategies. This paper presents two contributions to the design and implementation of efficient, predictable, scalable, and flexible <b>dispatching</b> components. First, it shows how patterns can be applied to capture key design and performance characteristics of proven <b>dispatching</b> components. Second, it presents a set of patterns that describe successful solutions appropriate for key <b>dispatching</b> challenges arising in various real-time DOC middleware and applications...|$|R

The <b>dispatching</b> rules are tested in environments characterized by three factors, namely, the order strength of the precedence relationship, the level of resource availability {{and the level of}} estimation errors in the activity durations. The results show that project environment affects only the performance differences but not the grouping of the better <b>dispatching</b> rules. The greatest number of successors, rank positional weight, greatest cumulative resource requirement and minimum activity slack <b>dispatching</b> rules consistently perform better than the other <b>dispatching</b> rules, unaffected by the accuracy of the estimated activity durations. This finding validates the results of many past studies in the deterministic project environment for choosing the right <b>dispatching</b> rule for both projects with and without well-estimated activity durations. project management heuristics <b>dispatching</b> simulation...|$|R

40|$|In {{automated}} manufacturing systems, {{deadlock avoidance}} policies guarantee deadlock-free operation while performance controllers, such as <b>dispatching</b> rules, attempt to achieve performance thresholds. In an automated system, <b>dispatching</b> rules must {{work within the}} constraints imposed by the deadlock avoidance policy in order to assure continuing system operation, and thus, the deadlock avoidance logic defines the decision space over which the <b>dispatching</b> rule can work. This paper investigates the interactions that arise between deadlock avoidance flexibility {{and the effectiveness of}} <b>dispatching</b> rules in achieving good system performance. Two major findings are that the positive effects of intelligent <b>dispatching</b> are highly influenced by the flexibility of the deadlock avoidance policy, and that a naive <b>dispatching</b> rule can sometimes achieve better system performance under an inflexible deadlock avoidance policy...|$|R
