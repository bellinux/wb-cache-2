5|$|Austin {{admitted}} {{the theft of}} the cow, saying he had had no food for his children. According to his undated charge sheet, witnesses for the state were Littrell, Martin, Lane, and Lawrence Payne. Austin's account of what happened tallied {{with that of the}} posse, except that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the one, not Laura, who had objected to the shotgun being removed from the wall. He said Laura had been trying to take the rifle away from her son when it was fired.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Shaughnessy {{traveled}} to Yale University, which was considering three candidates for its vacant head coaching position. A month later, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{not interested in}} Yale, but that he might move to an unnamed Eastern school with little football tradition. Shaughnessy resigned in March 1942 to move to Maryland. A 1977 Sports Illustrated article reported {{that he decided to}} leave when he realized Stanford might discontinue its football program during World War II. He expressed disappointment about leaving, but believed the new job would provide a challenge. Maryland reportedly offered the same salary as Stanford, $9,000 ($ adjusted for inflation), and a position on its faculty.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, The Boston Globe first {{reported}} that Wolf was considering {{not running for}} re-election. Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> more focused on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order {{to focus on a}} run for governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E

He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out of his hands and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> glad to be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E

5|$|Critchell {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with newly relegated Conference Premier side Wrexham on 24 June 2008. He made his debut in a 2–0 victory over Oxford United, {{where he played}} in right midfield. After making a further appearance for Wrexham he suffered from an ankle injury during a training session. He underwent surgery on this ankle in October, which had been delayed due to illness. After recovering from this injury four months later, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> looking to be loaned out to help improve his first-team chances at Wrexham. He eventually joined fellow Conference Premier side York City on a one-month loan on 5 January 2009. He was due to make his debut a day later against former club Weymouth, but the match was postponed. He eventually made his first appearance after playing in the 2–1 victory over Oxford on 13 January {{in the second round}} of the FA Trophy. This was followed by his league debut on 17 January in a 3–0 victory over Lewes. The loan was extended for a second month on 4 February and finished his time at York with 11 appearances.|$|E
5|$|He was {{released}} by Doncaster {{at his own request}} on 13 January 2009 and joined Conference Premier club Oxford United the next day on a contract {{until the end of the}} 2008–09 season. He made his debut in a 1–0 victory over Altrincham on 17 January 2009 and scored his first goal four days later with a shot into the top-left corner of the goal, which gave Oxford a 1–0 victory against Mansfield Town. Nelthorpe was named on standby for the England C team, who represent England at non-League level, in February 2009, for a friendly against Malta under-21s. He was sent off against Torquay United after clashing with Mustapha Carayol, which resulted in a three-match suspension, and following this <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> looking to use his aggression more effectively. He made his return in a 2–1 victory over Kettering Town on 19 March 2009, during which he opened the scoring with a 20-yard free kick and assisted the second goal with a corner kick that was headed in by Chris Willmott. He finished the season with 16 appearances and 2 goals for Oxford.|$|E
5|$|In a {{press conference}} after the game, Brown {{announced}} that he would not return for his senior season and enter the NFL Draft, saying he told the media <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> staying to take the focus off of himself prior to the game. Brown was drafted 27th overall by the Indianapolis Colts, becoming the first UConn player ever drafted in the first round. Three other UConn players were drafted in the second round: Darius Butler 41st overall by the New England Patriots, Will Beatty 60th overall by the New York Giants, and defensive end Cody Brown 63rd overall by the Arizona Cardinals. Tight end Martin Bédard was drafted 15th overall {{in the second round of}} the Canadian Football League's (CFL) 2009 Draft. Buffalo did not have any players drafted by either league in 2009; in the 2010 NFL Draft James Starks was selected in the sixth round, 193rd overall, by the Green Bay Packers. UConn cornerback Robert McClain was also drafted by the NFL in 2010, in the seventh round, 249th overall, by the Carolina Panthers.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, 1994, State Judicial Police arrested Puentes Pizaña in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on a {{car theft}} charge. In an {{interview}} the following day, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not guilty of Fischer's murder, and claimed {{he was at his}} mother's house in Matamoros when the murder occurred. He insisted that neither he nor Olivarez were gun owners or users. U.S. officials noted that it was unlikely for Mexico to extradite Puentes Pizaña since the extradition treaty between both countries did not cover Mexican nationals, and because Texas has the death penalty, which is outlawed in Mexico. Reynosa officials stated that Puentes Pizaña would have to face charges in Mexico before an extradition could be considered. Car theft sentences ranged from three to ten years in prison. Puentes Pizaña, on the other hand, argued that facing trial in the U.S. would not guarantee a fair trial. South Texas officials stated that there was a possibility for Puentes Pizaña to be tried in Mexico for Fischer's murder if an agreement was made between Texan and Tamaulipas state officials, though they said that trying him in the U.S. was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was trying to put the blame on him to protect himself from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico {{to see if they could}} talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E
5|$|He {{signed for}} Conference Premier club Cambridge United in August 2007 after playing {{for them in}} a {{pre-season}} friendly. He started his Cambridge career by scoring four goals {{in the first three}} matches, which included a hat-trick in their 5–1 home victory over Farsley Celtic on 21 August 2007. He was named as the Conference Premier Player of the Month for August 2007. He signed for Conference Premier rivals York City on loan until the end of 2007–08 on 31 January 2008, after which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> looking to sign for the club permanently in the summer. He scored on his debut, a 2–0 home win over Grays Athletic after coming on as a 46th-minute substitute for Richard Brodie on 9 February 2008. He started ahead of Brodie in the following matches against Halifax Town and Histon, but struggled during these matches. Cambridge attempted to recall him from his loan in March 2008, but league rules meant {{that he would not be}} able to return. He returned to Cambridge following the expiration of his loan spell at York in April 2008, in which he made 13 appearances and scored 2 goals. He featured in Cambridge's play-off semi-final second leg 2–1 home win over Burton Albion; this result meant the team reached the final 4–3 on aggregate. He came on for the last 15 minutes of the final against Exeter City at Wembley Stadium on 18 May 2008, but Cambridge lost 1–0. He was released by the club in May 2008 after making 33 appearances and scoring 8 goals.|$|E

5|$|In the 2008–09 season, Buffon {{was once}} again sidelined by several injuries. From September through January, reserve goalkeeper Alexander Manninger held his {{position}} between the sticks, gaining praise for his deputising. Due to recurring injuries, Manninger's performances and Juventus's poor form {{towards the end of}} the season (as Buffon was seen despondent whilst the team drew with both Lecce and Atalanta), there were further rumours that Buffon was displeased and wanted to part ways with the club. He admitted he was disappointed with the current results, but assured that he had no intention of leaving. After a discussion with management, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> reassured about the club's future and signed a contract extension to 2013. Buffon and Juventus finished the season on a high note, with two victories, finishing in second place behind Internazionale. They were knocked out of the Coppa Italia semi-finals by eventual champions Lazio and of the Champions League in the round of 16 by Chelsea. Buffon was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2009 for the sixth consecutive season since first being nominated in 2004. Buffon made his 300th appearance for Juventus in a 3–3 home draw against Chievo in 2009.|$|E
