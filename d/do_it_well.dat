500|$|Laura Fermi remembered Woods as [...] "a tall {{young girl}} built like an athlete, {{who could do}} a man's job and <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well.</b> She {{was the only woman}} {{physicist}} in Enrico's group. At that time, her mother, who was also endowed with inexhaustible energy, was running a small farm near Chicago almost by herself. To relieve Mrs. Woods of some work, Leona divided her time between atoms and potatoes." ...|$|E

[...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly rated it [...] "B+", saying that [...] "even if the themes on their 11th studio CD are a bit predictable, their muscular riffs and handsome vocal harmonies give the material a boot-scooting vibrancy".|$|E

500|$|Mayall's mother {{encouraged}} him to study whatever interested him the most, and to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well,</b> so he considered astronomy {{as an alternative to}} mining. After asking many professors in the astronomy department whether they enjoyed their work and whether they made a satisfactory wage, and being content with their answers, he transferred to the College of Letters and Science to major in astronomy. [...] This did not set him back in his degree requirements because almost all of his first year studies had been in basic physical sciences and mathematics. [...] Eventually Mayall discovered that he greatly enjoyed astronomy, and decided upon a course of graduate level study followed by a career as a research scientist.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the {{character}} underwent changes in appearance and direction with Becky suffering two miscarriages. Kelly branded the storyline challenging, admitting {{she felt a}} huge responsibility to get it right, stating: [...] "It's definitely been the hardest thing I've done since I've been here. I think the responsibility to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well</b> that you feel is huge." [...] Kelly also spoke of the sadness she felt for the impact the plot has on her character adding: [...] "She can't really put up any barriers about this– it's the worst thing that's ever happened. She goes from being a girl to a woman, I think. I'm just devastated for her". Kelly brands the storyline as her hardest, [...] "Most of Becky’s storylines have an element of fun in there somewhere, but with this one {{it was just like}} a cloud was hanging over me for six weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|The second pack, [...] "Pinnacle Station", was {{released}} as a paid download for the Xbox 360 {{and as a}} free download for Microsoft Windows on August 25, 2009. However, it remains absent on the PlayStation 3 version of the game. The pack introduces a training facility where the player can compete in eight virtual reality combat scenarios, divided into four different game types like Deathmatch and Capture the flag. After beating the combat scenarios, the player needs to complete four more to unlock a special survival mode, {{which is the same}} as the previous survival challenges but requires players to last five minutes. BioWare described [...] "Pinnacle Station" [...] as [...] "a Fight Club-style arena" [...] and originally intended to include a similar arena in the base game, but the idea was ultimately dropped because they were not able to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well</b> enough. The pack received mediocre reviews from critics, who called it uninspiring and unnecessary.|$|E

500|$|Kolbe {{thought at}} first that casting Robinson was [...] "really off-the-way" [...] but he felt the actor made the episode [...] "bloom". He gave general {{guidelines}} to Robinson about how he could approach the character, but it was Robinson who developed the traits of the character. Kolbe also praised the writing saying that [...] "I wish there was more writing like this for television. I think we'd have a much healthier industry." [...] Robinson said that Garak was a complicated character which required the use of subtext, adding that it wasn't {{a simple way to}} portray a character [...] "but when you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well,</b> you really get people's attention". He was told by the producers that they intended to bring him back onto the show, but in a later interview, he said that this was commonplace in the industry and doesn't usually occur. When he was brought back for the second-season episode [...] "", executive producer Ira Steven Behr apologized for not bringing him back sooner.|$|E
500|$|... "New Guys" [...] {{featured}} one of {{the final}} few performances of Mindy Kaling as Kelly Kapoor, who left the series to star in her own comedy television series The Mindy Project, which was created for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Both Novak and Kaling appeared in two episodes of the season—"New Guys" [...] and [...] "Finale". The episode features both Clark Duke and Jake Lacy as two new Dunder Mifflin employees who have been hired to [...] "go through the back log of over 4,000 unanswered customer complaints that" [...] Kelly has ignored the past few years. Duke noted that filming the slack lining scene [...] "was not that fun; it was really hard". He did, however, state that Helms was able to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well</b> [...] "with no practice". The voice of the documentarian that responds to Jim is that of series director David Rogers. Rogers also voiced the same character in the penultimate episode opener [...] "A.A.R.M.". Originally, Daniels had re-recorded the line in [...] "New Guys", but ended up liking Roger's voice better. He asked him to reprise the role in [...] "A.A.R.M." [...] to preserve continuity.|$|E
500|$|Espinosa {{landed the}} lead role of the film Gloria in 2014. The film is a biopic about singer-songwriter Gloria Trevi, and her {{relation}} with her manager, record producer Sergio Andrade. The movie chronicles {{the rise and fall}} of the singer's career, detailing Trevi's first encounter with Andrade (who became her mentor), her brief tenure in a band, her rise to musical stardom, a sex scandal involving minors, and her imprisonment in Brazil. Espinosa won the role after a month-and-a-half casting process, stating that [...] "I do not know how many actresses were , or who they were, but once I got the role I knew it was a big responsibility, because it is a character who is alive and has a lot of fans, I had to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well.</b> It is a very complex character, full of nuances, with great force". Espinosa took singing lessons and had to learn Trevi's accent. Also, to fully prepare for the role, the actress was assigned a choreographer and worked with the film director to find the right tone for the scenes. Espinosa watched Trevi's interviews, concerts and films to be able to play her. [...] "The role was meant for me", Espinosa said to Noticine.|$|E

500|$|With [...] over [...] {{still to}} travel before the {{relative}} safety of Hut Point, Crean and Lashly began hauling Evans on the sledge, [...] "eking out {{his life with}} the last few drops of brandy that they still had with them". On 18 February they arrived at Corner Camp, still [...] from Hut Point, with [...] {{only one or two}} days' food rations left and still four or five days' man-hauling to do. They then decided that Crean should go on alone, to fetch help. With only a little chocolate and three biscuits to sustain him, without a tent or survival equipment, Crean walked the distance to Hut Point in 18hours, arriving in a state of collapse to find Atkinson there, with the dog driver Dmtri Gerov. Crean reached safety just ahead of a fierce blizzard, which probably would have killed him, and which delayed the rescue party by a day and a half. Atkinson led a successful rescue, and Lashly and Evans were both brought to base camp alive. Crean modestly played down the significance of his feat of endurance. In a rare written account, he wrote in a letter: [...] "So it fell to my lot to do the 30miles for help, and only a couple of biscuits and a stick of chocolate to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Well,</b> sir, I was very weak when I reached the hut." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of City Lights endured, with the film's re-release in 1950 again positively received by audiences and critics. In 1949, the critic James Agee wrote in Life magazine, {{that the final}} scene was the [...] "greatest single piece of acting ever committed to celluloid." [...] Richard Meryman called the final scene {{one of the greatest}} moments in film history. Charles Silver, Curator of Film at the Museum of Modern Art, stated that the film is so highly regarded because it brought forth a new level of lyrical romanticism that had not appeared in Chaplin's earlier works. He adds that like all romanticism, it is based in the denial of the real world around it. When the film premiered, Chaplin was much older, he {{was in the midst of}} another round of legal battles with former spouse Lita Grey, and the economic and political climate of the world had changed. Chaplin uses the Girl's blindness to remind the Tramp of the precarious nature of romanticism in the real world, as she unknowingly assaults him multiple times. Film.com critic Eric D. Snider said that by 1931, most Hollywood filmmakers either embraced talking pictures, resigned themselves to their inevitability, or just gave up making movies, yet Chaplin held firm with his vision in this project. He also noted that few in Hollywood had the clout to make a silent film at that late date, let alone <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well.</b> One reason was that Chaplin knew the Tramp could not be adapted to talking movies and still work.|$|E
2500|$|After the July 2014 {{crash of}} Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, RT rushed to blame others for the plane's shoot-down in Ukraine amid accusations by Ukrainian fighters of Russian {{involvement}} in the crash.

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 14, Jones {{introduced}} himself to a then 16-year-old musician from Florida, Ray Charles, after watching him play at the Black Elks Club. Jones cites Ray Charles as an early inspiration for his own music career. He noted that Charles had overcome a disability (glaucomatic blindness) to achieve his musical goals. He has credited his father's sturdy work ethic with giving him the means to proceed, and his loving strength with holding the family together. Jones has said his father had a saying: [...] "Once a task is just begun, never leave until it's done. Be the labor great or small, <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well</b> or not at all." ...|$|E

Now try to play detached tones for twenty seconds and do you <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> <b>Well</b> I found {{that something was wrong}} because I couldn't play half, not even a fourth as long as I could hold a tone. When you play you must let only the amount of air pass the lips that is needed to produce the tone—no more. I went to work on this and now I can play an air or an allegro exercise as long as I can hold a tone." ...|$|E

And they <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well.</b> It's not pleasant work, but it's a living. And it has to be done. Somebody has to go around and empty all those bed pans. And it's perfectly honorable work.

2500|$|Satana then starred as [...] "Varla" [...] in the 1965 film Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!—a very {{aggressive}} and sexual female character {{for which she}} did all of her own stunts and fight scenes. Renowned film critic Richard Corliss called her performance [...] "the most honest, maybe the one honest portrayal in the Meyer canon and certainly the scariest". Originally titled The Leather Girls, the film is an ode to female violence, based on a concept created by Russ Meyer and screenwriter Jack Moran. Both felt at her first audition that Satana was [...] "definitely Varla." [...] The film was shot on location in the desert outside Los Angeles during days when the weather was more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and freezing nights, with Satana clashing regularly with teenage co-star Susan Bernard due to Bernard's mother's reportedly disruptive behavior on the set. Meyer said Satana was [...] "extremely capable. She knew how to handle herself. Don't fuck with her! And {{if you have to}} fuck her, <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well!</b> She might turn on you!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Graham's {{announcement}} that the Fillmore West gig was Big Brother's last concert with Joplin, the band—with Joplin still as lead vocalist—toured the United States that fall. Reflecting Joplin's crossover appeal, two October 1968 performances at a roller rink in Alexandria, Virginia, were reviewed by John Segraves {{of the conservative}} Washington Evening Star {{at a time when}} the Washington metropolitan area's hard rock scene was in its infancy. An opera buff at the time, he wrote, [...] "Miss Joplin, in her early 20s, has been for the last year or two the vocalist with Big Brother and the Holding Company, a rock quintet of superior electric expertise. Shortly she will be merely Janis Joplin, a vocalist singing folk rock on her first album as a single. Whatever she does and whatever she sings she'll <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well</b> because her vocal talents are boundless. This is the way she came across in a huge, high-ceilinged roller skating rink without any acoustics but, thankfully a good enough sound system behind her. In a proper room, I would imagine there would be no adjectives to describe her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Ewbank {{was seen}} as a humble coach who had {{a good sense of humor}} and tried to stay out of the spotlight. He could also be harsh with his players, however. Before the 1958 {{championship}} game, he gave a speech telling his stars they needed to improve and had barely made the team. Unitas, he said, was obtained [...] "with a seventy-five-cent phone call" [...] and Ameche wasn't liked or wanted. Ewbank was not universally liked by his players. Second-string running back Jack Call later said the team won [...] "in spite of, not because of" [...] Ewbank. Other players saw him as overly easygoing, saying that while he was able to build teams up, he became too relaxed once he reached the top. [...] Hall of Famer Raymond Berry stated in his book All the Moves I Had [...] "What it amounts to is that Ewbank knew exactly what he wanted his team to do and how to get them to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>well..</b> [...] Being under Weeb's system was the number one reason why Unitas and I had the careers we had." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{need not}} be afraid to speak," [...] said Ethel, [...] "for she always <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>well</b> and winningly. I have seen her give a reproof in so firm and kind a way, and so bright in the instant of forgiveness." ...|$|R
