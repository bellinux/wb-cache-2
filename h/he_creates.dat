5|$|The series focuses upon deputy {{headteacher}} Eric Slatt (David Bamber), permanently stressed {{over the}} chaos <b>he</b> <b>creates</b> both {{by himself and}} some of his eccentric staff. His wife Janet (Geraldine Fitzgerald) and new English teacher Suzy Travis (Nicola Walker) attempt to help him solve the problems.|$|E
5|$|By {{trapping}} initially and blackmailing later, Shankar gets hold of Delhi Suri with whose help, <b>he</b> <b>creates</b> a {{rift between}} Damodar and Nagaraju {{which leads to}} the latter's murder. By blackmailing Sukanya that they would reveal her past to Damodar, they trap Mallikharjun with her help and accuse him of a rape attempt on Sukanya. However, the fact that Mallikharjun was gay, which was concealed by him for a long time, was believed by none. He is murdered by eating poisoned food.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 {{he joined}} the team of {{collaborators}} of El Jueves, for which <b>he</b> <b>created</b> the character of Urbano. Alongside José Luis Agreda <b>he</b> <b>created</b> for that magazine the strip Jaula Magna with jokes about the university world. For the children's magazine Míster K <b>he</b> <b>created,</b> alongside EnriqueCarlos, the strip Harry Pórrez, a Harry Potter parody. Also for El Jueves <b>he</b> <b>created</b> the series Los Ilegales, a satirical view {{of the problems of}} the illegal immigrants in Spain.|$|R

50|$|<b>He</b> <b>created</b> two- and {{three-dimensional}} art {{and when}} <b>he</b> <b>created</b> {{the statue of}} Nelson he agreed that the sum would be given to charity.|$|R
5|$|By {{virtue of}} this variety and his interfusion of Western, Indian folk and Carnatic elements, Ilaiyaraaja's {{compositions}} {{appeal to the}} Indian rural dweller for its rhythmic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic Ragas, and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound. Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, <b>he</b> <b>creates</b> the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E
5|$|Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket {{walk down}} a winding path in search of Riku and King Mickey. A man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive {{fortress}} called Castle Oblivion. Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have forgotten all of their abilities. The hooded man explains that the deeper {{they go into the}} castle, the more memories they will lose, but they will also uncover new memories in the process. <b>He</b> <b>creates</b> a deck of cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.|$|E
5|$|The sculpture's roughly cubical {{arrangement}} cleverly {{ensures that}} the overall composition retains a harmonious equilibrium. It is lightened by the artist dispensing with a back slab and incorporating negative space into the piece. By putting {{the children in the}} place of Seneb's legs, the artist adds to the sense of symmetry. <b>He</b> <b>creates</b> the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure, preserving an appearance of normality without disguising Seneb's unusual physique. The family's names and titles are given in inscriptions placed {{on either side of the}} children and on the horizontal face of the base.|$|E

5|$|Theatre also greatly {{influenced}} Alejo Carpentier's work. In all his work, Carpentier uses the characters <b>he</b> <b>creates</b> {{to explore the}} notions of subjectivity and identity, analyzing {{the way in which}} individuals see themselves and others within cultural settings. In order to achieve such an analysis, Carpentier makes use of spectatorship: his characters perceive a spectacle in alterable ways which parallel their alterable ways of experiencing the world. Spectacle situations are also sometimes used by Carpentier as a tool for the characters to reframe and rethink the world, as well as to establish individual and group identity.|$|E
5|$|ABA Games' sole developer, Kenta Cho, {{began writing}} {{games as a}} child during the 1980s using the NEC PC-6001 microcomputer, as there were few commercially {{available}} games. After leaving university, Cho contemplated professional games development but ultimately instead joined Toshiba to work in multimedia research and development. He continues to work full-time for Toshiba while running ABA Games as a hobby, working mainly on weekends. Cho is the sole contributor to ABA Games. Lacking musical training, <b>he</b> <b>creates</b> the soundtracks to his games using commercially available, pre-made samples. ABA Games releases a game approximately every six months, with {{the first three months}} spent creating prototypes and the latter three spent refining a finished version.|$|E
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that <b>he</b> <b>creates,</b> Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
50|$|For children, <b>He</b> <b>created</b> {{the retired}} magician Kinkar Kishore Ray, alias Kikira who solved mysteries {{with his two}} assistants. <b>He</b> <b>created</b> another detective {{character}} called Victor.|$|R
50|$|In 1914 he {{returned}} to Russia and in 1918 he moved to Yekaterinburg where <b>he</b> <b>created</b> his monumental works of art. In 1921 he moved to Novorossiysk, then to Batumi. Living there, <b>he</b> <b>created</b> portraits of Lenin, Marx and Engels, many cultural workers of Georgia. In 1923 he lived in Baku, where <b>he</b> <b>created</b> in monumental genre.|$|R
50|$|He {{began on}} school stages in 1999. <b>He</b> <b>created</b> his first school stage play called Unity, which {{was his own}} script. Thereafter <b>he</b> <b>created</b> many stage plays and participated to many school drama competitions.|$|R
5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day, a brown bear strolls {{onto the streets}} of Springfield, frightening the town. The bear is eventually subdued by the police. Homer convinces Springfield that {{something needs to be}} done to protect them from bears, and the town takes their complaint to Mayor Quimby, who gives in easily. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created. Homer is then shocked to see taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the patrol, and this warrants another visit by the town to the Mayor's office. To appease them, Mayor Quimby blames the high taxes on illegal immigrants. <b>He</b> <b>creates</b> Proposition 24, which will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.|$|E
5|$|Paul prefers {{playing in}} the half court versus playing up-tempo. <b>He</b> <b>creates</b> scoring {{opportunities}} by constantly changing speeds; upon beating his defender one-on-one or shedding him in the pick-and-roll, he will often slow down and box him out, denying him from regaining front side position and forcing the defense to help at all times. His ability to penetrate deep into the paint leads to easy shots for his teammates, and in 2013 he was second {{in the league in}} assisted three pointers. As a playmaker, he is noted for his consistently high assist-to-turnover ratio, averaging just 2.4 turnovers per game over his career. A deft midrange shooter, he is especially proficient from the right elbow, leading the league in shooting percentage from that area in 2015. On defense, he aggravates opponents with active hands and high effort, and has been ranked {{as one of the best}} perimeter defenders in the NBA.|$|E
5|$|Ra's {{enemies are}} {{the forces of}} chaos, which {{threaten}} maat, the cosmic order that <b>he</b> <b>creates.</b> They include both humans who spread disorder and cosmic powers like Apep, the embodiment of chaos, whom Ra and the gods who accompany him in his barque are said to combat every night. The malevolent gaze of Apep's own Eye is a potent weapon against Ra, and Ra's Eye {{is one of the}} few powers that can counteract it. Some unclear passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that Apep was thought capable of injuring or stealing the Eye of Ra from its master during the combat. In other texts, the Eye's fiery breath assists in Apep's destruction. This apotropaic function of the Eye of Ra is another point of overlap with the Eye of Horus, which was similarly believed to ward off evil.|$|E
50|$|As governor, <b>he</b> <b>created</b> {{unemployment}} insurance and, after {{the repeal of}} prohibition, <b>he</b> <b>created</b> Virginia's Alcohol Beverage Control board. In 1936, Governor Peery signed into law the act that created the Virginia State Parks.|$|R
50|$|Törnström {{worked for}} a time as a {{furniture}} carver; <b>he</b> <b>created</b> works for the Stockholm Royal Palace until 1781; <b>he</b> <b>created</b> carvings for ships. Most likely, Törnström became acquainted with af Chapman during this time.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2009 <b>he</b> <b>created</b> Urban Vani, a {{community}} project bringing together beatboxing and South Asian Dance. In 2012, <b>he</b> <b>created</b> a new Indian beatboxing orchestra called [...] "Voctronica" [...] {{in collaboration with}} the British Council.|$|R
5|$|Recuerdos de Provincia (Recollections of a Provincial Past), 1850. In {{this second}} autobiography, Sarmiento {{displays}} a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, {{in contrast to}} Mi defensa, choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. Recuerdos discusses his Similar to Facundo, Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing Recuerdos and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory. Sarmiento's persuasion in this book is substantial. The accounts, whether all true or false against him, {{are a source of}} information to write Recuerdos as he is then able to object and rectify into what <b>he</b> <b>creates</b> as a 'true account' of autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Springfield Elementary School teacher Mrs. Edna Krabappel feels {{increasingly}} isolated and, {{looking for}} a companion, places a personal ad in the newspaper. A yo-yo craze sweeps through the school after a group of four demonstrate {{the potential of the}} toys. Bart breaks the class fish tank with his yo-yo, and is given one month of detention by Edna. While snooping in her desk to take back his yo-yo, he discovers her personal ad, and decides to get revenge on her pulling a prank and responding by mail. <b>He</b> <b>creates</b> a new adult male alter ego named Woodrow, after former President Woodrow Wilson. Edna responds by sending a suggestive photograph. Bart writes a response to Edna, using lines from a old love letter Homer had sent Marge.|$|E
5|$|The Stranges {{become a}} popular couple in London. Lady Pole and Strange's wife, Arabella, become friends and during one of her visits Arabella meets the gentleman with thistle-down hair, whom she assumes is a relative. The Cabinet ministers find Strange {{easier to deal with}} than Norrell, and they send him to assist the Duke of Wellington on his Peninsular Campaign. For over a year, Strange helps the army: <b>he</b> <b>creates</b> roads, moves towns, and makes dead men speak. After he returns, he fails to cure George III's madness, {{although}} Strange manages to save the king from the gentleman with thistle-down hair, who is determined to make Stephen a king. Strange then helps defeat Napoleon at the horrific Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
5000|$|Zappa {{has written}} some light novels. <b>He</b> <b>created</b> {{one for the}} Chocosis series with MF Bunko J titled [...] "Chocotto Sister: Four seasons". Then with Dengeki Bunko <b>he</b> <b>created</b> two adaptations for the Please! anime series: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>created</b> {{some new}} and {{developed}} known non-linear effects and qualities. For this purpose <b>he</b> <b>created</b> methods for investigation of essentially non-linear dynamical systems. <b>He</b> <b>created</b> methods based on non-linear phenomena which enable to transform vibrations, waves and energy into continuous motions or motions of desirable type that are one-dimensional or multi-dimensional. <b>He</b> <b>created</b> new methods and means for experimental investigations, basis for creation of systems {{the operation of}} {{which is based on}} new principles. The created systems ensure high precision of positioning of bodies in space, of performing complicated trajectories and laws of motions and of ensuring the prescribed stable shapes of systems.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, <b>he</b> <b>created</b> the Turner Foundation, {{which focuses}} on philanthropic grants in {{environment}} and population. In the same year <b>he</b> <b>created</b> Captain Planet, an environmental superhero. Turner produced two TV series with him as featured character.|$|R
5|$|The series {{features}} {{the exploits of}} Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosbie. Wilson initially turned down the part of Meldrew and David Renwick considered Les Dawson for the role, until Wilson changed his mind. The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems <b>he</b> <b>creates</b> for himself. Set in a typical suburb in southern England, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. Indoor scenes were filmed at BBC Television Centre with most exterior scenes filmed on Tresillian Way in Walkford on the Dorset/Hampshire border. Despite its traditional production, the series subverts its domestic sitcom setting with elements of black humour and surrealism.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five years pass, and Pulikecei is now {{the king}} of Cholapuram Paalayam. As foretold, he is foolish as well as lecherous. He is a puppet {{in the hands of}} Sangilimayan, who collaborates with the British for his own {{personal}} gain, and does not attend {{to the needs of the}} people of his kingdom. Pulikecei also tortures his subjects. <b>He</b> <b>creates</b> an outdoor stadium for different castes to fight against each other and punishes his palace guards even when they make the slightest of mistakes; he also uses his guards as targets for shooting practice. Ukraputhan, now an educated revolutionary, collaborates with his friends to overthrow the British. Ukraputhan falls in love with Vasantha Sundari, who reciprocates his feelings. When Ukraputhan tries to kill Pulikecei, he is shocked to see that they look alike.|$|E

To save {{the land from}} Sangilimayan and the British, Ukraputhan captures Pulikecei and trades places with him as the king whilst sending Pulikecei to prison. As the king, Ukraputhan joins Agandamuthu, the commander-in-chief, and helps brings about new reforms. He {{converts}} the palace harem into a playground and helps fund and provide {{for the education of}} children; to grow crops, <b>he</b> <b>creates</b> fertile land for tilling the soil. In a break with past policies of the kingdom, Ukraputhan refuses to pay tributes and taxes demanded by the British. Bhavani Ammaiyar praises Ukraputhan's reforms, unaware that Ukraputhan is disguised as Pulikecei. In jail, Pulikecei is taken care of by Soolayini, who provides refreshments to the soldiers. Eventually, the two fall in love.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{worked to}} {{decrease}} the influence of Spanish cardinals in the College of Cardinals. <b>He</b> <b>created</b> five French cardinals, and the Italian cardinals <b>he</b> <b>created</b> were considered neutral. Clement wanted the French cardinals that <b>he</b> <b>created</b> {{to be present in}} Rome and {{to take part in the}} governance of the Church. Henry IV also demanded that three French cardinals go to Rome, and they were present at Clement's death on 3 March 1605.|$|R
50|$|Other roles <b>he</b> <b>created</b> were Adel-Muza in Giuseppe Apolloni’s L’ebreo in La Fenice, (1857) and Galieno in Errico Petrella’s Morosina ovvero L'ultimo de' Falieri in Naples (1860).
