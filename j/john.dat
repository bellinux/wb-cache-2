5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} over the northeastern Pacific Ocean forced <b>John</b> westward, where upper level wind shear kept <b>John</b> a tropical storm. Intensity fluctuated considerably, however, as shear levels varied. More than once, shear cleared away {{most of the}} clouds above <b>John</b> and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical depression. However, after eight days of slow westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, shear lessened greatly on August 19, and <b>John</b> intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and August 20, <b>John</b> further strengthened from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a major Category 3 hurricane. Around 1100 PDT on August 20, it crossed into the central Pacific, {{the first of three}} basin crosses <b>John</b> would make.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the central Pacific, <b>John</b> left the area {{monitored by the}} NHC and was instead monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). As it moved slowly westward, Hurricane <b>John</b> continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the Hawaiian Islands; on 22 August <b>John</b> was designated a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii Standard Time) reached its peak winds of 175 miles per hour (280 km/h). Also on August 22 (by Hawaii Standard Time), <b>John</b> made its closest approach to the Hawaiian Islands, 345 miles (500 km) to the south. <b>John</b> had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept <b>John</b> on its southerly path. Nonetheless, heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of <b>John</b> affected the islands.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>John</b> was the Count of Poitou and {{therefore}} the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned <b>John</b> to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. <b>John</b> was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that he need not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning <b>John</b> not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status. When <b>John</b> still refused to come, Philip declared <b>John</b> in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – {{with the exception of}} Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against <b>John.</b>|$|E

5|$|Barrymore's {{achievements}} and his colorful life have ensured that several biographical studies followed his 1926 autobiography, Confessions of an Actor. Alma Power-Waters produced a 1941 study, {{authorized by the}} subject, <b>John</b> Barrymore: The Legend and the Man; Fowler, wrote Good Night, Sweet Prince: The Life and Times of <b>John</b> Barrymore (1943); Alpert published The Barrymores (1964); and <b>John</b> Kobler wrote Damned in Paradise: The Life of <b>John</b> Barrymore (1977), although Norden noted in 2000 {{that many of these}} earlier works are less than reliable. Those he identified as being more thoroughly researched are Peters' 1990 history, The House of Barrymore, and his own study of the actor's work in <b>John</b> Barrymore: A Bio-Bibliography (1995). Subsequent to Norden's comments on the available literature, Morrison published the positively reviewed <b>John</b> Barrymore, Shakespearean Actor in 1997, which focuses on Barrymore's stage work.|$|E

5|$|Clearing Johnston Atoll, <b>John</b> {{turned to}} the {{northwest}} and began strengthening again as shear decreased. On August 27 local time, <b>John</b> reached a secondary peak strength of 135 miles per hour (210 km/h), and shortly thereafter it crossed the International Date Line at approximately 22° N and came under the surveillance of the Guam branch of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).

Immediately after crossing the Date Line, <b>John</b> again weakened and its forward motion stalled. By September 1, <b>John</b> had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the Date Line. There, <b>John</b> lingered for six days while performing a multi-day counterclockwise loop.
