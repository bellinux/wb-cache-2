40|$|<b>High-lift</b> <b>configurations</b> {{are often}} a {{challenge}} for numerical simulation once {{it comes to the}} prediction of maximum lift. This {{is not so much a}} problem of the separated flowin the wing and slat coves, which are rather confined, but of the pressure induced separation taking place on the upper flap surface. With respect to a Scale-Resolving Simulation (SRS) this kind of separation is certainly prone to the grey area issue, while due to the recirculation of turbulent eddies the cove flowis mainly treatable by standard SRS approaches like DDES. Other important aspects in the frame of SRS and the grey area are the shear layers leaving the trailing edges of all airfoil elements contributing to noise (especially in the case of the slat) and themixing of shear layers with wakes.

The removal of the external fairings for the Fowler flap mechanism could help to reduce drag by 3. 3 counts. The main challenge is to develop an AFC system that can provide the necessary lift recovery on a simple hinged flap high-lift system while using the limited pneumatic power available on the aircraft. Innovative low-power AFC concepts will be investigated in the flap shoulder region. The AFC concepts being explored include steady blowing and unsteady blowing operating in the spatial and/or temporal domain. Both conventional and AFC-enabled <b>high-lift</b> <b>configurations</b> were designed for the current effort.

Large-eddy simulations (LES) were performed for turbulent ow around a wing under the in uence from engine jet ow by solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations using an in-horse high-order finite difference code. Simulations were performed for jet under both a clean wing and the wing at <b>high-lift</b> <b>configuration.</b> Installation effects {{on both the}} jet and the wing are analysed by comparing with LES results performed for three baseline cases: jet along, clean wing along and the wing in <b>high-lift</b> <b>configuration.</b> It is found that the flow is two-dimensional near {{the leading edge of}} the wing. Further down-stream three-dimensional ow features are developed. Interaction with vortical jet stream accelerates developments of the ow underneath the wing. Stronger turbulent structures are seen within the jet shear layer near the wing and their interaction with the wing causes surface pressure uctuations, which results in increased radiated noise. Interaction with the jet causes a reduction in lift for the clean wing, however the contribution from the flap is increased when the wing is in <b>high-lift</b> <b>configuration.</b> For the current geometry the jet stream does not hit the clean wing, and it is shifted towards the wing by a small angle (one degree) due to low pressure region under the wing.

For this purpose, a three-segment variable camber airfoil employed as a performance adaptive aeroelastic wing shaping control effector for a NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM) in landing and take-off configurations is considered. The objective of the study is to define optimal high-lift VCCTEF settings and VCK settings/configurations. A total of 224 combinations of VCK settings/configurations and VCCTEF settings are considered for the inboard GTM wing, where the VCCTEFs are configured as a Fowler flap that forms a slot between the VCCTEF and the main wing. For the VCK settings of deflection angles of 55 deg, 60 deg and 65 deg, 18, 19 and 19 vck configurations, respectively, were considered for each of the 4 different VCCTEF deflection settings. Different vck configurations were defined by varying the horizontal and vertical distance of the vck from the main wing.

Fairly good agreements are obtained in these comparisons although viscous effects are all neglected in the calculation. In particular, the computed results of the JAXA <b>high-lift</b> <b>configuration</b> model indicate that trailing vortices from various high lift devices are clearly captured even in the downstream region, where vortices are likely to be vanished due to inherent numerical viscosity in the conventional unstructured mesh methods. This clearly demonstrates that the present high order unstructured mesh method is capable of capturing various flow features quite accurately while it retains the desired geometrical flexibility. It is also shown that the developed code achieves high computing performance on the Earth Simulator and exhibits a potential for future large scale computations...|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} programme was initiated to examine three candidate high-lift technologies, which would, if implemented, simplify the mechanical {{complexity of the}} multiple component trailing-edge devices traditionally employed on civil transport aircraft. Experimental studies were undertaken {{with the aim of}} examining each technology in terms of its potential to favourably influence boundary layer development and improve the aerodynamic characteristics of a <b>high-lift</b> <b>configuration.</b> Preliminary studies of triangular serrated geometries, at the trailing edge of a modified flat plate, highlighted that the ability of the serrations to favourably influence the flow field development over an aft positioned single slotted flap was critically dependent upon the flap lap/gap and deflection angle. Under the test conditions, the serrations were most effective at low flap deflection angles, particularly serrations with a length corresponding to 13 % flap chord. Extending these studies to a representative <b>high-lift</b> <b>configuration</b> significantly limited the range of flap laps/gaps and deflection angles over which the serrations were favourable. Furthermore, oil flow visualisation provided evidence of wake structures emanating from serration vertices, corroborating earlier hypotheses and suggesting the flow mechanism by which serrations favourably influenced boundary layer development over the upper surface of the downstream flap. Experiments indicated that when optimised, blowing tangentially from a slot at the trailing edge of the main element over the upper surface of a flap within a three-element <b>high-lift</b> <b>configuration,</b> provided a highly effective means of preventing boundary layer separation and increasing lift. This was corroborated by oil flow visualisation and computational simulations. Maintaining the same momentum coefficient and blowing through discrete orifices at the trailing edge of the main element, proved highly favourable, heightening the increment in lift in comparison to the corresponding tangential slot blowing configuration. Hence, the mass flow rate could be reduced in comparison to the tangential slot blowing configuration, without compromising the aerodynamic performance.
