50|$|Horizontal {{windlasses}} offer several advantages. The unit {{tends to}} be more self-contained, protecting the machinery from the corrosive environment found on boats. The dual wheels also allow two anchors on <b>double</b> <b>rollers</b> to be serviced. Vertical capstans, for their part, allow the machinery to be placed below decks, thus lowering the center of gravity (important on boats), and also allow a flexible angle of pull (which means rope or chain can be run out to different fair leads).|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} wooden {{roller coaster}} {{was a single}} track in a figure eight, which operated beginning in 1903. The Giant Coaster was built in 1913, and Ingersoll's Derby Racer in 1914. It was soon renamed the Jack Rabbit Derby Racer. Jack Rabbit was a <b>double</b> wooden-track <b>roller</b> coaster with an 80 percent drop, and it stood out as the most popular ride at the park {{and was one of}} only two <b>double</b> track <b>roller</b> coasters in the country.|$|R

50|$|The mill {{itself is}} powered by a 20-horsepower water turbine that has a 40-horsepower steam engine back-up when the water level is low. The mill has three {{separate}} plants in it. The main plant is a “three stand” <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> mill that produced wheat flour and is located on all three floors. A single stand triple roller milling plant was added to mill corn. It includes a set of 36 in grindstones to produce Buckwheat flour.|$|E
5000|$|The six-cylinder 2½-litre engine has {{inclined}} {{overhead valves}} {{on either side}} of the cylinder head. They are opened by rockers operated by a single overhead camshaft which is driven by <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> chain. The S.U. carburettor is bolted to the cylinder head which may be removed with the valve train without affecting engine timing. The crankshaft has been given four bearings. The pistons are of aluminium and the connecting rods are steel. Cooling water circulates by pump.|$|E
5000|$|The revised chassis {{was again}} made of {{box section steel}} and was {{cruciform}} braced. The side members rose over the rear axle and were not underslung like the Consort. The suspension was independent at the front using coil springs but retained traditional leaf springs and live axle at the rear. Automatic chassis lubrication continued to be fitted, operating [...] "thermostatically every time the engine warm(ed) up", and the propeller-shaft centre bearing was [...] "prepacked with grease" [...] so did not require lubrication. [...] However, the propeller shaft itself was not served by the system and four grease points required [...] "attention every 1,000 miles". Worm and <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> steering was used. The Regency's hybrid Girling hydro-mechanical brakes were upgraded to fully hydraulic during production of the Regency II.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{pressure}} angle {{is one of}} the primary considerations in designing a cam mechanism since an inappropriate angle may cause excessive sliding loads on the follower. This paper presents a simple yet straightforward method for the design and analysis of a cam mechanism with a translating follower having <b>double</b> <b>rollers.</b> In the proposed approach, conjugate surface theory is employed to derive a kinematic model of the cam mechanism. Analytical expressions for the {{pressure angle}} is then derived. The validity of the analytical expressions is confirmed by machining a designed cam using a 3 -axis CNC machine too...|$|R

5000|$|The {{park was}} inaugurated as Parque Interama on September 21, 1982. Its sixty attractions {{included}} the Aconcagua roller coaster, the Scorpion double giant wheel, Vertigorama <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> coaster, Aerogondolas (the longest Sky Ride in Latin America), the musical fountain, and a miniature railway circulating {{around the perimeter}} of the park. The observation tower reached 208 m (682 ft) upon topping out in 1981, and remained the tallest free-standing structure in Argentina until 2015. The park struggled with setbacks from before its opening, The 1980 bankruptcy of the chief stockholder in Interama, Banco Sidesa, delayed the inaugural. Interama's estimated US$ 100 million in bad debts prompted the administration of Mayor Julio César Saguier to revoke the lease, and sue Interama, upon the 1983 return of democracy. The park was then renamed as the Parque de la Ciudad (City Park) in December of that year.|$|E
5000|$|The Leyland Royal Tiger was an underfloor-engined heavyweight {{single deck}} {{bus or coach}} chassis, and sold well in the United Kingdom and {{overseas}} from launch. [...] "Overseas" [...] versions differed greatly from home market models. Upon launch in 1950 this was the fourth new marque of post-war Leyland single deck bus chassis since 1945. It used the same units as the Leyland-MCW Olympic but with a substantial steel ladder-frame chassis generally straight in elevation but with an up-sweep over the rear axle, to which operators could fit a coach-built body of their choice with the passenger floor about 3 ft above the road surface. The flexibly-mounted Leyland 0.600H horizontal engine was mounted {{in the middle of}} the chassis frame, driving back through a unit mounted single-plate clutch and four-speed gearbox with synchromesh on second, third, and top, or later only on third and top, to a spiral-bevel rear axle. Steering was unassisted Marles cam and <b>double</b> <b>roller,</b> all component assemblies (save for some special export orders) were built by Leyland and were proven, having been previously used in the Tiger PS2 and/or Olympic.|$|E
50|$|The {{blood pump}} was {{patented}} in 1855 by Porter and Bradley and was hand operated. A modification first named surgical pump, designed and manufactured by E. E. Allen in 1887, {{was intended for}} direct blood transfusion. Truax, who also distributed and promoted the Allen pump with one roller, developed the first <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pump in 1899. In the following decades, several researchers, including Beck, Van Allen, Bayliss and Müller as well as Henry and Jouvelet, refined the apparatus and recommended the use of roller pumps for blood transfusion and other applications. After further modifications made by DeBakey in 1934, and application of this pump {{in one of the}} first heart-lung machines constructed by Gibbon, DeBakey's name became inseparably attached to this type of pump. For perfusion experiments, an electrically powered roller pump was first used by Fleisch in 1935. Today, the roller pump is the most frequently used blood pump for cardiopulmonary bypass worldwide, having prevailed against the early pulsatile tube compression pumps and ventricular pumps. In recent years, centrifugal pumps have increasingly competed with roller pumps as systemic blood pumps for cardiopulmonary bypass and have become the preferred arterial pump in a variety of centers. Application of mechanical cardiac assistance has evolved from nonpulsatile roller pump support, followed by an era of pulsatile ventricular pumps to the rediscovery of the nonpulsatile flow mode with modern axial flow pumps.|$|E
5000|$|In {{awarding}} Leavitt's new machine a {{gold medal}} at its 1881 exhibition, the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association noted that Leavitt's subsequent improvements on his original patent had perfected the earlier postal card cancelling machine, [...] "allowing letters of large or small size, either thick or thin, to be operated on to perfection." [...] A number of improvements, including a feeder box, a system of <b>double</b> <b>rollers</b> and a movable impression shaft meant that Leavitt's new invention {{could be used for}} all manners of letters, instead of for just a standard-sized card. [...] "The machine works to perfection," [...] the judges noted, [...] "and saves a great deal of labor." ...|$|R

40|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) with a {{centrifugal pump}} requires a certain flow rate; therefore, its application for low body weight infants is frequently accompanied by oxygenator membrane malfunction and/or inadequate perfusion. To prevent low-flow associated complications, we report {{a case in}} which a novel system of dual roller pumps was used. A baby girl with a body mass index 0. 25 m 2, who experienced difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass after a Norwood-like operation, required an ECMO. Concerns for the tube lifespan reduction due to roller pump friction led to the use of a <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pump circulation. The termination of ECMO during tube exchange is not needed, because circulation is maintained by another roller pump. The novel strategy of ECMO with <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pumps will allow low perfusion rate to provide adequate circulatory support for low body weight patients...|$|E

The recorded arthroscopies were analyzed for the presence of bleeding episodes with a special computer program that automatically detects the tinctures of red-colored blood. A least 20 % of an arthroscopic image had to be covered with blood to qualify as bleeding episode. The median (min-max) presence of bleeding episodes {{as a percentage of the}} operation time was 6. 6 % (0. 0 - 43. 6 %) for gravity infusion, 3. 7 % (0. 2 - 46. 4 %) for the single roller, and 3. 3 % (0. 0 - 19. 3 %) for the <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pump, respectively. The large variation could be attributed to the occurrence of arterial bleeding episodes during some procedures. No significant differences were found between the irrigation systems. For a subgroup including acromioplasties and releases, significant differences were found in favor of both roller pumps (P < 0. 05). Overall, the roller pumps did not outperform gravity infusion. However, from the results, high-risk procedures for bleeding episodes were identified (acromioplasty and release of a frozen shoulder) that can benefit from the use of roller pumps. A clear view is essential to perform an arthroscopic procedure safely and efficientl...|$|E
