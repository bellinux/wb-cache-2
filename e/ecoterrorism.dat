50|$|On 8 February 2004 a spill of 13,000 litres {{of diesel}} fuel was discovered, {{resulting}} in a 2-kilometre spill which closed the fiord for two days while intensive cleanup activities were completed. Apparently a hose was used to displace the fuel from the tanks {{of one of the}} tour vessels, and various government officials claimed it appeared to be an act of <b>ecoterrorism</b> motivated by rising numbers of tourists to the park, though more details did not become known. The spill was removed and wildlife impact appears minimal.|$|E

5000|$|The Public Interest Watch {{report was}} also covered by Marc Levin, {{a lawyer and}} {{president}} of the American Freedom Center. After reviewing a number of incidents of damage to property attributed to the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front, Levin sought to equate Greenpeace with <b>ecoterrorism.</b> [...] "While these acts of ecoterror are clearly illegal, few people realize that the money used to commit many of these crimes may have been illegally laundered through tax-exempt organizations whose donors - individuals and nonprofit foundations unaware of the laundering - receive tax deductions," [...] he wrote in the New Jersey Law Journal.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of October 19, 1998 {{a group of people}} part of the Earth Liberation Front set fires to several lifts and {{buildings}} at Vail Ski Resort.

The fires were set at Two Elk Lodge, and destroyed multiple buildings on Vail Mountain, including Two Elk Restaurant. In 2006, Chelsea Dawn Gerlach and Stanislas Gregory Meyerhoff both pleaded guilty to the attacks. Josephine Sunshine Overaker remains at large and is on the FBI's list of Most Wanted Terrorists.|$|E
50|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Cambridge, Hardwick moved to Finland in 1969. He started his career {{as the voice of}} the English {{language}} school tapes of Finnish primary and high schools in the middle 1970s, and to the children of the 1960s and 1970s he became famous as the policeman of the children's language program Hello Hello Hello (1975). Hardwick's reputation as a Finnish director and keen-eyed depictor of the Finnish lifestyle stems from the YLE TV2 comedy series Tankki täyteen and Reinikainen. In Reinikainen, the protagonist is an elderly single policeman from the countryside, who is transferred to a city, where his verbal skill, cunning and nonchalant attitude often defuses dramatic situations and saves the day. His most artistically ambitious work is the TV series Pakanamaan kartta, dealing with total short term memory loss and <b>ecoterrorism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Set in {{the year}} 2038, Earth is a cautionary tale of the harm humans can cause their planet via {{disregard}} for the environment and reckless scientific experiments. The book has a large cast of characters and Brin uses them to address a number of environmental issues, including endangered species, global warming, refugees from ecological disasters, <b>ecoterrorism,</b> and the social effects of overpopulation. The plot of the book involves an artificially created black hole which has {{been lost in the}} Earth's interior and the attempts to recover it before it destroys the planet. The events and revelations which follow reshape humanity and its future in the universe. It also includes a war pitting most of the Earth against Switzerland, fueled by outrage over the Swiss allowing generations of kleptocrats to hide their stolen wealth in the country's banks.|$|E

5000|$|Poison Ivy {{appears in}} the {{animated}} TV series The Batman, voiced by Piera Coppola. This incarnation is complete with a new origin and rose-like hairstyle and dress as well as stronger ties to Barbara Gordon. Pamela Isley is {{a high school student}} and environmental activist. Despite Jim Gordon's protests, as she was sentenced to a youth detention center repeatedly for delinquent acts during her protests, she is Barbara's best friend. She convinces Barbara to help her with [...] "protests" [...] which were actually scouting missions on polluting companies for her hired mercenary, the corporate saboteur Temblor (voiced by Jim Cummings). She uses a voice scrambler in order to recruit Temblor to carry out her missions of <b>ecoterrorism.</b> During one such mission, the plant mutagen [...] "chlorogene" [...] falls on her during a battle between Temblor and the Batman. She awakes in an ambulance afterward and manifests powers similar to her other incarnations, most notably psionic plant control, and an ability to exhale mind-controlling spores when she blows a kiss at her desired target. She swiftly turns her powers to furthering her ecoterrorist career, and takes the 'Poison Ivy' name before being stopped by Batman and Batgirl. In the fifth-season premiere, she is forced into helping Lex Luthor take control of Superman by using her mind-controlling spores and lacing them with Kryptonite dust.|$|E
40|$|During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the {{retreating}} Iraqis caused the deliberate discharge of six {{million barrels of}} oil into the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. The immediate impact on the ecosystem was dramatic, and, because of the intense media coverage of the conflict, highly visible to the American public. The spill popularized the term 2 ̆ 7 <b>ecoterrorism</b> 2 ̆ 7 and raised serious questions about the applicability of international law to the situation. There are numerous conventions that seek to establish standards of due diligence for the prevention of accidental pollution and to impose civil liability on those who damage the environment, but these conventions govern the relations of peaceful nations and their applicability in wartime situations is problematic. Only recently have efforts been made to address this issue, and to set forth some protective measures specifically designed to prevent widespread environmental devastation during armed conflict...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade and a half, North America has seen a rash of {{environmentally}} motivated arsons. One group in particular, the clandestine Earth Liberation Front (ELF), has targeted ski resorts, genetic research labs, SUV dealerships, and forestry buildings, leading James Jarboe of the FBI to declare the ELF the "number one" domestic terrorist threat facing the USA. This article analyses the social construction of the "ecoterrorist threat" {{in the pages of the}} New York Times. Various stakeholders-including ELF spokespersons, moderate environmentalists, corporate interests, and state agencies-have sought to influence the way that media covers the ELF. Ultimately, much to the chagrin of ELF spokespersons, discourses of <b>ecoterrorism</b> have normalized in mainstream media, which regularly frames the spokespersons and activists as "dangerous clowns. " In turn, this coverage has prevented the expression of the ELF's ideology, foreclosing the potential for the mainstream media to represent as legitimate the concerns of the ELF. I argue that blame for this failure rests in part with certain implications of the ELF's organizational strategy of "leaderless resistance," which-unlike civil disobedience movements of the past-is predicated on having its actors remain unsympathetically faceless and nameless. © 2012 The Author(s).

40|$|<b>Ecoterrorism</b> – radical {{violent or}} {{destructive}} acts committed for environmental motives or on environmental targets – {{has been an}} under-studied domestic security concern in Canada. The seemingly intractable conflict between energy needs and environmental concerns, as exemplified by the recent series of pipeline bombings in northeastern British Columbia, has served to highlight the need for strategic thinking about this emerging threat. The question needs to be asked: {{who is responsible for}} responding to these kinds of security threats? The "'Canada First ' Defense strategy " lists terrorism response as one of the 6 core missions of the Canadian military. Does their mandate therefore extend to eco-terrorism, or are such acts better addressed as cases of civil disobedience, under the purview of the police and judiciary? We must consider the likely effectiveness of military responses for securing Canadian energy sources, particularly in the context of concerns about transnational as well as domestic eco-terrorists. This paper addresses this question and provides sets of scenarios to help guide the discussion regarding the kinds of security responses that are both necessary and feasible to address the security problem of eco-terrorism. i...|$|E
40|$|Political {{action on}} the cusp between social {{movements}} and militancy provides a robust test of universal theories of both collective action and terrorism. In particular, radical environ-mentalism and {{the new wave of}} <b>ecoterrorism</b> in the United States deserve social science con-sideration as one such radical cusp movement. Data on 84 ecoterrorist events in the United States, 1998 - 2005, from the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism’s Terrorism Incident Database are considered vis-à-vis previous theories to identify possible patterns. A methodology for research on clandestine organizations, the imputation of cells from incident data, is proposed. Analysis suggests that radicalism is a product of social movements and that it diffuses according to exogenous factors, in particular local political climates. Little support is found for theories of continued radicalization in militant movements, but some evidence in-dicates that a general life cycle of political violence exists. It seems a rule that broad social movements spawn radical fringes. While some radicals may return to a moderate stance, others veer into militancy and the use of political violence, such as the Black Panthers in the American Civil Rights movement or the Weather Underground of the anti-Vietnam war movement. The environmental movement also has its share of radicals, with direct action groups such as Greenpeace, the Sea Shepherd Society, and Earth First!. Since the early 1980 s, radicalism among environmentalists seemed mostly on the decline until a major fire at a Vail, Colorado ski resort in October 1998 sparked a wave of attention on the new “ecoterrorism. ” A formerly obscure group, the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) claimed the arson attack and seized national headlines with a communiqué: “This action is just a warning. We will be back if this greedy corporation continues to trespass into wild and unroaded areas...|$|E
