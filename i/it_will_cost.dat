Homer decides to call a foundation repairman and finds out that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> $8,500 for the repairs. Homer takes Marge to a party for the retirement of a Springfield Nuclear Power Plant employee. With a new position open at the power plant, Marge decides to apply for it {{to get the money}} for the foundation repair. With the help of Lisa, Marge gets the job at the power plant.|$|E

25|$|In September 2012, Feyenoord {{confirmed}} {{that there will}} arise a new stadium in 2018. The stadium will be built by builder VolkerWessels, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> around €300million (~£242million). Another option was a plan made by a consortium of BAM, Eneco Energie and Siemens. But the plan {{was rejected by the}} Feyenoord and Stadion Feijenoord direction. The new stadium should be a 63,000 all-seater. Despite the new plans, much of the supporters prefer a renovation of De Kuip. One of those initiatives are Red de Kuip, which is Dutch for Save de Kuip. They made plans of building a third tier on top of the current stadium, increasing the capacity to 68,000. This plan would cost only €117million (~£94million).|$|E
25|$|Forced to {{separate}} from the party, Noctis finally reaches the Crystal, only to be slowly pulled into it. Ardyn then appears and reveals himself to be Ardyn Lucis Caelum, a former healer and king of Lucis who was chosen by the Crystal two thousand years ago. Ardyn had saved Eos by absorbing the Daemons into himself, only to be demonized by Noctis’ ancestors. Rendered immortal by the Daemons' power and denied ascension by the Astrals, Ardyn has since sought revenge on the royal bloodline and the Crystal, hastening {{the onset of the}} Starscourge while waiting for the True King to appear so he could destroy them both. Within the Crystal, Noctis encounters the Astral Bahamut; he learns that he is the True King of prophecy, who will cleanse the Starscourge and restore light to Eos. Noctis prepares himself to fulfill his destiny, knowing that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> him his life; upon his return to the mortal realm, he finds that ten years have passed. He reunites with his friends, who have been keeping the Daemons at bay since Eos’ descent into eternal darkness, before heading to the ruins of Insomnia. After the party defeats the rogue Astral Ifrit, Noctis confronts Ardyn alone and kills him in single combat. Noctis then ascends the throne, and using the power of the Lucii and the Crystal's light sacrifices his life to purge the Starscourge and the Daemons from the world. In the spirit realm, Noctis—with the aid of Lunafreya and the Lucii—destroys Ardyn's spirit.|$|E
25|$|Belle {{has learned}} that the monster that took Robin was a Fury. Someone had used magic in Camelot to save Robin and did not pay the price, which is a life, and the monster has arrived to collect Robin's soul as payment. It {{will return to the}} Underworld when the moon reaches its zenith, but can be stopped if someone gives their life in his place. Regina confronts Emma, believing that she had summoned the Fury, but Emma reveals that Regina was the one {{responsible}} for its appearance. That night near the pond, the Fury begins pulling out Robin's soul, and Charon the boatman appears as the moon reaches its zenith. Regina sacrifices herself for Robin, and is joined by Mary Margaret, David, Leroy and Arthur. As all five band together, they successfully pull Robin from the Fury (and since the price of a single soul was equally divided among them), which disappears back into the underworld with Charon. While everyone celebrates this latest victory at Granny's, a worried Mary Margaret notes that if they win, Emma will lose. At Granny's, Henry introduces himself to Violet again and shows her what a jukebox is, and plays the same song he had played in Camelot, which, somehow, seems familiar to her. At her house, Emma opens the locked door and goes downstairs, at the behest of Rumplestiltskin's manifestation, revealing the stone with the sword Excalibur in it. Rumplestiltskin, the manifestation of her darkness, says that she can make it whole again and use it to vanquish all of the light forever. Emma tries to pull the sword from the stone but fails, being repelled by the sword's magic. After this failed attempt, the Dark One taunts her, and tells her that in order to complete the task, she will have to pay the price, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> someone dearly.|$|E

Sinha claimed that the film is based on not one distinct killing but many. He considered the film [...] "a protest against such traditions and practice".

500|$|In February 2013, the Association of Global Automakers and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which {{submitted}} a joint comment to the NHTSA, announced their {{support to the}} rule, but asked the NHTSA to find a noise level that effectively alerts pedestrians without being excessively loud to others {{inside and outside of}} the vehicle. They also commented that the rule is too complicated, unnecessarily prescriptive, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> more than necessary. Some automakers also said {{there is no need for}} electric-drive vehicles to play sounds while not in motion, [...] "since it is not clear that it helps pedestrians to hear cars that are stopped in traffic or parked."

500|$|The Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project's final {{construction}} project was straightening the Kissimmee River, a meandering -long river that was drained {{to make way}} for grazing land and agriculture. The C started building the C-38 canal in 1962 and the effects were seen almost immediately. Waterfowl, wading birds, and fish disappeared, prompting conservationists and sport fishers to demand the region be restored before the canal was finished in 1971. In general, C projects had been criticized for being temporary fixes that ignored future consequences, costing billions of dollars with no end in sight. After Governor Bob Graham initiated the Save Our Everglades campaign in 1983, the first section of the canal was backfilled in 1986. Graham announced that by 2000 the Everglades would be restored as closely as possible to its pre-drainage state. The Kissimmee River Restoration project was approved by Congress in 1992. It is estimated that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> $578million to convert only [...] of the canal.

A photograph of the Franklin River taken on one of these missions (and showing the construction road) was signed after the case by all the judges involved and a copy is displayed in the Australian National University College of Law staff library. On 1 July 2008, twenty five years after the High Court decision that saved the Franklin River an anniversary dinner was held at Hobart's Grand Chancellor Hotel where former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke stated that the campaign to protect the Franklin River had important lessons for the struggle against global warming: [...] "And as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983.
