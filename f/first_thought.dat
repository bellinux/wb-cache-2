5|$|The {{relationship}} between river flows and Murray cod recruitment {{are more complex}} than <b>first</b> <b>thought,</b> and in less regulated rivers, Murray cod {{may be able to}} recruit under a range of conditions including stable low flows. (Significant recruitment of Murray cod in low-flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven.) This information also suggests that nonriver-regulation-related causes of degradation are playing a larger role in the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae than first thought; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae to a much greater degree than first thought; and that decades of overfishing is playing a far larger role in the current state of Murray cod stocks, through depletion of spawning adults, than <b>first</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{the wife}} of Chicago {{publisher}} Horace O'Donoghue read him the news of Shepard's death {{four days after the}} event, he picked up a razor and slit his throat.

5|$|Apatodon mirus, {{based on}} a scrap of {{vertebra}} Marsh <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> to be a mammalian jaw, has been listed as a synonym of Allosaurus fragilis. However, it was considered indeterminate beyond Dinosauria by Dan Chure, and Mickey Mortimer believes that the synonymy of Apatodon with Allosaurus was due to correspondence to Ralph Molnar by John McIntosh, whereby the latter reportedly found a paper saying that Othniel Charles Marsh admitted that the Apatodon holotype was actually an allosaurid dorsal vertebra.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> about how this could be achieved was with liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Codex Zacynthius (designated by siglum Ξ or 040 in the Gregory-Aland numbering; A1 in von Soden) is a Greek New Testament codex, dated paleographically to the 6th century. <b>First</b> <b>thought</b> to {{have been}} written in the 8th century, it is a palimpsest—the {{original}} (lower) text was washed off its vellum pages and overwritten in the 12th or 13th century.

5|$|Garza {{lived with}} her parents, and on Saturday, April 16, 1960, she told them {{that she was going}} to {{confession}} at Sacred Heart Church in McAllen. Garza was often conspicuous in the congregation because of her striking appearance, and several parishioners remembered seeing Garza at the church that night. When Garza's parents did not hear from her that evening, they <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> that she had stayed at the church for midnight mass. When Garza did not return home by 3:00 am, Nicolas and Josefina went to the McAllen Police Department to report their daughter missing.|$|E

The right hand and lower body were found next day, but the statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. It is said that the only way the curse can be lifted is by returning his long-lost glasses and left hand.|$|E

5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. <b>First</b> <b>thought</b> to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar {{to the shape of}} pyramid, Borobudur was <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> more likely to have served as a stupa, instead of a temple. A stupa is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.|$|E

5|$|Diaby {{began the}} 2008–09 season {{late in the}} season after the thigh injury from the {{previous}} season was discovered to be more serious than <b>first</b> <b>thought.</b> He made his debut in the season on 18 October 2008 in a 3–1 win over Everton. Three days later, Diaby scored the third goal in a 5–2 Champions League group stage win over Fenerbahçe. He appeared regularly in the campaign {{for the first time in}} his Arsenal career. On 26 December 2008, Diaby scored his third career goal against Aston Villa in a 2–2 draw. The following month, he assisted on the equalising goal, scored by Robin van Persie, in the team's 1–1 draw with Everton. Diaby scored his second goal of the campaign in Arsenal's 3–1 league win against Newcastle on 21 March. He finished the season by scoring the team's third goal in the 4–1 win over Stoke City.|$|E
5|$|Following several poor performances, Nani criticised Sir Alex Ferguson for {{his lack}} of {{confidence}} in him. Despite this outburst, Nani was given a chance to shine and provided an assist for Rooney in the 4–0 league win over Hull City. Soon after this positive display, he put in another good performance in their League Cup semi-final victory over derby rivals Manchester City, revealing a heart-to-heart with Ferguson had resulted in a better display of form. On 31 January 2010, Nani scored the first goal and set up Rooney's 100th career Premier League strike in a 1–3 league victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Nani's goal was <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> of as a Manuel Almunia own goal by many sources, but was confirmed as belonging to Nani on 26 March by the Dubious Goals Panel. Following this performance, Nani then set up the second of a 5–0 home win over Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|German forces also {{operated}} in the Battle of Jarama, {{which began with}} a Nationalist offensive on 6 February 1937. It included German-supplied ground forces, including two batteries of machine guns, a tank division, and the Condor Legion's anti-aircraft guns. Bombing by both Republican and Nationalist aircraft helped ensure a stalemate. It showed up the inadequacy of the Legion's aircraft, faced with superior Soviet-made fighters. The Legion's efforts only partly mitigated what was a significant defeat for the Nationalists at the Battle of Guadalajara during March. A joint Italian-German general {{had been set up}} in January 1937 to advise Franco on war planning. The defeat of a significant Italian force and the growing Soviet superiority in tanks and aircraft led the Germans to support a plan to abandon the offensive on Madrid and instead concentrate a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas. While many countries believed motorised troops to have been proven less effective than <b>first</b> <b>thought,</b> it was the inadequacy of the Italians as a fighting force that dominated German thought.|$|E
