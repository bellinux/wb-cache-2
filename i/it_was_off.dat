5|$|Highbury was {{the venue}} for twelve FA Cup semi-finals as a neutral ground, {{the first in}} 1929 and the last in 1997, {{although}} between 1984 and 1992 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the FA's list of approved venues, after Arsenal's refusal to install perimeter fencing following a pitch invasion by Everton fans during their semi-final against Southampton. It also hosted the London XI's home leg against Lausanne Sports in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals; London won 2–0 on the night and 3–2 on aggregate.|$|E
25|$|He did {{not achieve}} {{much in the}} Test matches but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> his bowling that Don Bradman {{completed}} his 100th first class century. When Bradman reached 99, in the match for an Australian XI against the Indians, the Indian captain Lala Amarnath brought Kishenchand on to bowl. It was his first try at bowling during the tour. After playing a few balls carefully, Bradman took a single past mid-on to reach his hundred. He scored a duck {{in each of the}} five Tests that he played.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fourth}} day, Australia defied all {{predictions}} with a 45-run partnership between Warne and Lee, before Warne was forced back onto his stumps by Flintoff to get dismissed hit wicket. Kasprowicz {{came in and}} supported Lee well, fending off aggressive bowling from Flintoff and Harmison. The pair had England on the back foot as their victory target neared closer and closer, edging virtually everything. With three to win, and three results possible, Harmison had Kasprowicz caught behind, with replays showing that the ball hit the batsman's hand when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the bat. If the hand {{had been on the}} bat, {{it would have been a}} correct decision – as it stood, it was incorrect to give him out. This would prove to be a crucial error in the context of the series. England were thus victors – if in almost the most narrow way possible – and the series very much alive.|$|E

25|$|Pope Alexander IV and the Curia {{continued}} to live in Naples, until {{the first week of}} June 1255 when they returned to Anagni, and it was not until mid-November that the Pope was back in Rome. There the Curia stayed until the end of May, 1256, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> to Anagni for the summer, until the beginning of December. The problem was that Rome was in the hands of Senator Brancaleone degli Andalo, Count of Casalecchio, since 1252, and the Ghibbelines and Alexander was repeatedly driven out by unruly mobs. Rome was home again until the end of May, 1257, until the summer vacation at Viterbo began. The vacation lasted until the end of October, 1258, when the Court visited Anagni again; they stayed until the beginning of November, 1260. The Pope then was able to reside at the Lateran until the first week of May, 1261, when the Court was off to Viterbo again. Alexander IV died at Viterbo on 25 May 1261. A total of nineteen months was spent in Rome, {{out of a total of}} seventy-eight months. Alexander had created no new cardinals, and so the Electoral meeting following his death had only eight participants. The Election was a long-drawn-out one, lasting from 25 May to 29 August 1261. Unable to agree on one of themselves, the Cardinals chose Jacques Pantaléon, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who, since 1255, was Papal Legate with the Crusade in the Holy Land. He became Pope Urban IV, and was crowned at Viterbo on 4 September 1261.|$|E
25|$|The Top 3, Sophie, Bill and Fenton {{had just}} two final {{challenges}} to complete. The {{first was the}} last chance {{to work on their}} presenting skills with Mark and Julia. Mark held a Cue card which they were required to read while looking down the camera and deliver it with as much personality as possible. Mark was looking for someone with the ability to engage the audience. Bill and Sophie struggled with their delivery while big Fenton nailed it in one take, getting a round of applause from both judges. Then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> to one of Sydney's best fine dining experiences, Mint bar and dining. Once there they had one last attempt to impress 5 VIP's with a signature dish under the keen eye of Ben O'Donoghue. This showed another side of Ben that the contestants had yet to see, a no nonsense head chef barking orders at them in the kitchen and putting the pressure on to get the meals out as efficiently as possible. Sophie served up a very fresh and light Mexican chicken with a tasty salad including heart of palm and pistachio. The food critiques were very impressed. Next up Bill aimed to impress with his dish, crayfish cooked in herb butter and served with a salad. The reaction was the same all round from the judges, not good. The presentation was lacking and the salad didn't suit the dish. Owner of Mint remarked 'It's like two different dishes on one plate.' Finally Fenton from Queensland served up an eye fillet with hollandaise and potato rösti (a favourite at his restaurant.) While one judge thought the beef was the best stating 'he (Fenton) put his whole life on the BBQ and served it up for us.' it was Sophie's chicken that got the majority of the VIP judges vote and won her ticket through to the grand finale. That left Fenton and Bill. Ben then announced that Bill would be going home and Fenton was going through. But then in a final twist, Chef Ben O'Donoghue decided to bring Bill back because he felt that he had let him down with his direction in the kitchen. So the Top 2 was again the Top 3 with all contestants going into the final with the winner announced on Australia Day.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle plan}} called for a {{combination}} of naval bombardments and an amphibious landing. The initial attempt was called off after adverse currents hampered the assault and {{the element of surprise}} was lost. Nelson immediately ordered another assault but this was beaten back. He prepared for a third attempt, to take place during the night. Although he personally led one of the battalions, the operation ended in failure: the Spanish were better prepared than had been expected and had secured strong defensive positions. Several of the boats failed to land at the correct positions in the confusion, while those that did were swept by gunfire and grapeshot. Nelson's boat reached its intended landing point but as he stepped ashore he was hit in the right arm by a musketball, which fractured his humerus bone in multiple places. He was rowed back to Theseus to be attended to by the surgeon, Thomas Eshelby. On arriving at his ship he refused to be helped aboard, declaring [...] "Let me alone! I have got my legs left and one arm." [...] He was taken to surgeon Eshelby, instructing him to prepare his instruments and [...] "the sooner <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the better". Most of the right arm was amputated and within half an hour Nelson had returned to issuing orders to his captains. Years later he would excuse himself to Commodore John Thomas Duckworth for not writing longer letters due to not being naturally left-handed. He developed the sensation of phantom limb in his lost arm later on and declared that he had [...] "found the direct evidence of the existence of soul".|$|E

500|$|In the {{standard}} Golden Age model, the industry's top product, the A films, premiered {{at a small}} number of select first-run houses in major cities. Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues. As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein, [...] "During these first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising." [...] Then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> to the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of smaller, independent theaters, programs often changed {{two or three times a}} week. To meet the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as [...] "quickies" [...] for their tight production schedules—as short as four days. As Brian Taves describes, [...] "Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily." [...] Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that presaged its arrival, [...] "he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got", writes Epstein. Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be advertised at all.|$|E

2500|$|The new club {{might have}} {{continued}} except that White Conduit Fields {{was an open}} area allowing members of the public, including the rowdier elements, to watch the matches and to voice their opinions on the play and the players. The White Conduit gentlemen were not amused by such interruptions and decided {{to look for a}} more private venue of their own. Winchilsea and Lennox asked Lord to find a new ground and offered him a guarantee against any losses he may suffer in the venture. Lord took a lease from the Portman Estate on some land at Dorset Fields where Dorset Square is now sited; and the ground was prepared and opened in 1787. It was initially called the New Cricket Ground, perhaps because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> what was then called [...] "the New Road" [...] in Marylebone, when the first known match was played there on 21 May but, by the end of July, it was known as Lord's. As it was in Marylebone, the White Conduit members who relocated to it soon decided to call themselves the [...] "Mary-le-bone Club". The exact date of MCC's foundation is lost but seems to have been sometime in the late spring or the summer of 1787. On 10 & 11 July 1837, a South v North match was staged at Lord's to commemorate the MCC's Golden Jubilee. Warner described it as [...] "a Grand Match to celebrate the Jubilee of the Club" [...] and reproduced the full scorecard.|$|E
