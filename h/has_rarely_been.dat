This <b>has</b> <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> considered a valid subspecies but the intermediate pattern of bill colouration suggests intermixing of subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) {{is the only}} mockingbird commonly found in North America. This bird is mainly a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south during harsh weather. This species <b>has</b> <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> observed in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Countershading, like counter-illumination, <b>has</b> <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> {{applied in}} {{practice}} for military camouflage, though not because military authorities {{were unaware of}} it. Both Abbott Thayer in the First World War and Hugh Cott in the Second World War proposed countershading to their countries' armed forces. They each demonstrated the effectiveness of countershading, without succeeding in persuading their armed forces to adopt the technique, though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general.|$|E

Nevertheless, based on the colors of surviving textile fragments and the evidence of actual dyestuffs found in archaeological sites, reds, blues, and yellows from plant sources were in common use by the late Bronze Age and Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|As {{the show}} progressed through tryouts, Hammerstein {{repeatedly}} revised it, obscuring Suzy's profession {{and the nature}} of Fauna's house. Pipe Dream met with poor reviews, and rapidly closed once it exhausted its advance sale. It had no national tour or London production, and <b>has</b> <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> presented since. No movie version of the show was made; the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization (which licenses their works) once hoped for a film version featuring the Muppets with Fauna played by Miss Piggy.|$|E
5|$|Lessons had a {{significant}} effect on the development of children's literature in Britain and the United States. Maria Edgeworth, Sarah Trimmer, Jane Taylor, and Ellenor Fenn, to name a few of the most illustrious, were inspired to become children's authors because of Lessons and their works dominated children's literature for several generations. Lessons itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute that educational writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male Romantic writers, Barbauld's Lessons <b>has</b> <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> studied by scholars. In fact, it has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Mating <b>has</b> <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel {{to each other}} while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E
5|$|Michel de Nostredame (depending on the source, 14 or 21 December 1503 – 2 July 1566), usually Latinised as Nostradamus, was a French {{physician}} and reputed seer who published collections of prophecies that have since become widely famous. He {{is best known}} for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Since the publication of this book, which <b>has</b> <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> out of print since his death, Nostradamus has attracted a following that, along with much of the popular press, credits him with predicting many major world events.|$|E
5|$|Radyr {{hawkweed}} is {{the common}} name of Hieracium radyrense, a very rare endemic member of the aster, daisy, or sunflower family. It is a microspecies, so far only identified at Radyr. It was first identified in 1907 at the quarry, {{was described as a}} variety in 1948 and then as a separate species in 1955. It <b>has</b> <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> seen and regular surveys between 1998 and 2004 indicate that today only a single population of about 25 plants survives in the wild.|$|E

5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it <b>has</b> <b>rarely</b> <b>been</b> applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E
