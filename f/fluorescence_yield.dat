Occasionally, the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>yield</b> of the darkened anaerobic samples approached 80 % of the maximum fluorescence.

The deviation of the <b>fluorescence</b> quantum <b>yield</b> from unity in rigid isotropic solution suggests that <b>fluorescence</b> quantum <b>yield</b> depends not only on the ultra-fast oscillation of ThT fragments relative to each other in an excited state as was suggested earlier, but also depends on the molecular configuration in the ground state. This means that the <b>fluorescence</b> quantum <b>yield</b> of the dye incorporated into amyloid fibrils must depend on its conformation, which, in turn, depends on the ThT environment. Therefore, the <b>fluorescence</b> quantum <b>yield</b> of ThT incorporated into amyloid fibrils can differ from that in the rigid isotropic solution.

While gels prepared with DMF actually have lower <b>fluorescence</b> <b>yields</b> than gels prepared without DMF at lower annealing temperatures, DMF gels can be annealed at much higher temperatures while retaining high optical quality. At these higher temperatures, terbium <b>fluorescence</b> <b>yields</b> increase dramatically as the sol-gel network undergoes densification, closing the pores of the network and eliminating the fluorescence quenching silanols on pore surfaces. DMF is therefore found to enhance the fluorescence properties of rare earth sol-gel glasses by reducing micro-fracturing and facilitating network densification. Further investigations are underway to determine the effectiveness of other promising DCCAs, such as glycerol, and to explore the possibility of exploiting the solubility properties of DCCAs to improve rare earth dopant dispersion...|$|R

After {{the completion of}} the initial fast transient, the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>yield</b> rises from the level S to a plateau M within a minute, declining only after prolonged illumination. Both normal and 1, 1 dimethyl- 3 (3 ' 4 '-dichloro) -phenylurea (DCMU) -poisoned Anacystis are capable of these changes. In normal Anacystis, the slow increase in the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>yield</b> (S-* 1 M) requires light absorbed in system II while light absorbed in system I is ineffective. In DCMU-poisoned Anacystis, however, these changes are also promoted by light absorbed in system I. Addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a photophosphorylation uncoupler acting near the photosynthetic electron transport chain, abolishes the rise from S to M in normal but has no effect in the DCMU-poisoned system. Phlorizin, a phosphorylase inhibitor, has very little effect. These results suggest that the light-induced variation in the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>yield</b> is related to the conformational changes which accompany photophosphorylation.

A typical pattern of <b>fluorescence</b> <b>yield</b> variations was found whatever {{the age of the}} leaf but with age-dependent changes in rates. Its successive phases were related to the Chl(ide) spectral shifts observed in low-temperature emission spectra. The <b>fluorescence</b> <b>yield</b> started at a high level and strongly declined during the formation of Chlide(695) from Chlide(688) within a few seconds. It increased to a transient maximum during the Shibata shift (15 - 25 min) that resulted in ChI(ide) (682). A final, slow decrease to a steady state occurred during the final red shift to ChI(685). Pretreatments with delta-aminolevulinic acid, chloramphenicol or 1, 10 -phenanthroline resulted in correlated modifications of Chl(ide) <b>fluorescence</b> <b>yield</b> transients and shifts of the low-temperature Chl(ide) emission band. The complex response of the final decrease phase of the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>yield</b> to these compounds suggests that it results both from the assembly of photosynthetic Chi proteins and from the reorganization of the etioplast membrane system.
