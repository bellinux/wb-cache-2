50|$|Crystal River is at {{the heart}} of the Nature Coast of Florida. The city is {{situated}} around Kings Bay, which is spring-fed and so keeps a constant 72 F temperature year round. A cluster of 50 springs designated as a first-magnitude system feeds Kings Bay. A first-magnitude system discharges 100 cubic feet or more of water per second, which equals about 64 million gallons of water per day. Because of this <b>discharge</b> <b>amount,</b> the Crystal River Springs group is the second largest springs group in Florida, the first being Spring Creek Springs in Wakulla County near Tallahassee. Kings Bay can be home to over 400 manatees during the winter when the water temperature in the Gulf of Mexico cools, and is the only place in the United States where people can legally interact with them in their natural conditions without that interaction being viewed as harassment by law enforcement agencies. Tourism based on watching and swimming with manatee is the fastest growing contribution to the local economy.

40|$|Dental handpieces {{in daily}} {{practice}} use {{come in contact}} with organic, inorganic and chemical contaminations that may contain potentially dangerous pathogens. Due to their complex structure, because of internal water- and air-channels, handpieces provide high demands on reprocessing. They have to be cleaned, disinfected and possibly sterilized according the KRINKO-recommendation "Hygiene requirements in the reprocessing of medical devices" before using on the next patient. Especially the cleaning is important, because without adequate cleaning the disinfection or sterilization has a reduced or no effect. It should be examined whether dental handpieces can be cleaned standardized and reproducible with a manual method, if the cleaning success with a peroxidase-test-kit is verifiable and whether the discharge volumes of cleaning liquids are reproducible. The investigation took place in test series with seven handpieces, each with a spray-water and spray-air channel. A total number of 120 spray-channels was investigated. After contamination with human blood the handpieces were cleaned with a special adapter (3 x 2 seconds) and dried (1 x 3 seconds) according to the manufacturer. After flushing by SDS they were inserted in SDS and extracted on the shaker. Then the channels were cleaned with dental SuperFloss and this was extracted in SDS. Of all extraction solutions protein determinations were made using the modified OPA-method. In addition, a peroxidase-test was used to verify the results. Also the <b>discharge</b> <b>amount</b> of the cleaning solution has been investigated. The modified OPA-method was suitable for the tests because of the possibility to detect even minimal protein amounts. At 100 % of the investigated channels residual protein could be determined.

40|$|Annual natural {{discharge}} (Q) of the River Murray and its most extensive tributary, the Darling River system, is often {{inversely related to}} sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. These SST variations are components of a planetary-scale phenomenon referred to as E 1 Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Darling and Murray river historical values of Q indicate that annual surface runoff from regions dominated by subtropical summer monsoon precipitation and annual surface runoff primarily responding to temperate winter storms are both strongly influenced by ENSO cycles. Forecasting, approximately 1 year in advance, of ENSO-related SST from geophysical model calculations thus provides a mechanism for estimating probabilities of annual river <b>discharge</b> <b>amount.</b> Contingency tables relating annual Q to SST, based on combining observed data for 95 years and forecast SST {{over a period of}} 15 years, provide probabilities of expected annual Q as a function of forecast SST.

This paper has studied the estimation of peak flood discharge of the Kunur River Basin, a major tributary of the Ajay River in the lower Gangetic plain. To achieve this objective, field measurements, GIS technique, and several channel geometry equations are adopted. Three important geomorphic based hydrological models—manning’s equation, kinematic wave parameter (KWP), and SCS curve number (CN) method—have been used for computing peak discharge during the flood season, based on daily rainfall data of September, 2000. Peak discharges, calculated by different given models, are 239. 44 [*]m 3 /s, 204. 08 [*]m 3 /s, and 146. 52 [*]m 3 /s, respectively. The hydrograph has demonstrated the sudden increase with heavy rainfall from the 18 th to the 22 nd of September, 2000.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the future behavior of the glaciers, their mass balance must be studied. The loss of water produced by melting, known as glacier discharge, is one of the components of this mass balance. In this paper, a vine copula structure is proposed to model the multivariate and nonlinear dependence among the glacier discharge and other related meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation and precipitation. The multivariate distribution of these variables is divided in four cases according to the presence or not of positive discharge and/or positive precipitation. Then, each different case is modelled with a vine copula. The conditional probability of zero discharge for given meteorological conditions is obtained from the proposed joint distribution. Moreover, the structure of the vine copula allows us to derive the conditional distribution for the glacier discharge for the given meteorological conditions. Three different prediction methods are used and compared for the future values of the discharge. The proposed methodology is applied to a large data base collected since 2002 by the GLACKMA association from a measurement station located in the King George Island in the Antarctica. Seasonal effects are included by using different parameters for each season. We have found that our proposed vine copula model outperforms the standard results obtained with the classical degree-day models in all cases for both the probability of positive discharge and the <b>discharge</b> <b>amount</b> predictions...|$|E

However, only very limited impact studies have been carried out. Taking a typical plant in Xiamen as an example, the present study targeted the distribution and sea-air transfer flux of volatile mercury in seawater, in order to trace {{the fate of the}} discharged mercury other than into the sediments. Samples from 28 sampling sites were collected in the sea area around two discharge outlets of the plant, daily and seasonally. Total mercury, dissolved gaseous mercury and dissolved total mercury in the seawater, as well as gaseous elemental mercury above the sea surface, were investigated. Mean concentrations of dissolved gaseous mercury and gaseous elemental mercury in the area were 183 and 4. 48 ng m(- 3) in summer and 116 and 3. 92 ng m(- 3) in winter, which were significantly higher than those at a reference site.

40|$|Uncontrolled {{fluid flow}} in the {{wellbore}} {{is one of the}} most critical safety concerns for the oil and gas industry. The major focus of this dissertation is on blowout events given the most severe consequences associated with such incidents. The past tragedies reflect a strong need for not only understanding the mechanisms of blowout to accurately estimate the consequence, but also the approaches to managing and controlling the risks, uncertainties, and hazards associated with blowout events. A fully integrated analytical model that couples the reservoir and wellbore has been proposed to investigate the fluid behaviors during the blowout events. This model could be used to simulate any potential blowout events for gas, oil, or oil/gas wells at onshore or offshore facilities. The reservoir, wellbore, and their interactions are coupled together to demonstrate a full picture of the potential well blowout incidents. The results reveal that understanding the importance of heat transfer and multi-phase flow behaviors is essential to accurately estimate the consequence of well blowouts. Well-established computational algorithms are developed to effectively estimate the blowout rate and total <b>discharge</b> <b>amount</b> during blowout incidents. The statistical analysis identifies the independent variables responsible for the maximum discharge; both reservoir permeability and the connected reservoir volume are the key variables. The results of the blowout modeling could serve as the input for both consequence-based and risk-based approaches to assess the risk associated with the blowout events. The application of such approaches is demonstrated by the case study. The consequence-based approach is easier to be implemented and provide guidance to the operators based on the realistic worst-case scenario. It would be useful for drilling site location selection and preparation of emergency response plan. On the other hand, the risk-based approach enables the operators to have a comprehensive understanding of the particular well that they are working on, so that the risk associated with the blowout events can be effectively managed and controlled. The risk reduction plan based on the blowout risk assessment is also discussed in this dissertation...|$|E
