50|$|<b>Harlequin</b> <b>bugs</b> are {{phytophagous}} insects. Adult {{and young}} chew on the stems and leaves of {{plants such as}} cabbage, broccoli, kale, turnip, radish, horseradish, mustard and rape, and often cause blotching at the feeding site. These plants are economically important and are abundant in crop fields but {{when they are not}} in production, <b>harlequin</b> <b>bugs</b> are able to feed on wild plants as well. Cruciferous plants such as cabbage produce mustard oil glycosides which give them a stinging flavor. This chemical compound is sequestered by <b>harlequin</b> <b>bugs</b> and stored in the prothorax as they feed.|$|R

50|$|Like all insects, <b>harlequin</b> <b>bugs</b> {{have an open}} circulatory system. Blood {{is pumped}} to the head (anteriorly) through the dorsal blood vessel and posteriorly through the ventral body cavity. To map out the {{circulation}} of blood in these insects, Craig et al. injected radioactive phosphorus into the posterior end {{of the heart and}} traced it through the body cavity. The blood reached the wings first, then the antennae, and then pairs of legs in order from anterior to posterior. Craig et al. also tested the time it takes for blood to form a homogeneous mixture (complete mixing). The time it took for blood to completely mix in <b>harlequin</b> <b>bugs</b> was about twenty-five minutes.|$|R
50|$|Mating in <b>harlequin</b> <b>bugs</b> {{is similar}} to other insects in that the male {{transfers}} sperm to the female and the female stores this sperm in a specialized structure called the spermatheca. Using electron microscopy, Stacconi et al. were able to study {{the structure of the}} spermatheca in detail (2011).|$|R
50|$|Because {{chrysanthemums}} contain pyrethrums, {{they are}} used as companion plants to repel pest insects from nearby crops and ornamental plants. They are thought to repel aphids, bed bugs (Cimex lectularius), leafhoppers, spider mites, <b>harlequin</b> <b>bugs,</b> ticks, pickleworms, and imported cabbage worms, among others, in gardens and farms. For example, they are planted among broccoli plants for protection from several common insect pests.|$|R
50|$|Tectocoris diophthalmus, {{commonly}} known as the Hibiscus <b>Harlequin</b> <b>Bug</b> or Cotton <b>Harlequin</b> <b>Bug,</b> is a brightly coloured convex and rounded shield-shaped bug with a metallic sheen that grows to about 20 mm. Adult females are mostly orange and males are both blue and red or orange. The colours are quite variable. It lives in Northern and Eastern Australia, New Guinea and several Pacific Islands in habitats ranging from urban to agricultural and coastal areas.|$|E

500|$|Pests include root-knot {{nematodes}} {{and cabbage}} maggots, which produce stunted and wilted plants with yellow leaves; aphids, which induce stunted plants with curled and yellow leaves; <b>harlequin</b> <b>bugs,</b> which cause white and yellow leaves; thrips, {{which lead to}} leaves with white-bronze spots; striped flea beetles, which riddle leaves with small holes; and caterpillars, which leave behind large, ragged holes in leaves. The caterpillar stage of the [...] "small cabbage white butterfly" [...] (Pieris rapae), commonly known in the United States as the [...] "imported cabbage worm", is a major cabbage pest in most countries. The large white butterfly (Pieris brassicae) is prevalent in eastern European countries. The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and the cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) thrive in the higher summer temperatures of continental Europe, where they cause considerable damage to cabbage crops. In India, the diamondback moth has caused losses up to 90 percent in crops that were not treated with insecticide. Destructive soil insects include the cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) and the cabbage maggot (Hylemya brassicae), whose larvae can burrow into the part of plant consumed by humans.|$|R

50|$|Cosmopepla lintneriana, the twice-stabbed stink bug, locally {{called the}} wee <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug</b> (particularly in Alberta), is {{a species of}} insect in the Pentatomidae family. Cosmopepla lintneriana was first {{described}} in 1798 by Johan Christian Fabricius as Cimex carnifex and then again in 1865 by Thomas as Cosmopepla bimaculata. Lintneriana is hosted {{by a variety of}} plants, including milk thistle, echinacea, asparagus, oats, mint and goldenrod, and is widespread throughout North America, from Canada to Mexico. The body of lintneriana is black with a red, orange or yellow band across the pronotum and a short red stripe along the midline. The scutellum has two red spots near the apex.|$|E
50|$|Pheromones {{can also}} be used to bait plants that are staples for M. histrionica and trap the insects. M. histrionica are major pests of plants in the Brassicaceae family. In a study {{conducted}} by Ludwig and Kok (2001), researchers tested broccoli, mustard and rape plants for attractiveness to the <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug</b> and found that these plants do not significantly delay development in the bugs. This is what leads to these economically important plants to be targeted by M. histrionica. The study showed that all plants, especially small and young plants even at lower densities of insects, experienced death after being targeted by harlequin bugs, although larger plants could bare more numbers.|$|E
50|$|The {{harlequin}} {{cabbage bug}} (Murgantia histrionica), {{also known as}} calico bug, fire bug or <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug,</b> is a black stinkbug of the family Pentatomidae, brilliantly marked with red, orange and yellow markings. It is destructive to cabbage and related plants in tropical America as well as throughout most of North America, especially the warmer parts of the United States. In addition to cabbage {{it can be a}} major pest to crops such as broccoli, radishes, and the ornamental flower cleome. Nymphs are active during the summer and in the tropics the bug can achieve three to six generations a year. In the northern range there is only one generation annually and the insects overwinter as adults.|$|E

50|$|Bagrada hilaris is {{a species}} of shield bug known by the common names bagrada bug and painted bug (See a short video at YouTube). It could be mistaken for or erroneously {{referred}} to as <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug.</b> It is native to Asia. It is known elsewhere as an introduced species, including California and Arizona, where {{it was first reported}} in 2008. It is a major pest insect of Brassica oleracea crops (including cabbage, kale, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli), and related crucifers such as turnips, rape, and mustard. The adult and nymph of the species suck sap from the leaves of the plants, causing wilting, yellowing, and stunting of growth. Besides crucifers, the bugs are known on papaya, sorghum, maize, potato, cotton, caper, pearl millet, and some legumes. Large numbers of the bug congregate on the plants and cause extensive damage.|$|E
50|$|M. histrionica males contain 10,11-epoxy-1-bisabolen-3-ol, a {{pheromone}} {{more commonly}} known as murgantinol. The stereoisomers of male <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug</b> pheromones consists of two compounds: tridecane and murgantinol. These substances, found specifically in male pheromones, are responsible for aggregation of the insects to aid in sexual reproduction and {{can also be used}} in warning predators. A study conducted by Zahn et al. (2008) found that mature male insects produced pheromones that recruited females, other males and young insects based on attractiveness. For females, the pheromone is used as a sex-pheromone to attract mates. Other males use a different version of this pheromone to aggregate more males to a given area to signal the availability of food and it serves a similar purpose with nymphs. Nymphs use the pheromone to guide themselves to the food source in starving conditions.|$|E
40|$|The <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug,</b> Murgantia histrionica (Hahn), is an {{agricultural}} pest {{in the continental}} United States, particularly in southern states. Reliable gene sequence data are especially useful {{to the development of}} species-specific, environmentally friendly molecular biopesticides and effective biolures for this insect. Here, mRNAs were sampled from whole insects at the 2 nd and 4 th nymphal instars, as well as sexed adults, and sequenced using Illumina RNA-Seq technology. A global assembly of these data identified 72, 540 putative unique transcripts bearing high levels of similarity to transcripts identified in other taxa, with over 99 % of conserved single-copy orthologs among insects being detected. Gene ontology and protein family analyses were conducted to explore the functional potential of the harlequin bug’s gene repertoire, and phylogenetic analyses were conducted on gene families germane to xenobiotic detoxification, including glutathione S-transferases, carboxylesterases and cytochrome P 450 s. Genic content in <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug</b> was compared with that of the closely related invasive pest, the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stål). Quantitative analyses of <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug</b> gene expression levels, experimentally validated using quantitative real-time PCR, identified genes differentially expressed between life stages and/or sexes...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{selective}} pressures favouring parental care can inform {{our understanding of}} the evolutionary origins and transitions of sociality in insects. Here, we report upon investigations designed to estimate {{the costs and benefits of}} parental care in the egg-guarding hibiscus <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug</b> Tectocoris diophthalmus (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae). We found that the presence of a guarding female had no effect on hatching success under benign laboratory conditions. In the wild, however, guarding decreased the likelihood of total clutch failure, and produced a fourfold greater egg-hatching rate relative to unguarded clutches. Females guarded against generalist invertebrate egg predators, including conspecific nymphs, but were ineffective against hymenopteran egg parasitoids. Females continued to feed during the guarding period and exhibited no signs of weight loss or increased mortality due to this behaviour. We did not observe the production of subsequent clutches in any experimental females; therefore, the lifetime fecundity costs of providing parental care in T. diophthalmus remain indeterminate. Overall, maternal egg guarding appears to function as a relatively low cost-low benefit strategy that increases hatching success by protecting against predation - but not parasitism. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{can adjust}} their {{behaviour}} according to previous experience gained during foraging. In parasitoids, experience {{plays a key}} role in host location, a hierarchical process in which air-borne and substrate-borne semiochemicals are used to find hosts. In nature, chemical traces deposited by herbivore hosts when walking on the plant are adsorbed by leaf surfaces and perceived as substrate-borne semiochemicals by parasitoids. Chemical traces left on cabbage leaves by adults of the <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug</b> (Murgantia histrionica) induce an innate arrestment response in the egg parasitoid Trissolcus brochymenae characterized by an intense searching behaviour on host-contaminated areas. Here we investigated whether the T. brochymenae response to host walking traces left on leaf surfaces is affected by previous experience in the context of parasitoid foraging behaviour. We found that: 1) an unrewarded experience (successive encounters with host-contaminated areas without successful oviposition) decreased the intensity of the parasitoid response; 2) a rewarded experience (successful oviposition) acted as a reinforcing stimulus; 3) the elapsed time between two consecutive unrewarded events affected the parasitoid response in a host-gender specific manner. The ecological role of these results to the host location process of egg parasitoids is discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{describing}} {{differences in}} morphology, developmental fate and secretion composition in the scent glands {{of the cotton}} <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug</b> Tectocoris diophthalmus we have sought to extend comparative knowledge of the scent gland system in the pentatomoid families within the Hemiptera-Heteroptera. Chemical investigation of the secretions was undertaken by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The following volatiles were detected: 2 -hexenal, 2 -hexenyl acetate and 2 - octenyl acetate from the metathoracic scent gland (an adult gland); nonanal from the abdominal dorsal first gland (the divided dorsal gland) in the adults; 2 -hexenal, 2 -octenal, 4 -oxohex- 2 -enal, dodecane and tridecane from the abdominal dorsal second and third glands (the undivided dorsal glands) in fifth-instar nymphs. Secretory units are sparse, opener muscles absent, and secretion scarcely, if at all, present {{in the second and}} third dorsal abdominal scent glands in the adults. T. diophthalmus is an addition to the small but growing list of pentatomoids in which biochemical divergence of the abdominal dorsal first gland from the abdominal dorsal second and third glands has been reported. The metathoracic scent gland in T. diophthalmus is comparatively small, as it is in many other aposematic species within the Hemiptera-Heteroptera...|$|E
40|$|Life history {{parameters}} and reproductive {{behaviors of the}} <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug,</b> Murgantia histrionica Hahn (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), were determined. Total developmental time from egg to adult was ≈ 48 d. After a sexual maturation period of ≈ 7 d, both sexes mated repeatedly, with females laying multiple egg masses of 12 eggs at intervals of 3 d. Adult females lived an average of 41 d, whereas adult males lived an average of 25 d. Courtship and copulation activities peaked {{in the middle of}} the photophase. In mating experiments in which mixed sex pairs of virgin and previously mated bugs were combined in all possible combinations, the durations of courtship and copulation by virgin males were significantly longer with both virgin and previously mated females than the same behaviors for previously mated males. When given a choice between a virgin or previously mated female, previously mated males preferred to mate with virgin females, whereas virgin males showed no preference for virgin over previously mated females. Analyses of mating behaviors with ethograms and behavioral transition matrices suggested that a primary reason for failure to copulate by virgin males was the incorrect rotation of their pygophores to the copulation position, so that successful alignment of the genitalia could not occur...|$|E
40|$|Most insects employ non-caring {{strategies}} to safeguard their eggs and offspring from predation. Parental care behaviour is extremely rare in insects, {{but has been}} described in several insect groups {{and particularly in the}} Hemiptera. Given that such behaviour is considered an evolutionary precursor to more complex forms of insect sociality, investigating the dynamics of parental care may inform our understanding of social evolution. In this paper, we describe the oviposition and maternal care behaviour of the egg-guarding cotton or hibiscus <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug</b> Tectocoris diophthalmus (Thunberg, 1783) in the field. We also report the results of experimental manipulations designed to test for egg discrimination mechanisms in this species. Our observations indicate that females lay about 100 eggs in a cylindrical cluster around a branch or leaf petiole. Maternal care is limited to egg straddling and defensive postures and behaviours. These were only displayed when walking invertebrate predators approached the egg clutch; mothers were observed to react to the presence of parasitoid wasps on their clutches. Protective behaviours are only displayed by guarding females and are possibly triggered by oviposition, but will cease permanently if females are separated from their clutch {{for more than a few}} minutes. We found no evidence for clutch discrimination, as females guarded their own clutch as readily as unrelated eggs until hatching. Egg guarding in this species may have been selected to enhance offspring survival in a high predation environment. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The green stink bug, Acrosternum hilare (Say), and the <b>harlequin</b> <b>bug,</b> Murgantia histrionica (Hahn) (both Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), are pests of many {{economically}} important crops. Although both {{species have}} been studied extensively, until recently their relationships with sym-biotic gut bacteria have remained unknown. The endosymbionts may be important, as other pen-tatomomorphan species harbor vertically transmitted gut bacteria that {{play an important role}} in the biology of their host insects. We report the role of gut symbiotic bacteria on the development and fitness of A. hilare and M. histrionica by comparing control insects with individuals that hatched from surface sterilized egg masses. We studied the life history of A. hilare and M. histrio-nica under laboratory conditions at 23 ± 2 C and L 16 :D 8, measuring nymphal mortality and development time, and estimating other demographic parameters. We also evaluated egg masses, nymphs, and adults of both species with diagnostic PCR primers for the presence of specific gut symbiotic bacteria for both treatments. Our results show that egg mass surface sterilization elimi-nates or reduces the prevalence of this bacterium-insect symbiosis in both species. Acrosternum hilare’s development time, survivorship, and other demographic parameters were negatively affected by surface sterilization of egg masses. Conversely, M. histrionica’s survivorship was mar-ginally increased by clearing its symbiont infection during the first generation; however, mean generation time was significantly longer. Our data indicate that the degree of mutualism in this association for pentatomid species is variable, given that A. hilare requires its symbiont for ade-quate development and survival, whereas M. histrionica’s symbiont may not be required for development and survival under the experimental conditions used...|$|E
