The {{purpose of the study}} was to identify different perspectives on what parameters are of value when forming a future framework for DPO training and competence assessment and assurance. Seven respondents from different segments of the offshore industry, including ship operators and non-governmental organizations, participated. The Authors found a general consensus among the respondents that a DPO competence framework that is unified and mandated by a governing body, was sought after. The key components such a framework should address are, according to the respondents; competence assessment, competence assurance and DPO training. Furthermore, the respondents discuss other perspectives on what such a framework could address, such as DP time logging, on-board training and supervision, manual ship handling and training scheme improvements. To conclude the study, the Authors discussed the discrepancy between the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code’s</b> requirement that shipping companies should ensure that each ship is manned with qualified seafarers and that the industry wishes for a specific framework that aids in achieving DPO competence.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{introduces the}} inspection and survey of ships {{looking at this}} intricate topic from several different viewpoints. Numerous stakeholders play various roles in the shipping industry, ranging from ship and cargo owners to insurance companies, from society at large represented by maritime administrations to regulatory and inspection bodies, etc. As shipping is intrinsically an international and strategic business, its regulations and standards, {{as well as the}} relevant inspection activities have long been the subject of international agreement. Indeed, due to the large number of actors on the scene, the inspection and survey regime of ships is not easy to unravel. Though many books and documents present the matter from the viewpoint of one of the stakeholders, very few give an overall presentation of this subject in a rational way. Some bibliographical references are provided {{at the end of this}} chapter, together with some brief explanations for further elucidation. In the following, the ship inspection or survey is treated as an event occurring at various times within a shipï¿½s life. As such, the discussion starts by identifying who requires, and who carries out inspections and surveys. This is done in some detail, thus introducing the main regulatory instruments (rules and conventions) applicable to ships and the various inspection and survey bodies which verify their application. A brief summary is given of the frequency of inspections and surveys, operational and environmental conditions during inspections and the location on ships and of items to be inspected or surveyed. A more comprehensive description of items to be inspected or surveyed and relevant degradation modes and/or expected defects follows, with particular reference to structural deterioration. State of the art of inspection and survey methods and techniques are reviewed: the focus is not on non-destructive testing (NDT) or test techniques, rather on the onboard practices covering safety measures, accessibility and scope and extension of inspections and surveys. Although NDT techniques are applied, the survey practice and management is the dominant factor, crucial for the success of the survey or inspection. The conclusion of this chapter deals with the Inspection Matrix: such a matrix is a proposal to establish a rational tool for the judgment of the ship inspection and survey regime, identifying areas that may be subject to possible over-inspection and areas possibly requiring further strengthening of the inspection and survey regime. The terms 'inspection' and 'survey' are often incorrectly used as synonyms. Within the marine environment they carry quite different definitions. An inspection is a verification that a specific item, whether a piece of structure or item of equipment, meets a specific regulatory or other standard at the time that it is inspected. For example, a flag State inspector will verify that a fire extinguisher certificate is current and has not expired at the time that it is visually inspected. At a scheduled inspection, all fire extinguishers on the ship will be checked to verify compliance in this manner. A survey is carried out by a classification society surveyor. It is a risk-based approach to assessing the overall compliance of a vesselï¿½s structure and machinery with the applicable Rules of that society by sampling based on empirical experience. Such sampling allows the surveyor to use his professional judgment to determine if the vessel will continue to remain in compliance with the relevant Rule requirement for the period until the next scheduled survey. The sampling approach is necessary because of the size and complexity of modern ships. For example, a large tanker will have many kilometers of welds within its hull structure. It is not practical to visually inspect every centimeter of those welds on a periodic basis. However, experience will indicate that certain areas of the ship are subject to higher stress or greater corrosion and so the survey will focus on those areas. A further term 'audit'' should also be introduced as certain regulatory requirements are subject to periodic audit. These are principally the <b>ISM</b> and ISPS <b>Codes.</b> These are management systems. Verification of compliance is carried out through an audit of the system by a trained auditor. In many instances the classification society surveyor will attend a ship in multiple roles: he may conduct a periodic class survey; he may then act as a flag State inspector to conduct a regulatory inspection; and, if appropriately trained, he may then act as an auditor to verify continued compliance with the statutorily mandated <b>ISM</b> and ISPS <b>Codes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the METKU Project (Development of Maritime Safety Culture) is to study how the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> has {{influenced}} the safety culture in the maritime industry. This literature review is written {{as a part of}} the Work Package 2 which is conducted by the University of Turku, Centre for Maritime Studies. The maritime traffic is rapidly growing in the Baltic Sea which leads to a growing risk of maritime accidents. Particularly in the Gulf of Finland, the high volume of traffic causes a high risk of maritime accidents. The growing risks give us good reasons for implementing the research project concerning maritime safety and the effectiveness of the safety measures, such as the safety management systems. In order to reduce maritime safety risks, the safety management systems should be further developed. The METKU Project has been launched to examine the improvements which can be done to the safety management systems. Human errors are considered as the most important reason for maritime accidents. The international safety management code (the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code)</b> has been established to cut down the occurrence of human errors by creating a safety-oriented organizational culture for the maritime industry. The <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> requires that a company should provide safe practices in ship operation and a safe working environment and establish safeguards against all identified risk. The fundamental idea of the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> is that companies should continuously improve safety. The commitment of the top management is essential for implementing a safety-oriented culture in a company. The <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> has brought a significant contribution to the progress of maritime safety in recent years. Shipping companies and ships’ crews are more environmentally friendly and more safety-oriented than 12 years ago. This has been showed by several studies which have been analysed for this literature research. Nevertheless, the direct effect and influence of the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> on maritime safety could not be isolated very well. No quantitative measurement (statistics/hard data) could be found in order to present the impacts of the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> on maritime safety. In this study it has been discovered that safety culture has emerged and it is developing in the maritime industry. Even though the roots of the safety culture have been established there are still serious barriers to the breakthrough of the safety management. These barriers could be envisaged as cultural factors preventing the safety process. Even though the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> has been effective over a decade, the old-established behaviour which is based on the old day’s maritime culture still occurs. In the next phase of this research project, these cultural factors shall be analysed in regard to the present safety culture of the maritime industry in Finland...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} waterborne transportation in the Gulf of Finland, {{the risk of}} a hazardous accident increases and therefore manifold preventive actions are needed. As a main legislative authority in the maritime community, The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set down plenary laws and recommendations which are e. g., utilised in the safe operations in ships and pollution prevention. One of these compulsory requirements, the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code,</b> requires proactive attitude both from the top management and operational workers in the shipping companies. In this study, a crosssectional approach was taken to analyse whether the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> has actively enhanced maritime safety in the Gulf of Finland. The analysis included; 1) performance of the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> in Finnish shipping companies, 2) statistical measurements of maritime safety, 3) influence of corporate top management to the safety culture and 4) comparing safety management practices in shipping companies and port operations of Finnish maritime and port authorities. The main results found were that maritime safety culture has developed in the right direction after the launch of the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> in the 1990 ´s. However, this study does not exclusively prove that the improvements are the consequence of the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code.</b> Accident prone ships can be recognized due to their behaviour and there is a lesson to learn from the safety culture of some high standard safety disciplines such as, air traffic. In addition, the reporting of accidents and nearmisses should be more widely used in shipping industry.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implementation}} of the International Safety Management (<b>ISM)</b> <b>Code</b> in the Chinese chemical shipping industry. In particular, it examines the tension between management focus on speedy production and seafarers’ participation in safety related decision making and analyses how this tension is managed. It shows that while on paper companies have policies stating safety commitment in compliance with the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code,</b> in practice shore management tends to prioritise efficient production. When Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and ship’s sailing schedules are in conflict, managers implicitly request shipmasters to prioritise the ‘core interest’ of the company. Although the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> endows shipmasters with overriding authorities in relation to shipboard safety management, they tend to read between the lines and tacitly follow managers’ intentions. The study suggests that if the ISM implementation makes a difference, it is the practice that managers become more subtle in giving orders to exert their dominance. The study further reveals that the management’s practice is not only irresponsive to seafarers’ safety concerns but also makes rather limited contributions to promote OHS Management...|$|E

40|$|In shipping, safety {{depends on}} the {{reliability}} of the technical and human components of the ship-system, although the marine environment itself may sometimes be so hostile as to give rise to accidents that are beyond technical and human control. The need for a continuous analysis of shipping accidents is dictated by the accumulated evidence for the predominance of the human factor and the ever-increasing pressure for further improvement on the safety record of shipping. In this context, the effectiveness of enforced regulations towards the promotion of safety policy in shipping is assessed and the debate and focus on this issue are maintained. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine human reliability with reference to all accidents involving Greek-flagged ships during 1993 - 2006, a time-scale that spans over the pre- and post-ISM period. The accident data were processed through a decision tree analysis, which enabled the classification of various accident factors, which, for the purpose of this approach, were treated as the tree variables. In the context of assessing the effectiveness of the implemented <b>ISM</b> <b>Code,</b> the above-mentioned analysis revealed that although the human element maintained its dominance in shipping accidents, there is also substantial evidence in support of its effective control during the post-ISM period, since the implementation of the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> led to an overall reduction of human-induced accidents. Furthermore, the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> was found to remove the influence of vessel type upon the human or non-human source of accidents, since prior to ISM implementation tankers and Ro-Pax vessels were profoundly linked to human-induced accidents. In terms of location, the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> improved the human-induced accident record in both navigational regions of restricted and open waters. However, its impact in terms of location was less effective, since the navigation in restricted waters proved to be distinctively linked to human-induced accidents in comparison to that of open waters, over the entire period of investigation.

A part of this was to study the organizational models and analyze these against the requirements and expectations of the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code.</b> The background for this study is the many articles written about the DPA's role in the organization and the interpretation of the responsibility in relation to the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> after an accident.

In addition to this e-mail exchange with other professional bodies, discussions with active DPA's and study of relevant literature. It looks like the theory that triggered this thesis is not quite correct. It looks like all gloomy predictions following the introduction of the <b>ISM</b> <b>Code</b> have turned and this debate has subsided.
