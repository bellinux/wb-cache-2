Â This design simplification may have profound drawbacks on compressor efficiency, especially for chillers using an economizer cycle, where {{each stage of}} compression deals with an increasing mass flow rate. For those multiple stage centrifugal compressors connected with economized cycle chillers, {{the flow of the}} later stage of the compressor is merged with the flow from the economizer. Therefore, the flow rate for each stage will be much different at any given time. Non-equal <b>impeller</b> <b>diameters</b> will thus show performance advantages.

50|$|These laws {{assume that}} the pump/fan {{efficiency}} remains constant i.e. , which is rarely exactly true, but {{can be a good}} approximation when used over appropriate frequency or diameter ranges (i.e., a fan will not move anywhere near 1000 times as much air when spun at 1000 times its designed operating speed, but the air movement may be increased by 99% when the operating speed is only doubled). The exact relationship between speed, diameter, and efficiency depends on the particulars of the individual fan or pump design. Product testing or computational fluid dynamics become necessary if the range of acceptability is unknown, or if a high level of accuracy is required in the calculation.

The degree of cavitation, as indicated by NPSHR, will change at different flow rates. Also, a change in <b>impeller</b> <b>diameter</b> does not generally affect NPSHR, because cavitation occurs at the impeller inlet.

The one-dimensional approach along with empirical equations is adopted for the design of each impeller. The predicted performance curves result through the calculation of the internal flow field and a successful correlation of local and global parameters. The numerical solution of the discretized three-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations over an unstructured grid is accomplished with a commercial CFD finite-volume code.
