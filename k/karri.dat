5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii fruits singly or {{in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} grass or among leaf litter. It is {{typically}} found in eucalypt forest and subtropical rainforests. It has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. In southwest Australia it is found in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and <b>karri</b> (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forests, where fruiting usually occurs in late autumn and early winter. The fungus appears to prefer disturbed ground, as it is often found at roadsides by forests, on lawns, grassy areas of parks, and among the slash of thinned <b>karri</b> regrowth forests. It is common in river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) woodlands. M.clelandii also occurs in New Zealand, where it is found in mixed mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), kānuka (Kunzea ericoides), and kauri (Agathis) forest, and in conifer plantations. It is the smallest and most slender of the Macrolepiota species that occur there.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, {{with a pair}} or small group of birds maintaining and defending a territory year-round. These territories average around 0.4–2.4hectares (1–6acres) in optimal habitat of tall <b>karri</b> forest, although are smaller and restricted to dense riverbank undergrowth in less favourable habitats.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis is {{endemic to}} the Southwest Botanical Province, a floristic {{province}} renowned as a biodiversity hotspot, {{located in the}} southwest corner of Western Australia. This area has a Mediterranean climate, with wet winters and hot, dry summers. B.sessilis occurs throughout much of the province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin, east along the south coast as far as Bremer Bay, and inland to Wongan Hills and Kulin. It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the <b>Karri</b> forest in the cool, wet, southwest corner of the province, but even there, B.sessilis var. cordata occurs along the coast.|$|E
50|$|<b>Karris</b> Guile (née White Oak) {{returns to}} the Chromeria {{with the rest of}} the Blackguard from Ru, whereupon the White strips her of her {{position}} for marrying the Prism and insists that <b>Karris</b> can no longer draft since she is close to breaking her halo (when a drafter uses too much magic, the luxin residue breaks through their irises, and they become a Wight). She then puts <b>Karris</b> in charge of managing the Chromeria's spies.|$|R
50|$|Ironfist helps <b>Karris</b> and Kip escape, {{and they}} both go after Garadul directly. Kip sees Lord Omnichrome give Zymun (a red drafter Kip knows from Rekton's burning) his mother's {{rosewood}} case, but Kip decides to help <b>Karris.</b> Playing on her disgust with the Prism and Chromeria, Omnichrome persuades Liv to join his cause in return for aiding Kip and <b>Karris.</b> Omnichrome intends for Garadul to die, so Corvan and Dazen try to save him. They are unsuccessful; Kip kills him in a rage before he can be stopped.|$|R

5|$|The grey currawong {{is found}} in wet and dry sclerophyll forests across its range, as well as mallee scrubland, and open areas such as parks or {{farmland}} near forested areas. It also inhabits pine plantations. Preferences vary between regions; subspecies versicolor {{is more common in}} wetter forests in southeastern mainland Australia, while the Tasmanian subspecies arguta is found most commonly in lowland dry sclerophyll forest. The subspecies melanoptera and intermedia are found mainly in mallee scrublands and woodlands, while in Western Australia, subspecies plumbea {{is found in}} various forests and woodlands, such as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), <b>karri</b> (E.diversicolor), tuart (E.gomphocephala) and wandoo (E.wandoo), as well as paperbark woodlands around swampy areas, and acacia shrublands dominated by summer-scented wattle (Acacia rostellifera) and mulga (Acacia aneura) with Eremophila understory.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren {{was officially}} {{described}} by ornithologist John Gould in 1837, who derived the bird's specific name {{derived from the}} Latin term elegans 'elegant'. He gave its location as the East Coast, but realised his error after further collections by John Gilbert from Southwestern Australia. Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described birds from the southern <b>karri</b> forests as subspecies warreni in 1916 {{on the basis of}} darker female plumage. However, others have not observed this subsequently and the consensus is that no separate subspecies are recognized. In fact there is little variation in size or colour within the species between populations or individuals.|$|E
5|$|Bearing a nice narrow pointed bill {{adapted for}} probing and {{catching}} insects, the red-winged fairywren is primarily insectivorous; it forages {{and lives in}} the shelter of scrubby vegetation in temperate wetter forests dominated by the <b>karri</b> (Eucalyptus diversicolor), remaining close to cover to avoid predators. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, with small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. There is {{a higher proportion of}} female helpers recorded for this species than for other species of fairywren. A variety of vocalisations and visual displays have been recorded for communication and courtship in this species. Singing is used to advertise territory, and birds can distinguish other individuals on song alone. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display.|$|E
5000|$|Mark {{says they}} had nets in [...] and {{they and their}} father, Zebedee, {{employed}} other men in [...] <b>Karris</b> argues this shows they had money and a high probability of being educated, with {{a knowledge of the}} Jewish Bible. Others point to [...] to show that they were unschooled, but <b>Karris</b> argues against reading this too literally.|$|R
5000|$|Sixteen {{years after}} the war, the Prism {{receives}} a note from a woman claiming to be [...] "Lina," [...] instructing him to meet his now 15-year-old son across the world in Tyrea. He had not known of his son's existence until this point. This child was conceived while Gavin was betrothed to <b>Karris</b> White Oak, {{a member of his}} Blackguard, the most elite military force in the world. The White sends <b>Karris</b> to Garriston, Tyrea's capital, to spy on its Satrap's army. She gives <b>Karris</b> a note concerning Gavin's unfaithfulness, to be read after leaving the Chromeria. Gavin is sent somewhere else to keep the two separated, but instead chooses to bring <b>Karris</b> to Garriston himself before she can read the note, using a mode of transportation no one else even believes possible: magically-aided flight across the ocean. This allows them to enter Tyrea in hours, rather than the month or so expected otherwise.|$|R

5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in <b>karri</b> regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina on the stump base.|$|E
25|$|Warren, {{also known}} as <b>Karri</b> Forest Region and the Jarrah-Karri forest and shrublands ecoregion, is a biogeographic region in {{southern}} Western Australia. Located in {{the southwest corner of}} Western Australia between Cape Naturaliste and Albany, it is bordered to the north and east by the Jarrah Forest region. Its defining characteristic is an extensive tall forest of Eucalyptus diversicolor (<b>karri).</b> This occurs on dissected, hilly ground, with a moderately wet climate. <b>Karri</b> is a valuable timber and much of the <b>karri</b> forest has been logged over, but less than a third has been cleared for agriculture. Recognised as a region under the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA), and as a terrestrial ecoregion by the World Wide Fund for Nature, it was first defined by Ludwig Diels in 1906.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} vegetation of the Warren {{region is}} the <b>karri</b> (Eucalyptus diversicolor), at 90m the tallest trees in Australia, {{in association with}} the three tingle trees, which are endemic to this coast: rates tingle (E.brevistylis), red tingle (E.jacksonii) and yellow tingle (E.guilfoylei). <b>Karri</b> has a thick undergrowth of flowers and shrubs such as coral vine (Kennedia coccinea). The most important plant families are Fabaceae (including the colourful Wisteria), Orchidaceae, Mimosaceae, Myrtaceae and Proteaceae.|$|E
50|$|Liv and Kip {{run away}} to free <b>Karris</b> from Garadul's captivity. Ironfist leaves {{a few hours}} later, to see to their survival. Liv infiltrates successfully, while Kip is {{recognized}} and captured, though not before drafting sub-red for the first time. <b>Karris,</b> meanwhile, is taken to meet Lord Omnichrome, a color wight who heads Garadul's drafters. She recognizes him as her brother Koios, thought-killed by Dazen in overzealous self-defense before the war.|$|R

He ultimately rejects this, however, and is saved {{at the very}} last moment by <b>Karris</b> and Ironfist. They return him to the Chromeria, however, he loses one of his eyes before they can get to him.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} sleepers were creosoted Baltic fir spaced at 22 inch centres. These {{have now}} been entirely replaced by second-hand standard gauge sleepers cut into thirds, creosoted douglas fir, or jarrah and <b>karri</b> (Australian hardwoods from the eucalyptus family).|$|E

25|$|Most {{occur in}} heathlands or low woodlands; {{of the eastern}} species, B.integrifolia and B.marginata occur in forests; many {{south-western}} species such as B.grandis, B.sphaerocarpa, B.sessilis, B.nobilis and B.dallanneyi grow as understorey plants in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), wandoo (E. wandoo) and <b>karri</b> (E. diversicolor) forests, with B.seminuda {{being one of the}} forest trees in suitable habitat.|$|E
50|$|With the White dead {{just before}} Sunday, a new White {{is to be}} selected. Orea, the {{previous}} White, has maneuvered <b>Karris</b> into the selection process. Using intuition provided to her by Orholam, she divines that someone, presumably Andross, attempted to subvert the selection. After choosing the correct stone and surviving an immediate assassination attempt, she becomes the new White.|$|R
50|$|Kip, <b>Karris</b> and Corvan {{retreat to}} the docks, along with the Prism. Kip saves Ironfist's life before chasing the ship that's already left the dock. As Kip runs across the water, he sees someone stab the Prism from behind with the dagger, and tackles him off the ship. He {{retrieves}} the box and leaves the assassin for the sharks before escaping with the Prism's ship.|$|R
50|$|The Prism {{returns to}} the Chromeria, having lost green in {{addition}} to blue, to rally the spectrum for war with the Color Prince. Through {{a great deal of}} political maneuvering he is successful, though not without making enemies of red, blue and yellow, and removing green altogether. Andross pressures him to marry the green, but he eventually marries <b>Karris</b> instead. Before Andross can object properly, war is upon them.|$|R
25|$|The {{southwest}} {{coastal area}} has a Mediterranean climate. It was originally heavily forested, including large stands of <b>karri,</b> {{one of the}} tallest trees in the world. This agricultural region {{is one of the}} nine most bio-diverse terrestrial habitats, with a higher proportion of endemic species than most other equivalent regions. Thanks to the offshore Leeuwin Current, the area {{is one of the top}} six regions for marine biodiversity and contains the most southerly coral reefs in the world.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} rest of the South West, there is a fairly low {{diversity}} of bird species. Endemism is similarly low, as most South West bird species are habitat generalists with wide distributions. Exceptions include the red-eared firetail (Stagonopleura oculata) and the white-breasted robin (Eopsaltria georgiana), both of which occur only in the <b>karri</b> forest; the western bristlebird (Dasyornis longirostris), western whipbird (Psophodes nigrogularis nigrogularis) and western ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), all of which inhabit the region's heath vegetation; and the noisy scrub-bird (Atrichornis clamosus), which inhabits densely vegetated gullies. Other forest birds include the purple-crowned lorikeet.|$|E
25|$|Most of Western Australia has a hot arid and {{semi-arid}} climate. However, the south-west {{corner of}} the state has a Mediterranean climate. The area was originally heavily forested, including large stands of the <b>karri,</b> one of the tallest trees in the world. This agricultural region of Western Australia is in the top nine terrestrial habitats for terrestrial biodiversity, with a higher proportion of endemic species than most other equivalent regions. Due to the offshore Leeuwin Current, the area numbers in the top six regions for marine biodiversity, containing the most southerly coral reefs in the world.|$|E
50|$|As {{they draw}} closer, <b>Karris</b> sees smoke, and directs {{them to the}} former town of Rekton, which has been {{burned to the ground}} by Tyrean soldiers. They are just in time to save a {{teenager}} from being executed, killing several of the Satrap's personal bodyguards in the process. Gavin is then confronted by the irate Satrap himself, who calls himself King Garadul and his Satrapi a true independent nation. The town was burned on his order, as an example, due to their refusal to pay levies.|$|R
5000|$|According to Robert J. <b>Karris</b> [...] "Luke alone of the evangelists {{introduces}} {{his work}} with a finely crafted, periodic Greek sentence." [...] The first sentence gives the [...] "since" [...] clause, the main clause is given {{in the first part}} of the second sentence, and the purpose clause is given by [...] "so that you may know...". Luke uses the word epeidēper to start the book, a literary word that only occurs here in the Greek Bible. He uses diēgēsis for [...] "an account", which taken alone seems to mean a personal storytelling, but when compared to other usages at the time, such as with the works of Josephus, is to be taken as meaning a well planned account, although he might use it in the original meaning in [...] He uses the word kathexēs for orderly account, which would mean a logical, spatial, or chronological account. <b>Karris</b> argues that the use of the word as well in Acts indicated that Luke is composing in a logical sequence, with Luke building a logical argument for his view of God fulfilling his promises through Jesus. Many scholars have seen parallels between this style and the openings to the Greek histories of Herodotus and Thucydides as well as scientific manuals and treatises of the Hellenistic world.|$|R
50|$|Away {{from all}} this, <b>Karris</b> reads the note {{given to her}} by the White, and is angered by Gavin's betrayal, his lies about it when {{breaking}} their engagement, and the White's attempts to manipulate her into forgiving him. Because of this, she ultimately refuses Gavin's offer of assistance {{the rest of the}} way to Garriston, opting to explore Rekton while Gavin brings Kip back to the Chromeria. She meets Corvan Danavis, Kip's tutor and a former general of Dazen Guile's army. She is eventually captured by king Garadul, while Corvan continues to Garriston.|$|R
25|$|The Flames {{finally ended}} their home losing streak {{with their first}} win at the Saddledome in eight {{contests}} with a 3–2 win over the Phoenix Coyotes on January 22, 2014. Calgary won a second consecutive home game two nights later as the team overcame a four-goal effort by former Flame Eric Nystrom to defeat the Nashville Predators 5–4 in a shootout. Three additional wins followed as the Flames won every contest of a five-game homestand {{for the first time}} in 17 years. The final game of the homestand was costly however, as <b>Karri</b> Ramo suffered an MCL injury that kept him out of the lineup until after the NHL's break for the 2014 Winter Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Eucalypts {{have many}} uses which {{have made them}} {{economically}} important trees, and have become a cash crop in poor areas such as Timbuktu, Africa and the Peruvian Andes, despite concerns that the trees are invasive in some countries like South Africa. Best-known are perhaps the varieties <b>karri</b> and yellow box. Due to their fast growth, the foremost benefit of these trees is their wood. They can be chopped off at the root and grow back again. They provide many desirable characteristics for use as ornament, timber, firewood and pulpwood. It is also used {{in a number of}} industries, from fence posts and charcoal to cellulose extraction for biofuels. Fast growth also makes eucalypts suitable as windbreaks and to reduce erosion.|$|E
25|$|Calgary's home arena, the Scotiabank Saddledome, {{suffered}} {{significant damage}} {{over the summer}} during widespread flooding that inundated the land around the arena. The facility was repaired {{in time for the}} playing season, a year in which the Flames were widely predicted to finish in last place in the Pacific Division. Calgary finished the year with a 35–40–7 record to finish sixth in the seven-team division and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season. The team's top selection at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, Sean Monahan, made the squad as an 18-year-old and finished second in team goal scoring with 22 goals. Michael Cammalleri led with 26 goals, while Jiri Hudler was the team leader in assists (37) and points (54). <b>Karri</b> Ramo was one of four goaltenders to appear for Calgary, and led the team with 17 wins.|$|E
5000|$|A pirate [...] "rescues" [...] the Prism and Kip. He takes Kip's dagger (which {{now more}} closely resembles a broadsword, with a musket mounted on) and the Prism revives. The pirate, called Gunner, decides to keep 'Gavin' but throws Kip {{back into the}} ocean. He {{eventually}} washes up on the shore, and is captured by Zymun Whiteoak, returning to the Chromeria under Andross's instructions. It is then revealed that Zymun is Kip's half brother, being the child of <b>Karris</b> and the real Gavin who is also Kip's actual father.|$|R
50|$|Kip and the Prism {{return to}} their army's flagship, where an enraged Andross berates the Prism for marrying <b>Karris</b> {{and a host of}} other offenses, {{claiming}} to have begun the process of unseating him. Kip, meanwhile, recognizes this as the scene in the card, and Andross as a red wight. In a sudden, fierce confrontation, Kip briefly stabs Andross with his dagger, before a brawl develops. The Prism briefly considers killing Kip in order to retrieve the knife before Andross can, but instead stabs himself with it before diving off the ship. Kip jumps after him.|$|R
