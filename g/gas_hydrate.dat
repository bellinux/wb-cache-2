25|$|The {{second major}} topic {{being looked at}} is how this warming will affect methane gas release in the ocean seabed along the {{continental}} margins in West Spitsbergen. There exists these <b>gas</b> <b>hydrate</b> stability zones where a small fluctuation in temperature could dissociate these hydrates and release methane gas bubbles that rise {{to the surface and}} are released into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic {{region is}} one of the many natural sources of the {{greenhouse}} gas methane. Global warming accelerates its release, due to both release of methane from existing stores, and from methanogenesis in rotting biomass. Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, permafrost, and as undersea clathrates. Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming. Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost and decaying <b>gas</b> <b>hydrate</b> deposits.|$|E
25|$|A {{release of}} methane from clathrates, however, is {{believed}} to be slow and chronic rather than catastrophic and that 21st-century effects of such a release are therefore likely to be 'significant but not catastrophic'. It is further noted that 'much methane from dissociated <b>gas</b> <b>hydrate</b> may never reach the atmosphere', as it can be dissolved into the ocean and be broken down biologically. Other research demonstrates that a release to the atmosphere can occur during large releases. These sources suggest that the clathrate gun effect alone will not be sufficient to cause 'catastrophic' climate change within a human lifetime.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{a debate}} about {{whether there was a}} large enough amount of methane hydrate to be a major carbon source; a recent paper {{proposed}} that was the case. The present-day global methane hydrate reserve is poorly constrained, but is mostly considered to be between 2,000 and 10,000 Gt. However, because the global ocean bottom temperatures were ~6°C higher than today, which implies a much smaller volume of sediment hosting <b>gas</b> <b>hydrate</b> than today, the global amount of hydrate before the PETM has been thought to be much less than present-day estimates. in a 2006 study, scientists regarded the source of carbon for the PETM to be a mystery.

2500|$|Methane cycling and {{carbonate}} formation by microorganisms in chemosynthetic environments {{have implications}} for the control of greenhouse gases. [...] Methane can be trapped and stored under the seabed as a <b>gas</b> <b>hydrate,</b> and under different conditions, can either be controlled by microbial consumption, or can escape into the surrounding seawater, and ultimately the atmosphere. Our understanding of the biological controls of methane seepage and feedback mechanisms for global warming is limited. The distribution and structure of cold seep communities can act as an indicator for changes in methane fluxes in the deep sea, e.g. by seafloor warming. [...] Using multibeam echosounder data and 3D seismic data with in situ studies at seep sites, and by investigating the life histories of fauna at such ecosystems, HERMIONE scientists aim to understand more about their interconnectivity and resilience, and the implications for climate change.|$|E
2500|$|The {{volume of}} water {{escaping}} {{from within and}} beneath the forearc results in some of Earth’s most dynamic and complex interactions between aqueous fluids and rocks. Most of this water is trapped in pores and fractures in the upper lithosphere and sediments of the subducting plate. [...] The average forearc is underrun by a solid volume of oceanic sediment that is [...] thick. [...] This sediment enters the trench with 50–60% porosity. These sediments are progressively squeezed as they are subducted, reducing void space and forcing fluids out along the decollement and up into the overlying forearc, {{which may or may}} not have an accretionary prism. Sediments accreted to the forearc are another source of fluids. Water is also bound in hydrous minerals, especially clays and opal. [...] Increasing pressure and temperature experienced by subducted materials converts the hydrous minerals to denser phases that contain progressively less structurally bound water. Water released by dehydration accompanying phase transitions is another source of fluids introduced to the base of the overriding plate. [...] These fluids may travel through the accretionary prism diffusely, via interconnected pore spaces in sediments, or may follow discrete channels along faults. [...] Sites of venting may take the form of mud volcanoes or seeps and are often associated with chemosynthetic communities. [...] Fluids escaping from the shallowest parts of a subduction zone may also escape along the plate boundary but have rarely been observed draining along the trench axis. All of these fluids are dominated by water but also contain dissolved ions and organic molecules, especially methane. [...] Methane is often sequestered in an ice-like form (methane clathrate, also called <b>gas</b> <b>hydrate)</b> in the forearc. These are a potential energy source and can rapidly break down. Destabilization of gas hydrates has contributed to global warming in the past and will likely do so in the future.|$|E
