40|$|Various XML-based {{approaches}} {{aimed at}} representing compound digital assets have emerged {{over the last}} several years. Approaches that are of specific relevance to the digital library community include the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS), the IMS Content Packaging XML Binding, and the XML Formatted Data Units (XFDU) developed by CCSDS Panel 2. The MPEG- 21 <b>Digital</b> <b>Item</b> <b>Declaration</b> (MPEG- 21 DID) is another standard specifying the representation of digital assets in XML that, so far, has received little attention in the digital library community.
