Using whole-genome sequencing of all Yersinia species, we delineate the gene complement of the whole genus and define patterns of virulence evolution. Multiple distinct <b>ecological</b> <b>specializations</b> appear to have split pathogenic strains from environmental, nonpathogenic lineages. This split demonstrates that contrary to hypotheses that all pathogenic Yersinia species share a recent common pathogenic ancestor, they have evolved independently but followed parallel evolutionary paths in acquiring the same virulence determinants as well as becoming progressively more limited metabolically. Shared virulence determinants are limited to the virulence plasmid pYV and the attachment invasion locus ail. These acquisitions, together with genomic variations in metabolic pathways, have resulted in the parallel emergence of related pathogens displaying an increasingly specialized lifestyle with a spectrum of virulence potential, an emerging theme in the evolution of other important human pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ecological</b> <b>specializations</b> such as antipredator defense can {{reinforce}} morphological and distributional divergence within hybridizing species. Two hybridizing {{species of}} Daphnia (D. galeata and D. dentifera) are distributed in both Japan and North America; however, these populations {{have a longer}} history in Japan than in North America due to the differing impact of the last glaciation on these two regions. We tested the hypothesis that this longer coexistence in Japan would lead to extensive genetic admixture in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA whilst the distinct morphological traits and distributional patterns would be maintained. Results The high level of correspondence among morphological traits, distribution, and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA types for the specimens with D. dentifera mtDNA indicated that the species distinction has been maintained. However, a discordance between mtDNA and nuclear ITS- 1 types was observed for most specimens that had D. galeata mtDNA, consistent with the pattern seen between the two species in North America. This observation suggests nuclear introgression from D. dentifera into D. galeata without mitochondrial introgression. Conclusions The separation of morphological traits and distribution ranges of the two hybridizing species in Japan, {{as well as in}} North America, has been maintained, despite large differences in climatic and geographical histories of these two regions. Variations in environmental factors, such as predation pressure, might affect maintenance of the distribution, although the further studies are needed to confirm this. </p...|$|R

This study compares mitochondrial and microsatellite genetic diversity and structure among three sympatric rock-dwelling cichlids of Lake Tanganyika, Eretmodus cyanostictus, Tropheus moorii, and Ophthalmotilapia ventralis. The species represent three endemic, phylogenetically distinct tribes (Eretmodini, Tropheini, and Ectodini), and display divergent ecomorphological and behavioral specialization. Sample locations span both continuous, rocky shoreline {{and a potential}} dispersal barrier {{in the form of}} a muddy bay. High genetic diversity and population differentiation were detected in T. moorii and E. cyanostictus, whereas much lower variation and structure were found in O. ventralis. In particular, while a 7 -km-wide muddy bay curtails dispersal in all three species to a similar extent, gene flow along mostly continuous habitat appeared to be controlled by distance in E. cyanostictus, further restricted by site philopatry and/or minor habitat discontinuities in T. moorii, and unrestrained in O. ventralis. In contrast to the general pattern of high gene flow along continuous shorelines in rock-dwelling cichlids of Lake Malawi, our study identifies differences in population structure among stenotopic Lake Tanganyika species. The amount of genetic differentiation among populations was not related to the degree of geographical variation of body color, especially since more phenotypic variation is observed in O. ventralis than in the genetically highly structured E. cyanostictus...|$|R

We then investigated the potential relationships between morphological and behavioural specialization. These relationships differed markedly from the traditional ecomorphological paradigm. While morphological specialization showed no relationship with dietary specialization, it exhibited a strong relationship with foraging microhabitat specialization. However, this relationship was inverted: species with specialized morphologies were microhabitat generalists, whereas generalized morphotypes were microhabitat specialists. Interestingly, this mirrors relationships found in plant–pollinator communities and may also be applicable to other ecosystems, highlighting the potential importance of including niche axes beyond dietary specialization into ecomorphological frameworks.

My dissertation examines the pattern and evolutionary processes of divergence in pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) on alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and clover (Trifolium pretense).

The degree of genetic differentiation varied greatly among markers, suggesting that divergent natural selection drives aphid divergence in all geographic locations. Three of the same genetic markers were identified as evolving under divergent selection in the eastern and western regions, and additional divergent markers were identified in the East. In Chapter Three, I investigated population structure of aphids in North America, France, and Sweden using AFLPs.

The main aim {{of this study is to}} reevaluate the MAST ribogroups described so far and to determine whether additional groups can be found. For this purpose, we used traditional and state-of-the-art molecular tools, combining 18 S rDNA sequences from publicly available clone libraries, single amplified genomes (SAGs) of planktonic protists, and a pyrosequencing survey from coastal waters and sediments.

In this work we studied whole genome sequences of 28 strains of B. longum, including 8 sequences described in this paper. Part of these strains were isolated from healthy children during a long observation period (up to 10 years between isolation from the same patient). The three known subspecies (longum, infantis and suis) could be clearly divided using sequence-based phylogenetic methods, gene con-tent and the average nucleotide identity.

Vertical symbiont transmission via maternal passage is also pivotal for offspring’s growth and survival in many organisms [4 – 6]. Hence, {{it is expected that}} vertical symbiont transmission may coevolve with various organismal traits concerning maternal investment in offspring. Here we report a novel phenotypic syndrome entailing morphological, histological, behavioral, and <b>ecological</b> <b>specializations</b> for maternal investment and vertical symbiont transmission in stinkbugs of the family Urostylididae [7 – 9]. Adult females develop huge ovaries exaggerated for polysaccharide excretion, possess novel ovipositor-associated organs for vertical transmission of a bacterial symbiont (“Candidatus Tachikawaea gelatinosa”), and lay eggs covered with voluminous symbiont-supplemented jelly. Newborns hatch in midwinter, feed solely on the jelly, acquire the symbiont, and grow during winter. In spring, the insects start feeding on plant sap, wherein the symbiont localizes to a specialized midgut region and supplies essential amino acids deficient in the host’s diet. The reduced symbiont genome and host-symbiont cospeciation indicate their obligate association over evolutionary time. Experimental deprivation of the jelly results in nymphal mortality, whereas restoration of the jelly leads to recovered nymphal growth, confirming that the jelly supports nymphal growth in winter. Chemical analyses demonstrate that the galactan-based jelly contains a sufficient quantity of amino acids to sustain nymphal growth to the third instar. The versatile biological roles of the symbiont-containing egg-covering jelly highlight intricate evolutionary interactions between maternal resource investment and vertical symbiont transmission, which are commonly important for offspring’s growth, survival, and ecological adaptation...|$|R

In this study, we used a time-calibrated phylogeny of 70 Iberian species of short-horned grasshoppers (Acrididae) to test for patterns of morphological disparity {{in relation to their}} ecology and phylogenetic history. Specifically, we examined the role of substrate type and level of <b>ecological</b> <b>specialization</b> in driving different aspects of morphological evolution (locomotory traits, chemosensitive organs and cranial morphology) in this recent radiation. Results: We found a bimodal distribution of locomotory attributes corresponding to the two main substrate type guilds (plant vs. ground); plant-perching species tend to exhibit larger wings and thicker femora than those that remain on the ground. This suggests that life form (i. e., substrate type) is an important driving force in the evolution of morphological traits in short-horned grasshoppers, irrespective of ancestry. Substrate type and <b>ecological</b> <b>specialization</b> had no significant influence on head shape, a trait that showed a strong phylogenetic conservatism. Finally, we also found a marginal significant association between the length of antennae and the level of <b>ecological</b> <b>specialization,</b> suggesting that the development of sensory organs may be favored in specialist species. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that even in taxonomic groups showing limited morphological and ecological disparity, natural selection seems to play a more important role than genetic drift in driving the speciation process.

In this dissertation, I used data from benthic diatom communities of tropical (Lake Matano, Sulawesi, Indonesia) and temperate (Mazinaw Lake, Ontario, Canada) freshwater lakes to evaluate several novel models regarding the mechanisms that regulate the composition, structure, and relative abundance of biological communities. I demonstrated that in Lake Matano, diatom communities exhibited high degrees of small-scale patchiness and were not regulated by geographic proximity or substrate characteristics.

In general, groups of species with higher levels of <b>ecological</b> <b>specialization</b> exhibited higher levels of taxonomic diversity and lower species abundances, and my results demonstrate that more specialized taxa tended to partition resources while generalists were more prone to competitive effects. In colonization experiments, assemblages from low latitudes proceeded quickly through the early successional period and exhibited deterministic community structure in as little as ten days. This deterministic structure was not observed in similar experiments conducted in a temperate system and succession was frequently reset by weather events. Additionally, taxa from within the tropical assemblage responded independently when subjected to a simulated upwelling event, and neither simulated nor actual disturbances invoked changes in community composition in this system. In summary, I proposed the following Rules of Assembly as they pertain to diatom communities: 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFew {{studies have}} focused on the early {{colonization}} of New Caledonia by insects, after the re-emergence of the main island, 37 Myr ago. Here we investigate the mode and tempo of evolution of a new endemic cricket genus, Pixibinthus, recently discovered in southern New Caledonia. First we formally describe this new monotypic genus found exclusively in the open shrubby vegetation on metalliferous soils, named ‘maquis minier’, unique to New Caledonia. We then reconstruct a dated molecular phylogeny based on five mitochondrial and four nuclear loci in order to establish relationships of Pixibinthus within Eneopterinae crickets. Pixibinthus is recovered as thesister clade of the endemic genus Agnotecous, mostly rainforest-dwellers. Dating results show that the island colonization by their common ancestor occurred around 34. 7 Myr, shortly after New Caledonia re-emergence. Pixibinthus and Agnotecous are then one of the oldest insect lineages documented so far for New Caledonia. This discovery highlights for the first time two clear-cut <b>ecological</b> <b>specializations</b> between sister clades, as Agnotecous is mainly found in rainforests with 19 species, whereas Pixibinthus is found in open habitats with a single documented species. The preference of Pixibinthus for open habitats and of Agnotecous for forest habitats nicely fits an acoustic specialization, either explained by differences in body size or in acoustic properties of their respective habitats. We hypothesize that landscape dynamics, linked to major past climatic events and recent change in fire regimes are possible causes for both present-day low diversity and rarity in genus Pixibinthus. The unique evolutionary history of this old New Caledonian lineage stresses the importance to increase our knowledge on the faunal biodiversity of ‘maquis minier’, in order to better understand the origin and past dynamics of New Caledonian biota...|$|R
40|$|The vomeronasal {{system is}} crucial for social and sexual {{communication}} in mammals. Two populations of vomeronasal sensory neurons, each expressing G alpha i 2 or G alpha o proteins, send projections to glomeruli of the rostral or caudal accessory olfactory bulb, rAOB and cAOB, respectively. In rodents, the G alpha i 2 - and G alpha o-expressing vomeronasal pathways have shown differential responses to small/volatile vs. large/non-volatile semiochemicals, respectively. Moreover, early gene expression suggests predominant activation of rAOB and cAOB neurons in sexual vs. aggressive contexts, respectively. We recently described the AOB of Octodon degus, a semiarid-inhabiting diurnal caviomorph. Their AOB has a cell indentation between subdomains and the rAOB is {{twice the size of}} the cAOB. Moreover, their AOB receives innervation from the lateral aspect, contrasting with the medial innervation of all other mammals examined to date. Aiming to relate AOB anatomy with lifestyle, we performed a morphometric study on the AOB of the capybara, a semiaquatic caviomorph whose lifestyle differs remarkably from that of O. degus. Capybaras mate in water and scent-mark their surroundings with oily deposits, mostly for male-male communication. We found that, similar to O. degus, the AOB of capybaras shows a lateral innervation of the vomeronasal nerve, a cell indentation between subdomains and heterogeneous subdomains, but in contrast to O. degus the caudal portion is larger than the rostral one. We also observed that four other caviomorph species present a lateral AOB innervation and a cell indentation between AOB subdomains, suggesting that those traits could represent apomorphies of the group. We propose that although some AOB traits may be phylogenetically conserved in caviomorphs, <b>ecological</b> <b>specializations</b> may {{play an important role in}} shaping the AOB.

40|$|Plants of {{the genus}} Conophytum are dwarf {{xerophytes}} from the arid, winter-rainfall regions of southern Africa, remarkable for the extreme succulence of their fused leaf pairs, and for the frequently cryptic appearance of their vegetative bodies, which has earned them the common name “living stones. ” About 10 other genera in the family Aizoaceae contain sphaeroid succulents, with analogous shoot morphology, but none appear to be closely related to Conophytum. With about 100 species, exhibiting a range of growth forms and <b>ecological</b> <b>specializations,</b> Conophytum {{is by far the}} largest and most diverse genus of living stones. ^ My investigations of the microscopic characteristics of Conophytum leaves, using SEM and light microscopy, has revealed hitherto unknown variability between species in the expression of characteristics such as sunken stomata, bladder cells, the hypodermis, and epidermal layers of calcium oxalate crystal sand. The patterns of distribution of these anatomical and micromorphological features provide new insights into the taxonomy, systematics, and ecology (many of the characters are relevant to survival in dry climates) {{of the genus}}. The chromosome counts that I have obtained for Conophytum enable comparative study of the cytology of the genus, which consists predominantly of diploid populations, but with several complexes of tetraploid species. ^ Using evidence from my SEM, anatomical, and cytological work, along with characters from gross vegetative and floral morphology, I have undertaken the first morphological cladistic analysis of Conophytum. The resulting phylogeny resolves, with bootstrap support, a number of the sections of the genus, while indicating that other traditionally recognized groupings are actually paraphyletic or polyphyletic. Several biologically significant characters, such as nocturnal flowers and the windowed-geophyte growth form, seem to have evolved more than once, in parallel. A striking trend in the character evolution of Conophytum is the reduction of plesiomorphic anatomical adaptations to drought, like sunken stomata, with a compensatory rise of novel strategies for surviving in xeric environments, like protective tunics formed from old leaves, and the retreat of the plant body underground. ...|$|R
