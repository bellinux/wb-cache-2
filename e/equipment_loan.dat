40|$|It is {{no secret}} that, for {{information}} seekers, the hegemony of libraries as “the place to go,” both physically and virtually, is being challenged. As Google and other search engines increasingly compete with libraries {{as a means for}} patrons to find information in an online environment, it is essential that libraries maintain effective web presences of their own. A redesign of the Joyner Library at East Carolina University website has led not only to an increase in website traffic but, more crucially, to an increase in use of library services, including the library’s <b>equipment</b> <b>loan</b> program and Serial Solution’s Summon discovery service. A combination of better web design principles and improved information architecture has served to attract more patrons to the library website while also making it easier for patrons to navigate to the content most suited to their needs. An effective web presence is one piece of the puzzle in ensuring that libraries continue to remain relevant and one that can, in many ways, be more easily and cost-effectively implemented. This poster session will highlight the changes made to the Joyner Library website’s design and architecture, the results of these alterations and goals for future development...|$|E

40|$|Blind Ocean Acoustic Tomography (BOAT) is {{an ocean}} remote {{exploration}} concept similar to acoustic tomography but where both the emitted signal waveform {{and the source}} osition are unknown. BOAT consists of a minimal environmental model of the area, a broadband matched- eld processor and a genetic algorithm search procedure. This paper presents the results obtained with BOAT on part of the data set acquired during the INTIFANTE' 00 sea trial, where an acoustic source was towed along both range independent and range dependent paths, with source-receiver ranges varying from 500 m up to 5. 5 km and water depths varying from 70 to 120 m. The results obtained on several hours of data, show that source range and depth {{can be used as}} focalizing parameters, together with the Bartlett power to indicate model tness.

40|$|The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) {{launched}} the Minnesota Bicycle and Pedestrian Counting Initiative in 2011, a statewide, collaborative effort {{to encourage and}} support non-motorized traffic monitoring. This report summarizes work by MnDOT and the University of Minnesota between 2014 and 2016 to institutionalize bicycle and pedestrian monitoring. The project team established a new statewide bicycle and pedestrian traffic monitoring network with 25 permanent monitoring locations and a new district-based portable counting <b>equipment</b> <b>loan</b> program. Other key accomplishments included Minnesota’s first Bicycle and Pedestrian Annual Traffic Monitoring Report, a new MnDOT website for reporting annual and short-duration counts, and a new Bicycle and Pedestrian Data Collection Manual that local jurisdictions and consultants can use to design manual and automated non-motorized traffic monitoring programs. The project team also included provisions in MnDOT equipment vendor agreements that enable local governments to purchase bicycle and monitoring equipment; established new annual training programs for bicycle and pedestrian monitoring; and contributed provisions in the Statewide Bicycle System Plan and Minnesota Walks that call for bicycle and pedestrian traffic monitoring and creation of performance measures based on counts. Despite this progress, challenges in implementing monitoring remain and continued investment in and support for bicycle and traffic monitoring is needed...|$|E
40|$|Bangladesh is {{predominantly}} agricultural {{country from the}} beginning of its invention. About 85 % people are living in the rural society to sustain their life in the hard situation. To the rural economy finance is very potential to provide in the development of agricultural activities.

Among them BKB, RAKUB and four government bank played key role in the agriculture development besides private commercial banks and foreign commercial banks are also active in loan providing. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify the relation of agricultural marketing goods loan to other loans. This study is confined to the loans on different agricultural sectors by five banks of Bangladesh named NCBs, BKB, RAKUB, BRDB and BSBL and the contribution to agricultural marketing goods loan by the agriculture sector by the lenders for the nine years period from 2005 - 2006 to 2011 - 2012.
