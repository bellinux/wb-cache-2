25|$|The natural {{mechanism}} of seed dispersal for Osage orange, {{and the reason}} for its limited historical range despite its adaptability, {{has been the subject of}} debate. One hypothesis is that the Osage orange fruit was eaten by a giant ground sloth that became extinct shortly after the first human settlement of North America. Other extinct Pleistocene megafauna, such as the mammoth, mastodon and gomphothere, may have fed on the fruit and aided in seed dispersal. An equine species that became extinct at the same time also has been suggested as the plant's original <b>dispersal</b> <b>agent</b> because modern horses and other livestock will sometimes eat the fruit.

40|$|The {{handful of}} studies that have {{investigated}} chimpanzee and gorilla seed-dispersal identify these primates as important <b>dispersal</b> <b>agents.</b> These studies do not, however, make any measure of the 'quality' of the dispersal service offered by chimpanzees and gorillas. Determining 'quality' requires {{a measure of the}} dispersal distance and the microsite to which the seeds are dispersed. In this study, I report the first estimate of seed dispersal curves for chimpanzees and gorillas. Seed dispersal curves were produced by combining ape movement data with gut passage curves from literature. The derived dispersal distances for chimpanzees and gorillas are similar c. 7. 7 km; this is surprisingly large when compared with other seed <b>dispersal</b> <b>agents.</b> This is likely due to a combination of foraging behaviour and gut physiology. At a species level, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were shown to direct dispersal of Uapaca palidosa to favourable microsites even though gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) were responsible for moving a greater number of seeds. This study presents a novel method for the rapid derivation of dispersal curves and highlights the importance of incorporating species. level as well as community level studies to assess the quality of seed <b>dispersal</b> <b>agents.</b> It is my hope that the methods presented here be applied elsewhere so that the role of extant megaherbivores as seed <b>dispersal</b> <b>agents</b> be incorporated into future models that investigate forest dynamics...|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} the popular account (Davies & Chittenden 2013) was written, the present author was unaware of any other {{reliable}} records of Eastern Green Tinkerbird for southern Mozambique, aside from Quadros’s skin. However, this overlooked K.L. Tinley’s (1977: table 9.6) unpublished thesis for the Gorongosa area, Sofala Province, in which Eastern Green Tinkerbird was listed as a frugivore <b>dispersal</b> <b>agent</b> on the Gorongosa Massif. A highly experienced naturalist, K.L. Tinley (in litt., 16 May 2013) confirms that “I frequently saw Green Tinkerbird when I climbed the footpath through the forest once a month 1969-1972 to the highest plateau to collect and record the phenology of the summit grasslands”. This footpath approximately ran from the Murombedzi Waterfall (18° 29’ S, 34°0 2’ E, ca 850 m asl) up to the summit on the south-west side of the massif (with complete altitudinal sequence of wet, closed-canopy forest up to ca 1800 m asl).

40|$|Seed {{dispersal}} is {{a critical}} stage in the life-cycle of plants. It is {{the process by which}} seeds escape the potentially deleterious density-dependent effects of deposition beneath conspecifics and other individuals. Long distance dispersal (LDD) – the movement of seeds considerable distances away from the parent plant – strongly influences plant population structures and dynamics. In response to global environmental change, LDD is a key mechanism by which species may be able to establish in new habitats and climatic ranges. The emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is an important LDD vector in Australian ecosystems, capable of traversing many kilometres over a few days, and retaining large amounts of seed within the gut for up to a few weeks. In this thesis, the population dynamics of four large-seeded species within the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests of southwestern Australia was investigated within areas of contrasting high/low emu abundance. The focal plant species could all be dispersed by the emu and represented different life histories; Leucopogon nutans (Ericaceae), a fire-killed, short-lived seeder shrub, Persoonia elliptica (Proteaceae), an epicormic resprouting tree, Macrozamia riedlei (Zamiaceae), a long-lived, apical resprouting cycad, and Podocarpus drouynianus (Podocarpaceae), a long-lived, basal resprouting coniferous shrub. Plant demographic assessment revealed that {{there was no difference in}} population structure, demographic rates or spatial structure for any of the species in contrasting sites of high/low emu abundance. A spatial simulation model and Bayesian change point analysis highlighted the difficulties in detecting a change in spatial structure following <b>dispersal</b> <b>agent</b> loss. For the three larger species, extreme plant longevity and environmental heterogeneity make it difficult to detect a change in plant spatial pattern following <b>dispersal</b> <b>agent</b> loss. For the shorter-lived L. nutans, high seed production and low frequency of removal masks any effect of whether emus are present or not in terms of population structure. Visitation and fruit removal rates were generally low for each species, irrespective of emu abundance. The <b>dispersal</b> <b>agent</b> community was depauperate, with only a few vertebrates acting as local dispersal agents for each focal species. The emu was observed to ingest all of the focal species except P. elliptica. Telemetric tagging of M. riedlei seeds revealed that the Australia Raven (Corvus coronoides) acts as a novel LDD vector, regularly dispersing individual seeds > 300 m from the parent plant. Spatially-explicit simulation modelling of emu movement, informed from the Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking of birds within jarrah forest showed that the emu is a highly mobile and effective LDD vector, and could disperse many seeds > 1500 m from the parent plant and up to a maximum dispersal distance of ca. 7000 m during a 1000 -hr simulated period. Modelling also revealed that the emu (and subsequent seed dispersal) is highly sensitive to changes to landscape configuration and composition. Simulated increases in habitat fragmentation and disconnection substantially reduced seed dispersal distances and collapsed LDD. The emu is a highly effective seed <b>dispersal</b> <b>agent</b> (in terms of both quantity and quality of seeds dispersed), yet remains directly persecuted in some agricultural areas, and faces the same population pressures from habitat loss as other large organisms. The emu has shown a remarkable resilience to these pressures, and provides a pathway for plant species to expand their ranges under global environmental change. However, in order to fulfil this function, the emu requires a relatively contiguous landscape. Future work should focus on understanding the long-term (seasonal) movements of the emu to provide a complete picture of how this species contributes to seed dispersal in a changing landscape...|$|E
