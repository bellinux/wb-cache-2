5000|$|However, the {{variable}} value is [...] {{until it is}} initialized, and forward reference is not possible.

5000|$|Immediately-invoked {{function}} expressions may {{be written}} {{in a number of}} different ways. A common convention is to enclose the function expression (and optionally its invocation operator) with the grouping operator, i.e. in parentheses, to explicitly tell the parser to expect an expression.

50|$|D is {{designed}} with {{lessons learned from}} practical C++ usage rather than from a purely theoretical perspective. Although it uses many C and C++ concepts it also discards some, and is as such not compatible with C and C++ source code. D has, however, been constrained in its design by the rule that any code that is legal in both C and D should behave in the same way. D gained some features before C++ did, for example closures, anonymous functions, and compile time function execution. D adds to the functionality of C++ by also implementing design by contract, unit testing, true modules, garbage collection, first class arrays, associative arrays, dynamic arrays, array slicing, nested functions, lazy evaluation, and a re-engineered template syntax. D retains C++'s ability to perform low-level coding and to add inline assembler. C++ multiple inheritance is replaced by Java-style single inheritance with interfaces and mixins. On the other hand, D's <b>declaration,</b> <b>statement</b> and expression syntax closely matches that of C++.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the present {{relationship}} between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the post-World War II transfer of Germans from Czechoslovakia to Germany. The new approach to this issue appeared {{after the fall of}} the communist regime in Czechoslovakia in 1989. The Sudeten German issue started to be openly discussed again, and both countries tried to solve this issue by negotiating and creating the Czech-German Declaration; however, this did not bring the reconciliation process to the end. This thesis describes the life of Czech and German nations within the Central European region since the thirteenth century and shows some important events of their common history. The thesis discusses the problem of nationalism, which started to increase from the beginning of the nineteenth century, and became a widespread political problem. In 1998, both the German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman backed the 1997 <b>declaration</b> <b>statement</b> by agreeing their countries would not encumber their relations with the past.

50|$|Although our {{original}} {{intention was to}} ascertain under which conditions detailed flowcharts were most helpful, our repeated negative results have led us to a more skeptical opinion of the utility of detailed flowcharts under modern programming conditions. We repeatedly selected problems and tried to create test conditions which would favor the flowchart groups, but found {{no statistically significant differences}} between the flowchart and non-flowchart groups. In some cases the mean scores for the non-flowchart groups even surpassed the means for the flowchart groups. We conjecture that detailed flowcharts are merely a redundant presentation of the information contained in the programming language statements. The flowcharts may even be at a disadvantage because they are not as complete (omitting <b>declarations,</b> <b>statement</b> labels, and input/output formats) and require many more pages than do the concise programming language statements.|$|R
