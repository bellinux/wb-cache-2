40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the debt crisis in the euro zone. The {{literature}} presents two interpretations of these events. The first attributes {{the responsibility of the}} crisis to the political authorities of the countries under attack. They let the citizens live beyond the standard allowed by the economy. This interpretation supports the use of austerity policies to solve the crisis. The second interpretation argues that the political authorities of all the European Union are responsible for the crisis. They kept alive an institutional organization of the coordination process between monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies,</b> which was known to be faulty. The paper presents theoretical and empirical arguments in favour of the second interpretation. It argues that austerity fails to stabilise the public debt and contends that a coordination process based on effective enforcement and on a European Fiscal Agency can achieve better results by favouring the adoption of coordinated and <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{efforts of}} {{politicians}} in power {{to affect the}} decisions of voters through <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> in pre-election periods are still topical. This article determines whether governments in European Union countries initiate the political-budget cycle. We analyse 23 EU member states in the period 1995 – 2008. We pay attention to four institutional factors that {{can contribute to the}} creation of the political-budget cycle: length of democracy, type of parliamentary election, term of election and ideology. We find that the political-budget cycle was present throughout European Union countries in this period. The factor of the length of democracy had a small impact on the statistical significance of the results. However, ideology turned out to be the most important factor in our analysis. Current revenues were used as a tool of <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> in the years of elections predominantly by ideologically mixed governments. Left-wing governments used rather the expenditure side of the budget to win the favour of the electorate. The type of election (regular or early) became relevant only in specific cases and in combination with other institutional factors. Finally, the new EU member governments consider the spring or autumn term of the election as a criterion co-determining their pre-election <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R
50|$|Fiscal policy {{consists}} {{in managing the}} national Budget and its financing so as to influence economic activity. This entails the expansion or contraction of government expenditures related to specific government programs such as building roads or infrastructure, military expenditures and social welfare programs. It also includes the raising of taxes to finance government expenditures and the raising of debt (Treasuries in the U.S.) {{to bridge the gap}} (Budget deficit) between revenues (tax receipts) and expenditures related to the implementation of government programs. Raising taxes and reducing the Budget Deficit is deemed to be a restrictive fiscal policy as it would reduce aggregate demand and slow down GDP growth. Lowering taxes and increasing the Budget Deficit is considered an <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> that would increase aggregate demand and stimulate the economy.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> coordination in the EU {{during the}} Great Recession (2008 - 2010). For {{the first time}} since the Maastricht Treaty heralded the coordination of macroeconomic policies among EU Member States, public finances were collectively focused on stimulus policies. In sharp contrast to the preceding decade of consolidation and constraint, <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> coordination during the Great Recession presents a novelty: a study in fiscal expansion. Drawing on Mancur Olson’s Logic of Collective Action, this thesis uses a mixed-methods approach that combines the insights from over 40 in-depth interviews and econometric analyses. The central argument of this thesis is that the fiscal crisis responses of EU Member States were not coordinated. Yet despite this lack of coordination, free-riding was kept at bay. First, the overarching consensus on the need for counter-cyclical <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> prevented growth free-riding (i. e. a situation of limited domestic stimulus and free-riding on other countries’ <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies).</b> Second, discipline imposed by financial market participants contributed to policy-makers’ awareness of their limited room for fiscal manoeuvre, which meant that stability free-riding (i. e. stimulus policies that exceeded a country’s fiscal space) did not occur. The first finding suggests the importance of shared policy ideas in achieving collective action; the second points to the role of financial markets in constraining public finances. Ultimately both, shared policy ideas and market discipline, can function as a substitute for strong institutional commitment to shape group oriented behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Over 2008 - 11, most OECD {{countries}} {{switched from}} highly <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> to the tightest in decades. During {{the crisis and}} subsequent recession in 2008 - 09, many OECD and G 20 countries implemented stimulus packages, which in some cases amounted to 4 % or more of GDP. On the expenditure side, the fiscal programmes typically focused on public investment. Given their large traditional role in public investment in OECD countries, sub-national governments (SNGs) have {{played an important role}} in implementing investment recovery strategies. For future investment strategies it is important to learn about obstacles encountered across levels of government and the instruments that facilitated implementation. The crisis has made more obvious the multi-level governance challenges – in particular <b>fiscal,</b> <b>policy,</b> capacity or administrative challenges – that are inherent to decentralised political systems. Co-ordination across levels of government has proven critical for targeting investment priorities, ensuring coherence in <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> and facilitating the implementation of national strategies during the crisis. As stimulus packages are phased out, many countries are planning some combination of spending cuts and tax increases in 2011 - 12. To avoid simply shifting the problem from the centre to the regions, co-ordinated efforts from all levels of government are required to accommodate appropriate budget cuts for fiscal consolidation and better prioritise investment in what unlocks each region?s potential to restore growth. Both the stimulus and the process of fiscal consolidation highlight the need to foster and improve policy co-ordination, transparency and information sharing across levels of government. sub-national government, public investment, regional development, multi-level governance, fiscal consolidation, crisis...|$|R

30|$|We {{extend the}} HL set-up in two directions. (1) First, we {{consider}} {{the existence of a}} third candidate that runs for office. Based on casual observation, we assume that the third candidate is ideological and always proposes the same policy (in our case, the <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy).</b> This is an assumption that aids considerably in the tractability of the problem and is grounded in the real world observation that third parties are usually more dogmatic than mainstream ones. 6 Laver and Hunt (1992) find strong evidence to support this idea. In a study for 25 countries, they asked people to locate in a scale 1 – 20 the position of the most important parties in their country regarding the following question: “forced to make a choice, would party leaders give up policy objectives in order to get into government or would they sacrifice a place in government in order to maintain policy objectives?”. They observed that systematically, citizens of different countries perceive mainstream candidates as more willing to give up policy objectives (then, as more strategic) and third parties as more likely to give up a place in government (then, as more deterministic). 7 (2) Second, {{we consider the}} existence of heterogeneous voters, divided into two groups. A majority consisting of non-ideological voters, who want the implemented policy to correctly match the state of the world; and a minority of ideological voters, who have a fixed preference for the policy that the third candidate stands for (the <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy).</b>|$|E
40|$|Latin America {{lives in}} {{economic}} cycles; {{there have been}} several episodes of economic populism over the last few decades. This analysis places the government of Hugo Chávez, the current President of Venezuela, in a populist context. Chávez’s experiment with populism is a case of the “model ” presented by Dornbusch and Edwards (1990). A country rich in natural resources, but plagued by poverty and inequality, Venezuela presented all the conditions favorable for a populist leader to emerge. If Chávez continues using <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> to accelerate growth and redistribute income, while disregarding general macroeconomic equilibrium, a final collapse is highly probable.

I {{would also like to thank}} Jaime Paiva for his incessant support, and for motivating me from beginning to end. 2 “Venezuelan politics cannot be understood unless two opposite facts are taken into consideration: the country’s economy grew more than any other economy in the world between 1920 and 1980, and there is no other nation, outside of Africa, that has declined so much economically in the past 20 years. Plus, one has to consider another problem: the wealth implied in oil, whose owner is the State, makes the population grow up thinking they are rich, when in reality they are getting poorer. This contradiction creates frustration, resentment and the search for a panacea. People think that if oil belongs to everyone and if they do not receive their share it is because somebody is stealing, it is because of corruption. This is the context in which Hugo Chávez arises. ...|$|R

30|$|Lesson 10 is {{that the}} same lessons that apply to a reform of a system of tax deductibility of {{mortgage}} interest also apply to structural reforms, see Teulings and Zubanov (2013). Many market distortions create rents of which the net present value can be traded on the market. For example, the value of a permit to drive a cap is equal to net present value of all future rents that it yields. The ability to trade this permit allows the current holder of the permit to extract the net present value of all future rents. Future owners get nothing: the price of the permit offsets the net present value of the rents. Hence, reforms aiming at a reduction of these distortions change the intergenerational distribution of welfare in favour of future generations. Offsetting these intergenerational effects by an <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> would improve the chances of success in structural reforms.|$|E

Production in most emerging markets countries will pick up during winter, but not by much, while restrictive or less <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> will dampen demand in most advanced economies and in particular in Europe. - In the euro area, we expect GDP to shrink by around - 0. 2 % in 2012 and grow by about 0. 7 % in 2013, mostly driven by higher exports and a limited rebound in consumption. Our industrial production forecast has been revised downwards with respect to the Summer report, now we expect a growth rate of - 1. 9 % in 2012 and 1. 4 % in 2013. - The fall in the number of employed persons came to a halt in the second quarter, since the contraction of employment slowed markedly in southern Europe. The number of hours worked, however, continued to shrink. Downward pressure on wages lowered the growth rate (year on year) of hourly labor costs by half a percentage point to about 2 % in the second quarter. However, the unemployment rate is expected to remain above 11 %. - The latest move by the ECB has a good chance of preventing a further deterioration of financial conditions in the southern countries. Private households and firms in the north will further benefit from low external financing costs that are on a downward trend since early this year. - Additional pressures on the supply side in the international energy market are the main drivers of the important upwards revision of our total inflation forecast, which is now 2. 6 % for 2012. However, medium term inflation expectations continue to be in line with the ECB’s mandate, and our forecast for 2013 is 1. 9 %. In the current context, with neither confidence, economic activity and credit flows improving, this increase in forecast inflation is not expected to change the ECB’s expansionary monetary policy stance...|$|R

40|$|The European Forecasting Network (EFN) is a {{research}} group of European institutions, founded in 2001 {{under the auspices of}} the European Commission. · The world economy will recover during 2010 and 2011 thanks to ultra-low key interest rates in industrial countries and to the strong growth in emerging markets economies. In the euro area, however, the phasing out of <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> and <b>fiscal</b> consolidation will drag down demand; rising exports will be the main driver of the recovery. Internal demand will have a positive (although small) contribution to growth in 2011. We expect euro area GDP to grow around 1. 2 % and 1. 6 % during 2010 and 2011, respectively. · Due to rising exports, the industrial sector will resume positive growth in the short run but the intensity of the recovery will be moderate and insufficient to compensate the sharp fall of 2009 : at the end of 2011, the industrial production index is expected to be still 10 % below its pre-crisis levels. · For the first time in its short history, the euro area is struggling with a crisis of confidence in the sustainability of the monetary union. Our forecast is based on the assumption that, with the help of the program adopted at the beginning of April, Greece will be able to meet its financial obligations and will carry out the required reforms. However, downside risks are high. One adverse effect of the current situation that might gain importance is that the interest rate burden of firms and households could increase quickly in spite of low key interest rates. This will occur if higher yields for government bonds take effect on the financing costs for private agents; this is a cause for concern because debt ratios for firms, but also for consumers, have been on a rising trend for years in the euro area and are now on record levels. · Inflation expectations in the euro area continue to be very low. Forecasts were revised downwards after the weak HICP data of January and February. We now expect HICP inflation to be 1. 2 % in 2010 and 1. 3 % in 2011. The only risks for inflation come from oil and raw materials prices which are showing signs of significant increases in the world markets.

These measures could help the private sector to overcome the recession and facilitate the economic activity towards increased production and export, but it must also take into consideration the other negative side of this <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> Exactly the alternatives of financing those budget deficits, which are common in many countries, could initiate intensive borrowing from the government in order to finance those economic activities. Once again, since the ’ 80 -ties, these kind of financing is a reason for unstable and irresponsible growth of the public debt/GDP ratio from the governments. Although, majority of the countries tend to increase the capital investments, {{but the fact is that}} most of that money goes for government expenditure. Precisely that excessive government expenditure in most countries is the reason for “crowding out” of private investments. This paper states the borrowing process of the government and their massive demand for capital that puts the private investors in undermined position in comparison to the government which is able to supply the capital through higher price. In other words, this paper is analyzing the positive effects from the government actions and the negative implications that the deficit finance could cause. The final objective of this paper is to detect the implications that may cause the government with the revenue and expenditure side measures in order to help the private sector...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is at least twofold. Firstly, the paper gives a record of <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> in the Federal Republic of Germany by {{describing}} various phases of its design during the past twenty years. This is done on the background of changing economic conditions and different monetary regimes. As a second purpose, the paper attempts to evaluate the performance of <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> in the Federal Republic of Germany both by taking stock of some empirical results obtained in other studies and by own econometric investigations. The goal of the econometric analysis is to estimate <b>fiscal</b> and monetary <b>policy</b> rules by taking into account explicitly the possibility that these policies have to be treated as at least partly endogenous variables. As a major outcome of the first purpose, three phases of <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> may be distinguished. While the first phase is characterized by a short-term oriented global demand management prevailing until the mid-seventies, <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> was more in favor of a steadily oriented growth and structural policy afterwards. This phase was succeeded by an embarkment upon a cause of fiscal consolidation since the beginnings of the eighties. With respect to the effectiveness of <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> actions, our own econometric analysis is based on a four equations model. Basically it consists of a conventional IS-LM model with a very simple Phillips curve. In addition, fiscal and monetary reaction functions are estimated in order to avoid biased coefficients associated with the impact of fiscal and monetary impulses on employment. It is shown, how important it is (econometrically) to treat policies as endogenous variables. Moreover, our results point to the well-known experience that only a combination of <b>expansive</b> <b>fiscal</b> and monetary measures is suitable to fight against unemployment...|$|R

First, <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> generally has Keynesian effects. Second, <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> instruments are often pro-cyclical (and practically never counter-cyclical). Taken together these two empirical regularities indicate a major policy failure as they imply that <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> is a cause of volatility and not a tool for stabilization. The paper then discusses policy options to make <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> more conducive to stabilization. Business cycles <b>Fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> Output growth volatility Stabilization...|$|R
