Lenneberg summarized the litera-ture and, based on his review of 17 adequate reports from the literature and eight personal cases, divided children into four groups. He stated that when a focal brain lesion is sustained between ages 20 and 36 months, children recapitulate all the stages of language learning, from vocalization and babbling to single words, primitive two word phrases, etc until perfect speech is achieved, and he concluded that recovery is due to reacquisition rathe...|$|R

40|$|BY <b>acquired</b> <b>aphasia</b> in {{children}} we mean the language disorganizations resulting from focal cerebral lesions occurring during childhood. In such circumstances aphasia consists in a regression of psycho-linguistic performances which has some analogies with the aphasic disorders {{in the adult}} but differs from it in that the disturbance bears upon the function of language and, more generally, upon the nervous system during their maturation. <b>Acquired</b> <b>aphasia</b> {{in children}} is entirely different from retarded speech often unfortunately labelled congenital aphasia, charac-terized by a defect in language elaboration at the origin of which there is or {{there is not a}} cerebral lesion. <b>Acquired</b> <b>aphasia</b> in children has been known for long but a few studies only have been devoted to this subject. It is common belief that it is a rare disorder and moreover that it is remarkably transitory so that sequelae are very few or absent. Exception being made for isolated cases, the work of E. Guttmann (1942) is the earliest comprehensive review of the symptomatology and evolution. Guttmann (1942) reported 16 patients with aphasia among 30 {{children under the age of}} 14 having hemispheric lesions. He emphasized the fact that the aphasia was characterized by a reduction of verbal expression, whatever the situation of the lesion; in other terms that jargonaphasia and logorrhoea did not occur. The rapidity of recovery of the language was remarkable. Further-more, Guttmann (1942) pointed to the intellectual deficiencies which may last, and rightly ascribed them to brain damage rather than to aphasia. A. Branco Lefevre (1950) and J. de Ajuriaguerra (1958) con-firmed Guttmann's observations and drew attention to the disorders of written speech and to the fact that recovery progresses often less quickly than it is commonly admitted. In this paper we report 32 children suffering from <b>acquired</b> <b>aphasia,</b> studied during several years, while rehabilitation was carried out.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we address brain-behaviour {{relationships}} {{in children with}} <b>acquired</b> <b>aphasia,</b> by reviewing some recent studies {{on the effects of}} focal brain lesions on language development. Timing of the lesion, in terms of its occurrence, before or after the onset of speech and language acquisition, may be a major factor determining language outcome. However, it is still unclear which are the effects of aphasia occurring between 2 and 5 years of age, a time window which is crucial for acquiring and automatizing the basic rules of native language. A comprehensive review of the literature on <b>acquired</b> childhood <b>aphasia</b> precedes the description of long-term follow-up (20 years) of two identical twins, one of whom became aphasic at 3 years and 4 months after infarction of the left sylvian artery. Psycholinguistic analysis and fMRI data show a slow and incomplete recovery from non-fluent aphasia associated to an intra-hemispheric organization of language.

50|$|The {{terminology}} for children’s language disorders {{is extremely}} wide-ranging and confusing, with many labels that have overlapping {{but not necessarily}} identical meanings. In part this confusion reflects uncertainty about the boundaries of SLI, {{and the existence of}} different subtypes.Historically, the terms ‘’developmental dysphasia’’ or ‘’developmental aphasia’’ were used to describe children with the clinical picture of SLI. These terms have, however, largely been abandoned, as they suggest parallels with adult <b>acquired</b> <b>aphasia.</b> This is misleading, as SLI is not caused by brain damage.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{neurologic}} tenets {{claim that}} the clinical picture of <b>acquired</b> childhood <b>aphasia</b> is nonfluent irrespective of lesion location. In the past 20 years, however, several case {{studies have shown that}} fluent aphasic patterns can be observed in children with <b>acquired</b> childhood <b>aphasia.</b> But the question remains open as to whether the pattern of their speech characteristics is similar to the one described in adult aphasics as studies addressing spontaneous speech fluency characteristics in larger series of children with <b>acquired</b> childhood <b>aphasia</b> are scarce. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether an analysis of spontaneous speech fluency as has previously been performed in adult aphasics by other investigators would also yield two distinct groups of aphasic children and, if so, whether the distribution of the different speech characteristics in both groups would reflect the rank order found in adults, that is, whether nonfluent verbal output characteristics would predominate in one group and fluent features in the other. Audiotaped and videotaped recordings of 24 cooperative children with acute <b>acquired</b> childhood <b>aphasia</b> unselected for age, gender, etiology, and aphasia severity ratings were analyzed according to 10 different speech characteristics. A cluster analysis (two-means clustering) was performed to seek the existence of two distinct groups of aphasic children. Results were confirmed, and exact P values were computed with Mann-Whitney U-tests. A two-means clustering created two distinct classes. Mann-Whitney U-tests ranked the speech characteristics according to their discriminating power between clusters. Comparing this rank order with the one previously found in adults revealed a high correlation (Spearman's rank correlation: r =. 915, P <<. 005), thus indicating that the clusters we found were highly similar to the adult clusters. Thus, the use of the speech variables proposed to evaluate adult aphasic spontaneous speech enabled us to demonstrate a fluent/nonfluent dichotomy in a childhood aphasic population as well. This study shows that the traditional views on the uniformity of the clinical picture of <b>acquired</b> childhood <b>aphasia</b> are obsolete. Our findings corroborate data issued from several case reports of fluent <b>acquired</b> childhood <b>aphasia</b> and from the few studies focusing on speech fluency in <b>acquired</b> childhood <b>aphasia,</b> which all point to the existence of an adultlike heterogeneity of childhood aphasic syndromes. Current clinical evidence no longer supports the hypotheses of equipotentiality and progressive lateralization but favors the notion that the anatomic substrate for language representation in the child is similar to that in adults, even in young subjects.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Landau-Kleffner {{syndrome}} (LKS) is epileptiform <b>aphasia</b> <b>acquired</b> {{during childhood}} and occurring {{in children with}} previously normal language devel-opment. The epileptiform activity in these children is thought {{to result in a}} functional ablation of eloquent speech areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the usefulness of mag-netoencephalography (MEG) for localizing the source of epileptiform activity in these patients. METHODS: Nineteen patients with <b>acquired</b> <b>aphasia</b> and a suspected diagnosis of LKS were referred for MEG evaluation. Patients ranged in age from 4 to 14 years. Fourteen MEG studies were performed on a 74 -channel system, four on a 148 -channel whole-head system, and one on a 37 -channel system. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 19 patients had perisylvian MEG spikes. In 10 of the patients, the spikes were bilateral, and in three they were unilateral. Four other patients had non-sylvian spikes, and two patients had no spikes recorded. The results of MR imaging were normal or noncontributory for all 19 patients.

40|$|Background: Telerehabilitation is {{the remote}} {{delivery}} of rehabilitation services via {{information technology and}} telecommunication systems. There {{have been a number}} of recent studies that have used video conferencing to assess language skills in people with aphasia. These studies have highlighted the possibility that severity of impairment and aetiology may have an effect on the administration of telerehabilitation language assessment protocols. Furthermore, anecdotal accounts of difficulties in administering language assessment via telerehabilitation also demonstrate the need for research into the effects of severity of aphasia. It is important that the effects of severity of aphasia are determined as part of the overall evidence base for telerehabilitation language assessment protocols. Aims: To investigate the influence of severity of aphasia on the ability to assess <b>acquired</b> <b>aphasia</b> via telerehabilitation methods. Methods Procedures: A total of 32 participants with an <b>acquired</b> <b>aphasia</b> were assessed simultaneously via telerehabilitation and face-to-face methods on the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination 3 rd Edition Short Form (BDAE- 3) and the Boston Naming Test (BNT) (2 nd Edition Short Form). A custom-built telerehabilitation system developed at the University of Queensland enabled real-time telerehabilitation assessment over a 128 kbit/s Internet connection. Participants were grouped according to their severity level. Data analysis was conducted on the differences in scores from the two assessors. Outcomes Results: Results revealed that severity of aphasia did not greatly influence the accuracy of the telerehabilitation assessment for the majority of the BDAE- 3 clusters. However, severity of aphasia appeared to affect the ability to assess naming and paraphasia via telerehabilitation methods. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the scores given in the face-to-face and telerehabilitation environments were comparable within each severity level. Conclusions: Results suggest that severity of aphasia may influence the ability to assess some language parameters via telerehabilitation. Further research should use larger sample sizes to confirm these results and to refine the telerehabilitation technology to enable these parameters to be adequately assessed. Additionally, clinician satisfaction with telerehabilitation assessment should be qualitatively researched so as to widen clinician acceptance of this method...|$|R

40|$|A 5 &frac 12;-year-old {{boy with}} {{language}} delay {{and behavioral problems}} was evaluated. His symptoms were consistent with per-vasive developmental disorder, and electroencephalography showed frequent generalized spike and polyspike activity.

40|$|We present six {{patients}} with <b>acquired</b> <b>aphasia</b> with convulsive disorder (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) and distill the main clinical features from {{a review of}} the recent literature. Our series showed that the clinical picture can vary at onset, as well as {{during the course of the}} illness, and that the long-term outcome of the aphasia is quite unpredictable, despite the fact that epilepsy and electroencephalographic abnormalities usually regress or disappear with the years. We also call attention to the electroencephalographic phenomenon of electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep, and we suggest that the course of the aphasia may well be linked to the appearance and disappearance of electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep. Therefore, we recommend a sleep electroencephalogram in all children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Finally, our findings did not demonstrate the beneficial effect of treatment with anticonvulsants on the aphasia, but recent studies have shown that treatment with corticosteroids, whether combined with anticonvulsants, is effective.

In particular, it is still difficult to predict which therapeutic task or approach will be successful at remediating which particular disorders. We argue that this is particularly true in the rehabilitation of anomia, whilst in other areas (e. g., reading) the relationship between deficit, task, and outcome is easier to interpret. We discuss in detail the reasons for these differences arguing that specificity of theoretical models, complexity of therapeutic tasks, and a lack of (reporting of) comprehensive assessment of linguistic deficits all contribute to the problem. We conclude that research needs to perform a microanalysis of the interactions between tasks and deficits. 16 page(s...|$|R
