5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he <b>ever</b> <b>went</b> there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen people, {{including}} Taylor, {{were eventually}} indicted in {{the assassination of}} Governor Goebel. Three accepted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony. Only five <b>ever</b> <b>went</b> to trial, two of those being acquitted. Convictions were handed down against Taylor's Secretary of State Caleb Powers, Henry Youtsey, and Jim Howard. The prosecution charged that Powers was the mastermind, having a political opponent killed so that his boss, Governor Taylor, could stay in office. Youtsey was an alleged intermediary, and Howard, who {{was said to have}} been in Frankfort to seek a pardon from Taylor for the killing of a man in a family feud, was accused of being the actual assassin.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese government's pre-war {{plans to}} protect the country from air attack focused on {{neutralizing}} enemy air bases. Before the war {{it was believed that}} Soviet aircraft based in the Russian Far East posed the greatest threat. The Japanese military planned to destroy the air bases within range of the home islands if Japan and the Soviet Union <b>ever</b> <b>went</b> to war. When the Pacific War began, the Japanese government believed {{that the best way to}} prevent American air raids was to capture and hold the areas in China and the Pacific from which such attacks could be launched. It was expected that the Allies would not be able to re-capture these bases. However, the Japanese anticipated that the Allies might still make small-scale attacks against the home islands using naval aircraft flying from aircraft carriers. The government chose not to develop strong defenses to meet the threat of air attack as the country's industrial resources were unable to maintain offensive air forces in China and the Pacific as well as a defensive force in the home islands.|$|E

The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says that he may however have taken over a rôle that his father held in being an agent for Sir John Hubaud, a High Sheriff of Warwickshire; but Sir John Hubaud died in 1583, ten years before Thomas was born.|$|E
25|$|Those {{individuals}} {{who participated in}} the Expo project were also impacted; Mexican interim ambassador Federico Gamboa tells in his memoirs that Spanish sculptor Justo de Gandarias, and elderly man when he met him on 20 June 1899, was still in Guatemala two years after the failed Expo because the government had not paid him for his services. Two years after that, Gamboa met with the sculptor again, and this time he tells that Gandarias had lost all hope of ever getting paid and that was in Guatemala barely surviving by selling cigarettes in Guatemala City; Gamboa visited Gandarias at his home and tells how the sculptures place was in total disarray, but kept some old paintings and sculptures that he was hoping to sell if he <b>ever</b> <b>went</b> back to Spain.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 2009, it was {{reported}} that Nowak would not claim insanity if her case <b>ever</b> <b>went</b> to trial. Nowak's attorney withdrew a previous motion filed in 2007, which would have left open the opportunity to use an insanity defense in the case. On October 7, 2009, a judge in Orlando ruled in favor of allowing Nowak's attorneys to take a second deposition from Shipman to inquire whether Nowak actually pepper-sprayed Shipman. A medical report by paramedics raised some questions according to Nowak's attorneys as to the factual basis for it. If it was found not to have occurred, Nowak's attorneys wanted the criminal charges related to the assault and battery to be dropped before trial begins. The trial was scheduled for December 7, 2009. On November 10, 2009, Nowak entered a guilty plea to lesser charges. She was sentenced to a year's probation and the two days already served in jail, with no additional jail time.|$|E

[...] He also took office without {{a seat in the}} legislature.

500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} with The Des Moines Register, Iowa State University economist Kenneth Stone stated that Merle Hay Mall successfully {{adapted to the}} changing lifestyles of the 1960s and 1970s by offering longer shopping hours {{during a time when}} downtown Des Moines merchants began restricting their hours. Author and Des Moines native Bill Bryson commented on how Merle Hay Mall's opening changed Des Moines in his 2006 memoir The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid: [...] "My father never shopped anywhere else after that. Neither did most people. By the early 1960s, people exchanged boasts about how long it had been since they had been downtown. They had found a new kind of happiness at the malls." [...] In 1989's , Bryson wrote that [...] "Jack Kerouac, of all people, thought that Iowa women were the prettiest in the country, but I don't think he <b>ever</b> <b>went</b> to Merle Hay Mall on a Saturday" [...] when he commented on the obesity of Iowa women.|$|E
500|$|In Wright's {{account of}} the Azores expedition, he listed {{as one of the}} expedition's members a [...] "Captaine Edwarde Carelesse, alias Wright, who in S. Frauncis Drakes West-Indian voiage was Captaine of the Hope". In another work, The Haven-finding Art (1599) (see below), Wright stated that [...] "the time of my first {{employment}} at sea" [...] was [...] "now more than tenne yeares since". The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography asserts that during the expedition Wright called himself [...] "Captain Edward Carelesse", and that he was also the captain of the Hope in Sir Francis Drake's voyage of 1585–1586 to the West Indies, which evacuated Sir Walter Raleigh's Colony of Virginia. One of the colonists was the mathematician Thomas Harriot, and if the Dictionary is correct it is probable that on the return journey to England Wright and Harriot became acquainted and discussed navigational mathematics. However, in a 1939 article, E.J.S. Parsons and W.F. Morris note that in Capt. Walter Bigges and Lt. Crofts' book A Summarie and True Discourse of Sir Frances Drakes West Indian Voyage (1589), Edward Careless was referred to as the commander of the Hope, but Wright was not mentioned. Further, while Wright spoke several times of his participation in the Azores expedition, he never alluded to any other voyage. Although the reference to his [...] "first employment" [...] in The Haven-finding Art suggests an earlier venture, {{there is no evidence that}} he went to the West Indies. Gonville and Caius College holds no records showing that Wright was granted leave before 1589. There is nothing to suggest that Wright <b>ever</b> <b>went</b> to sea again after his expedition with the Earl of Cumberland.|$|E

500|$|Following Tewkesbury, Suffolk {{was granted}} the estates of the under-age Francis, Viscount Lovell during Lovell's minority, {{and may have}} {{received}} {{the custody of the}} ex-Lancastrian Queen, Margaret of Anjou, in 1472, since Margaret was held at one point in Wallingford and subsequently in Ewelme. This was followed by a number of other offices and promotions, none of which were lucrative. In 1472 he was appointed High Steward of Oxford University and the following year made a Knight of the Garter. He was also the King's Lieutenant of Ireland (in later centuries the post {{came to be known as}} the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland) between March and July 1478 (although he probably never took the position in person). So little, in fact, had his financial situation improved, that in the first parliament after Edward's return from exile- in 1471 – Suffolk refused his summons to attend parliament. This was because he felt himself unable to sustain the status and maintain the retinue of a royal duke in London for whatever duration the parliament turned out to be. With the exception of the Lovell estates Suffolk received no major grants, in stark comparison to Edward's brothers George, Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and even the king's Woodville in-laws. Suffolk's continuing poverty was reflected in the fact that, although he again took loyal part in King Edward's 1475 French campaign (on possibly the only occasion he <b>ever</b> <b>went</b> abroad), he could muster only forty men-at-arms and 300 archers. Michael Hicks remarks that, as a retinue, this [...] "fell far short of those of other royal dukes." [...] Soon after his return from France his mother, the Duchess Alice, died; certainly by 15 August 1476, when John finally came into possession of her dower lands, and by extension, finally, his whole estate. She was buried at Ewelme, Oxfordshire in a [...] "stunning alabaster monument." ...|$|E
