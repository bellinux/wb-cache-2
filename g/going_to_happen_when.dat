500|$|Regarding her {{involvement}} in a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she [...] "would definitely be part of it." [...] She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that [...] "Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, everybody wants to do it. Every time I see him, it's like: 'When is it <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen?</b> <b>When</b> {{is it going to}} happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E
500|$|Shyamalan {{expressed}} {{hope for}} a third installment following Split, saying, [...] "I hope [...] The answer is yes. I'm just such a wimp sometimes. I don't know what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> I go off in my room, a week after this film opens, to write the script. But I'm going to start writing. [...] a really robust outline, which is pretty intricate. But now the standards for my outlines are higher. I need to know I've won already. I'm almost there but I'm not quite there." [...] In April 2017, Shyamalan announced the official title, release date, and returning actors for the third movie. The film, titled Glass, will be released January 18, 2019 and will feature Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Anya Taylor-Joy, and James McAvoy returning to their respective roles in the series.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{called the}} episode [...] "at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple", {{especially}} {{when compared to}} previous episodes like [...] "White Tulip". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining [...] "I can't really find anything to complain about here. The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool." [...] Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, {{and the use of}} split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode [...] "demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even though I know Fringe is heading somewhere, I have no idea where that might be, or what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> we get there. Boy, if you're not watching Fringe, you're missing out." ...|$|E

50|$|Unpredictability is the Core Drive of {{constantly}} being engaged because you don't {{know what is}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> next. <b>When</b> something does not fall into your regular pattern recognition cycles, your brain kicks into high gear and pays attention to the unexpected. This is the primary Core Drive behind gambling addictions, but also present in every sweepstake or lottery program that companies run. Think about the controversial Skinner Box experiments, where an animal irrationally presses a lever frequently because of unpredictable results.|$|R
60|$|I had {{not been}} sitting there long before my {{attention}} became attracted {{to a man in}} a punt who, I noticed with some surprise, wore a jacket and cap exactly like mine. He was evidently a novice at punting, and his performance was most interesting.

60|$|In our {{theatrical}} {{experience as}} playgoers {{we are all}} equally accustomed to predict by certain little signs and portents on the stage what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> there. <b>When</b> the young lady, an admiral's daughter, is left alone to indulge in a short soliloquy, and certain smart spirit-rappings are heard to proceed immediately from beneath her feet, we foretell that a song is impending.

When any of the performers who belong to the sea-faring or marauding professions are observed to arm themselves with very small swords to which are attached very large hilts, we predict that the affair will end in a combat.

She checks the personal column of The Times but doesnt see what she expected to see there. Going to the restaurant car again she is placed on the same table as the owner of the case and strikes up a conversation with him and asks him if he is the same Parker Pyne of The Times adverts. He confirms that he is and he asks her if she is unhappy. She confesses that she is and the cause is her husband of the past eighteen months. He is a sober and puritanical soul who has been working in Constantinople for two weeks and she is on her way to join him. One week ago, in his study, she found a piece of blotting paper on which was part of a message which referred to her and used the words, [...] "just before Venice would be the best time."

60|$|I {{found that}} a person of large {{intelligence}} could read this beautiful language with considerable facility without a dictionary, but I presently found that to such a parson a grammar could be of use at times. It is because, {{if he does not}} know the WERE'S and the WAS'S and the MAYBE'S and the HAS-BEENS'S apart, confusions and uncertainties can arise. He can get the idea that a thing is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> next week <b>when</b> the truth is that it has already happened week before last. Even more previously, sometimes. Examination and inquiry showed me that the adjectives and such things were frank and fair-minded and straightforward, and did not shuffle; it was the Verb that mixed the hands, it was the Verb that lacked stability, it was the Verb that had no permanent opinion about anything, it was the Verb that was always dodging the issue and putting out the light and making all the trouble.|$|R

At the moment, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see what <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> he finishes the tour and we'll take it from there." [...] Following this, the band sent out a press release announcing the search of a fill-in guitarist. The press release stated that the position is required to be filled until January 2015. Although the press release stated clearly that the position was temporary, applicants were told via email response that this did not mean restrictions to membership of the band {{and that they could}} contribute to the band creatively and artistically.

There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> again, <b>when</b> am I ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway.
