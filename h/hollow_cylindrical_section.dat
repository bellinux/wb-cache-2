Este trabalho tem como objetivo {{investigar}} as vantagens e as possibilidades estruturais de sistemas enrijecidos pelos aspectos formais e geométricos de seus elementos, ou por suas disposições físicas neste sistema. As superfícies de dupla curvatura ou superfícies hiperbólicas, devido a suas características geométricas de empenamento, conferem uma eficiência no seu comportamento estrutural superior às superfícies planas. Dentro deste universo, a escolha de tais superfícies (anticlásticas) servirá como ponto de partida nesta pesquisa, na transposição do raciocínio do comportamento estrutural das cascas e membranas para as estruturas reticuladas de superfícies hiperbólicas. Em especial neste estudo: os Parabolóides Hiperbólicos. As estruturas de dupla curvatura, que já agregam naturalmente um irresistível apelo estético, encontram nos perfis tubulares cilíndricos vantagens significativas. A seção transversal completamente simétrica em todas as direções favorece as ligações entre as barras que se posicionam de maneiras reversas e variáveis no espaço, fazendo dos tubos um dos melhores aliados quanto às questões estruturais e de montagem. O presente trabalho propõe-se a investigar as vantagens estruturais dessas formas, no intuito de viabilizar sistemas construtivos metálicos que possam ter aplicações imediatas em alguns campos da engenharia e da arquitetura. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ABSTRACT : The {{main objective}} of this work is to investigate the advantages and possibilities of structural systems stiffened by formal and geometric aspects of its components, or by their physical arrangement in the system. The doubly curved surfaces or hyperbolic paraboloids, due to their geometrical characteristics, have superior structural performance when compared to flat (plane) surfaces. This research departs from the selection of these surfaces, and from the structural similarities that exist between shells, isotropic membranes and ruled surfaces, especially hyperbolic paraboloids. These solutions {{have not yet been}} sufficiently explored in their structural advantages by the steel construction industry. The strong aesthetic appeal of the doubly-curved surfaces, together with the use of <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>sections</b> for bars, offer significant advantages. The radial simmetry of the cross-section allows reverse and random positioning in space, resulting in an efficient solution, either in the structural or the constructive aspects. The present work aims to investigate the structural pros and cons of the tubular sections using these geometrical shapes for the steel construction industry, and to analyze and propose new solutions for structural elements, including the analysis of their structural behaviour and constructive aspects such as production and assembling on site...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanical}} {{parameters of}} constitutive equations for soil and rock {{can be determined}} by laboratory experiments in which a cylindrical specimen is commonly tested under uniaxial and triaxial compressive conditions. The distribution of stress in the specimen during the tests must be kept uniform and homogeneous. In this paper, numerical simulations are carried out to determine the distribution of stress in <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> specimens under a uniaxial compressive state {{and the distribution of}} stress in a rectangular parallelepiped specimen under a plane strain condition. The results of the numerical simulations reveal that if <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> specimens are tested under a uniaxial compressive condition, the stress distribution will no longer be uniform or homogeneous after the peak strength under strain-hardening and/or strain-softening conditions. This means that the post-yielding mechanical parameters of constitutive equations cannot be determined by <b>cylindrical</b> or <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> specimens. On the other hand, if a rectangular parallelepiped specimen is tested under a plane strain condition, it is found that the stress distribution in the specimen will always be uniform and homogeneous, even after the peak strength. Thus, a rectangular pararellepiped specimen, compressed under a plane strain condition, is preferable for determining the post-yielding mechanical parameters of constitutive equations. 1...|$|R

Loss reduction in this waveguide is attributed to an ideal profile of the dominant hybrid HE mode. This mode profile also results in relatively low dis-persion and very high coupling efficiency.
