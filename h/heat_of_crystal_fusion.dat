40|$|Abstract. High-frequency dynamic {{magnetic}} properties of quasi-two-dimensional organic conductors (BEDT-TTF) 2 IBr 2 of α'- and β-phases {{have been studied}} by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The <b>heating</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystals</b> in the α'-phase is accompanied by their phase transition to the β-phase, so, the Dyson distortion of the ESR line is appeared. Contributions from the crystal field and symmetry of the system {{as well as the}} orbital magnetic moment admixture to the total magnetic moment of charge carriers have been judged by the comparison of the orientation and temperature dependencies of the ESR spectra for the α'- and β-phases. Experimental data have proved localized states of charge carriers either in α'- or β-phases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Studies of {{the effects}} of carbon dioxide (CO 2) lasers on dental enamel have {{demonstrated}} that surface changes can be produced at low fluences (< 10 J/cm 2) if wavelengths are used which are efficiently absorbed by the hard tissues. In this study, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the wavelength dependence of surface changes in dental enamel after exposure to an extensive range of CO 2 laser conditions. Bovine and human enamel were irradiated by a tunable, pulsed CO 2 laser (9. 3, 9. 6, 10. 3, 10. 6 pm), with 5, 25, or 100 pulses, at absorbed fluences of 2, 5, 10, or 20 J/cm 2, and pulse widths of 50, 100, 200, 500 ps. SEM micrographs revealed evidence <b>of</b> melting, <b>crystal</b> <b>fusion,</b> and exfoliation in a wavelength-dependent manner. <b>Crystal</b> <b>fusion</b> occurred at absorbed fluences as low as 5 J/cm 2 per pulse at 9. 3, 9. 6, and 10. 3 pm, in contrast to no <b>crystal</b> <b>fusion</b> at 10. 6 pm (< 20 J/cm 2). Longer pulses at constant fluence conditions decreased the extent of surface melting and <b>crystal</b> <b>fusion.</b> The total number of laser pulses delivered to the tissue did not significantly affect surface changes as long as a minimum of 5 to 10 pulses was used.

Ac-calorimetry is an excellent technique for examining small crystals; in the past [1], the <b>heat</b> capacities <b>of</b> <b>crystals</b> as small as 10 pg have been measured.

40|$|AbstractCrystals of {{cytochrome}} bo 3 ubiquinol oxidase from E. coli diffract X-rays to 3. 5 Å and {{the structure}} determination is in progress. The limiting factor to the elucidation of the structural detail {{is the quality of}} the crystals; the diffraction spots from the crystals are diffused which leads to difficulties in processing the data beyond 4. 0 Å. Weak protein–protein contacts within the crystal lattice is assumed to be the cause of this problem. To improve these contacts, we have introduced protein Z to the C-terminal end of the subunit IV of cytochrome bo 3 and expressed both proteins as a single fusion. We have successfully obtained <b>crystals</b> <b>of</b> this <b>fusion</b> protein. The spot shape problem has clearly been solved in the <b>crystals</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fusion</b> protein although further optimization is necessary to obtain higher resolution.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the specific <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystals</b> <b>of</b> (Ca 1 -xSrx) 3 Ru 2 O 7 using ac- and relaxation-time calorimetry. Special emphasis {{was placed on}} the characterization of the Neel (TN= 56 K) and structural (Tc = 48 K) phase transitions in the pure, x= 0 material. While the latter is believed to be first order, detailed measurements under different experimental conditions suggest that all the latent heat (with L ~ 0. 3 R) is being captured in a broadened peak in the effective heat capacity. The specific heat has a mean-field-like step at TN, but its magntitude (Delta cP ~ R) is too large to be associated with a conventional itinerant electron (e. g. spin-density-wave) antiferromagnetic transition, while its entropy is too small to be associated with full ordering of localized spins. The TN transition broadens with Sr substitution while its magnitude decreases slowly. On the other hand, the entropy change associated with the Tc transition decreases rapidly with Sr substitution and is not observable for our x= 0. 58 sample.
