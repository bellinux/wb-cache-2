A task is an operation that transforms a certain set of resources into another set.

This is primarily available in collaborative process automation systems (CPAS). Site measurements are often supported by wireless sensor networks to reduce the wiring cost.|$|E

Unless this is achieved, the PdM solution is of limited value, at least if the PdM solution is implemented on a medium to large size plant with tens of thousands pieces of equipment. In 2010, the mining company Boliden, as a first, implemented a combined Distributed Control System (DCS) and Pdm solution integrated with the plant CMMS system on an object to object level, transferring equipment data using protocols like Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol (HART), IEC61850 and OLE for process control (OPC).|$|E

The equipment pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter (PM 2. 5 and PM 10) endanger people's health and surrounding environment. A critical review and analysis of factors affecting the amounts of construction emissions is conducted through literature review and a case study, four categories of factors including <b>equipment</b> and <b>conditions,</b> <b>equipment</b> maintenance, operating <b>conditions,</b> and <b>equipment</b> operations are reviewed. A case study is made on 14 wheel loaders with different makes and capacities with accumulated weekly data with the aim of determining the impact of emission factors on the weekly equipment emissions. It is found that equipment engine power, <b>equipment</b> <b>conditions,</b> and <b>equipment</b> operator skills are significant factors on average fuel consumption and emissions in the case study.

40|$|AbstractLoad {{capacity}} of pile foundation {{is larger than}} shallow foundation because the loads are transferred deeper into de stiffer layers of soil. Piles and the ground under the pile cap work simultaneously to lift and hold the above structure. The determination of cross section, length and arrangement piles accordance with load, geotechnical, construction <b>equipment,</b> <b>conditions</b> is a big challenge in the designing of pile foundation to achieve efficiency economy. Analysing {{the relationship between the}} stress of the ground and pile's load capacity to choose cross section, length and arrangement piles accordance with load, geotechnical, construction <b>equipment,</b> <b>conditions</b> will bring economy efficiency. In this paper a new method for determining the load {{capacity of}} pile based on the consideration stress in the ground under the tip of the pile and along the pile is presented.

Complaints may also reflect viewers' general disagreement with other people's viewpoints.
