In Northeast India the spatial references of identities have experienced tremendous changes. Formerly, the political settings were frequently based on links with a centre more than on {{belonging to a}} continuous space. These affiliations were themselves subject to reshaping, specially according to <b>inter-States</b> politics. By contrast, emerging identities give today a large importance to the territorial dimension and more generally adopt the XIXth century's European national paradigms: one people, one culture, one country. So the search for new territories is being impeded by the existence of former modes of belonging. The cultural and linguistic entanglements of Northeast India do not ease the process. Furthermore, tribal belonging itself remains problematic, blurred by the dialectical relationship between clan and space. So clan belonging, spatial belonging and cultural/linguistic features often prove contradictory.

In competition which progressively tightens like this, every company claimed {{to own the}} excellence and competitiveness so that probabilities to win the competition become greater. Those conditions forced manufacturing operations to continually striving to reduce lead time of their operations. Their goal is to satisfy the customer with the exact product, quality, quantity, and price in the shortest amount of time. It can only be achieved if the company is able to create and to implement effective and efficient processes in each of its line of their business. For this purpose lean tools are used because lean focus on the continuous improvement of a company towards the ideal through the relentless reduction of waste. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a Special type of flow chart that uses symbols known as "the language of Lean " to depict and improve the flow of inventory and information. Value Stream Mapping Purpose is to provide optimum value to the customer through a complete value creation process with minimum lead time. For this purpose {{we have tried to}} show how the lead time can be reduced by using lean tools properly. A trim manufacturing company was being selected for case study. In this case study we have studied production process of one product and draw the current state value stream map. From the current data analysis we found out the problems and gave some recommendations to improve the production lead time and provide a future state value stream map.

One key to success is to be competitive in the global marketplace is the ability to meet international standards and regulations. The quality management system ISO 9001 : 2008 is an integrated system that serves to optimize the quality of a company's effectiveness by creating an ergonomic framework for continuous quality improvement (continual quality improvement). ISO 9001 : 2008 specifies requirements - requirements and recommendations for the design (ergonomically view) and assessment of a quality management system that aims to ensure that the company will deliver a product (goods / services) that meet the requirements set. By implementing quality control, and ergonomic principles companies can find and address the factors that cause deviation of the process, so expect the percentage of production that deviates from the standard can be minimized.

40|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{mark of the}} war between the states of Wu and Yue was its brutality, which was significantly different from other <b>inter-states</b> wars during the Spring and Autumn Era. The main cause of this discrepancy may be because {{the fact that there}} was no aristocracy existed in the Wu and Yue. This historical factor led to the distinctiveness of these two states’ political, military and bureaucratic systems. It was also because of this factor the Wu and Yue never had a need to break the resistance of aristocrats through the process of 'social mobility' as other Eastern Zhou states did. The statement that 'there were no aristocrats in the Wu and Yue' is based on solid studies of both historical documents as well as archaeological discoveries. This phenomenon had a close relationship with the way these two states developed. Comparing with Chu and Qin, the other two non-central land states, Wu and Yue were relatively isolated and did not have much cultural exchanges with the central land. Because of this isolation, the Wu and Yue had the opportunities to develop from chiefdoms into states, which made their power structures very centralized. In Xie Weiyang 謝維揚`s theory, he thought that the state of Yue was a chiefdom before rising up, and Zhang Guangzhi 張光直 and Duan Yu 段渝 pointed out that Liangzhu Culture was the chiefdom. Although I do not totally agree with the theory of Xie Weiyang, but I believe that the Wu and Yue are both chiefdoms before they finished their evolution and became states. The main reason I use the concept of “chiefdom” to explain the socio-political conditions of the Wu and Yue is because if a state was developed from chiefdom, its government would own centralized power, which was entirely different from the states which came from the “confederacy of tribes 部落聯盟” such as in the early history of Greece and Rome. This was the root cause that the power of the kings in these two states was far more powerful than in other Spring and Autumn states. Geostrategic environment is another factor which could affect the whole Wu-Yue War. The war between the Wu and Yue was inevitable, but during the early period of the Wu-Yue war, the participation of the Chu and Jin was obvious, and in the latter stages of the war, Wu and Yue had become very strong and powerful themselves so that the influence of Jin and Chu towards this war was weaker and nearly invisible. Thanks to several external and internal factors, the Yue could start and implement its Grand Strategy, and the final destruction of the Wu was the indication mark of the successful implementation of the Grand Strategy. The definition of the Grand Strategy is that: coordinating all resources and elements of national power (economic, political, and military) to accomplish a national goal - mainly against external threats. Anyone who knows a little of the Yue history will know the phrase - 'one Decade of preparations and accumulation 十年生養'. This phrase includes many subjects, such as the military strategies, political policies, economic measures, etc, and all these measures were around one strategic goal: Destroying Wu. I think this is precisely consistent with the definition of The Grand Strategy, which is the reason why I use The Grand Strategy to explain the history of Yue. The warfare between the Wu and Yue was the main driving force behind the formation of the “Wu-Yue Culture” and possibly one of the reasons for the development of the distinctive “Wu-Yue Culture Region”. There is some documental and archaeological evidence to prove this viewpoint. The formation of the Wu-Yue Culture was so solid that the Chu could not effectively control the area of the Wu and Yue even after its successful occupation of the Yue, as it did to other states which located in the Huai 淮 River and Si 泗 River. It seems that a strong feeling of group identity had gradually formed with the process of the formation of Wu-Yue Culture, although the Yue controlled the Wu area for not a very long time...|$|R
