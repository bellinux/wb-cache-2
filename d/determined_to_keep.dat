6000|$|... [172] This {{dialogue}} {{is not in}} the least more absurd and selfish than the discourse of many who now attend on the preaching of the Gospel.

5|$|From the {{examples}} of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were {{at the mercy of}} their husbands’ good will. When she came across the biblical passage, “and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee,” she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women’s subjugation, but then reasoned that the injunction applied only to wives. Resolving to “call no man my master,” she <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.|$|E

5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, when they commissioned the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim to further develop the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line and the British television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration also came from Carter's memories of The Twilight Zone {{as well as from}} The Silence of the Lambs, which provided the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the relationship between the two}} leads strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel and John Steed in The Avengers series.|$|E

5|$|Ownership of {{the region}} of Oltenia became a source of dispute between the Iazyges and the Roman empire. The Iazyges had {{originally}} occupied the area before the Dacians seized it; it was taken during the Second Dacian War by Trajan, who was determined to constitute Dacia as a province. The land offered a much more direct connection between Moesia and the new Roman lands in Dacia, which may be why Trajan was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it. The dispute led to war under Hadrian, with him invading the Iazyges. The exact terms of the peace treaty are not known, but {{it is believed that}} the Romans kept Oltenia in exchange for some form of concession, likely involving a one-time tribute payment. The Iazyges also took possession of Banat around this time, suggesting it may {{have been part of the}} treaty.|$|E
