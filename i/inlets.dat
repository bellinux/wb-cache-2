As in other insects, a segmented tube-like heart {{is attached to}} the dorsal wall of the hemocoel.

5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine <b>inlets</b> and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E

The change of <b>inlet</b> turbulence level is controlled by the grid. The detailed measurement of <b>inlet</b> flow: the turbulence and the total pressure distribution across the height of <b>inlet</b> channel were performed by HWA (hot wire anemometry) probe and by total pressure probe, respectively.

5|$|Ophelia moved {{extremely}} {{slowly in}} and around North Carolina, causing the storm to drop more than 10inches (254mm) of rain on many coastal areas. The highest amount measured was from Oak Island, where 17.5inches (445mm) was registered. In addition, storm surges of 7–12feet (2–4m) were recorded, particularly in low-lying <b>inlets</b> of Pamlico Sound. At the storm's peak, over 240,000 customers were without power in coastal North Carolina. One indirect fatality was reported due to a traffic accident related to Ophelia, although no direct deaths were recorded.|$|E

40|$|A scarf <b>inlet</b> is {{characterized}} by having a longer lower lip than upper lip leading to both aerodynamic and acoustic advantages. Aerodynamically, a scarf <b>inlet</b> has higher angle of attack capability and {{is less likely to}} ingest foreign objects while the aircraft is on the ground. Acoustically, a scarf <b>inlet</b> provides for reduced <b>inlet</b> radiated noise levels below the engine as a result of upward reflection and refraction of <b>inlet</b> radiated noise. Results of a wind tunnel test program are presented which illustrate the aerodynamic performance of two different scarf <b>inlet</b> designs.

5|$|The {{first two}} blocks of JF-17 {{is powered by}} a single Russian RD-93 {{turbofan}} engine, which is a variant of the RD-33 engine used on the MiG-29 fighter. The engine gives more thrust and significantly lower specific fuel consumption than turbojet engines fitted to older combat aircraft being replaced by the JF-17. The advantages of using a single engine are a reduction in maintenance time and cost when compared to twin-engined fighters. A thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.99 can be achieved with full internal fuel tanks and no external payload. The engine's air supply is provided by two bifurcated air <b>inlets</b> (see airframe section).|$|E
5|$|The terrain around Kranji was {{primarily}} mangrove swamps and tropical forest intersected by streams and <b>inlets.</b> The shoreline between the Kranji River and the Johor–Singapore Causeway, nearly four kilometers long, was defended by the Australian 27th Brigade, led by Australian Brigadier Duncan Maxwell.

5|$|To reach {{all points}} {{designated}} by the Admiralty for longitude measurements, it was sometimes necessary to take chronometers ashore, across <b>inlets</b> and up rivers too shallow for the ship. This put the chronometers at risk and the disturbance of moving them affected their accuracy.

30|$|In summary, {{the strongest}} {{influence}} on the hydraulic efficiency was the <b>inlet</b> orientation. The horizontal <b>inlet</b> orientation resulted in the best hydraulic efficiency. Previous studies considering mixing time have also observed the influence of <b>inlet</b> orientation on hydraulic efficiency (Maruyama et al. 1982; Dakshinamoorthy et al. 2006; Zughbi and Rakib 2004; Tian and Roberts 2008). However, contradictory results showed up about how the <b>inlet</b> orientation influences the hydraulic efficiency (Shivaram 2007). One {{of the reasons they}} show contradictory results might just come down to experimental design. <b>Inlet</b> momentum and the interaction between <b>inlet</b> momentum and <b>inlet</b> orientation also had {{influence on the}} hydraulic efficiency, particularly for the mixing index. The effect of <b>inlet</b> orientation upon mixing was much stronger for a high <b>inlet</b> momentum than for a low <b>inlet</b> momentum. In general, similar results have been reported in laboratory experiments (Tian and Roberts 2008). All these studies, however, evaluated the hydraulic efficiency using the mixing time indicator and they did not affirm the relative importance of <b>inlet</b> orientation, <b>inlet</b> momentum and their interaction.|$|R
40|$|<b>Inlet</b> conditions, {{including}} <b>inlet</b> {{size and}} location {{as well as}} <b>inlet</b> temperature and humidity, have significant effects on the humidity distribution in building room, testing chamber and built environment. This paper presented {{the investigation of the}} changes of <b>inlet</b> air temperature, humidity and <b>inlet</b> vent positions on the humidity distribution in the environmental chamber through experimental approach and simulation method. The average relative humidity (RH) and humidity uniformity inside the chamber with different <b>inlet</b> vent positions were investigated. The results show that non-uniformity of the humidity distribution decreases with the increase of the <b>inlet</b> RH value under low <b>inlet</b> temperature conditions while it increases with the increase of the <b>inlet</b> RH value under high <b>inlet</b> temperature conditions. The humidity uniformity is not very good under the lower <b>inlet</b> vent positions. Comparison studies on the humidity uniformity between experimental tests and numerical simulations show that the simulation results agree well with the experimental test results.

5|$|Initially, {{long-term}} {{solutions to}} the Isabel Inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered, though they were ultimately cancelled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet. Coastal geologists were opposed to the solution, stating {{the evolution of the}} Outer Banks is dependent on <b>inlets</b> from hurricanes. Dredging operations began on October 17, about a month after the hurricane struck. The United States Geological Survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of Hatteras Island, a choice made to minimize impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane. On November 22, about two months after the hurricane struck, Highway 12 and Hatteras Island were reopened to public access. On the same day, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was reopened. The breach on the southern end of Hatteras Island was filled in with sand, as well.|$|E
5|$|Modern Scotland is {{half the}} size England and Wales in area, but with its many <b>inlets,</b> islands and inland lochs, it has roughly {{the same amount of}} {{coastline}} at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall: today about 700cm per year in the east and over 1,000cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and {{may have contributed to the}} fragmented nature of political power.|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} {{study was}} performed to explore the aerodynamic performance of a streamline-traced, external-compression <b>inlet</b> designed for Mach 1. 664 at off-design conditions of freestream Mach number, angle-of-attack, and angle-of-sideslip. Serious degradation of the <b>inlet</b> performance occurred for negative angles-of-attack and angles-of-sideslip greater than 3 degrees. At low subsonic speeds, the swept leading edges of the <b>inlet</b> created a pair of vortices that propagated to the engine face. Increasing the bluntness of the cowl lip showed no real improvement in the <b>inlet</b> performance at the low speeds, but did improve the <b>inlet</b> performance at the design conditions. Reducing the <b>inlet</b> flow rate improved the <b>inlet</b> performance, but at the likely expense of reduced thrust of the propulsion system. Deforming the cowl lip for low-speed operation of the <b>inlet</b> increased the <b>inlet</b> capture area and improved the <b>inlet</b> performance...|$|R
