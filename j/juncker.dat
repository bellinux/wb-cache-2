Its {{president}} is Jean-Claude <b>Juncker,</b> who presides over 27 other commissioners (one {{from each of the}} states composing the European Union, except Luxembourg, which is Juncker's state). In July 2014, <b>Juncker</b> was officially elected to succeed José Manuel Barroso, who completed his second five-year term in that year.|$|E
25|$|EC & EEAS: Signalling reassertion by France over European {{diplomacy}} and security matters, the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude <b>Juncker</b> appointed Michel Barnier, the former EU Internal Market Commissioner, as his special advisor on defence and security. <b>Juncker</b> stated that Barnier's role {{will be to}} advise the European Commission and particularly the EUHRVP Federica Mogherini on important defence and security issues.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} time in 2014, the President of the European Commission was elected under the new {{provisions}} established with the Treaty of Lisbon, which had entered into force after the 2009 Elections to the European Parliament, on 1 December 2009. <b>Juncker's</b> aide Martin Selmayr {{played a central role in}} his campaign and later during his presidency as <b>Juncker's</b> campaign director, head of <b>Juncker's</b> transition team and finally as <b>Juncker's</b> head of cabinet (chief of staff).|$|R

Each new President is nominated by the European Council and formally elected by the European Parliament, for a five-year term. , the current President is Jean-Claude <b>Juncker,</b> who took office on 1 November 2014. He {{is a member of}} the European People's Party (EPP) and is the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg. <b>Juncker</b> is the twelfth President and his First Vice-President is Frans Timmermans.|$|E

40|$|The fear of {{a federal}} Europe has {{eurosceptics}} riled once again. David Cameron is increasingly dialling up his rhetoric in response to Jean-Claude <b>Juncker’s</b> candidacy for head of the European Commission, with <b>Juncker’s</b> reported advocacy for a “United States of Europe” driving right-wing euroscepticism to a new pitch – unsurprising after a European parliament election that saw a broad surge in anti-EU voting...|$|R
50|$|Following <b>Juncker's</b> {{graduation}} from the University of Strasbourg, {{he was appointed}} as a Parliamentary Secretary. He later won election to the Chamber of Deputies {{for the first time}} in 1984 and was immediately appointed to the Cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Santer as Minister of Labour. This led to his being given a chairman's role at a number of meetings of the Council of the European Communities, where <b>Juncker's</b> pro-Europe credentials first emerged.|$|R

40|$|The UK’s {{nominated}} Commissioner, Jonathan Hill, {{was assigned}} {{the financial services}} portfolio in Jean-Claude <b>Juncker’s</b> proposed European Commission. As this {{was viewed as a}} positive outcome for British interests, some commentators have suggested the threat of a ‘Brexit’ may have factored into the decision. Simon Usherwood writes that while a Brexit might not have been foremost in <b>Juncker’s</b> mind, it nevertheless played a role. He argues however that the UK should not expect preferential treatment and that the country’s relationship with the EU remains far from resolved...|$|R

25|$|The Treaty of Lisbon doesn't {{define a}} {{nomination}} {{process for the}} President of the Council and several official and unofficial candidates were proposed. At the final European Council meeting on the treaty in Lisbon, on 19 November 2007, French President Nicolas Sarkozy set off public speculation on candidates by naming Tony Blair, Felipe González and Jean-Claude <b>Juncker,</b> and praising the three as worthy candidates with Blair in particular being a long time front runner for the post. However, he faced large scale opposition for being from a large state outside the eurozone and the Schengen Area {{as well as being}} a leader who entered the Iraq War which had split Europe. Minor opposition to other leaders such as <b>Juncker</b> also led to their rejection.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Jean-Claude <b>Juncker</b> {{as president of the}} 17 euro zone finance ministers, known as the Eurogroup, suggestions soon gathered pace that Chancellor Angela Merkel was pressing for Schäuble to take up the position; the job later went to Jeroen Dijsselbloem instead.|$|E
25|$|In July 2016, Barroso became non-executive {{chairman}} of London-based Goldman Sachs International (GSI), the bank's largest subsidiary. He {{will also be}} {{an adviser to the}} bank. This position has been regarded as quite controversial, and has led Barroso's successor Jean-Claude <b>Juncker</b> to launch an ethics investigation.|$|E
50|$|The Presidency {{has helped}} {{strengthen}} the group, since before <b>Juncker's</b> appointment the Eurogroup was only 'accidentally' present at {{meetings in the}} European Parliament. Since the position of President was created, the president has attended Parliament's committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs every six months.|$|R
50|$|In this capacity, Oettinger was {{in charge}} of the Commission’s {{department}} for communications networks, content and technology. His department gained considerable powers as part of <b>Juncker’s</b> administrative reshuffle, including over the fight against counterfeiting, piracy and copyright. He shared competency over cyber-security matters with Dimitris Avramopoulos.|$|R
50|$|It {{represented}} a coalition between <b>Juncker's</b> Christian Social People's Party (CSV) and Asselborn's Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP), after these {{had been elected}} the largest and second-largest parties respectively in the legislature, {{in the general election}} of 2004. Previously, the CSV had been governing in coalition with the liberal Democratic Party.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the expressions of shock, support, solidarity and sympathy offered by many national governments and heads of state, the United Nations Security Council observed a minute of silence at its morning meeting on 23 March. The attack was denounced by the European Commission President Jean-Claude <b>Juncker</b> and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the victory}} of the European People's Party in the {{previous}} election, EPP parties were keen to get one of their members into the post, including Luxembourgian Prime Minister Jean-Claude <b>Juncker</b> (EPP), who refused, and Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel (EPP), who was in a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party of Austria which discredited him as a candidate to some governments.|$|E
25|$|Stoiber {{was first}} {{appointed}} in 2007 {{as a special}} adviser to then-European Commission President José Manuel Barroso to chair the “High level group on administrative burdens,” made up of national experts, NGOs, business and industry organizations. Quickly nicknamed the “Stoiber Group,” it produced a report in July 2014 with several proposals on streamlining the regulatory process. Stoiber was re-appointed in December 2014 by Jean-Claude <b>Juncker</b> to the same role, from which he resigned after one year in late 2015.|$|E
40|$|Extract: This {{article will}} dispute <b>Juncker’s</b> {{claim that the}} Europe of today {{is similar to that}} of one hundred years ago. The alliances of 1913, which were the basis of World War I, will first be {{described}} to illustrate the precarious situation of early 20 th century Europe. This situation will be then be compared with the early 21 st century, detailing the vastly divergent priorities of the European Union in 2013. Subsequently, the Balkan setting of 1913 will be detailed and compared with the Balkan situation in 2013 to demonstrate that the Balkans are no longer the ‘powder keg of Europe’, largely due to EU efforts. Ultimately, it will be demonstrated that <b>Juncker’s</b> claim that Europe of 2013 finds itself in similar circumstances to Europe of 1913, is incorrect; in reality, the Europe of 2013 is vastly different from the Europe of one hundred years ago...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} several months, European {{officials}} have presented a range of visions {{for the future of}} the continent. Iain Begg (LSE European Institute) looks at likely scenarios in the wake of European Commission President Jean-Claude <b>Juncker's</b> latest State of the Union and contends that interest in Brexit and the Brits is declining across the continent.

40|$|What lessons {{have been}} drawn by the EU from the CETA and TTIP trade negotiations? Johan Adriaensen argues that the trade package {{contained}} in Jean-Claude <b>Juncker's</b> State of the Union speech presented a coherent vision for how EU trade negotiations could move forward, with avenues for discontent at future agreements to be channelled through representative institutions. However, implementing these ideas will be far from straightforward, and {{it is unclear whether}} the EU will be able to prevent the kind of opposition to future trade agreements that it experienced in both the CETA and TTIP cases...|$|R
25|$|Although he was {{a member}} of the European Parliament, Farage campaigned to leave the EU as a key figurehead for the British exit from the EU in 2016. Polls on the day of the vote {{suggested}} defeat for the leave campaign, though they were successful with 52 per cent of the vote. Jean-Claude <b>Juncker</b> promptly told all UKIP members to leave the Parliament. Farage also made the suggestion of a future second referendum in an interview with the Daily Mirror if Brexit lost but the result was closer than 52-48.|$|E
25|$|One of the 28 is the President of the European Commission (currently Jean-Claude <b>Juncker)</b> {{appointed}} by the European Council. After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is ex-officio a Vice-President of the Commission and is also chosen by the European Council. The other 26 Commissioners are subsequently {{appointed by}} the Council of the European Union {{in agreement with the}} nominated President. The 28 Commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} of Line 4 will be between Alsos Veikou and Goudi stations, {{predicting}} fourteen (14) new stations and a length of 11.7km of new track. It has been announced that an invitation to tender {{for the construction of}} the {{first phase of}} Line 4 will be issued in the summer of 2016. The construction is expected to start by mid-2017 and the opening of the line by circa 2025. The estimated cost for constructing {{the first phase of the}} new line is 1.2-1.4 billion EUR. Currently, the project of the first phase is considered to follow a PPP scheme which might be extended for constructing the whole new line. An alternative solution is a mixed funding between the EIB and the Greek State. It is also a high-profile candidate project to be included in the <b>Juncker</b> Plan of EU that will include also the second phase of Line 4 of Athens Metro.|$|E
40|$|Jean-Claude <b>Juncker’s</b> new European Commission officially entered {{office on}} 1 November. Arndt Wonka and Holger Döring {{write on the}} {{political}} profile of the new Commissioners, noting that {{in line with the}} growing politicisation of the institution over recent decades, the 28 members include a record share of former prime ministers and deputy prime ministers. The percentage of Commissioners who have a partisan affiliation with their country’s current government, and the percentage who have previously gained ministerial experience in national politics, are also at record levels in comparison to previous Commissions...|$|R
40|$|This Policy Brief is {{the first}} of a series of three that explore {{progressive}} policies that could address the current economic dilemma of the European Union. This first one assumes a continuation of conventional macroeconomic policies together with a significant rise in capital investment. We give particular attention to Jean Claude <b>Juncker’s</b> announcement of an ambitious investment package, advertised to be financed by € 300 billion over three years. Our macroeconomic modelling clearly shows that the scale of this plan when accompanied by continued reductions in government spending and revenue would not be sufficient to stave off secular stagnation throughout Europe...|$|R
50|$|In July 2014, {{given the}} large number of Italian MEPs {{belonging}} to the S&D group following the 2014 European election, the European Council considered her as a candidate for the position of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in Jean-Claude <b>Juncker's</b> new European Commission. On 13 July 2014, the Financial Times among other European newspapers reported that her nomination proposal had been opposed by the Baltic states and several Central-European countries, including Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, where her stance towards Russia concerning the Ukrainian crisis was considered to be too soft.|$|R
