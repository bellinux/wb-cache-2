This study proposes a cylinder-FBG (C-FBG) sensor with the FBG glued to a cylindrical sensor holder. Effectiveness of the sensor was evaluated by characterizing directionality and frequency sensitivity of the sensor and by comparing the detected AE signals in a 3 -point bending test of a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminate against a conventional wide-band piezoelectric AE sensor. The features of the detected signals were similar to the signals detected by the wide-band AE sensor.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explores the}} concept of {{locality}} in proofs of global safety properties of asynchronously composed, multi-process programs. Model checking on the full state space is often infeasible due to state <b>explosion.</b> A local <b>proof,</b> in contrast, {{is a collection of}} per-process invariants, which together imply the global safety property. Local proofs can be compact: but a central problem is that local reasoning is incomplete. In this paper, we present a “completion ” algorithm, which gradually exposes facts about the internal state of components, until either a local proof or a real error is discovered. Experiments show that local reasoning can have significantly better performance over a reachability computation. Moreover, for some parameterized protocols, a local proof can be used to show correctness for all instances. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} fifty years, it has been {{believed}} that cosmic ray (CR) nuclei are accelerated to high energies in the rapidly expanding shockwaves created by powerful supernova <b>explosions.</b> Yet observational <b>proof</b> of this conjecture is still lacking. Recently, Uchiyama and collaborators reported the detection of small-scale X-ray flares in one such supernova remnant, dubbed “RX J 1713 - 3946 ” (a. k. a. G 347. 3 - 0. 5), which also emits very energetic, TeV (1012 eV) range, gamma-rays. They contend that the variability of these X-ray “hotspots ” implies that the magnetic field in the remnant is about a hundred times larger than normally assumed; and this, they say, means that the detected TeV range photons were produced in energetic nuclear interactions, providing “a strong argument for acceleration of protons and nuclei to energies of 1 PeV (1015 eV) and beyond in young supernova remnants. " We point out here that the existing multiwavelength data on this object certainly do not support such conclusions.
