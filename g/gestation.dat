40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} incidence, {{severity}} and pregnancy outcomes of pregnancy induced hypertension in twins and singleton <b>gestations.</b> Material and Method: The cohort study enrolled 305 twins and 298 singleton <b>gestations</b> at Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand between January 1996 and December 2001. The rates of pregnancy induced hypertension and pregnancy outcomes were statistically analysed in both groups. P-value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Pregnancy induced hypertension {{was found to}} at develop 18. 36 % in the twin <b>gestations,</b> compared with 5. 03 % in the singleton <b>gestations</b> (P< 0. 05). Women with twin <b>gestations</b> had higher rates of pregnancy induced hypertension (RR 3. 65, 95 % CI 2. 11 - 6. 30, P< 0. 05) and occurred earlier than singleton <b>gestations</b> (35. 86 ± 2. 50 VS 37. 40 ± 1. 18 weeks, P< 0. 05). Twin <b>gestations</b> with preganancy induced hypertension had significantly higher rate of cesarean delivery, low birthweight, NICU admission and perinatal death than singleton <b>gestations</b> with pregnancy induced hypertension (P< 0. 05). Moreover, the abruptio placenta, postpartum hemorrhage and perinatal mortality in twin <b>gestations</b> with pregnancy induced hypertension group {{were significantly higher than}} in normotensive group (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The incidence of pregnancy induced hypertension was significant higher and occurred earlier with greater adverse pregnancy outcomes among twin <b>gestations</b> than singleton <b>gestations.</b> Moreover, the rate of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in twin <b>gestations</b> with pregnancy induced hypertensive group was higher than in normotensive group...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of twin <b>gestations</b> has {{increased over the}} last few decades, mainly due to maternal age at childbearing, and the use of assisted reproductive technologies. Twins are at higher risk of aneuploidy, structural anomalies, and placental abnormalities. Some of the placental and umbilical cord abnormalities found in twin <b>gestations</b> are nonspecific and can be found in singleton <b>gestations</b> (ie, placenta previa, placental abruption, single umbilical artery, velamentous cord insertion, vasa previa, etc). However, other anomalies are unique to twin <b>gestations,</b> and are mainly associated with monochorionic twins-these include intraplacental anastomosis and cord entanglement. Most of these conditions can be diagnosed with ultrasound. An accurate and early diagnosis is important in the management of twin <b>gestations.</b> Determination of chorionicity, amnionicity, and the identification of placental anomalies are key issues for the adequate management of twin pregnancies.

Lifespan increases with <b>gestation</b> period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of <b>gestation,</b> and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To compare {{maternal}} {{outcome of}} multiple versus singleton pregnancies at a tertiary hospital in Tanzania. Methods: A {{case control study}} was designed using maternally linked data from Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) medical birth registry {{for the period of}} 2000 – 2010. A total of 822 multiple <b>gestations</b> (cases) were matched with 822 singletons (controls) with respect to maternal age at delivery and parity. The odds ratio (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for adverse maternal outcome between singleton and multiple <b>gestations</b> were computed in a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: Of the 33 997 births, there were 822 (2. 1 %) multiples. Compared with singletons, women with multiple <b>gestations</b> had increased risk for preeclampsia (OR 2. 6; 95 %CI: 1. 7 – 3. 9), preterm labour (OR 5. 6; 95 %CI: 4. 2 – 7. 4), antepartum haemorrhage (OR 1. 6; 95 %CI: 1. 1 – 2. 3), anaemia (OR 2. 0; 95 %CI: 1. 6 – 2. 6) and caesarean section (OR 1. 5; 95 %CI: 1. 4 – 1. 7). In addition, there were six maternal deaths among women with multiple <b>gestations,</b> of which all were attributed to postpartum haemorrhage. This accounted for a case fatality rate of 15. 8 %. Conclusions: Multiple <b>gestations</b> are associated with adverse maternal outcomes. Close follow-up and timely interventions may help to prevent poor outcomes related to multiple <b>gestations.</b> These findings suggest the needs for clinicians to counsel women with multiple <b>gestations</b> during prenatal care regarding the potential risks...|$|R
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the nervous}} shark is viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their initial supply of yolk, they are {{provisioned}} {{by the mother}} through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites {{at the sides of}} the female as a prelude to mating. After mating, the female stores the sperm for approximately four weeks prior to fertilization. In Darwin Harbor, mating occurs from January to March and birthing occurs in October and November following a <b>gestation</b> period of eight to nine months. In Shark Bay, mating occurs from late October to early November and birthing occurs around the same time the following year, following a <b>gestation</b> period of 11 months; this slower development likely reflects the cooler temperatures of Shark Bay.|$|E

It is aplacental viviparous, with the mother provisioning her young with histotroph ("uterine milk"). Life history differs between the eastern and western subpopulations: eastern females bear litters of up to six pups with a twelve-month <b>gestation</b> period, while western females bear litters of {{only one or two}} pups with a ten-month <b>gestation</b> period. Also, western rays mature later and live longer than eastern rays. The venomous sting of the sparsely-spotted stingaree is potentially injurious to humans, and it has been reported to react aggressively if disturbed.

5|$|Viviparous mammals {{are in the}} {{subclass}} Theria; {{those living}} today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short <b>gestation</b> period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located {{in the front of}} the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy. Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way. The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long <b>gestation</b> periods. They get their name from the placenta, which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} provide {{evidence-based}} guidelines for using progestogens {{for the prevention}} of preterm birth (PTB). METHODS: Relevant documents, in particular randomized trials, were identified using PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, 1983 through February 2012) publications, written in English, which evaluate the effectiveness of progestogens for prevention of PTB. Progestogens evaluated were, in particular, vaginal progesterone and 17 -alpha-hydroxy-progesterone caproate. Additionally, the Cochrane Library, organizational guidelines, and studies identified through review of the above were utilized to identify relevant articles. Data were evaluated according to population studied, with separate analyses for singleton vs multiple <b>gestations,</b> prior PTB, or short transvaginal ultrasound cervical length (CL), and combinations of these factors. Consistent with US Preventive Task Force suggestions, references were evaluated for quality based on the highest level of evidence, and recommendations were graded. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Summary of randomized studies indicates that in women with singleton <b>gestations,</b> no prior PTB, and short CL ≤ 20 mm at ≤ 24 weeks, vaginal progesterone, either 90 -mg gel or 200 -mg suppository, is associated with reduction in PTB and perinatal morbidity and mortality, and can be offered in these cases. The issue of universal CL screening of singleton <b>gestations</b> without prior PTB {{for the prevention of}} PTB remains an object of debate. CL screening in singleton <b>gestations</b> without prior PTB cannot yet be universally mandated. Nonetheless, implementation of such a screening strategy can be viewed as reasonable, and can be considered by individual practitioners, following strict guidelines. In singleton <b>gestations</b> with prior PTB 20 - 36 6 / 7 weeks, 17 -alpha-hydroxy-progesterone caproate 250 mg intramuscularly weekly, preferably starting at 16 - 20 weeks until 36 weeks, is recommended. In these women with prior PTB, if the transvaginal ultrasound CL shortens to 3 ̆c 25 mm at 3 ̆c 24 weeks, cervical cerclage may be offered. Progestogens have not been associated with prevention of PTB in women who have in the current pregnancy multiple <b>gestations,</b> preterm labor, or preterm premature rupture of membranes. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of progestogens in women with any of these risk factors, with or without a short CL. Copyright © 2012. Published by Mosby, Inc...|$|R
