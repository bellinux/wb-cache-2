40|$|The {{possibility}} of using terrestrial <b>ionospheric</b> <b>focusing</b> {{to improve the}} directivity of electric dipoles on space missions has been investigated by comparing simultaneous observations of a solar radio storm by the ISIS 1 and ISIS 2 spacecraft, in near earth orbit, and the ISEE 3 spacecraft located beyond the magnetosphere. To this end, a three-dimensional ray tracing in a spherically stratified ionosphere {{has been carried out}} for conditions appropriate to the observations by the ISIS spacecraft of a solar radio storm in September 1983. The procedure allows Poynting flux spectral densities measured on ISIS to be converted to spectral densities well outside the ionosphere where they can be compared directly with simultaneous observations on ISEE 3. The results demonstrate good agreement over their common observing frequency range (1 - 2 MHz) ...|$|E
40|$|About 22 {{hours after}} its closest {{approach}} to Jupiter, Voyager 2 passed behind the planet as {{viewed from the}} earth. Although the spacecraft was geometrically occulted for nearly two hours, the radio links {{between it and the}} earth were maintained almost continuously because of the refraction of the signals in Jupiter's south polar atmosphere. A figure shows the plane-of-the-sky geometry of this grazing occultation and preliminary data on the intensity of the spacecraft radio signals as received by the tracking station at Goldstone, California. The intensity data indicate a classic atmospheric occultation profile and the effects of turbulence and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>focusing</b> and defocusing. Analysis of the dispersive ionospheric refraction data yields preliminary profiles for the topside ionosphere at 66. 7 deg S (entry in the evening) and 50. 1 deg S (exit in the morning) that are reversed with respect to corresponding Voyager 1 profiles in terms of plasma concentration at a fixed altitude. Preliminary reduction of the preencounter occultation of Voyager 1 by the Io torus gives an average plasma density of about 1000 e/cu cm...|$|E
40|$|Ionospheric {{modification}} by {{high power}} radio waves and by chemical releases are combined in a theoretical study of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>focused</b> heating. The release of materials which promote electron-ion recombination creates {{a hole in}} the bottomside ionosphere. The <b>ionospheric</b> hole <b>focuses</b> high power radio waves from a ground-based transmitter to give a 20 dB or greater enhancement in power density. The intense radio beam excites atomic oxygen by collisions with accelerated electrons. Airglow from the excited oxygen provides a visible trace of the focused beam. The large increase in the intensity of the radio beam stimulates new wave-plasma interactions. Numerical simulations show that the threshold for the two-plasmon decay instability is exceeded. The interaction of the pump electromagnetic wave with the backward plasmon produces a scattered electromagnetic wave at 3 / 2 the pump frequency. The scattered wave provides a unique signature of the two-plasmon decay process for ground-based detection...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{modelling}} of {{the topside}} ionosphere {{relies on the}} availability of good quality measured data. The Alouette, ISIS and Intercosmos- 19 satellite mis-sions provided large amounts of data, but with limited coverage of relevant geo-physical conditions by each individual mission. Recently, methods for inferring the electron density distribution in the topside from Global Positioning System (GPS) -based total electron content (TEC) measurements have been developed. This paper attempts to review recent progress in topside <b>ionospheric</b> modelling <b>focusing</b> on GPS-TEC based modelling techniques and explores the possibility of using GPS measurements for the topside modelling efforts in South Africa. ...|$|R

The <b>focus</b> of this effort was the phenomenon of electron trapping {{and its implications for}} breakdown processes (collisional regime) and the current-voltage relationship governing current collection (collisionless regime) in space-based pulsed power systems with high voltage components exposed to space, e. g., the SPEAR I experiment...|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} been proposed to use bare electrodynamic tethers (EDTs) in connection with micro- and nano-satellites, either to provide a cheap test of OML current collection theory or to devise a lightweight deorbiting system for cubesats experiments. In the present article we investigate the orbital evolution of small satellites (2 kg) equipped with electrodynamic tethers of different lengths (100 m to 300 m) different <b>ionospheric</b> conditions and <b>focusing</b> on a nominal VEGA polar orbit of 700 km altitude. Issues of tether integration in the microsatellite system and tether deployment are also addressed. Results show that, given sufﬁcient power availability and once a safe and effective deployment strategy is devised, a small dedicated experiment involving two cubesats is feasible in favorable conditions with tether length of 100 - 300...|$|R
40|$|Electron densities in the Martian nightside {{ionosphere}} {{are more}} than 90 % of time too low to be detected by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding radar sounder on board the Mars Express spacecraft. However, the relative number of ionograms with peak electron density high enough to be detected represents a good statistical proxy of the <b>ionospheric</b> density. We <b>focus</b> on solar energetic particle (SEP) events, and we analyze their effects on ionospheric formation. SEP time intervals were identified in situ using the background counts recorded by the ion sensor of the ASPERA- 3 instrument on board Mars Express. We show that peak electron densities during the SEP events are {{large enough to be}} detected in more than 30 % of measurements, and, moreover, the reflections of the sounding signal from the ground almost entirely disappear. Nightside electron densities during SEP events are thus substantially increased as compared to normal nightside conditions...|$|R
30|$|One {{possible}} solution {{to these problems}} is to combine ground-based GPS data with space-borne measurements. Observations from a GPS receiver with a zenith-looking antenna placed onboard a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite offer an opportunity to separate the ionospheric irregularities registered above a LEO from that on the ground. Earlier, Noja et al. (2013), and Zakharenkova and Astafyeva (2015) demonstrated that space-borne GPS measurements onboard a solo-satellite mission (CHAMP) could successfully be used to study the occurrence of high-latitude topside ionospheric irregularities. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantages of using LEO multi-satellite missions for monitoring high-latitude <b>ionospheric</b> irregularities. Our <b>focus</b> was on the successful European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm mission, launched in November 2013, and currently in orbit for more than 2  years. Swarm is a constellation of three identical satellites that orbit at two altitudes of ~ 460 and ~ 510  km; the upper satellite (Swarm B) slowly separates in local time from the tandem satellites (Swarms A and C). We analyze {{the differences in the}} spatial distribution of ionospheric irregularities detected by the ground-based permanent GPS network with that of the topside GPS measurements onboard the Swarm constellation, using a case study of the 2015 St. Patrick’s Day storm. Additionally, we include GPS measurements from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and TerraSAR-X (SAR—synthetic aperture radar) satellites that orbit at similar altitudes to Swarm.|$|R
40|$|Spacecraft radar {{sounding}} signals at frequencies {{higher than the}} ionospheric peak plasma frequency are not reflected by the ionosphere. Instead, they {{make it to the}} ground where they are reflected by the planetary surface. We analyze the intensity of the surface reflections measured by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) ionospheric radar sounder on board the Mars Express spacecraft. Apart from the surface reflectivity and the spacecraft altitude, the detected intensity of surface reflections is controlled primarily by the signal attenuation during the <b>ionospheric</b> propagation. We <b>focus</b> on the nightside region, where the ionospheric densities in the main layer are too low to cause a significant attenuation and allow sampling of the surface reflections at frequencies down to 3 MHz. The attenuation occurs mainly at altitudes below 100 km, where the electron-neutral collision frequency is a maximum. The intensity of surface reflections can thus serve as a proxy for electron densities at low altitudes not accessible by the direct ionospheric {{radar sounding}}. We analyze the intensity of surface reflections as a function of relevant controlling parameters. The intensity of surface reflections is lower at higher solar zenith angles on the nightside and during the periods of larger solar activity. Moreover, it exhibits a seasonal variation that is related to the dust storm occurrence. The intensity of surface reflections is lower in areas of closed magnetic field lines, suggesting that nightside electron densities behave rather differently at low altitudes than at higher altitudes. This is confirmed by comparison with simultaneous observations of the main ionospheric layer...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of intense}} high-altitude {{electric}} field (E-field) peaks for large-scale plasma convection is investigated {{with the help}} of Cluster E-field, B-field and density data. The study covers 32 E-field events between 4 and 7 RE geocentric distance, with E-field magnitudes in the range 500 – 1000 mV/m when mapped to <b>ionospheric</b> altitude. We <b>focus</b> on E-field structures above the ionosphere that are typically coupled to discrete auroral arcs and their return current region. Connected to such E-field peaks are rapid plasma flows directed along the discrete arcs in opposite directions {{on each side of the}} arc. Nearly all the E-field events occur during active times. A strong dependence on different substorm phases is found: a majority of intense E-field events appearing during substorm expansion or maximum phase are located on the nightside oval, while most recovery events occur on the dusk-to-dayside part of the oval. For most expansion and maximum phase cases, the average background plasma flow is in the sunward direction. For a majority of recovery events, the flow is in the anti-sunward direction. The net plasma flux connected to a strong E-field peak is in two thirds of the cases in the same direction as the background plasma flow. However, in only one third of the cases the strong flux caused by an E-field peak makes an important contribution to the plasma transport within the boundary plasma sheet. For a majority of events, the area covered by rapid plasma flows above discrete arcs is too small to have an effect on the global convection. This questions the role of discrete auroral arcs as major driver of plasma convection...|$|R
40|$|URL] audienceIonospheric scintillations {{are created}} by {{diffraction}} when the transmitted propagating waves encounter a medium made of irregular structures with variable refraction indexes. The recombination of the waves after propagation can be constructive or destructive and the resulting signal at output of the receiver antenna may present rapid variations of phase and amplitude. Scintillations are essentially observed in the regions located under the geomagnetic equator, where irregularities in the ionosphere like plasma bubbles occur more frequently. They also happen over Polar Regions and {{are associated with the}} penetration of charged particles along the magnetic field lines. Under the auroral oval region, scintillations can be local or spread over a great part of the oval. According to past observations scintillations occur mainly at the period of the equinox and the solstice. During {{the rest of the time}} there are almost no observations. After sunset, the modification in the ionosphere layers generates such variations. Scintillations cause very brutal and fast fades of the received signal, and once these phenomena occur they can last from 30 minutes up to several hours. However, continuous GNSS Carrier Phase Measurements are important observations needed for data demodulation and are increasingly used in GNSS receivers, both at user side (e. g. for precise positioning), and for ground segments to compute the navigation and integrity data. The carrier phase is traditionally tracked in the GNSS receivers using PLL, potentially aided by FLL. Carrier tracking loops may be optimized, depending on the application and environment, by selecting the appropriated loop order, integration time, and bandwidth (trade-off between accuracy and robustness). Phase Loops are however known to be less robust than code tracking loops, and the GNSS receivers may thus suffer from phase tracking loss, for example when tracking low C/N 0 signals (attenuations), or fast varying signals such as signals affected by scintillations. This strongly impacts the positioning service availability, as well as the capability to demodulate the navigation message data, in situations where ionospheric scintillations affect the received signal. One thus has to implement innovative techniques and receiver architectures to provide robust carrier phase tracking, either by improving or optimizing the classical tracking loops (optimized parameters of the PLL, potentially dynamically) or by defining different architectures such as Kalman filter-based tracking loops (either scalar or vector architectures, taking benefits of the different tracking channels, constellations and frequencies which may be differently affected by the disturbance). Other techniques coming, for example, from the telecommunication domain can also be interesting to estimate the propagation channel parameters. It can also be taken advantage of the improved structure of the modern GNSS signals, providing in particular a pilot signal component. The improvement technique investigated in this paper consists in replacing the conventional phase lock loop filter by a Kalman Filter PLL (KFP), as inspired by the technique proposed by Psiaki et al [...] Kalman loop filters provide the optimal filter gain when the statistical levels of uncertainty of the state and observation vectors are well known. So the Kalman filter is continuously adapting the filter bandwidth to the noise level. KFP tracking loop indeed show a better resistance to weak GNSS signal tracking compared to classical loop filters. We were therefore interested in analyzing the potential of such KFP variants for tracking the GPS L 1 carrier phase in presence of scintillations, adapting in particular the feedback control signal. This was conducted during a project financed by CNES. The aim of this paper is therefore to present the development of a GPS L 1 phase tracking technique based on a Kalman Filter improving the tracking robustness in presence of ionospheric scintillations, and to present results of its performance using simulations. The paper starts with a description of the phenomenon of ionospheric scintillation, including the possible models for signals affected by <b>ionospheric</b> scintillations, <b>focusing</b> on the model selected for this study which is GISM (Global Ionospheric Scintillation Model) developed by IEEA. The second section presents a review of the state of the art of ionospheric mitigation tracking techniques. In a third part, the proposed robust GPS L 1 tracking technique proposed is described. Then the simulation environment is described, and simulations results are presented, showing improved performance of the proposed tracking technique...|$|R
