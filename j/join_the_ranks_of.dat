The boys accept to the game with amusement and find that the women are not good at baseball. Two Harvard University baseball stars <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the girls in disguise and defeat the boys team.

5|$|Potocki was an alumnus of the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, {{where he}} was a student in the years 1761–1765. From 1765 he studied {{theology}} and law in Rome, where he attended the Collegium Nazarenum, up to about 1769. His parents intended for him to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> clergy, but he refused to follow this path. After traveling through Italy and Germany, he returned to Poland around 1771. On 27 December 1772 he married Elżbieta Lubomirska. This marriage brought him close to the political faction of Familia. Early on, Potocki made a major impression on many of his contemporaries, being groomed as the next leader of Familia. From 1772 he was invited to the King Stanisław II Augustus' Thursday Dinners.|$|E

5|$|The Hongwu emperor from 1373 to 1384 staffed his bureaus with {{officials}} gathered through recommendations only. After that the scholar-officials who populated the many ranks of bureaucracy were recruited through a rigorous examination {{system that was}} initially established by the Sui dynasty (581–618). Theoretically the system of exams allowed anyone to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> imperial officials (although it was frowned upon for merchants to join); in reality the time and funding needed to support the study {{in preparation for the}} exam generally limited participants to those already coming from the landholding class. However, the government did exact provincial quotas while drafting officials. This was an effort to curb monopolization of power by landholding gentry who came from the most prosperous regions, where education was the most advanced. The expansion of the printing industry since Song times enhanced the spread of knowledge and number of potential exam candidates throughout the provinces. For young schoolchildren there were printed multiplication tables and primers for elementary vocabulary; for adult examination candidates there were mass-produced, inexpensive volumes of Confucian classics and successful examination answers.|$|E
5|$|At Villa Imperial, one of {{the richest}} cities of Upper Peru, an open cabildo called on Goyeneche to {{withdraw}} from their territory. He obeyed, as {{he did not have the}} military strength to prevail. The Bishop of La Paz, Remigio La Santa y Ortega, fled with him. Castelli was received in Potosí and requesting that the locals swear allegiance to the Junta. He also requested that the royalist generals Francisco de Paula Sanz and José de Córdoba y Rojas submit to him. He made arrangements that the operation to capture Vicente Nieto should be carried out exclusively by the surviving members of the Regiment of Patricians from the mines of Potosi, who had been incorporated with honors into the Army of the North. Sanz, Nieto, and Córdoba were executed at the Plaza of Potosí. Nieto claimed that he died happy, because it was under the Spanish flag. Goyeneche and Ortega, on the other hand, were safe on royalist land. Bernardo Monteagudo, inmate at the Jail of the Court of Chuquisaca for his participation in the revolution of 1809, escaped to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the army. Castelli, who already knew Monteagudo's background, appointed him his secretary.|$|E

25|$|Despite a high {{enlistment}} {{rate in the}} U.S. Army, African Americans {{were not}} treated equally. At parades, church services, in transportation and canteens the races were kept separate. The Women's Army Corps (WAC) changed its enlistment policies in January 1941, allowing for African American women to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> Army nurses to strengthen the war effort. Much like with male soldiers, Black women were given separate training, inferior living quarters, and rations. Black nurses were integrated into everyday life with their white colleagues and often felt the pain of discrimination and slander from the wounded soldiers they cared for and the leadership assigned to them.|$|E

Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming regional managers, service managers, clinical nurse managers or Modern Matrons.|$|E

25|$|Broken Steel is {{the third}} and most {{significant}} downloadable content pack, altering the original ending of Fallout 3 and allowing the player to continue playing past {{the end of the}} main quest line.

The pack raises the game's level cap from 20 to 30. It includes three main quests and three side-quests. Three Dog has new dialogue in this expansion, but no new songs are added. The new weapons in Broken Steel, including the Tesla Cannon, {{are some of the most}} powerful weapons in Fallout 3.|$|E
25|$|The Druze {{had already}} made contact on several {{occasions}} with Yishuv agents and following their defeat at Ramat Yohanan, the Druze officers offered to defect and to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> Haganah. This proposition was discussed with Yigael Yadin, who refused the proposal but suggested that they could help to carry out sabotage operations behind {{the backs of the}} Arabs and to influence their comrades into deserting the army. By the start of May, 212 Wahab soldiers deserted. Taking into account the attitude of his men, Wahab met with Jewish liaison officers on 9 May and agreed to cooperate with Haganah. The two parties avoided clashes, and Wahab created a neutral enclave in the centre of Galilee. Wahab's army did not respond to calls for it to help fight Haganah's occupation of Acre, and avoided being present while Haganah occupied the police fortress of Shefa-'Amr during its evacuation by the British.|$|E
25|$|In the {{remainder}} of the Rider War, Eragon and Saphira are tutored by Oromis and Glaedr in Ellesmera. During an elvish Blood-Oath Celebration, Eragon is changed by a symbolic dragon, giving him elf-like abilities (speed, strength) and completely healing his back as well as all of his other injuries. Eragon then reveals his true feelings to Arya. After much persistence, Arya angrily rejects Eragon's suit. Meanwhile, Nasuada moves the Varden to the separate country of Surda which is ruled by King Orrin, and Roran moves the villagers of Carvahall to Surda, after their village was destroyed by the Ra'zac, who also captured Katrina. Roran is promoted to Captain while Nasuada allows the Urgals to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the Varden, even though her decision is opposed by many. Eragon and Saphira confront Murtagh and Thorn, who slew King Hrothgar.Thorn hatched for Murtagh and was magically made almost as big as Saphira. Murtagh bests Eragon, taking his sword Zar'roc, and revealing to him that they are brothers.|$|E

25|$|These {{traumatic}} experiences {{may have}} influenced Akhras' attempts to join one of the Palestinian resistance groups. However, Israeli intelligence reports indicate that Akhras was impregnated by a Fatah operative, despite being an unmarried teenager, and that the emotional and social consequences of her unplanned pregnancy were the primary reason she decided to commit a suicide attack. Akhras first tried to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> Hamas, which turned her away because of a long-standing policy against allowing females to fight in physical combatcitation needed. Hamas, which has claimed responsibility for many suicide bombings in Israel says that the basis for this rule lies in teachings of the Qur'an that says Jihad is {{the domain of the}} male. Despite this, Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad (which generally also only recruits males) have since each used female suicide bombers. In 2002, the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin made a statement to the press after Akhras' bombing saying that the group would only use women after they ran out of men.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the First Liberian Civil War, 80,000 {{refugees}} fled neighboring Liberia for the Sierra Leone – Liberian border. This displaced population, composed almost entirely of children, would prove to be an invaluable asset to the invading rebel armies because the refugee and detention centers, populated first by displaced Liberians and later by Sierra Leoneans, helped provide the manpower for the RUF’s insurgency. The RUF took advantage of the refugees, who were abandoned, starving, and in dire need of medical attention, by promising food, shelter, medical care, and looting and mining profits in return for their support. When this method of recruitment failed, as it often did for the RUF, youths were often coerced at the barrel of a gun to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> the RUF. After being forced to join, many child soldiers learned that the complete lack of law – as {{a result of}} the civil war – provided a unique opportunity for self-empowerment through violence and thus continued to support the rebel cause.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth city {{populations were}} {{fragmented}} on {{the bases of}} trade, class, ethnicity, religious affiliation or jurisdiction type and consumed by internal conflicts. The most enterprising and successful of burghers were able to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> <b>of</b> nobility, thus leaving the urban occupations or introducing additional tensions within cities. Townspeople in larger cities, including Danzig, supported with dedication and generosity the national cause during the foreign invasions. The Commonwealth's urban upper layer had lost its previously prominent role in the promotion of cultural advancement, but in Silesia, where Polish gentry no longer existed, Protestant townspeople continued Polish language educational and cultural activities, including literary work and publications, in several cities. Toward {{the middle of the}} 18th century the Polish and German burghers of Danzig, Thorn (Toruń) and other municipalities of Royal Prussia were among the pioneers of Polish Enlightenment. The typically parochial climate of ignorance, backwardness and prejudice in many small towns found its expression in a number of witch trials. Many magnate residencies were built and public improvement projects completed in Warsaw {{during the first half of}} the 18th century.|$|E
