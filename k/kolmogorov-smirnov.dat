The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in 1913. Empirically, a data set can be tested to see whether Zipf's law applies by checking the goodness of fit of an empirical distribution to the hypothesized power law distribution with a <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</b> test, and then comparing the (log) likelihood ratio of the power law distribution to alternative distributions like an exponential distribution or lognormal distribution. When Zipf's law is checked for cities, a better fit has been found with exponent s = 1.07; i.e. the [...] largest settlement is [...] {{the size of the}} largest settlement. While Zipf's law holds for the upper tail of the distribution, the entire distribution of cities is log-normal and follows Gibrat's law. Both laws are consistent because a log-normal tail can typically not be distinguished from a Pareto (Zipf) tail.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{provide a}} {{framework}} to bound the probability that accumulated errors were never above a given threshold on hybrid systems. Such systems are used for example to model an aircraft or {{a nuclear power plant}} on one side and its software on the other side. This report contains a simple formula based on Lévy’s and Markov’s inequalities and it continues a formal theory of random variables with a special focus on producing concrete results. About a fourth of the bits of all the results of our archetype application remain continuously significant with a probability of failure of one against almost a billion, where worst case analysis considers that no significant bit remains. We are using PVS as such formal tools force explicit statement of all hypotheses and prevent incorrect uses of theorems. As our theorem contains hypotheses on the individual errors, we introduce Hoeffding’s inequality and <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov’s</b> test to check that the hypotheses are almost certainly satisfied. The test {{can also be used to}} outline sources of errors that need to be analyzed in more details. I...|$|R

Methodsa cross-sectional study was performed with 215 adolescents aged 10 to 14 years, of both genders, evaluated through anthropometry and body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and by four different BIA devices, with and without a protocol. The following tests were used: <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov's,</b> chi-squared, Student's t or Mann-Whitney's, Kruskal-Wallis's, Wilcoxon's, and kappa index. The ROC curves were constructed and the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Resultsof the 215 adolescents, 44. 2 % had excessive body fat. The tetrapolar BIA device equipped with eight tactile electrodes showed more sensitivity and results that were closer to those obtained by DXA (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0. 964 with protocol and AUC = 0. 973 without protocol, p 0. 05). ConclusionBIA is capable of predicting alterations in adolescents’ body composition.

This work reports analytical data for the following 19 elements: Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sb, Se, Sr, U, V and Zn. The most abundant chemical elements were zinc and copper (Zn > Cu), with concentrations exceeding 10 microg/g (Zn = 189. 2 microg/g; Cu= 22. 9 microg/g). Other elements with concentrations greater than 1 microg/g were, in order of abundance, Al > Sr > Ba > Pb. The remaining elements were all below 1 microg/g. The average elemental concentrations in hair were statistically compared by <b>Kolmogorov–Smirnov’s</b> test taking children’s gender into account. Al, Ba, Cr, Li, Rb, Sb, Sr, V and Zn were statistically different according to gender, with significance p < 0. 001.

But our results unveil {{the relations between the}} coeffients in the JB classical test and the moments, showing that it really depends on the first eight moments. This is a new explanation for the powerfulness of such tests. General Chi-square tests for an arbitraty model, not only normal, are also derived. We make use of the modern functional empirical processes approach that makes it easier to handle statistics based on the high moments and allows the generalization of the JB test both in the number of involved moments and in the underlying distribution.

40|$|Abstract: Numerous code {{optimisation}} {{methods are}} usually experimented by doing multiple {{observations of the}} initial and the optimised executions times in order to declare a speedup. Even with fixed input and execution environment, programs executions times vary in general. So hence different kinds of speedups may be reported: the speedup of the average execution time, the speedup of the minimal execution time, the speedup of the median, etc. Many published speedups in the literature are observations {{of a set of}} experiments. In order to improve the reproducibility of the experimental results, this technical report presents a rigorous statistical methodology regarding program performance analysis. We rely on well known statistical tests (Shapiro-wilk’s test, Fisher’s F-test, Student’s t-test, <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov’s</b> test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney’s test) to study if the observed speedups are statistically significant or not. By fixing 0 Y]> 1 2, the probability that an individual execution of the optimised code is faster than the individual execution of the initial code.

It was verified that the sample presents unsatisfactory general results about financial performance, especially when related to financial ratios of profitability and return. However, the analysis of different categories of hospitals displays relevant and significant divergences, especially about the type of hospitals: publics and voluntaries ones. The voluntary hospitals present higher liquidity ratios and the best profitability and their capital structure usually focus on long term financing obtained from external agents. These evidences suggest that those organizations focus on financial leverage to achieve better results without deteriorate their liquidity. On the other hand, the public hospitals present lower liquidity as well as worse profitability and return ratios. It was verified that the large-sized hospitals usually present lower financial ratios (liquidity, profitability and return) than the medium-sized hospitals...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{segmentation}} {{of audio}} streams according to speaker identities, environmental and channel conditions {{has become an}} important preprocessing step for speech recognition, speaker recognition, and audio data mining. In most previous approaches, the automatic segmentation was evaluated {{in terms of the}} performance of the final system like the word error rate for speech recognition systems. In many applications like online audio indexing, and information retrieval systems, the actual boundaries of the segments are required. Therefore we present an approach based on the cumulative sum (CuSum) algorithm for automatic segmentation which minimizes the missing probability for a given false alarm rate. In this paper, we compare the CuSum algorithm to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) algorithm, and a generalization of the <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov’s</b> test for automatic segmentation of audio streams. We present a two-step variation of the three algorithms which improves the performance significantly. We present also a novel approach that combines hypothesized boundaries from the three algorithms to achieve the final segmentation of the audio stream. Our experiments on the 1998 Hub 4 broadcast news show that a variation of the CuSum algorithm significantly outperforms the other two approaches and that combining the three approaches using a voting scheme improves the performance slightly compared to using the a two-step variation of the CuSum algorithm alone. 1...|$|R
