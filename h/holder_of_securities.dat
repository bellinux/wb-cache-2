50|$|For {{the primary}} market to thrive, {{there must be}} a {{secondary}} market, or aftermarket that provides liquidity for the investment security—where <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> can sell them to other investors for cash. Otherwise, few people would purchase primary issues, and, thus, companies and governments would be restricted in raising equity capital (money) for their operations. Organized exchanges constitute the main secondary markets. Many smaller issues and most debt securities trade in the decentralized, dealer-based over-the-counter markets.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{literature}} {{on the history of}} investment in Britain. However, the role played by women as investors has been almost wholly ignored. This paper argues that women were an important class of stock market investors and produces empirical evidence, most notably share registers, to show that women engaged {{in a number of different}} types of investment, and were important in both public and private companies as long-term <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The article concludes by suggesting the impact of these findings on our understanding of women's financial position and of their role in corporate governance. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{security}} interest is typically granted by a [...] "security agreement". The {{security interest}} is established {{with respect to}} the property, if the debtor has an ownership interest in the property and the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> interest conferred value to the debtor, such as giving a loan.|$|R
5000|$|Schemes more {{in sympathy}} with the ex-soldiers who had relinquished their {{certificates}} to speculators at reduced rates were termed “discrimination”. These called for paying the original <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> at full value, and reimbursing the current <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> for its purchase price. The combined payments would, however, exceed the denomination of the original certificate. [...] Congressman James Madison of Virginia offered his own variation of “discrimination” which preserved the federal obligation of face value debt repayment. In his version, current certificate holders would be reimbursed at their purchase price for the devalued certificate, and the balance would be handed to the original holder; the government outlay would match the face value of the original certificate. [...] Hamilton rejected both “repudiation” and “discrimination” and championed “redemption”, i.e. reserving payment at full value strictly to the current <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> the certificates, with arrears of interest.|$|R
40|$|Section 16 (b) <b>of</b> the <b>Securities</b> Exchange Act <b>of</b> 1934 (2 ̆ 2 Section 16 (b) 2 ̆ 2) was {{designed}} to curb insider trading leading to 2 ̆ 2 sure thing 2 ̆ 2 profits {{at the expense of}} individual stockholders and 2 ̆ 2 to protect the securities markets from untoward influences. 2 ̆ 2 A series of cases over the years has explored various aspects of Section 16 (b) such as: what is a purchase and sale; who is an issuer; who are beneficial owners; and limits of the statute 2 ̆ 7 s purposes. However, one aspect of Section 16 (b) not fully elucidated by case law is the question of standing. In deciding who has standing when an issuer corporation is extinguished in a merger, Lewis v. McAdam, a 1985 Ninth Circuit case, interpreted standing narrowly, limiting standing to the issuer or <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> <b>of</b> the issuer.

50|$|Restricted <b>Securities</b> <b>of</b> SEC-Reporting Companies. The SEC {{has reduced}} the holding period under Rule 144 for {{restricted}} <b>securities</b> <b>of</b> SEC-reporting companies held by both affiliates and non-affiliates {{from one year to}} six months. Affiliate <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> reporting company <b>securities</b> may now resell their restricted securities after six months, subject to the other Rule 144 requirements. Non-affiliate <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> reporting company <b>securities</b> (who have also not been affiliates during the prior three months) may now resell their restricted securities held between six months and one year subject only to Rule 144’s current public information requirement. Any such resale by a non-affiliate after one year will be exempt from all Rule 144 requirements.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} <b>of</b> {{registered}} <b>securities,</b> certificates bearing the name <b>of</b> the <b>holder</b> are issued, but these merely represent the securities. A person {{does not automatically}} acquire legal ownership by having possession of the certificate. Instead, the issuer (or its appointed agent) maintains a register in which details <b>of</b> the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> the <b>securities</b> are entered and updated as appropriate.

25|$|When a {{security}} is sold, the seller is contractually obliged {{to deliver it}} to the buyer. If a seller sells {{a security}} short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller fails to deliver, the transaction does not settle, and the seller {{may be subject to}} a claim from its counterparty. Certain large <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities,</b> such as a custodian or investment management firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as securities lending. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full title <b>of</b> the <b>security,</b> so it cannot be used as collateral for margin buying.|$|R
2500|$|Grantor trusts are {{typically}} used in automobile-backed securities and REMICs (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits). [...] Grantor trusts {{are very similar}} to pass-through trusts used in the earlier days of securitization. An originator pools together loans and sells them to a grantor trust, which issues classes <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> backed by these loans. [...] Principal and interest received on the loans, after expenses are taken into account, are passed through to the <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> the <b>securities</b> on a pro-rata basis.|$|R
5000|$|On November 25, 2008 the Fed {{announced}} it would buy $800 billion of debt and mortgage backed securities, in a fund separate from the 700-billion dollar Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that was originally passed by Congress. [...] According to the BBC,The Fed used the fund to buy $100 billion in debt from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and $500 billion in Mortgage-backed securities The fund would {{also be used to}} loan $200 billion to the <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> backed by various types of consumer loans, such as credit cards and student loans, to help unfreeze the consumer debt market.

50|$|A {{security}} interest {{is a type}} of property interest created by agreement or by operation of law over assets to secure the performance of an obligation, usually the payment of a debt. It gives the beneficiary <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> interest certain preferential rights in the disposition of secured assets. Such rights vary according to the type <b>of</b> <b>security</b> interest, but in most cases, a <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> interest is entitled to seize, and usually sell, the property to discharge the debt that the {{security interest}} secures.|$|R
6000|$|Some {{years had}} passed since Ralph's prophecy had come true, and Perry and the {{remaining}} Blackwoods had been [...] "relieved" [...] of the Boyne Street line. The process need not be gone into in detail, being the time-honoured one employed in the Ribblevale affair of [...] "running down" [...] the line, or perhaps {{it would be better to}} say [...] "showing it up." [...] It had not justified its survival in our efficient days, it had held out--thanks to Perry--with absurd and anachronous persistence against the inevitable consolidation. Mr. Tallant's newspaper had published many complaints of the age and scarcity of the cars, etc.; and alarmed <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities,</b> in whose vaults they had lain since time immemorial, began to sell.... I saw little of Perry in those days, as I have explained, but one day I met him in the Hambleton Building, and he was white.|$|R

50|$|The United States had {{initiated}} {{a ban on}} loans to Mexico in 1921, and had put the repudiation of Article 27 as its condition for lifting the ban.

50|$|Incidentally, {{abnormally}} {{low rates}} injure endowed {{institutions such as}} Universities, which derive their income from interest.

40|$|The decade {{which has}} just closed {{witnessed}} many trying years for railroads and their security holders. The unprecedented number of reorganization proceedings instituted in those ten years, together with various remedial proposals, tended to focus public attention on their problems. These problems necessarily involve the legal framework within which the railroad industry is carried on, an important segment {{of which is the}} long term lease. Railroad history has been such that in earlier periods of financial stress the mortgage device has played the conspicuous role, while the part of the lease has been relatively obscure. Between 1930 and 1940, however, with an increasing number of important lessee railroads in reorganization under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act or in equity, the lease began to take on greater significance. As a consequence, today many lessees in financial difficulties are realizing that the farreaching changes which have occurred in transportation may turn the long term lease into a snare and a delusion. Others, still solvent, are exercising greater care in making new leases, and seeking ways and means to modify existing ones. At the same time, <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> <b>of</b> lessor companies in many instances are experiencing the acute distress attendant upon the discovery that their securities, hitherto regarded as 2 ̆ 2 gilt-edged, 2 ̆ 2 may be worth little more than the paper upon which they are printed...|$|R

40|$|We explore {{whether a}} Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) {{is likely to}} correct the market {{failures}} that {{have contributed to the}} financial crisis, to what extent FTT succeeds in raising revenues, and how the FTT compares to alternative taxes in terms of efficiency.
