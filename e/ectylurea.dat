Others include apronal (apronalide), capuride, and <b>ectylurea.</b> As the barbiturates are basically cyclic ureas, these drugs are structurally and mechanistically related to them. The phenylureides are also closely related to the hydantoins, such as phenytoin, and may be considered ring-opened analogues of them.|$|E
