40|$|The {{potential}} {{utility of}} monomolecular layers ('monolayers') and other surface film {{materials for the}} reduction of open water evaporation has long been argued. However, outside the laboratory, trials to quantify the effectiveness of artificial surface films have produced highly variable results after application to water surfaces, whether natural water bodies or managed farm storages. This paper briefly reviews the physical mechanisms involved in evaporation suppression and the biophysical literature on aquatic surface microlayers. The wide-ranging results from sixteen months of outdoor trough-scale and (simultaneous) replicated bucket-scale evaporation reduction trials are interpreted using biophysical measurements made on microlayer and immediate subsurface water samples taken from the experimental troughs. When the prevailing environmental conditions and other ancillary measurements are taken into account, plausible hypotheses arise to account {{for at least some}} of the observed trial-to-trial differences in evaporation reduction and surface film performance. Results for the commercial monolayer product are inconclusive, as the concentration of the active ingredient in its formulation lacked the uniformity required for the accuracy at which these trials were conducted. Results for the temperature differential between open (unprotected) water and film-covered water, and the influence of windspeed on evaporative loss, indicate that the mechanism of evaporation suppression for mono-molecular (monolayer) organic films differs from that for thicker silicone oil films. These results have implications for both small-scale trialling of <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppressants</b> and the deployment and management of artificial surface film materials on agricultural water storages. In addition, it concluded that despite the attractiveness of simple side-by-side comparisons of performance, meaningful interpretation of results must consider prevailing meteorological conditions, and a timescale of hours rather than days. ...|$|E
40|$|Evaporation from a {{precipitation}} gauge {{can cause}} {{errors in the}} amount of measured precipitation. For automated weighing-bucket gauges, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) suggests the use of evaporative suppressants and frequent observations to limit these biases. However, the use of <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppressants</b> is not always feasible due to environmental hazards and the added cost of maintenance, transport, and disposal of the gauge additive. In addition, research has suggested that evaporation prior to precipitation may affect precipitation measurements from auto-recording gauges operating at sub-hourly frequencies. For further evaluation, a field campaign was conducted to monitor evaporation and its impacts on the quality of precipitation measurements from gauges used at U. S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) stations. Two Geonor gauges were collocated, with one gauge using an evaporative suppressant (referred to as Geonor-NonEvap) and the other with no suppressant (referred to as Geonor-Evap) to evaluate evaporative losses and evaporation biases on precipitation measurements. From June to August, evaporative losses from the Geonor-Evap gauge exceeded accumulated precipitation, with an average loss of 0. 12 mm h − 1. The impact of evaporation on precipitation measurements was sensitive to the choice of calculation method. In general, the pairwise method that utilized a longer time series to smooth out sensor noise was more sensitive to gauge evaporation (− 4. 6 % bias with respect to control) than the weighted-average method that calculated depth change over a smaller window (<+ 1 % bias). These results indicate that while climate and gauge design affect gauge evaporation rates, computational methods also influence the magnitude of evaporation biases on precipitation measurements. This study can be used to advance quality insurance (QA) techniques used in other automated networks to mitigate the impact of evaporation biases on precipitation measurements...|$|E
40|$|Self-assembling {{thin films}} known as monolayers have been {{identified}} as an effective and inexpensive solution to mitigate the evaporative loss of water from dams and reservoirs. A typical monolayer molecule consists of a hydrocarbon chain that is hydrophobic, and a hydrophilic headgroup with a strong affinity to water. When applied to water, these amphiphilic molecules quickly spread across the surface and assemble into a one-molecule thick film that constitutes a physical barrier to evaporation. Previously, field trials of these materials were conducted to assess their efficacy, and while some evaporation suppression was observed, their overall performance was considered poor, especially in the presence of wind. A new generation of monolayer materials have been proposed with the aim of increasing their robustness to the deleterious effects of wind, and to increase their overall evaporation mitigation properties. Computational modelling techniques such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) used in this thesis allow us to observe the interactions occurring at the monolayer/water interface at the atomistic level. We can then relate molecular structural and interaction properties with experimental observables such as evaporation resistance and monolayer stability. Monolayers of octadecanoic acid (C 18 OOH) were previously proposed as an evaporation suppressant, demonstrating strong evaporation resistance under laboratory conditions. However, they were found to be ineffective in the external environment. We undertook MD simulations on this monolayer using the validated OPLS force field to establish its lack of efficacy at the molecular level. We found that although C 18 OOH was able to form close packed monolayers, it was unable to anchor to the water subphase via hydrogen bonding. This was followed by a more comprehensive comparative MD study on several possible <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppressants.</b> We were able to relate atomistic structural and chemical properties with experimental evaporation suppression and wind resistance. Specifically, we found that effective material must be able to form a tightly packed monolayer over a wide range of surface pressures, while maintaining strong anchoring to the water subphase via hydrogen bonding. We found that ethylene glycol-monooctadecyl-ether (C 18 E 1) was the only monolayer molecule to meet this criteria. Multi-component monolayers have demonstrated higher than expected evaporation mitigation performance and we have conducted MD simulations in order to identify the underlying mechanism. C 18 E 1 was blended with octadecanol (C 18 OH) at a range of different ratios, and its evaporation suppressing performance was observed to dramatically increase around ratios of 1 : 1. MD simulations showed that the uneven surface geometry of the mixed monolayer encourages the formation of water-ether oxygen hydrogen bonds, which is not possible in pure octadecanol and negligible in pure C 18 E 1. The additional hydrogen bonding increases anchoring of the monolayer to the water, and explains the improvement in performance of these mixtures. The work performed in this thesis has provided for the first time, a molecular level understanding of the structural and dynamical features of water evaporation suppressing monolayers. Based on this we have also made a significant contribution {{to the development of the}} fundamental requirements for the design of stable and efficient material for water evaporation mitigation...|$|E
40|$|The novel duolayer system, {{comprising}} a monolayer of {{ethylene glycol}} monooctadecyl ether (C 18 E 1) and the water-soluble polymer poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), {{has been shown}} to resist forces such as wind stress to a greater degree than the C 18 E 1 monolayer alone. This paper reports all-atom molecular dynamics simulations comparing the monolayer (C 18 E 1 alone) and duolayer systems under an applied force parallel to the air/water interface. The simulations show that, due to the presence of PVP at the interface, the duolayer film exhibits an increase in chain tilt, ordering, and density, as well as a lower lateral velocity compared to the monolayer. These results provide a molecular rationale for the improved performance of the duolayer system under wind conditions, as well as an atomic-level explanation for the observed efficacy of the duolayer system as an <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppressant,</b> which may serve as a useful guide for future development for thin films where resistance to external perturbation is desirable.

40|$|Extensive {{greenhouse}} {{experiments were}} conducted to evaluate chemicals not previously studied extensively for their potential as <b>evaporation</b> <b>suppressants.</b> Included in the studies were crude oil, anionics, cationics, nonionics, silicones, polysaccharide-gum mixtures, oil-latex mixtures, fatty alcohols, and reflectance materials. Of these compounds, only crude oil and crude oil-cationic mixtures were effective in suppressing soil water evaporation significantly when applied to smooth Olton loam wet soil surfaces. The cationics apparently acted as a bond between the cation exchange capacity of the soil. Rates of crude oil studies were 473 l/ha (50 gal/acre) to 9460 l/ha (1000 gal/acre). In some cases the crude oil affected emergence of tomatoes and onions, but {{did not affect the}} emergence of cucumbers. More extensive studies were conducted in controlled environment facilities to determine the mechanisms of suppression by crude oil and to delineate the influence of various soil surfaces and environmental parameters on the effectiveness of the crude oil-treated surfaces. Rates studied included 946, 2038, and 4730 l/ha (100, 300, and 500 gal/acre). Two mechanisms of suppression are apparently involved when crude oil is applied to a smooth wet soil surface. Immediately following application, the mechanism is the same as that when oil is applied to a free water surface. Following this an increase in evaporation occurs, but the rate is much less than that from an untreated soil surface indicating the formation of a barrier which slows down the movement of liquid water to the soil surface. The crude oil was most effective on smooth wet soil surfaces and least effective on rough dry surfaces. Crude oil-treated surfaces were effective against wind speeds up to 6. 5 m/sec (15 mph) for 3 - 4 days at rates as low as 946 l/ha (100 gal/acre). As soil temperature was increased from 10 ? C. to 38 ? C., crude oil-treated surfaces were less effective in suppressing evaporation due to the increased vapor pressure of the soil water. Varying the light intensity from 0. 15 to 0. 60 Langleys/min did not influence the evaporation from crude oil surfaces in the controlled environment chamber. This is not surprising since it is net radiation, not solar radiation, which {{is a part of the}} energy balance. As was expected, the evaporation losses increased as the vapor pressure deficit of the air was increased from both the untreated and crude oil-treated surfaces. Field studies to evaluate the practical potential of crude oil in the field were disappointing. Crude oil was sprayed at the rate of 2838 l/ha (300 gal/acre) and floated at rates of 473 to 1892 l/ha (50 to 200 gal/acre) on the surface of irrigation water to apply it to soil surfaces in cotton during the growing season. A savings of moisture due to the application of crude oil was noted. However, there was no consistent increase in the yield of cotton. Crude oil appears to be an effective evaporation suppressant when applied to a smooth wet soil surface. Further, it is most effective immediately after water applications when the soil water evaporation rate is the highest, and the most economical material reported to date ($ 3 - $ 18 per acre or $. 06 a gallon for material). However, the application of crude oil to a smooth wet soil surface immediately following water applications is a major problem. During the field studies, it was noted that rain failed to penetrate the crude oil surface when the land was sloping. This finding is being investigated in another project on the use of crude oil as an aid in water harvesting...|$|E
