50|$|The Sydney Heads (also simply {{known as}} the <b>Heads)</b> <b>are</b> a series of {{headlands}} that form the 2 km entrance to Sydney Harbour in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché <b>head</b> <b>was</b> raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the <b>head</b> <b>was</b> shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The <b>head</b> <b>was</b> then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} Macrinus dispatched his Praetorian prefect Ulpius Julianus to {{the region}} with a contingent of troops he considered strong enough to crush the rebellion. However, this force soon joined the faction of Elagabalus when, during the battle, they turned on their own commanders. The officers were killed and Julianus' <b>head</b> <b>was</b> {{sent back to the}} emperor.|$|E

5|$|The Barra Head Lighthouse, {{built by}} Robert Stevenson, has {{operated}} since 1833.

The rough seas that surround the island {{have been used to}} test prototype lifeboats.|$|E
5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the head has long been debated, and has resulted in several scientific analyses. The most notable and detailed of these was Karl Pearson and Geoffrey Morant's study conducted in the 1930s, which concluded that the Wilkinson <b>head</b> <b>was</b> that of Cromwell. Rumours and conspiracy theories have circulated since Cromwell's head fell from Westminster Hall.|$|E
5|$|The <b>head</b> <b>was</b> {{conclusively}} seen on Westminster Hall {{as late as}} 1684, {{and it was on}} {{the south}} side of the Hall. Archaeological evidence also disproved its authenticity. The skull was pierced from the top, not from the bottom; and the skull had no trace of skin or hair, showing it had never been embalmed.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} the La Cobata <b>head</b> <b>was</b> not a major archaeological site {{and it is likely}} that the <b>head</b> <b>was</b> either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination. Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished, such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base. Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads, and does not narrow towards the base. Large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail. The right hand earspool also appears incomplete; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief, probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished. The La Cobata <b>head</b> <b>was</b> almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne.|$|E
5|$|The third game, Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within, {{known in}} Japan as Clock Tower: Ghost <b>Head,</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in Japan in 1998 and North America in 1999.

5|$|There were {{a number}} of {{development}} schemes for the head including a major railway and docks scheme proposed in 1885, proposals for housing and a golf course were also put forward before World War I, though none of these schemes came to fruition. In 1919 the <b>head</b> <b>was</b> sold by Sir George Meyrick to Harry Gordon Selfridge with plans to construct a grand house. These plans also came to nothing, apart from the establishment of a nursery garden. Bournemouth Borough Council purchased the head in 1930 for £25,200; although plans for housing existed west of double dykes, the head itself was to be kept as public open space. During World War II the <b>head</b> <b>was</b> closed to the public and was occupied by the army, becoming home to a number of installations including a radar station. The area was also extensively mined. The <b>head</b> <b>was</b> finally cleared of the military defences by the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight <b>head</b> <b>was</b> much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight <b>head</b> <b>was</b> easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake <b>head</b> <b>was</b> created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them.

Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from coaching, Headley remained associated with cricket, presenting awards and playing in friendly matches.
