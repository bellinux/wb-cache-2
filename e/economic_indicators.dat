5|$|Despite these <b>economic</b> <b>indicators,</b> the Budget {{presented}} in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education. Treasury officials had advised {{a series of}} tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes {{to the cost of}} posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November. He also announced additional spending to help the private sector.|$|E
5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in <b>economic</b> <b>indicators,</b> it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II and {{the large}} {{adjustment}} as the economy adjusted from wartime to peacetime in 1945, the collection of many <b>economic</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as unemployment and GDP, became standardized. Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions because of these available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, unemployment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (after 1948). Note that the unemployment rate often reaches a peak associated with a recession after the recession has officially ended.|$|E

The report cited a number of <b>economic</b> <b>indicators</b> to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended {{due to lack of}} access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed {{with tens of thousands of}} laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 <b>economic</b> <b>indicators</b> were {{signalling}} {{the onset of}} a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall {{in the cost of}} living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E
