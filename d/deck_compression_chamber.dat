40|$|SUMMARY The {{conditions}} of helium saturation diving promote {{the proliferation of}} Gram-negative bacterial species in the external auditory meatus of divers. These changes in flora occurred {{in the absence of}} operational diving, that is, no contact with water. The colonising bacteria were auto-genous in origin and cross-colonisation was observed between divers. On return to normal atmos-pheric conditions the aural flora became predominantly Gram-positive again within 48 hours. The slow return to normal pressures by deep-sea divers, necessary to avoid decompression sickness, restricts the period that can be maintained at depth. This problem is overcome by the saturation diving technique whereby the divers are maintained at high pressure in their living quarters and are transported to the sea bed in a detachable diving bell. The com-pression chamber and transfer chamber are anchored to the deck of an oil production platform, and the diving bell is detached and winched down to the required depth. On reaching the depth where they are to work, the divers leave the diving bell through a hatch and, on completion of their work, return to the bell, which is then raised to the platform and locked on to the parent compression chamber complex. Other divers in the compression chamber can then transfer to the bell and work can continue under-water in shifts. The <b>deck</b> <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> is fitted out with toilets, showers, beds, and life-support systems in general, allowing divers to recuperate between shifts. Food and other items are passed into, or removed from, the chamber through a small pressure-locked transfer port. A team of six divers in such a system could work, rest, and sleep for up to three months at a time in this artificial environment. The atmosphere within the chambers has a main-tained partial pressure of oxygen of around 0 3 to 0 - 35 atmospheres. The carbon dioxide level is not allowed to exceed 0 - 005 atmospheres. The pressure of the atmosphere has to be increased to an equiva-lence of the pressure at which the work has to be performed. The steady partial pressure of oxygen is maintained by adding increasing amounts of helium to the breathing mixture. It is necessary to maintai...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the general}} {{geometrical}} model of scroll <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> for scroll fluid machine, the geometric characteristics of scroll <b>compression</b> <b>chamber,</b> such as width, length, volume, and comprehensive curvature radius at the mesh point, and their variation as well are comprehensively analyzed. It is shown by the analysis that among all of the geometric characteristics, the width variation is the most complicated one; the comprehensive variation of the width together with the length {{can be used to}} determine the deformation processes of the chamber. The variability of its length, volume, and comprehensive curvature radius at meshing points should be taken as its basic deformation characteristics. For a scroll <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> with involute of circle, its deformation efficiency is higher and dynamic stability is excellent. At the same time, the scroll wrap with involute of circle is easy to fabricate and the profile with involute of circle is used widely for the major part of the scroll profile...|$|R

40|$|The <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> of a {{hermetic}} {{reciprocating compressor}} is, normally, formed by a cylinder and a piston which present a constant clearance during the piston displacement inside the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber.</b> This configuration {{has the advantage}} of a good sealing, however, during the most part of compression, the pressure difference between <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> and internal compressor ambient is small enough to not provide any leakage from chamber to internal ambient. In this situation, during the most part of compression process, the sealing efficiency is not necessary, but the high viscous friction, due the small clearance between piston and cylinder, generates a considerable waste of energy by viscous friction. This article presents an analysis about a geometric proposal for the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> that guarantees small clearance, necessary to the correct sealing of compressed gas, in a small region near the upper piston position. The second part of <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> is characterized by an increasing in the piston-cylinder clearance along the chamber length. The motivation for this configuration is to provide the adequate sealing only in the region where the leakage process is crucial to compressor performance, furthermore, the clearance growth provides a reduction on viscous friction between piston and cylinder, and both effects generate an expressive increase in the coefficient of performance. (number of transfer units), the thermal-hydraulic characteristics (friction factor and Colburn j-factor), and the operating conditions (heat transfer duty, core velocity, coil surface temperature, and fluid properties) is derived. It is shown that for heat exchanger with constant wall temperature (i. e., condensers and evaporators), there does exist a particular number of transfer units which minimizes the dimensionless rate of entropy generation. An algebraic expression for the optimum heat exchanger effectiveness, based on the working conditions, heat exchanger geometry and fluid properties, is also presented. The theoretical analysis led to the conclusion that a high effectiveness heat exchanger does not necessarily provide the best thermal-hydraulic design...|$|R

The reason for inserting metal foam in the compressor is to reduce the temperature rise of the gas during compression, since a higher temperature rise leads to more input work being converted into internal energy, which is wasted during the storage period as the compressed gas cools.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{hermetic}} compressors for household refrigeration, one {{important part of the}} overall efficiency of the machine comes from a good thermal efficiency of the discharge manifold. It is desired that the heat generated during the compression process and accumulated by the gas in the discharge chamber does not return to the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> walls.

Current technologies like on/off and variable velocity compressors, normally make use of metallic parts in the discharge chamber, such parts having high thermal conduction coefficients making them less efficient.

40|$|The {{performance}} of reciprocating compressors is usually evaluated under steady-state operating conditions defined in standards.

The model is formed by the coupling of two sub models, one for the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> {{and the other to}} calculate the temperatures and mass flow rates in components other than the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber.</b> As the model only simulates the compressor, experimental data was required to provide input from the remaining components of the system.

40|$|The pressure-density {{relationship}} {{and the pressure}} distribution inside the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> of a newly designed New Holland BB 960 large square baler were studied for the baling of alfalfa, whole green barley, barley straw, and wheat straw. An analytical model was developed for the pressure distribution inside the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> of the large square baler in the x-, y-, and z-directions by assuming isotropic linear elastic properties for forage materials. In order to validate this model, a tri-axial sensor was designed and {{used to measure the}} forces inside the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> when whole green barley, barley straw, and wheat straw were baled. The experimental results proved that the developed analytical model for each of the tested forage materials had a good correlation with the experimental data with a reasonable coefficient of determination (0. 95) and standard error (20. 0 kPa). Test data were also used to develop an empirical model for the pressure distribution inside the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> of the baler for each of the tested forage materials using least square method in regression analysis. These empirical models were simple equations which were only functions of the distance from the full extension point of the plunger along the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> length. Analytical and empirical models were also developed for the pressure-density relationship of the baler for baling alfalfa and barley straw. Results showed that bale density initially decreased with distance from the plunger, and then remained almost constant up {{to the end of the}} <b>compression</b> <b>chamber.</b> The developed empirical model for both alfalfa and barley straw was a combination of a quadratic and an exponential equation. In order to validate the developed models, field tests were performed by baling alfalfa and barley straw of different moisture contents, flake sizes, and load settings. The forces on the plunger arms were recorded by a data acquisition system. The actual bale bulk density was calculated by measuring the bale dimensions and weight. Results showed that both load setting and flake size had a significant effect on the plunger force. The plunger force increased with increased load setting and flake size. Comparing analytical and empirical models for bale density as a function of the pressure on the plunger showed that the trend of variation of density with pressure in both models was similar, but the rate of change was different. The variation rate of density with pressure in the analytical model was higher than that of the empirical model. The analytical model underestimated the bale density at low plunger pressures but showed more accurate prediction at higher pressures, while the empirical model accurately predicted the bale density at both low and high pressures. Some crop properties such as coefficient of friction and modulus of elasticity were determined for the development of the pressure distribution model. Results showed that static coefficient of friction of alfalfa on a polished steel surface was a quadratic function of material moisture content, while the relationship between the coefficient of friction of barley straw on a polished steel surface and material moisture content was best expressed by a linear equation. Results of this study also proved that modulus of elasticity of alfalfa and barley straw was constant for the density range encountered in the large square baler...|$|R
