40|$|Three simple, {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} spectrofluorimetric and spectrophotometric methods were developed and validated {{for analysis of}} <b>idrocilamide</b> (Idro) in presence of its hydrolytic and oxidative degradants. The first method is based on reaction of Idro with 7 -Chloro- 4 -Nitrobenz- 2 -Oxa- 1, 3 -Diazole (NBD-Cl) resulting {{in the formation of}} highly fluorescent product which was measured at 535 nm (λex 460 nm). The high sensitivity of the method allowed its successful application to the analysis of Idro in spiked human plasma. The second method is based on charge transfer complex formation of the drug with iodine in dichloromethane. The reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 365 nm. The third method is based on the reaction of carboxylic acid group of hydrolytic degradant of Idro with a mixture of potassium iodate and iodide to form yellow colored product showing maximum absorbance at 350 nm. Under optimized experimental conditions, Beer’s law is obeyed in the concentration ranges of 1 – 10, 50 – 500, and 25 – 250 μg mL- 1, with limits of detection; 0. 05, 4. 50 and 1. 72 μg mL- 1 for methods 1, 2 and 3 respectively. All the methods have been applied to the determination of Idro in pharmaceutical dosage form. The proposed methods could be applied for quality control analysis of idrocilamid...|$|E
