It regularly paid tribute and sent gifts (pīškeš) to the shah in the form of boys and girls for use as slaves; horses; and wines. In 1747 the Shah of Persia, Nader Shah was assassinated. Capitalizing on the eruption of instability Teimuraz II and his son Erekle II, who had been given the kingship of Kartli and Kakheti respectively by Nader Shah himself as a reward for their loyalty, declared de facto independence. After Teimuraz II's death in 1762, Erekle II assumed control over Kartli, thus unifying the two into the short-lived Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti. Following the Treaty of Georgievsk (1783) and Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar's brief re-occupation of eastern Georgia, the Kingdom of Kartl-Kakheti was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1801. Russian control over Kartli-Kakheti was finalized with Qajar Iran by the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813.|$|E

25|$|In 1637, Grandmaster Giovanni Paolo Lascaris {{set out to}} levy a tax of 50,000 scudi on the Maltese for the {{construction}} of the Floriana Lines. The Grandmaster ignored a protest against the tax by the Maltese clergy, lodged with Pope Urban VIII. The Pope sided with the Order against the laity and the clergy, and the Grandmaster ordered taxmen to start their collections. The tax collectors met immediately with opposition and an uprising began in September in Żejtun, the first village where collection was attempted. The leaders hoped to assemble the people at Marsa, then to march on Valletta as a procession with a cross or some statue of a saint. The parish priest of Żejtun was alarmed at these preparations, particularly the suggestions to bear arms in the protest, and informed Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa. The Bishop sent the priest to the inquisitor, Fabio Chigi, later Pope Alexander VII, who ordered him to report <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grandmaster. The latter imprisoned the lay leaders of the revolt. Acting on Chigi's advice, the grandmaster did not arrest local priests, even if there were suspicions they were involved in the revolt.|$|E
