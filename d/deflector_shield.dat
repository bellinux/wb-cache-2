500|$|Around this time, the Romulans {{attack the}} Enterprise, and the Vendorian—realizing that his actions have placed {{the ship in}} danger—decides to betray his Romulan masters for love. He {{takes the form of}} the Enterprises main <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> and the Romulans retreat. The Vendorian is arrested and would face trial but Kirk informs him that his actions to protect the Enterprise would be taken into consideration. Nored informs the Vendorian that it is very similar to Winston in {{personality}} and she offers to return to Earth with the alien. When Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy (voiced by DeForest Kelley) jokes that if the Vendorian had turned himself into a second Spock [...] "it would have been too much to take", Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) quickly replies that [...] "two Dr. McCoys just might bring the level of medical efficiency on this ship to acceptable levels." ...|$|E

5000|$|Other force fields, in {{the form}} of large or small scale <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> are {{particle}} <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> also known as [...] "magnetic shields".|$|R
50|$|Spherical energy <b>shields,</b> such as <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> provide {{many types}} of {{protection}} when in outer space. These include protection from space debris and protection of atmospheric conditions from outer space vacuum, both seen on larger spacecraft and the second Death Star.|$|R
50|$|The Captain {{determined}} the strategy, the Engineer {{was responsible for}} power management and allocation to different systems such as weapons and shields, the Helmsman for firing weapons, the Navigator for managing <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> the Communications Officer for damage control and so on.|$|R
50|$|Alf - An ancient {{race that}} had great {{technology}} and created deities and Valkyries. The crystals named receptor are buried on their foreheads. They can control ancient scientific devices called relics including orbital weaponry, laser sword and <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> by using receptors.|$|E
50|$|The game is {{particularly}} difficult, as the player only has three lives and two continues (activated with enough Force points), and Luke dies upon touching an enemy. The Millennium Falcon and the X-Wing can sustain only one hit before being destroyed, {{which can be}} prevented by using one of three <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> bursts.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, physics {{students}} at the University of Leicester developed a module of plasma-based deflector shields, inspired by the ones in Star Wars and other science fiction stories. However, the field poses some issues. One issue is that the <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> {{would have to be}} much stronger to repel than to hold the plasma in position. Another is that the shield would deflect electromagnetic energy, including light. This would make it impossible for someone inside the shield to see anything.|$|E
50|$|In the Star Trek fictional universe, shields {{refer to}} a 23rd and 24th century {{technology}} that provides starships, space stations, and entire planets with limited protection against damage. They are {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>deflectors,</b> <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> and screens (the latter during Star Trek: The Original Series).|$|R
30|$|Almost 10  years {{after the}} first fatal burst, the seventh {{longwall}} panel was being retreated at Mine A under almost 840  m of cover (MSHA 2006). Bounces were common along the longwall face, ranging from thumps in the roof or floor to coal being blown from the face. These events occurred all along the longwall face, but were most common near the headgate and tailgate entries. “Bounce procedures” were in place to protect the workers by limiting access to the face when the shearer was near the gate entries and specifying that shearer operators should position themselves behind the 8  m long <b>deflector</b> <b>shields</b> mounted above the shearer. The <b>deflector</b> <b>shields</b> were hinged off the shearer frame to be lowered or raised to accommodate mining clearance. In addition, expanded metal guards were attached to the armored face conveyor periodically along the walkway, and sheets of conveyor belting were suspended {{from the bottom of}} shield canopies along the walkway.|$|R
50|$|In Star Trek: The Role Playing Game, {{produced}} by FASA, players actually had individual bridge functions during combat. This {{at one point}} became a separate game known as Starship Tactical Combat Simulator. The Captain determined the strategy, the Engineer was responsible for power management and allocation to different systems such as weapons and shields, the Helmsman for firing weapons, the Navigator for managing <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> the Communications Officer for damage control and so on.|$|R
50|$|When in service, {{the vehicle}} is driven by {{hydraulic}} transmission which is also using the flail and lifting or lowering an armoured-steel-made <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> between the flail and vehicle. The flail rotating speed can be infinitely adjusted between 0-500 rpm. The armoured cabin contains seats for the driver and commander and is designed with NBC protection and to withstand a 10 kg explosion under the vehicle. The armour protects against 7.62 calibre bullets. A 2061 VHF radio is for communication. The wheels are mine and bullet resistant. There is an option to mount a 12.7-calibre machine gun. A self-recovery winch is fitted as standard.|$|E
50|$|In fictional works, a force field, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} an energy shield, force shield, defence shield or <b>deflector</b> <b>shield,</b> is a barrier made of energy or particles. It protects a person, area, or object from attacks or intrusions. This fictional technology is created as a field of energy without mass {{that acts as a}} wall, so that objects affected by the particular force relating to the field are unable to pass through the field and reach the other side. This concept has become a staple of many science-fiction works, so much so that authors frequently do not even bother to explain or justify them to their readers treating them almost as established fact.|$|E
50|$|Jamie and Zoe get back, and Flannigan {{takes them}} to the control room. He is {{overwhelmed}} by Leo and Enrico Casali, the communications officer, and his conditioning is broken. The Doctor is cornered in the powerhouse by the two Cybermen and they reveal their plans to him. When they try to destroy him, he electrocutes one. A large group of Cybermen start spacewalking towards the Wheel. Jamie and Flannigan go to the loading bay and free Vallance from cyber-control. Flannigan uses quick-setting plastic in a fire extinguisher to kill the last Cyberman and then turns on the <b>deflector</b> <b>shield,</b> which deflects the Cybermen into space. The Doctor uses the time vector generator to boost {{the power of the}} x-ray laser and destroys the advancing Cybership.|$|E
25|$|All flight {{takes place}} in space; the player does not {{encounter}} gravity or atmospheric effects. The starfighters are equipped with recharging laser weapons and limited warheads. The player controls power allocation between lasers, <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> and engines. Charging the lasers and shields slows the player's craft, giving effective power management {{an important role in}} gameplay. The player can toggle the firing mode (separate or linked) of each weapon type, and balance the shields forward, aft, or evenly.|$|R
5000|$|Registry: ISS Enterprise (NX-01)Class: NXService: 2150sCaptains: Maximilian Forrest (Vaughn Armstrong), Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula)The Star Trek: Enterprise episode [...] "In a Mirror, Darkly" [...] {{features}} a Mirror Universe version of NX-01 Enterprise. This ship {{is equipped with}} a cloaking device, <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> a tractor beam, a prototype agony booth, and different exterior markings. It is commanded by Captain Maximilian Forrest, although for a brief time his first officer, Commander Jonathan Archer, takes command following a mutiny. This Enterprise is destroyed by the Tholians.|$|R
50|$|The landing party {{returns to}} the ship, and Kirk orders a pursuit of the cloud at Warp 8. The ship gives chase, but Chief Engineer Scott doubts the Enterprise can sustain the high speeds for long. Kirk orders a {{reduction}} of speed, and the entity slows as well. Kirk orders battle stations as the entity cloud comes into range and gives the order to fire their weapons. The phasers and photon torpedoes pass through the being. Not only do the weapons have no effect, but neither do the <b>deflector</b> <b>shields</b> - the creature passes through the ship's hull and into the ventilation system.|$|R
5000|$|The Thirdspace {{aliens are}} large, octopus-like creatures. Little {{is known about}} the species, but they appear to be {{powerful}} telepaths. The aliens also have a concept they call [...] "The One." [...] It is not clear if this {{is the leader of the}} aliens, their deity, or perhaps a unified race consciousness. Their philosophy is that they are the only ones worthy of existence. Thirdspace aliens are older than the Vorlons (perhaps even older than The Shadows) and possess fearsomely advanced technology. Their single-occupant fighters fire powerful fireball batteries that can cripple White Star ships with a single hit, and their warships are large cannons wrapping orb-like power sources. They are also the only species in any universe known to possess <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> technology.|$|E
50|$|When {{the device}} is finally reactivated, the Thirdspace aliens stream out from the portal in small fighters and begin a devastating assault on Babylon 5, obliterating large cruisers with little effort; the Thirdspace fleet is so {{advanced}} that the single-occupant fighters possess <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> technology, making them extremely hard to destroy. The violent behavior of the individuals under the artifact's control is intended to disrupt the station's defenses. The struggle is ended when Sheridan enters the artifact via flight suit to plant and later detonate a thermonuclear device, destroying the artifact just as {{the first wave of}} Thirdspace heavy warships begin to emerge. Once destroyed, the telepathic influence stops and the station returns to normal. Trent, shaken by {{the way in which the}} artifact affected her, turns over her final report and goes on an indefinite hiatus.|$|E

5000|$|The Franklin uses {{polarized}} {{hull plating}} instead of <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> {{as well as}} pulsed phase cannons and conventional spatial torpedoes instead of the phasers and photon torpedoes of later starships. [...] It also is equipped with 22nd century cargo transporters that were certified for transport of cargo only. Commander Scott is able to modify the transporter system so that the Franklin can then beam lifeforms safely. Initially Commander Spock and Dr Leonard McCoy are transported separately to avoid a possible mixing before Scott's further modifications allow mass beaming which is then used to rescue {{the rest of the}} stranded Starfleet crew.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of force}} fields in the Star Wars {{universe}} is documented both in the main films of the Star Wars saga and in spin-off media, such as The Clone Wars, {{as well as other}} media adaptations. The usage of force fields in Star Wars serve different purposes, one main purpose being to deflect strikes by lasers, explosions, and similar attacks. Some examples of these in Star Wars films are the mention of force-field-based <b>deflector</b> <b>shields</b> on the Millennium Falcon and Imperial Star Destroyer, and, on a grand, semi-planetary scale, on the second Death Star in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.|$|R
25|$|The game {{preserves}} many of {{the core}} features of the Halo franchise's gameplay experience. Players step into the MJOLNIR powered armor of a Spartan and control that character's actions. MJOLNIR armor provides <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> which diminish whilst protecting the wearer from weapons fire but recharge after a short recovery. Spartans may only carry two personal weapons at a time, but may swap them out at any time for any other weapon (including those dropped by slain enemies) and may also carry and fire a crew-served weapon (discarded when the player switches back to a personal weapon). Spartans may also throw grenades and use their weapons for pistol-whipping. Finally, some of the vehicles and their mounted weapons are available for use.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} {{version of}} the aircraft, the Ca.135 Tipo Peru ("Peruvian Type"), had more powerful engines—Isotta Fraschini Asso XI R.C.40 Spinto ("Driven") engines, uprated versions of the Isotta Fraschini R.C.40 Asso delivering 559 kilowatts (750 horsepower) at sea level and 671 kilowatts (900 horsepower) at 4,000 meters (13,123 ft) - and modified engine cowlings with additional openings to accommodate the additional air intakes of the new engines. The new engines gave the Ca.135 better performance that met the Peruvian requirements, and also allowed {{an increase in the}} aircrafts bomb load to 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds). Defensive armament was improved by the installation of a 12.7-millimeter (0.5-inch) machine gun in a semi-open dorsal turret equipped with a wind <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> to protect the gunner and another 12.7-millimeter machine gun in a retractable ventral turret. Both turrets had a 360-degree field of fire, although the ventral turret produced excessive aerodynamic drag when extended and was recommended for use only in emergencies.|$|E
5000|$|Although it was {{designed}} to be fast and highly maneuverable with powerful weaponry, the Defiant was 'overgunned and overpowered' for a vessel of its size. The ship's structural integrity field needed extensive modifications to keep the Defiant from tearing itself apart. The ship {{was designed}} specifically for battle, featuring innovative pulse-phaser cannons and quantum torpedo armaments, in addition to photon torpedoes, standard phasers and a high-capacity <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> system. Another asset is its ablative armour, enabling the ship to sustain multiple hits from enemy weapons, even with the shields inoperable, with minimal damage. Inside, the Defiant is relatively spartan by Starfleet standards of the time: the ship is not designed to carry family members, has no science labs or holodecks, and has a limited infirmary. Crew quarters consist of two bunk beds and a general computer interface. This much more sparse setup is much to Lt. Cmdr. Worf's approval, and soon after his transfer to Deep Space 9, he decides to live permanently onboard the Defiant.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the real}} World War II Western Allies, {{they are a}} {{coalition}} of the United States, Great Britain and the French Resistance. Because of this, their units are a mixture of each side, such as the British Matilda tank and American M26 Pershing. They have a technological advantage over the other factions, because their buildings are able to power themselves, {{without the need for}} power plants. They also have a superior air force that is larger, stronger and more versatile. These include aircraft such as the P-38 Lightning bomber (the only bomber capable of defending itself against interceptors) P-51 Mustang fighters and attack helicopters. The Allies also have the atomic bomb at their disposal, deployed by a Northrop YB-35 and an [...] "earthquake bomb" [...] via a Halifax bomber. The Allied experimental unit is the O.R.B. (Omni-Repulsor-Barrier), which is an APC truck with a force-field generator on the back, capable of protecting units, within its <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> range, from low to medium attacks.|$|E
50|$|Information {{given in}} the show also {{suggests}} that <b>deflector</b> <b>shields</b> were not used until the 1953 invasion, after a recon mission proved that humanity had the means of effectively damaging their machines. The limited strength of their unprotected warships is also suggested {{by the fact that}} two or more of them were downed by a militia of no more than just 38 men. Curiously, a late episode features a mysterious Martian pod found that is made of an element that is, by all accounts, virtually indestructible. The pod in question appears to have to no weaponry and can only seat a single alien. Its purpose is not given, leaving its connection to the invasion and the aliens' technological progress unknown.|$|R

5000|$|Returning to {{the planet}} Delta Vega, site of the deaths of Lt. Cmdr. Gary Mitchell and Dr. Elizabeth Dehner, Captain Kirk and {{the crew of the}} Enterprise {{encounter}} a rift of psionic energy in space, through which travels a starship of Shiar design. The ship is quickly destroyed by the spatial anomaly, though not before Spock detects that it carried seven lifeforms of [...] "near human" [...] nature. A second, larger Shiar craft comes through the rift, which promptly fires an unusual projectile at the Enterprise: Gladiator of the Shiar Imperial Guard, who warns the Enterprise away from the planet and drives his point home by striking the ships <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> causing some actual damage to the vessel as a result. (Kirk: [...] "Did he just... punch my ship?") ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{possibility}} {{of using a}} planar artificially structured boundary as a charged particle beam <b>deflector</b> <b>shield</b> is studied via classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulation. The artificially structured boundary (ASB) is formed by a planar array of permanent disk magnets with like poles facing out and creates a spatially periodic magnetostatic field. A mono-energetic beam of charged particles is incident on the ASB, and {{the conditions under which}} particles penetrate through the array are determined...|$|E
50|$|Eventually, they {{infiltrate}} the Imperial garrison and steal the Falcon, piloting {{it out into}} the ongoing Battle of Dathomir. Solo allows the Iron Fist to acquire the Falcon with a tractor beam; once it is within the <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> he breaks it free of the beam lock, piloting his vessel over the superstructure of the gigantic vessel. Arriving upon the main bridge, he launches two concussion missiles, destroying the bridge, killing Zsinj, and knocking out the ventral shields. With Iron Fist so exposed, the Hapan Battle Dragons move into position with their ion cannons, disabling Iron Fist. Defeated, Zsinj's empire soon crumbles. Shortly thereafter, Solo and Leia marry, having realized during their intrepid journey together that they loved each other. Isolder is consoled by the fact he has {{fallen in love with}} his captor, Teneniel Djo.|$|R
50|$|In Galactic Attack, the player's {{job was to}} {{liberate}} the solar system from the dreaded Kazanta invaders by destroying the Kzanta's ships and bombarding the Kzanta's forces on the planets {{of the solar system}} and then beaming down armies to secure the planets. The game's framing uses the same loose Star Trek framing as Empire; the universe is two dimensional, with the user's starship placed in the center of their tactical screen. Ships have phasers which fire in a cone, with damage proportionate to distance, a limited number of torpedoes that can be in flight at any given time and which proceed in a straight line until they hit a target or time out, <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> a range of warp speeds, and a limited energy supply that slowly automatically regenerates. Weapons were fired on compass bearings by typing in degree headings.|$|R
50|$|The weapons {{range from}} small missile rounds to MIRV warheads to high-yield nuclear weapons. All weapons can be {{upgraded}} with tracers which allow the player to more accurately adjust the trajectory on their next turn. In addition to conventional warheads, {{there is also}} such ordnance as napalm, wildly bouncing bombs, and earth weapons, allowing the player to dump dirt on other tanks or to remove ground from beneath them. A tank which is covered with dirt has to shoot itself free and may get damaged in the process; one which falls from too high a level may be destroyed. A variety of utilities, such as <b>deflector</b> <b>shields,</b> recharge batteries, and tank parachutes, make it much harder to score a kill with a single hit even with the more bizarre and advanced weapons, adding another dimension to the game's tactics.|$|R
50|$|As an {{interesting}} and innovative gameplay element, the Trailblazer cruiser can only be crippled and not destroyed. The ship also contains a view the ship's engine room, which allows the player to enhance the ship's performance by upgrading or replacing the ship's components. The engine room is split into various areas including the Spindrive FTL engine, main cannon, sublight engine, turret, and <b>deflector</b> <b>shielding.</b> These components can be destroyed in battle or {{by the use of}} the Emergency Spindrive function in order to retreat from battle and head to a safer star system to recoup and repair. If the Spindrive is running without additional components its fuel efficiency could drop {{to the point that it}} could become impossible to reach a friendly base to re-equip without running out of fuel. In this situation, the player would be forced to use the escape pod and return to main base for a replacement Trailblazer. This however would cost precious mission time.|$|R
50|$|Onufriyenko {{performed}} {{his eight}} career spacewalk on January 25, 2002 {{when he and}} NASA astronaut Daniel Bursch ventured out into space from the Pirs airlock. During the spacewalk, Onufrienko and Bursch installed six <b>deflector</b> <b>shields</b> for the Zvezda Service Module's jet thrusters. Also, they installed an amateur radio antenna. The two spacewalkers also removed an experiment called Kromka situated {{near one of the}} thruster groups and installed a virtually identical new Kromka experiment in the same place. The experiment captured material that results from thruster firings. Onufrienko and Bursch also attached a physics experiment called Platan to the Zvezda module. Platan was designed to capture low-energy heavy nuclei from the sun and from outside the solar system. In addition, they installed three materials experiments, called SKK for their Russian acronym, on the Zvezda module. The experiments examine effects of the harsh environment of space {{on a wide range of}} materials. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 59 minutes.|$|R
