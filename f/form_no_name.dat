But many doubts and uncertainties remain concerning its literary form. It is fairly easy to say what it is not. It is more difficult to know what it really is. A. Lefèvre maintains that there is no proper word to call it. This literary <b>form</b> has <b>no</b> <b>name,</b> says Dubarle. J. Steinmann and A. Barucq tend to the apocalyptical form. E. Haag classifies the book as «parabolische Geschichts-darstellung». This is the best name provided, however, that the book is not considered as pure theological dissertation. The «parable» is based on the vital experience of the Maccabees'wars of liberation. The comparison between Dan and Jdt on one hand and 1 Mac and Jdt on the other hand leads to this conclusion...|$|R
