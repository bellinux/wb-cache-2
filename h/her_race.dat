25|$|The {{following}} {{is the latest}} consensus list of the research to date. Because there was no sanctioning body for the Blue Riband, researchers are limited to surviving shipping company archives and press reports to develop the list of Blue Riband winners. These lists are retrospective, and limited to steamships only. Therefore, most lists feature Sirius, in <b>her</b> <b>race</b> with Great Western in 1838, as the first record-holder, although her crossing was not as fast as some sail packet ships of the period. Early writers including Arthur Maginnus (1892), Henry Frey (1896), Charles Lee (1931) and C. R. Benstead (1936) were the standard sources until the 1950s. Since then, C. R. Vernon Gibbs (1952), and Noel Bonsor (1975) added {{to the body of}} knowledge, with additional detail about the German ships provided by Arnold Kludas.|$|E
