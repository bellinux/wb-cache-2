This arti-cle questions the value of such a form of intervention. The potential benefits of public support to crop insurance depend upon the answers to the following ques-tions: (i) Is it true that agricultural incomes’ variability has increased in the re-cent years, following the reform of agricultural policies after Gatt and Wto agreements? (ii) Is it really true that agricultural <b>incomes</b> <b>volatility,</b> even if it is a problem, cannot be effectively managed with private instruments?

Based on an income survey from 2006 in rural Mozambique, this study assesses the seasonal contribution of different income sources to total household income. The results indicate that forest and environmental income was the second largest contributor to households’ total income next to crop income, the relative share being 23. 7 percent of total income. With regard to seasonal income contributions, wage income and other income sources (gold in particular) are important in filling the gap when income from crop production is low, although they do not completely offset the fall.

Agro-ecology and economies of Central Asia are heterogenous and very {{little is known about}} the impact of climate change at the sub-national levels. The bio-economic farm model (BEFM) is used for ex ante assessment of climate change impacts at sub-national levels in Central Asia. The BEFM is calibrated to 10 farming systems in Central Asia based on the household survey and crop growth experiment data. The production uncertainties and the adaptation options of agricultural producers to changing environments are considered paramount in the simulations. Very large differences in climate change impacts across the studied farming systems are found.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} changes in American society in the last forty years has been the decline and delay in marriage. The fraction of {{young men and women who}} have never been married increased significantly between 1970 and 2000.

Specifically, if marriage in-volves consumption commitments, then a rise in <b>income</b> <b>volatility</b> results in a delay in marriage. Marriage, however, also allows for diversification of income risk since earnings fluctuations between spouses need not be perfectly correlated. We assess our hypothesis that rising <b>income</b> <b>volatility</b> contributed to the delay in marriage vis-à-vis other explanations in the literature, using an estimated equilibrium search model of the marriage market. We find that the increase in volatility accounts for about one-third of the observed delay in marriage.

Our measure of integration exhibits rich regional variation that, when aggregated to the national level, fluctuates substantially over time. In seeking to account for this behavior, we draw in part on theoretical models that emphasize the potential role of openness to international trade, regional disparities in <b>income,</b> and inflation <b>volatility</b> in threatening economic and political integration.
