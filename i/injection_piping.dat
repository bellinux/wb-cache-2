40|$|Thermal {{stratification}} has continuously caused several piping {{failures in}} {{nuclear power plants}} since the early 1980 s. However, this critical thermal effect was not considered when the old nuclear power plants were designed. Therefore, it is urgent to evaluate this unexpected thermal effect on the structural integrity of piping systems. In this paper, the thermal effects of stratified flow in two different safety <b>injection</b> <b>piping</b> systems were investigated by using a coupled CFD-FE method. Since stratified flow is generally generated by turbulent penetration and/or valve leakage, thermal stress analyses as well as CFD analyses were carried out considering these two primary causes. Numerical {{results show that the}} most critical factor governing thermal stratification is valve leakage and that temperature distribution significantly changes according to the leakage path. In particular, in-leakage has a high possibility of causing considerable structural problems in RCS piping...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this letter is to request relief from ASME Section XI Code {{required}} examinations due to limitations which were identified in the WBN Unit 1 Cycle 5 refueling outage. These requests for relief are being submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 50. 55 a(g) (5) (iii). TVA stated in the ASME Section XI ISI Summary Report for the Fifth Refueling Cycle dated January 14, 2004, that two requests for relief were required to be written for components examined during the inspection and those requests would be submitted under separate letter. The required examination coverage could not be achieved due to configuration of the pressurizer nozzle-to-vessel welds and safety <b>injection</b> system <b>piping</b> welds. Enclosure 1 provides Request for Relief 1 -ISI- 14 for the pressurizer nozzle-to-vessel welds. Enclosure 2 provides Request for Relief 1 -ISI- 15 for the safety <b>injection</b> system <b>piping</b> welds. Pnoted on-cyCdd paper-U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commissio...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{energy market}} {{has a high}} demand of {{flexibility}} due to introduction of other intermittent renewables as wind and solar. To ensure a steady power supply, hydro turbines are often forced to operate more at part load conditions. Originally, turbines were built for steady operation around the best efficiency point. The demand of flexibility, combined with old designs has showed an increase in turbines having problems with hydrodynamic instabilities such as pressure pulsations. Different methods have been investigated to mitigate pressure pulsations. Air injection shows a significant reduction of pressure pulsation amplitudes. However, installation of air <b>injection</b> requires extra <b>piping</b> and a compressor. Investigation of other methods such as shaft extension shows promising results for some operational points, but may significantly reduce {{the efficiency of the}} turbine at other operational points. The installation of an extension of the runner cone has been investigated at NTNU by Vekve in 2004. This has resulted in a cylindrical extension at Litjfossen Power Plant in Norway, where the bolt suffered mechanical failure. This indicates high amplitude pressure pulsations in the draft tube centre. The high pressure pulsation amplitudes are believed to be related to high tangential velocity in the draft tube. The mentioned runner cone extension has further been developed to a freely rotating extension. The objective is to reduce the tangential velocity in the draft tube and thereby the pressure pulsation amplitudes...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{stimulation}} {{of an existing}} deep, hot well on the west flank of Newberry Volcano was performed {{in the fall of}} 2012 as part of the Newberry EGS Demonstration. A microseismic array of 15 stations was installed in the summer to monitor the EGS growth. Eight geophones were installed in 213 - 246 m deep boreholes, four drilled in the summer of 2012, in order to reduce noise due to scattering in the attenuating volcanic deposits near the surface. Seven surface geophones were installed to further improve locations and allow determination of source mechanisms by enhancing focal sphere coverage. Each station is equipped with a cell phone modem which sends data in real-time to an acquisition server in Seattle After onsite assembly of moderate pressure pumps and <b>piping,</b> <b>injection</b> of cold groundwater into the EGS target well head began October 17 and continued until December 7. 174 microearthquakes with moment magnitudes between 0. 0 and 2. 4 were located within 1 km of the injection well, defining the EGS reservoir. Multi-zone stimulation was carried out by injecting thermally-degradable zonal isolation materials to plug stimulated fractures and shift stimulation to new fractures. The Newberry Volcano EGS Demonstration will allow geothermal industry and academic experts to develop, validate and enhance geoscience and engineering techniques, and other procedures essential to the expansion of EGS. Successful development will demonstrate to the American public that EGS can {{play a significant role in}} reducing foreign energy dependence, and provide clean, renewable, and safe baseload geothermal power generation...|$|R
