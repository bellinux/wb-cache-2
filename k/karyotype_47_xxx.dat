40|$|Abstract Introduction To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first report of a {{comorbidity}} between Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome and <b>47</b> (<b>XXX)</b> syndrome. The clinical picture of Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome is well described, while <b>47</b> (<b>XXX)</b> syndrome is much more rare and has a broader spectrum of possible phenotypic presentations. Case presentation An Italian Caucasian girl was referred at the age of 11 to our Rehabilitation Center for anxiety and learning difficulties. The girl had already been diagnosed as having <b>47</b> (<b>XXX)</b> syndrome; she had some rather typical features of the chromosomal abnormality, but she also showed a high level of anxiety and the presence of motor and vocal tics. When an accurate history was taken, a diagnosis of Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome emerged. Conclusions The possible interaction between peculiar features of these two syndromes in terms of neuropsychological and affective functioning is both interesting for the specific case and to hypothesize models of rehabilitation for patients with one or both syndromes. Executive functions are specifically reduced in both syndromes, therefore it might be hard to discriminate the contribution of each one to the general impairment; the same applies to anxiety. Moreover, mental retardation (with a significantly lower verbal cognitive functioning) poses relevant problems when suggesting cognitive behavioral or psychoeducational rehabilitative approaches. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Turner {{syndrome}} is a chromosomal abnormality {{in which the}} majority of patients have a 45 XO karyotype, while a small number have a 45 XO/ <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> <b>karyotype.</b> Congenital adrenal hyperplasia has been previously reported in patients with Turner syndrome. Although insulinomas {{are the most common}} type of functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and have been reported in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasias, the tumors have not been reported in patients with mosaic Turner syndrome. The present study reports the first case of an insulinoma in a patient with 45 XO/ <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> mosaic Turner syndrome. The patient suffered from recurrent hypoglycemia, which was relieved following ingestion of glucose or food. A 5 -h glucose tolerance test was performed and the levels of glucose, C-Peptide and insulin were detected. In addition, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound scanning were performed to evaluate the possibility of an insulinoma. Pathological examina-tion and karyotyping were performed on a surgical specimen and a whole blood sample, respectively. The patient was found to suffer from premature ovarian failure, and a physical exami-nation was consistent with a diagnosis of Turner syndrome. An ultrasound scan demonstrated streak ovaries and the patient was found to have a 45 XO/ <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> <b>karyotype.</b> Furthermore, a lesion was detected in the pancreas following CT scanning, which was identified as an insulinoma following surgical removal and histological examination. In conclusion, the present study reports the first case of an insulinoma in a patient with mosaic Turner syndrome.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Turner Syndrome (TS) {{is caused}} by {{monosomy}} or structural abnormalities of the X chromosome, with a prevalence of about 1 / 2000 females live birth. Most important clinical features of TS are short stature and gonadal failure. Approximately one third of girls with TS may undergo spontaneous puberty. Here {{we report on the}} case of a girl with a rare 45 X 0 / <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> mosaic TS exhibiting a precocious puberty. Case report The patient was diagnosed with TS at the age of 4 years, upon a diagnostic work-up for dysmorphic features. Chromosome analysis revealed a mosaic karyotype (45 X 0 / <b>47</b> <b>XXX).</b> She presented with normal height and normal growth velocity so that Growth Hormone (GH) therapy was not started. She was referred to our Department at the age of 7 years and 10 months, because of vaginal bleeding. A physical examination revealed a Tanner stage III for breast and Tanner stage III for pubic hair development. Height and weight were within the normal range for age. Psychological evaluation showed moderate global developmental delay, together with emotional and social immaturity and reading difficulties. The growth rate was accelerated. Her bone age was 10 years. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated increased size for age of both the uterus and the ovaries, with bilateral ovarian follicles. GnRH stimulation test revealed pubertal response of gonadotropins (peak LH 22. 5 mIU/ml). MRI of the brain was normal. These clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings were consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic central precocious puberty; therefore, GnRH analog therapy was started, in order to slow pubertal progression and to preserve adult stature. Furthermore, GH treatment was added to further improve adult height. CONCLUSION: Our case highlights the possibility of precocious puberty as an atypical clinical feature of TS. Thus, precocious puberty may occur in TS girls when a dosage compensation by the cell line with more than two X chromosomes allows normal ovarian function. GnRH analog therapy in addition to GH treatment should be recommended in TS girls with precocious puberty in order to slow pubertal progression and to preserve adult stature...|$|R
40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND—Females with Turner {{syndrome}} commonly exhibit ophthalmological abnormalities, {{although there}} is little information in the literature documenting findings specific to Turner syndrome mosaics. Ophthalmic findings are described in four patients with mosaic Turner syndrome. All had anterior chamber abnormalities and all four had karyotypic abnormalities with a 45, X cell line. The possible relation between the karyotypic and the phenotypic findings in these patients is discussed.  METHODS—Four girls with mosaic Turner syndrome underwent a full ophthalmological assessment, including examination under anaesthesia where indicated.  RESULTS—Three of the four patients presented with congenital glaucoma. Two had the karyotype 45, X/ 46, X, idic(Y) and one a 45, X/ <b>47,</b> <b>XXX</b> <b>karyotype.</b> The remaining child had a Rieger malformation of the iris and the karyotype 45, X/ 46, X, r(X).  CONCLUSIONS—These findings suggest that Turner syndrome mosaicism (where there are two abnormal cell lines) is associated with anterior segment dysgenesis. The findings in these four patients are compared with those seen in other mosaic phenotypes and it is postulated {{that the presence of}} two or more genetically different cell lines may have an adverse effect on anterior segment development. ...|$|R

For the detection of these aneuploidies, the “gold standard” method is the cytogenetic analysis of fetal cells, karyograms show all numerical and structural abnormalities, but it takes 2 – 4 weeks to get the reports. Molecular biological methods were developed to overcome the long culture time, thus, FISH and quantitative fluorescent PCR were introduced. In this work we show our experience with a commercial kit {{for the detection of}} sex chromosome aneuploidies. MethodsWe analyzed 20. 173 amniotic fluid samples for the period of 2006 – 2013 in our department. A conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed on the samples.

40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{co-occurrence of}} ring {{chromosome}} 13 syndrome and 47, XYY syndrome {{in the same}} individual is rare. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of the co-existence of this kind of chromosome aberrations. At present, the deletion 13 q syndrome is divided into three groups based on the deletion's location relative to chromosomal band 13 q 32. Group 1 (proximal to q 32) and group 2 (including q 32) have shown distinctive phenotypes including mental retardation and growth deficiency. Group 3 (q 33 - 34 deletion) is defined by the presence of mental retardation but there is usually an absence of major malformations. Case presentation We describe a 10 -month-old Chinese Han boy presenting with severe mental retardation, profound congenital bilateral hearing loss with a terminal 13 q 33. 2 deletion and multiple malformations. Routine chromosome analysis disclosed a de novo complex <b>karyotype</b> <b>47,</b> XYY, r(13) (p 11 q 34). Further investigation by high resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization delineated an 8. 5 Mb terminal deletion on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13 q 33. 2 →q 34). Conclusion The co-occurrence of double syndromes in the same individual is rare and its clinical presentation is variable depending on the predominating abnormality or a combination of the effect of both. Hearing impairment is suggested as another new clinical feature to 13 qter deletion.

40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} polycystic {{liver disease}} (ADPLD) {{is caused by}} variants in PRKCSH, SEC 63, and LRP 5, whereas autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is caused by variants in PKD 1 and PKD 2. Liver cyst development in these disorders is explained by somatic loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele in the developing cyst. We hypothesize {{that we can use}} this mechanism to identify novel disease genes that reside in LOH regions. In this study, we aim to map abnormal genomic regions using high-density SNP microarrays to find novel PLD genes. We collected 46 cysts from 23 patients with polycystic or sporadic hepatic cysts, and analyzed DNA from those cysts using high-resolution microarray (n= 24) or Sanger sequencing (n= 22). We here focused on regions of homozygosity on the autosomes (> 3. 0 Mb) and large CNVs (> 1. 0 Mb). We found frequent LOH in PRKCSH (22 / 29) and PKD 1 /PKD 2 (2 / 3) cysts of patients with known heterozygous germline variants in the respective genes. In the total cohort, 12 / 23 patients harbored abnormalities outside of familiar areas. In individual ADPLD cases, we identified germline events: a 2 q 13 complex rearrangement resulting in BUB 1 haploinsufficiency, a <b>47</b> <b>XXX</b> <b>karyotype,</b> chromosome 9 q copy-number loss, and LOH on chromosome 3 p. The latter region was overlapping with an LOH region identified in two other cysts. Unique germline and somatic abnormalities occur frequently in and outside of known genes underlying cysts.

Mangano 1 1 Dipartimento di Scienze per la Promozione della Salute e Materno Infantile ‘‘G. D’Alessandro’’, University of Palermo, Palermo, PA, Italy. Objectives: We {{describe}} an interesting case of migraine headaches with aura in a 47, XXY male Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) intreatment with Acetazolamide and resolutionof symptoms. Background: A 16 -year-old boy {{presented to the}} outpatient clinic migraine headaches throbbing, onset evening that lasts {{for a week and}} is presented once a month with aura, associated with nausea and vomiting. Methods: The boy is a preterm at 28 WG for gestosis, the birth weight was 800 gr. He presented psychomotor retardation, and flat feet, and scoliosis. On neurological examination cranial nerves were intact. Detailed testing of motor strength, sensory exam, gait and coordination was also normal, as were his reflexes. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. The EEG was normal. He presented tall stature, abdominal adiposity and small testicles. The <b>karyotype</b> <b>47,</b> XXY showed the presence of KS. The final diagnosis was new onset migraine headache with aura in patient with KS. Due to the frequency of his headaches and the disability associated he was treated with a prophylactic medication, before with Levetiracetam and then Topiramate and then Flunarizine without resolution of symptoms. Results: Afterintroduction prophilaxis with acetazolamidein an oral dose of 500 mg dailysymptoms haveresolved. Patients with KS have reduced testosterone and increased circulating estradiol. Migraine is suspected to be intimately connected with increased circulating levels of estradiol. In our patient the 17 -B- extradiolo at the same timeof migraine attackswas high. After introduction prophylaxis with acetazolamide for a period of six mounth thepatient experienceda reduction inmigraine attacks. Conclusions: Our case report supports the importance of hormonal influences in migraine headaches, while alerting physicians to consider unusual causes of hormonal dysregulation, such as KS in male patients presenting with new-onset headaches...|$|R
40|$|Background. 47 XYY {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} sex chromosome variation characterized by an additional Y chromosome. Most patients with <b>47</b> XYY <b>karyotype</b> have normal phenotype. This disorder seems associated with {{a higher risk of}} developing behavioral and cognitive problems, tall stature, and infertility in adulthood. Sexual development disorder is a rare finding. We report a first case with an abnormal left coronary artery originating from the pulmonary artery in a 47 XYY patient. Case. A one-month-old child was referred for ectopic testis and micropenis. Physical examination revealed facial dysmorphia, micropenis, and curvature of the penis with nonpalpable testis. Laboratory tests showed decreased total testosterone and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels. Blood <b>karyotyping</b> revealed a <b>47</b> XYY chromosomal formula. At the age of 3 months, the patient developed dyspnea and tachycardia. Echocardiography revealed an anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery with left ventricular dysfunction requiring surgical revascularization by direct reimplantation of the left coronary artery system. Our second case was a 3 -year-old child referred for hypospadias with nonpalpable left testicle. Physical examination showed hypertelorism. Blood <b>karyotyping</b> revealed a <b>47</b> XYY chromosomal formula. Conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first case of 47 XYY syndrome associated with this congenital heart malformation and a sexual development disorder...|$|R
