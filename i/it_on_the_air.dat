25|$|A modest ratings success, KITS {{fought off}} {{competition}} from the legendary AM CHR station, KFRC (which changed format to big bands in 1986), as well as KMEL-FM, which had switched from album-oriented rock to CHR in 1984. 105 KITS was, for a while, {{the darling of the}} Jet Set; daily visits were common from movie celebrities such as Bette Midler, Tom Cruise, Pat Morita, George Takei, Anthony Perkins and others. The celebs didn't usually make <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> but they toured the studios in San Francisco's Merchandise Mart just to see what the industry buzz was all about.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} the third season remained positive. Entertainment Weekly named The Wire the best show of 2004, describing it as [...] "the smartest, deepest and most resonant drama on TV." [...] They credited {{the complexity of the}} show for its poor ratings. The Baltimore City Paper was so concerned that the show might be cancelled that it published a list of ten reasons to keep <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> including strong characterization, Omar Little, and an unabashedly honest representation of real world problems. It also worried that the loss of the show would {{have a negative impact on}} Baltimore's economy.|$|E

500|$|Murphy {{has said}} that he has never seen a High School Musical film, to which Glee has been compared, and that his {{interest}} lay in creating a [...] "postmodern musical", rather than [...] "doing a show where people burst into song", drawing more heavily on the format of Chicago. Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism. [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why Idol worked. It's pure escapism," [...] he said. Murphy intended to make a family show to appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads, and as of October 2009 he had already mapped out plans for the series covering three years of broadcast.|$|E
500|$|... "The Rural Juror" [...] {{was filmed}} in early November 2006. Regarding the episode's title, Tina Fey {{explained}} that [...] "it {{came out of}} a discussion in the writers' room" [...] when she asked, [...] "you know what two words I cannot pronounce properly?" [...] After a few abortive efforts by Fey's co-writers, who also made [...] "rural juror" [...] sound akin to [...] "ruhhr-juhhrr," [...] everyone was so pleased that [...] " [...] wanted to hurry up and get <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> before someone else did." [...] Jenna's film, The Rural Juror, was first mentioned three episodes earlier, in [...] "Tracy Does Conan", and referenced several times later. A running joke throughout the series was the difficulty in pronouncing the film's title, so that everyone thought it was called something different. Throughout the episode, the film was called [...] "Roar Her, Gem Her" [...] by Liz; and also [...] "Oral Germ Whore" [...] and [...] "Roaring Junior" [...] by Pete. This episode also features the first mention of Mitch Lemon (Andy Richter), Liz's brother. Mitch has a form of amnesia, named Trauma Induced Niveaphasia, due to a skiing accident in December 1985.|$|E
500|$|Terry Barrett of Ohio State University calls Children and Television a [...] "serious book", {{something}} that could be read by the general public without compromising the field of education. [...] Barrett also calls the book an informative treatment of an [...] "interesting contemporary educational phenomenon". [...] Joan Tierney of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation calls the book [...] "a well-thought, well-organized historical version" [...] of the early history and development of Sesame Street. [...] She not only considers the book a [...] "how-to" [...] in how to create and produce a children's television show, but also an important exposure to the public the hard work and dedication it required to put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> [...] For Tierney, the most interesting part of the story Lesser tells in the book is how people with strong and different opinions and temperaments learned to work together and to give television [...] "a little bit of class". [...] She applauds Lesser for including the CTW's detractors, but believes that he unnecessarily included the more ridiculous criticisms in order to give Sesame Street and the Workshop more credibility. [...] Rose K. Goldsen of Cornell University criticizes Lesser for legitimizing [...] "the strange folk belief that depositing lore in a child's head is the same as educating a child". [...] She criticizes the research Lesser describes in the book, and insists that it should be considered as product-testing rather than educational research. [...] She also criticizes Lesser for legitimizing consumerism.|$|E

500|$|Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan created Glee. Murphy drew {{inspiration}} from his own childhood, which saw him play the lead role {{in all of his}} high school's musicals. Brennan and producer Mike Novick were also highly involved in their own schools' glee clubs. Brennan originally wrote a script for a Glee movie, but Murphy believed the concept would work better as a TV series. Fox picked up the series pilot within 15 hours of receiving the script, which Murphy attributes in part {{to the success of the}} network's American Idol, commenting: [...] "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein". Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism, explaining: [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why 'Idol' worked. It's pure escapism." [...] With regards to Glee audience, Murphy intended for it to be a family show which would appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads. Glee is set in Lima, Ohio. Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself originates from Indiana, and recalls childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park. Although set in Lima, the show is actually filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Fazekas {{noted that}} the {{producers}} felt [...] "bad" [...] about the chances for a third season due to the series' low viewership, adding she [...] "would love to see it live on, even if it's in some other form, digital or whatever. I doubt that there's a Netflix play for it." [...] She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers {{would find a way}} to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed. On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series. Loeb said he did not understand the decision, as [...] "there were no conversations" [...] regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying Agent Carter was canceled. He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, [...] "if someone wants to call and say, 'We want a two-hour Agent Carter [...] for May 2017,' [...] We'll put together the greatest Agent Carter movie we can.” Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it [...] "a network political thing" [...] since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more [...] "mainstream" [...] drama Conviction [...] "to get their ratings up" [...] instead of staying on Agent Carter, which Atwell felt had gained a [...] "cult following". After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated the streaming service passed on reviving Agent Carter because it is [...] "looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have" [...] original Marvel series. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting [...] "deal complexities" [...] for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air Agent Carter globally, as [...] "Some of those output partners still had <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> so they would argue its covered by their output [...] Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cuppy's best-known work, a satire {{on history}} called The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, was {{unfinished}} when he died. Its humor ranges from the remark that, when the Nile floods receded, the land, {{as far as}} the eye can see, is [...] "covered by Egyptologists", to the detailed dissection, quotation, and parody, in the chapter on Alexander the Great, of the picture of Alexander as an idealist for world peace. The book's appeal can be gauged by the fact that CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow and his colleague Don Hollenbeck took turns reading from <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> [...] "until the announcer cracked up." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, Journal Communications {{commenced}} {{on a plan}} {{to purchase}} WACY from Ace TV, Inc. for $4.65 million. Although Journal obtained the option to purchase WACY when it bought WGBA in the mid-2000s, it could not proceed with a purchase of WACY due to FCC duopoly limits placed on markets such as Green Bay/Appleton, which has fewer than eight independently owned full-power television stations. In paperwork filed with the FCC on May 3, 2012, Journal included a [...] "failing station waiver" [...] that would allow it to purchase WACY and keep <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> an avenue that LIN TV Corporation used in purchasing Green Bay's WCWF in 2011 and creating a duopoly with WLUK-TV. As the petitioner, Journal needed to prove in its waiver request that WACY was in an economically non-viable position (reasoning that LIN also cited in its purchase of WCWF).|$|E
2500|$|At {{the request}} of CBS {{management}} in New York, Murrow and Shirer put together a European News Roundup of reaction to the Anschluss, which brought correspondents from various European cities together for a single broadcast.

Huss of the International News Service in Berlin, and Senator Lewis B. Schwellenbach in Washington, D.C. Reporter Frank Gervasi, in Rome, {{was unable to find}} a transmitter to broadcast reaction from the Italian capital, but phoned his script to Shirer in London, who read <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Murrow reported live from Vienna, in the first on-the-scene news report of his career: [...] "This is Edward Murrow speaking from Vienna....

2500|$|In the 1970s, Arnaz co-hosted a week {{of shows}} with daytime host and {{producer}} Mike Douglas. Vivian Vance appeared as a guest. Arnaz also headlined a Kraft Music Hall special on NBC that featured his two children, with a brief appearance by Vance. To promote his autobiography, A Book, on February 21, 1976, Arnaz served as a guest host on Saturday Night Live, with his son, Desi, Jr., also appearing. The program contained spoofs of I Love Lucy and The Untouchables. The spoofs of I Love Lucy {{were supposed to be}} earlier concepts of the show that never made <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> such as [...] "I Love Louie", where Desi lived with Louis Armstrong. He read Lewis Carroll's poem [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] in a heavy Cuban accent (he pronounced it [...] "Habberwocky"). Desi Jr., played the drums and, supported by the SNL band, Desi sang both [...] "Babalu" [...] and another favorite from his dance band days, [...] "Cuban Pete"; the arrangements were similar to the ones used on I Love Lucy. He ended the broadcast by leading the entire cast in a raucous conga line through the SNL studio.|$|E
