Just as Batista was leaving, CM Punk ran to the ring carrying the Money in the Bank briefcase he had won at WrestleMania XXIV, with referee Mike Chioda tagging along with him. Since Edge was still out of it from the attack, he did not see Punk come into the ring and therefore was unaware that Punk was cashing in his contract. Once the bell rang, Punk simply hit Edge with a Go To Sleep and pinned him to win the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a single restoration with subgingival margin on a tooth, in the maxillary anterior zone, would affect its periodontal soft tissue parameters, and whether or not a deep chamfer preparation has a different influence in the periodontium when compared to a feather edge preparation. Plaque and gingival indexes, periodontal probing depth, bleeding on probing and patient’s biotype were registered. 106 teeth were prepared with a deep chamfer, while 94 were prepared with a feather <b>edge</b> <b>finishing</b> line. Six and twelve month after the restorations delivery the same parameters were evaluated. Repeated measure one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (α= 0. 05) was used. At six months the patient A statistically significant difference between baseline and the 6 and 12 -month follow up is present in regards to plaque index, gingival index and periodontal probing depth, but no statistically significant difference between chamfer and feather <b>edge</b> <b>finishing</b> lines. There is a statistically significant difference between baseline and the 6 and 12 -month follow up in regards to bleeding on probing. Feather edge preparation presents significantly more bleeding on probing and less gingival recession than the chamfer. Sub-gingival margins do influence the periodontal soft tissue response. Statistically significant difference exists between feather edge and chamfer finishing lines in regards to bleeding on probing and gingival recession.

40|$|For {{the past}} three decades, glass has become more {{frequently}} used for secondary construction elements in façade glazing, {{as well as for}} structural elements. In the latter case, the edge strength becomes an important issue when designing a structural glass beam or a façade fin. Different parameters affect the edge strength of glass, such as 1) the type of <b>edge</b> <b>finishing</b> and the supplier, 2) the size of the element and 3) the load duration. The first parameter affects the number and the shape of the edge flaws caused by cutting or polishing the edge. Secondly, the size effect is important because larger elements tend to have a greater probability of larger flaws. Finally, the load duration has an impact on the time-dependent strength. In this study, 16 series of glass specimens with different edge finishings and sizes were subjected to in-plane four-point bending tests at several loading rates. The environmental effect (i. e. humidity) was not examined, as all the tests were carried out under constant laboratory conditions. After comparing different distributions, the most appropriate distribution, i. e. Weibull, was used. The results of the series were compared statistically relative to the parameters mentioned above. The results indicate large variations in the edge strength, which are assumed {{to be related to the}} <b>edge</b> <b>finishing</b> and the glass supplier. A detailed manufacturing protocol is needed for a more accurate comparison of the results. Furthermore, unlike the size effect, the load duration effect was found to comply with earlier results given in literature...|$|E

In standards, these influences are expressed by the factor kmod, which reduces the strength depending on the load type, e. g. wind load, temperature load. In this study, five series of glass specimens with a cut <b>edge</b> <b>finishing</b> were subjected to in-plane four-point bending tests.

40|$|Glass is a {{challenging}} building material, among others {{due to the}} difficulty of defining its strength-related parameters. One of the main parameters influencing the strength of glass is the flaw population created at the edges of glass elements by cutting and polishing. The current study aims at correlating the configuration of edge flaws to the edge strength of glass. To do so, small-scale glass specimens were subjected to in-plane four-point bending tests to determine the failure strength and the failure location. Subsequently, the edge flaw conditions were studied defining the geometry factor and the depth of the edge flaws for each <b>edge</b> <b>finishing,</b> using the results from the bending tests as well as measurements made with a confocal microscope. Finally, using the flaw parameters defined, a time-dependent strength prediction is obtained for the investigated edge finishings...|$|E

40|$|A {{reliable}} {{assessment of the}} edge strength becomes an important issue when designing structural glass elements in buildings. However, in the literature the edge strength of glass, dependent on the edge quality, is not well documented. Therefore, in this study an edge strength model was established and validated for commonly used edge finishings, namely ground, arrissed and cut. After testing at a high stress rate, the fracture mirror zone depth and the flaw depth were measured. For every <b>edge</b> <b>finishing</b> a reliable ratio between the fracture mirror zone depth and the initial flaw depth was found. A strength model based on the measurement of the mirror zone depth was established and validated, as the measurement of the mirror zone is much easier than the measurement of the flaw depth. Also, the mirror zone depth is independent of the loading rate and can be useful for forensic engineering...|$|E
40|$|The edge {{strength}} of glass {{is influenced by}} the size of the surface (near the edge) which is subjected to tensile stresses. To quantify this size effect, 8 series of single layer annealed glass beam specimens (as-received glass) were subjected to in-plane four-point bending with linearly increased loading until failure. Within the 8 series, the <b>edge</b> <b>finishing</b> differed between ‘cut’ and ‘ground’, the thickness between 4 and 8 mm and the beam length between 550 and 1100 mm. From the test results a reduction in strength was observed for increased specimen size, which is in line with common expectations. However, the analytical prediction of this reduction by probabilistic laws derived from the literature is unsafe. In fact, these predictions of the strength reduction were up to 14 % less conservative than those observed from the presented test results. From this it is concluded that future standards should estimate the size effect more conservatively than currently done by the existing laws in the literature...|$|E

After {{a brief description of the}} micro and mesostructure of glass we will explain our goals in this analysis. We have divided the glass plate – from a mesoscopic aspect – into three major regions. The first region is the external surface, which is the largest area of a plate. The effect of the surface imperfections is negligible due to a grinded <b>edge</b> <b>finishing,</b> so we considered the second region as the edge. The third region contains the inhomogeneities in the glass material itself. To describe the mesostructure we have done atomic force microscopy (AFM) and micro computed tomography (µCT) scans.

The aim of the overall analysis is to develop a new certification procedure to qualify the structural glass in a mechanical a way. </div...|$|E
40|$|The interlaminar {{stresses}} are {{confined to}} a region near the free edge. Therefore, the laminate stacking sequence and the free <b>edge</b> <b>finishing</b> {{are some of the}} factors that affect the strength of the laminate and limit its life. The use of molded edges eliminates the need for trimming and machining the laminates edges thus improving productivity. However, this fabrication technique may have a detrimental effect on the laminate strength for certain stacking sequences. This effect in the presence of moisture has not been characterized. This work presents the results of a comparative study of the resistance to delamination of laminates with machined edges and molded edges. Additionally, two environmental conditions were considered: dry laminates and laminates saturated with moisture. The tensile strength of the laminates were measured and micrographs were used to analyze the microstructure of the laminates near the free edges. It is concluded that the mechanical properties of advanced composites depend on the environmental conditions and the fabrication techniques used to produce the laminates. Therefore, it is necessary to account for these factors when experimentally determining the design allowables...|$|E
40|$|Although {{deburring}} {{technology is}} used in precision manufacturing and high-quality machining, deburring is still considered a difficult problem. Precision parts require care to achieve precise dimensions and surface quality and in subsequent finishing operations. Deburring and <b>edge</b> <b>finishing</b> typically receive little attention from designers and manufacturing engineers. Due to deburring difficulties, it can {{account for more than}} 30 % of the total production cost when components are small. Efficient and effective deburring of miniature and/or precision components is very difficult. Therefore, this work applies a highly efficient and fully automatic novel electrochemical system that uses a rotating barrel. The effects of the main factors, such as barrel rotational speed, electrical current density, electrolyte temperature and process time, are investigated. Finally, optimal conditions are identified by applying the design of experiment to the required edge quality. The burrs on brass gears are dissolved and removed properly and the radius of the fillet of the gears after deburring has a small standard deviation of 5. 9 μm within only 5 minutes when using the proposed system of a rotational barrel with electrochemical deburring. This electrochemical system is an effective and efficient system to remove burrs from miniature metal parts...|$|E
