The main aim of this section is to explain the essence {{and the importance of}} creating a business plan. There is also shown the structure of the business plan and the possibilities that can be implemented in it. In the practical part are applied these theoretical knowledge. The practical part is written in form of a business plan for setting up a company using automated business strategies to evaluate investment for the general public. For better understanding of demand, a questionnaire survey was conducted. The aim of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of this business plan.

40|$|Abstract—During 1995 – 1996, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) con-ducted a {{far-reaching}} {{reexamination of}} the technologies, systems concepts and terrestrial markets {{that might be}} involved in future space solar power (SSP) systems. The principal objective of this “fresh look ” {{study was to determine}} whether a solar power satellite (SPS) and associated systems could be deEned that could deliver energy into terrestrial electrical power grids at prices equal to or below ground alternatives in a variety of markets, do so without major environmental draw-backs, and which could be developed {{at a fraction of the}} <b>initial</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projected</b> for the SPS Reference System of the late 1970 s. One of the key concepts emerging from the “fresh look ” SSP study is the “SunTower ” SPS system. This concept exploits a variety of innovative technologies and design approaches to achieve a potential breakthrough in establishing the technical and programmatic feasibility on initial commercial SSP operations. Capable of being deployed to either low Earth orbit or middle Earth orbit altitudes and various inclinations, the SunTower concept involves essentially no in-space infrastructure and requires no unique heavy lift launch vehicle. The concept, which can provide power to global market places appears to allow up to a factor of 30 : 1 reduction in <b>initial</b> <b>investment</b> requirements, compared to the 1979 SPS Reference Concept. This paper presents a technical overview of the SunTower SPS concept, including key technologies, sensitivity trades, operational scenarios. Potential non-SPS space program uses of the SunTower concept and related technologies are identiEed, including human exploration, space science and commercial space applications...|$|R

30|$|Overall, the {{leverage}} ratio L mirrors {{important aspects of}} sequential versus unstaged <b>investment</b> <b>projects.</b> First, {{as the number of}} stages of the investment increases, {{the leverage}} ratio of the compound option also increases (ceteris paribus). This reflects the relatively lower <b>initial</b> capital <b>investment</b> of sequential <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> compared to complete irreversible up-front financed projects that inevitably have an (implicit) leverage of zero. Second, this lower <b>initial</b> capital <b>investment</b> has a risk-reducing effect since losses are limited to the option premium(s), that is, prior investment outlays. Sequential <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> can thus be characterized as low-commitment (R&D) strategies (see Klingebiel and Adner 2012) or as “exploratory investments” (Bar-Ilan and Strange 1998) as the staging of investments implies varying degrees of commitment. Consequently, the leverage of the duplicating portfolio is a market-based operationalization of the (resource) commitment construct, and might be used as such also in future empirical research studies.|$|R

DCC {{is a legal}} and established business around the world but its market potential in Canada is almost untouched. Hyperwallet is capable of running a standard DCC system but plans to introduce a patentable new transaction-rerouting technology which would provide a cost advantage in comparison to future competitors.

With insufficient English programs {{in the public school}} system, many seek the education elsewhere. The Trung Institute will be a private school in Vietnam, specializing in teaching English as a second language (ESL). Currently ESL programs exist in Vietnam but most employ native English speakers with little teaching background as instructors. Teachers will be recruited from Teaching and ESL programs at Washington State University and Concordia for one-year stints in Vietnam. Teachers will be selected each year through an application process. The Institute is set apart through the use of certified teachers rather than untrained volunteers, and will be marketed as a higher level of education. The institute will prepare students for the Test of English as a Foreign Language, a requirement for citizens of Vietnam to receive their high school diploma. The curriculum will be designed to give students the edge in the workforce. The school will open in Ho Chi Minh.

The overall SHS-FIG effort focuses on directing and guiding those projects that: 1) develop and demonstrate new surface habitat system concepts, innovations, and technologies to support human exploration missions, 2) improve environmental systems that interact with human habitats, 3) handle and emplace human surface habitats, and 4) focus on supporting humans living and working in habitats on planetary surfaces. The activity areas of the SHS FIG described herein are focused on the surface habitat project near-term objectives as described in this document. The SHS-FIG effort focuses on mitigating surface habitat risks (as identified by the Lunar Surface Systems Project Office (LSSPO) Surface Habitat Element Team; and concentrates on developing surface habitat technologies as identified in the FY 08 gap analysis. The surface habitat gap assessment will be updated annually as the surface architecture and surface habitat definition continues to mature. These technologies are mapped to the SHS-FIG Strategic Development Roadmap. The Roadmap will bring to light the areas where additional innovative efforts are needed to support the development of habitat concepts and designs and the development of new technologies to support of the LSSPO Habitation Element development plan. Three specific areas of development that address Lunar Architecture Team (LAT) - 2 and Constellation Architecture Team (CxAT) Lunar habitat design issues or risks will be focused on by the SHS-FIG. The SHS-FIG will establish four areas of development that will help the projects prepare in their planning for surface habitat systems development. Those development areas are the 1) surface habitat concept definition, 2) inflatable surface habitat development, and 3) autonomous habitat operations, and 4) cross-cutting / systems engineering. In subsequent years, the SHS-FIG will solicit a call for innovations and technologies that will support the development of these four development areas. The other development areas will be assessed yearly and identified on the SHS-FIG s Strategic Development Roadmap. <b>Initial</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> that are funded by the Constellation Program Office (CxPO), LSSPO, or the Exploration Technology Development Projects (ETDP) will also be included on the Roadmap.
