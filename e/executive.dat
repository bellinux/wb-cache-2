Minority <b>executives</b> as a whole experience lower promotion, higher demotion, and higher exit than Caucasian males.

40|$|The salient {{attributes}} of {{direct and indirect}} exporting methods of distribution were identified. Attitudes of three groups of <b>executives</b> (<b>executives</b> using direct exporting methods, <b>executives</b> using indirect exporting methods and nonexporting <b>executives),</b> were assessed towards the attributes. Attitudes were analyzed using ANOVA. The {{findings suggest that the}} three groups of <b>executives</b> hold significantly different attitudes about the attributes. The findings (1) Imply that <b>executives</b> using indirect exporting methods and nonexporitng methods are most alike in their attitudes; (2) offer an explaination for the tendency of <b>executives</b> to begin exporting with indirect methods and to switch to direct methods as exporting experience increases, and (3) identify the attitudes that each group of <b>executives</b> is most likely to hold. © 1979 JIBS.

40|$|While reformers {{have argued}} that {{multiple}} directorships for <b>executives</b> can destroy value, we investigate firms with <b>executives</b> that accept an outside directorship and find negative announcement returns only when the <b>executive's</b> firm has greater agency problems. When fewer agency concerns exist, additional directorships relate to increased firm value. Announcement returns are also higher when <b>executives</b> accept an outside directorship in a financial, high-growth, or related-industry firm.

5|$|As {{indicated}} in the temple records, the priests of the temple were Shiva ascetics called Dandi Sanyasis, who belonged to Nambudiri community, a religious group common in modern Kerala. When {{the last of the}} ascetics died without an heir in 1776 AD, the king invited non-ascetic Nambudiris from Kerala for priesthood, a practice that continues in modern times. Till 1939, all the offerings made by the devotees to the temple went to the Rawal (chief priest), but after 1939, his jurisdiction was restricted to religious affairs. The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief <b>executive</b> officer who executes the orders from the state government, a deputy chief <b>executive</b> officer, two OSDs, an <b>executive</b> officer, an account officer, a temple officer and a publicity officer to assist the chief <b>executive</b> officer.|$|E
