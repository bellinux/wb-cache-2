5|$|To {{support its}} {{assertion}} that the Sultan of Johor did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Singapore contended that the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory. Thus, the only reliable way {{to determine whether a}} particular territory belonged to a ruler was to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> the inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler. This was difficult to do with respect to Pedra Branca since it was isolated and uninhabited, and Malaysia had not provided clear evidence of a direct claim to or actual exercise of sovereign authority over the island.|$|E
5|$|Some of a patient's single {{nucleotide}} polymorphismsslight {{differences in their}} DNAcan help predict how quickly they will metabolise particular drugs; this is called pharmacogenomics. For example, the enzyme CYP2C19 metabolises several drugs, such as the anti-clotting agent Clopidogrel, into their active forms. Some patients possess polymorphisms in specific places on the 2C19 gene that make poor metabolisers of those drugs; physicians can test for these polymorphisms and <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> the drugs will be fully effective for that patient. Advances in molecular biology have helped show that some syndromes that were previously classed as a single disease are actually multiple subtypes with entirely different causes and treatments. Molecular diagnostics can help diagnose the subtypefor example of infections and cancersor the genetic analysis of a disease with an inherited component, such as Silver-Russell syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The High Court's {{decision}} was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court {{held that the}} Registrar had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that the Registrar had been entitled to take, prima facie, the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless they had {{been shown to be}} incorrect. Although the Registrar had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by the Registrar by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's sworn statement. There was thus no merit in Komoco's contention that the Registrar had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, there had not been any compelling reason for the Registrar to re-evaluate her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from the policy, and had not fettered her discretion.|$|E

5|$|The Malagasy on the ship, {{seeing the}} signal fires, cut the anchor cable, {{allowing}} Meermin to drift shorewards, where she grounded on a sandbank. Crew member Rijk Meyer, who had earlier been thrown overboard and swum around {{the ship to}} the safety of the gunroom, now swam from the ship to the shore and was brought to Le Sueur. He informed Le Sueur that the Malagasy on the ship had told him to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> the earlier landing party was there, but that he had secretly arranged with the other crew members that, if help was available on shore, he would signal back to the ship by waving a handkerchief above his head. Six Malagasy and another crew member also left Meermin in a canoe, but a unit of the militia immediately surrounded the party when they landed. One Malagasy was shot dead and three others taken prisoner; the dead Malagasy was later identified by one of the ship's crew as the mutiny's overall ringleader, but his name was not recorded. Of the remaining two, one swam away and the other was believed either to have swum back to the ship or drowned in the attempt. Enraged by the crew's deception, the Malagasy still on Meermin launched an attack on the crew which lasted for three hours, but the crew were able to defend themselves.|$|E

Linda tells Mick, and when Whitney tells Lee, Mick and Linda rush into the room to celebrate before {{he has a chance}} to let the news sink in. Whitney and Lee are both diagnosed with chlamydia and Whitney blames herself due to Rob. Abi admits to Whitney she had a one-night stand and gave Lee chlamydia. Whitney initially ends their relationship and considers leaving Walford, but later decides to give him another chance. Whitney is pleased when Ryan is released from prison and he tells her he is moving to Wakefield. He offers Whitney and Lee to move in with him and she accepts, but later declines when Linda strongly disapproves of them moving so far away. Whitney and Ryan share an emotional farewell. Whitney suffers spotting and is taken to hospital with Lee, Linda and Mick, where the bleeeding gets heavier. A scan shows Whitney has miscarried her baby, devastating her and Lee. Lauren encourages Whitney to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> she lost their baby due to him giving her chlamydia and she confides in Johnny (now Ted Reilly) that chlamydia might have caused it but tells Lee that the doctors said it could not have. Whitney decides to go Milton Keynes to stay with Bianca but returns the next day with Bianca's wedding dress and intends to get married. She reassures everyone she is fine and is thrown another hen party. Whitney marries Lee with Stacey acting as maid of honour in place of an ill Lauren and Tiffany and Lily as bridesmaids. Whitney is disappointed to learn that Lee was behind the robbery at The Vic but is unaware how close to suicide he was. She argues with Lee over money and Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) who tries to kiss her. Whitney then turns to Mick for support, and sleeps at The Vic. The next day she is reconciled with an apologetic Lee but finds his wage slip showing how little he earns. Following another argument with Lee, Whitney confides in Mick, telling him she is going to buy Ryan an engagement present. Later, a bus crashes into the market and Whitney is trapped underneath it. Whitney is rescued and in hospital, she talks to Mick about her marriage. He comforts her and she kisses him, which is seen by Denise Fox (Diane Parish). Whitney decides to organise a night out and pawns her wedding ring for cash. Lee discovers what she has done and they start arguing. When Whitney says he doesn't deserve her, Lee slaps her in the face. Shortly after the incident Whitney lays on the bed in silence, with Lee begging for forgiveness. Whitney confides in Lauren who strongly advises her to leave Lee.|$|E
