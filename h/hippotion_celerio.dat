50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 32 mm. The body is more robust than <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio</b> and olive green. The forewings are olive green. The hindwings are as in <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio,</b> but duller pink and the black areas are better developed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio,</b> {{the vine}} hawk-moth or silver-striped hawk-moth, is a moth {{of the family}} Sphingidae.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} to <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio,</b> but the forewing pattern is less {{contrasting}} and the pink coloration of the hindwing upperside is deeper pink. The forewing upperside {{is similar to}} <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio</b> and Hippotion osiris but the oblique and transverse lines reduced in intensity. The hindwing upperside is most similar to Hippotion aporodes but the pink spots of median band are somewhat more sharply defined.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves of}} species R. tomentosa and R. tridentata are eaten by {{caterpillars}} of the Silver Striped Hawkmoth (<b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 28-34 mm. It is very closely allied to <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio.</b> It differs in being consistently darker, in the oblique band of the forewings being more evenly curved, buff instead of silvery and enclosing three narrow but distinct, dark brown parallel lines. The hindwings are as in <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio,</b> but the crimson patch at the base is deeper in tone, the blackish markings are better developed, invading most of the wing {{with the exception of}} the base. The inner margin and a series of intemervular post-median spots are crimson.|$|E
50|$|The vlei ink-flower has {{white or}} rosy-tinged (sometimes purple) flowers that {{open in the}} evening, and have long narrow corolla tubes. These traits all occur in flowers that are pollinated by hawkmoths, {{although}} a clear scent was not observed. <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio</b> and Nephele comma have been seen to visit C. tubulosum.|$|E
50|$|Between 1921 and his death, Crawford was a {{prolific}} author of notes on Irish insects. His main interests were Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. Many of his notes concerned migrant moths and butterflies, and he documented the occurrences of several rare hawkmoths including the only N. Ireland record of <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio</b> {{also known as}} Silver-Striped Hawk-Moth. He discovered the Small Eggar in Fermanagh in 1928. He also amassed a large collection of Irish Coleoptera. He specialised in the Dytiscidae.|$|E
50|$|Hippotion leucocephalus is a moth of {{the family}} Sphingidae. It is {{probably}} found in Africa, but the identity of this taxon, which is known only from the holotype female, is unclear, especially as Röber stated it was presumably a species found in Africa. It {{may be a better}} match to Hippotion aurora aurora than to <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio,</b> but the matter will only be settled by examination of the holotype, the current depository of which is unknown.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} butterflies and moths from Santa Maria, Faial, Pico and S. Miguel islands. Collections and/or observations were made mostly during short visits in the years 1997, 1998 and 2001. The list of records includes 40 Macrolepidoptera species, belonging to the families Pieridae, Nymphalidae, Lycaenidae, Geometridae, Sphingidae and Noctuidae. Some species are new confirmed records, for Faial (Vanessa virginiensis (Drury), <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio</b> (Linnaeus), Ophiusa tirhaca (Cramer), Agrotis segetum (Deni...|$|E
40|$|Various {{lepidopteran}} pests attack grapevines in South Africa, {{but they}} are mostly regarded as sporadic pests that seldom cause economic damage. The leaf-feeding silver-striped hawk moth, <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio</b> (Linneaus) (Sphingidae), is common in the Western Cape Province and occasionally causes economic damage to young vines. Theretra capensis (Linneaus) (Sphingidae) (grapevine hawk moth) and Heraclia superba (Butler) (Agaristidae) (superb false tiger) have also been reported on vines, but are rarely of economic importance (Annecke & Moran, 1982) ...|$|E
40|$|Moths of {{the genus}} Hippotion Hübner, 1822 (Family: Sphingidae) are {{distributed}} in Africa, Central and southern Asia and as migrants in southern Europe and Australia. Currently, around 30 species are accommodated in this genus. <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio</b> is a regular migrant to the Maltese Islands. On the onset of warmer weather conditions, colonies establish themselves in North Africa and Europe. It is a resident species in the Azores and the Atlantic coast of Morocco and most probably also in the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula and Egyptpeer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn his {{landmark}} {{work on the}} pollination {{biology of}} South African plants in 1954, Stefan Vogel described the deposition of Habenaria epipactidea (= H. polyphylla) pollinaria on the forelegs of the hawkmoth <b>Hippotion</b> <b>celerio.</b> The discovery of a large, well-pollinated population of H. epipactidea in the Eastern Cape allowed us to confirm {{the presence of this}} unusual pollen placement on a number of species of shorter-tongued hawkmoths. The long-tongued species Agrius convolvuli is likely to function as a nectar thief as the length of the tongue of this species relative to the nectar spur ensures that the forelegs are unlikely to come into contact with the viscidia. The legitimate hawkmoth pollinators removed a large proportion of pollinaria from the flowers and the majority of flowers had pollen deposited on their stigmas. Despite this, pollen transfer efficiency was relatively low at 8. 4 %. We also examined the scent production of H. epipactidea and show that volatile production increases markedly after 18 : 00, peaking at around 20 : 00. The scent of this species is dominated by methyl benzoate which makes up 99. 4 % of the floral scent at 20 : 00. The osmophores are located on the lateral petals and labellum, confirming Vogel's observations in the Soutpansberg (Zoutpansberg) ...|$|E
