40|$|Abstract- This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{stochastic}} analysis of recursive least squares (RLS) identification algorithms with an exponential forgetting factor. A persistent excitation assumption of a conditional type is made that does not prevent the regressors from being a dependent sequence. Moreover, the system parameter is modeled as the output of a random-walk type equation without extra constraints on its variance. It is shown that the estimation error can be split into two terms, depending on the parameter drift and the <b>disturbance</b> <b>noise,</b> respectively. The first term turns out to be proportional to the memory length of the algorithm, whereas the second is proportional to the inverse of the same quantity. Even though these dependence laws are well known in very special mathematical frameworks (deterministic excitation andor independent observations), this {{is believed to be the}} first contribution where they are proven in a general dependent context. Some idealized examples are introduced in the paper to clarify the link between generality of assumptions and applicability of results in the developed analysis...|$|E

The deflection profile of these microcantilevers is {{compared with that of}} typical rectangular microcantilevers under the action of dynamic disturbances. Various force-loading conditions are considered. The theory of linear elasticity for thin beams is used to obtain the deflection-related quantities. The disturbance in these quantities is obtained based on wave propagation and beam vibration theories. It is found that detections of rectangular microcantilevers with long-slits based on maximum slit opening length can be more than 100 times the deflections of typical rectangular microcantilevers. Moreover, the <b>disturbance</b> (<b>noise</b> effect) in the detection quantities of the microcantilever with long-slits is found to be always smaller than that of typical microcantilevers, regardless of the wavelength, force amplitude, and the frequency of the dynamic disturbance. Eventually, the detection quantities of the microcantilever with long-slits are found to be almost unaffected by dynamic disturbances, as long as the wavelengths of these disturbances are larger than 3. 5 times the microcantilever width.
