5000|$|The British Babcock & Wilcox Limited {{entered the}} German market in 1887 through {{licensing}} of its technology and brand {{to a local}} manufacturer, Schwartzkopff. By {{the middle of the}} 1890s the British became dissatisfied with apparently low volume of business: their German licensee [...] "had too much else to attend to". Direct operations in Germany were ruled out in fear of the strong anti-British sentiment among the Germans. Instead, in 1898 Babcock & Wilcox Limited formed a German subsidiary company, Deutsche Babcock & Wilcox Dampfkessel Werke Aktion-Gesellschaft (Deutsche Babcock & Wilcox, DB&W). Robert Jurenka and Alois Seidle from Bohemia signed an agreement with Babcock & Wilcox to convert their Berlin sales office into a <b>fully</b> <b>operational</b> <b>subsidiary.</b> Babcock & Wilcox Limited granted DB&W an exclusive license to sell Babcock & Wilcox products in Germany and its colonies. The British parent retained majority ownership and representation in {{the board of directors of}} DB&W.|$|E
