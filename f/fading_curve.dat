The most likely source for these rather large velocities is convective instability arising from deformations of the temperature profile by breaking gravity waves. The distinction between the two types of scatter at these altitudes probably accounts for the behavior with frequency of the nightime fading period at low and very low frequencies. The fading period of D-region reflections at night was constant at about 7 min from 16 to 43 kHz, but that at frequencies of 70 kHz and above, the fading period decreased {{in such a way as}} to indicate the presence of irregularities smaller than about 1 km in size.

50|$|The {{simplest}} of <b>fade</b> <b>curves</b> is the linear curve {{and it is}} normally the default fade. It takes a straight line and introduces a curve. This curve represents an equal degree by which the gain increases or decreases during {{the length of the}} fade. A linear fade-in curve makes it sound as though the volume increases sharply at the beginning, and more gradually towards the end. The same principle applies on a fade-out where a gradual drop in volume can be perceived in the beginning, and the fade gets more abrupt towards the end. If in your audio there is a natural ambience or reverb present that one would like to reduce, the linear shape would be ideal because of the initial drop in perceived volume. When applied it shortens the ambience. Also if the music requires an accelerating effect, this linear curve can also be applied. This type of fade is not very natural sounding. The principle of a linear cross-fade is: {{at the beginning of the}} fade the perceived volume drops more quickly, one can see at the halfway point (in the middle of the crossfade) that the perceived volume drops below 50%. This is a very noticeable drop in volume. Also if the control can move from position 0 to 100, and the percentage of the signal that is allowed to pass equals the position of the control (i.e. 25% of the signal is allowed to pass when the control is 25% of the physical distance from the 0 point to the 100 point). At the midpoint of the fade the effect of a linear cross-fade is that both the sounds are below half of their maximum perceived volume; and as a result the sum of the two fades will be below the maximum level of either. This is not applicable when the two sounds are on different levels and the cross-fade time is long enough. In turn if the crossfade is short (for example on a single note) the dip of the volume in the middle of the cross-fade can be quite noticeable.|$|R

We argue that these properties are best explained by a core-collapse supernova at the low-mass end (8 - 12 M_) of the range of massive stars that explode (Smartt 2009). Such a low mass progenitor had lost its hydrogen-rich envelope through binary interaction, having very thin oxygen-rich and silicon-rich layers above the collapsing core, thus ejecting a very small amount of radioactive ^ 56 Ni and oxygen. Although the host galaxy NGC 4589 is an elliptical, some studies have revealed evidence of recent star-formation activity (Zhang et al. 2008), consistent with the core-collapse scenario.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of so-called superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are discovered. It is believed {{that at least some}} of them with slowly <b>fading</b> light <b>curves</b> originate in stellar explosions induced by the pair instability mechanism. Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability supernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up to Z= 0. 006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether PISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light curve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of macroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting observational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN evolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova evolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The greatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an extreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the hydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of chemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric temperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider range of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light curves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two well-observed SLSNe PTF 12 dam and LSQ 12 dlf. However, these models' extreme chemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe. Therefore, alternative models such as the magnetar mechanism or wind-interaction may still to be favourable to interpret rapidly rising SLSNe.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Type II supernovae with rapidly <b>fading</b> light <b>curves</b> (a. k. a. Type IIL supernovae) are explosions of progenitors with low-mass hydrogen-rich envelopes which are of the order of 1 Msun. We investigate light-curve properties of supernovae from such progenitors. We confirm that such progenitors lead to rapidly fading Type II supernovae. We find that the luminosity of supernovae from such progenitors with the canonical explosion energy of 1 e 51 erg and 56 Ni mass of 0. 05 Msun can increase temporarily shortly before all the hydrogen in the envelope recombines. As a result, a bump appears in their light curves. The bump appears because the heating from the nuclear decay of 56 Ni can keep the bottom of hydrogen-rich layers in the ejecta ionized, and thus the photosphere can stay there for a while. We find that the light-curve bump becomes less significant when we make explosion energy larger (>~ 2 e 51 erg), 56 Ni mass smaller (<~ 0. 01 Msun), 56 Ni mixed in the ejecta, or the progenitor radius larger. Helium mixing in hydrogen-rich layers makes the light-curve decline rates large but does not help reducing the light-curve bump. Because the light-curve bump we found in our light-curve models has not been observed in rapidly fading Type II supernovae, they may be characterized by not only low-mass hydrogen-rich envelopes but also higher explosion energy, larger degrees of 56 Ni mixing, and/or larger progenitor radii than slowly fading Type II supernovae, so that the light-curve bump does not become significant.

50|$|The {{exponential}} curve shape {{is in many}} ways the precise opposite of the logarithmic curves. The fade-in works as follows: it increases in volume slowly and then it shoots up very quickly {{at the end of the}} fade. The fade-out drops very quickly (from the maximum volume) and then declines slowly again over the duration of the fade. Simply stated a linear fade could thus be seen as an exaggerated version of an exponential fade in terms of the apparent volume. Thus the impression that would be gathered from an exponential <b>curve’s</b> <b>fade</b> would sound as though the sound was rapidly accelerating towards the listener. Natural ambience can also be repressed by using an exponential fade-out. A cross-fade, in the exponential shape, will have a perceivable dip in the middle, which is very undesirable in music and vocals. This depends largely on the length of the cross-fade, a long cross-fade on ambient sounds can sound perfectly satisfactory (the dip can add a little breath to the music). Exponential crossfades (or a curve with a similar shape) have a smaller drop in the middle of the fade.|$|R

We discover that the supernova has not faded significantly, even {{more than three decades}} after its explosion. The spectrum exhibits numerous narrow (FWHM ≲ 600 km s^- 1) emission lines, indicating that the supernova blastwave is persistently interacting with dense circumstellar material (CSM). Evolution of emission lines indicates that the supernova ejecta is slowly progressing through the reverse shock, and has not expanded past {{the outer edge of the}} circumstellar envelope. We demonstrate that the CSM is not likely to be spherically distributed, with mass of ≲ 1 M_. The progenitor mass loss rate is estimated as ≳ 0. 01 M_ yr^- 1.

The light <b>curve</b> <b>fades</b> rapidly, dropping by 4. 5 mag from the V-band peak in 100 d. The optical and near-infrared spectra are dominated by narrow emission lines with broad electron scattering wings, signalling a dense circumstellar environment, together with multiple components of broad emission and absorption in H and He at velocities in the range 0. 5 – 1. 2 × 104 km s− 1. We see no evidence for nucleosynthesized material in SN 2009 ip, even in late-time pseudonebular spectra. We set a limit of< 0. 02 M on themass of any possible synthesized 56 Ni from the late-time light curve. A simple model for the narrow Balmer lines is presented and used to derive number densities for the circumstellar medium in the range ∼ 109 – 1010 cm− 3. Our near-infrared data do not show any excess at longer wavelengths, and we see no other signs of dust formation. Our last data, taken in 2012 December, show that SN 2009 ip has spectroscopically evolved to something quite similar to its appearance in late 2009, albeit with higher velocities. It is possible that neither of the eruptive and high-luminosity events of SN 2009 ip were induced by a core collapse. We show that the peak and total integrated luminosity can be due to the efficient conversion of kinetic energy from colliding ejecta, and that around 0. 05 – 0. 1 M of material moving at 0. 5 – 1 × 104 km s− 1 could comfortably produce the observed luminosity. We discuss the possibility that these shells were ejected by the pulsational pair instability mechanism, in which case the progenitor star may still exist, and will be observed after the current outburst fades. The long-term monitoring of SN 2009 ip, due to its proximity, has given the most extensive data set yet gathered of a high-luminosity interacting transient and its progenitor.

We derived the planetary, stellar and geometrical properties of the system and found them slightly smaller but in agreement with the values from the discovery paper. The period of the fading event was found to be 1. 36 s shorter and 100 times more precise than the previous published value. If CVSO 30 b would be a giant planet on a precessing orbit, which we cannot confirm, yet, the precession period may be shorter than previously thought. But if confirmed as a planet it would be the youngest transiting planet ever detected and will provide important constraints on planet formation and migration time-scales.
