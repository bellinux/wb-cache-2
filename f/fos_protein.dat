50|$|AP-1 {{transcription}} factor is assembled through the dimerization of a characteristic bZIP domain (basic region leucine zipper) in the Fos and Jun subunits. A typical bZIP domain {{consists of a}} “leucine zipper” region, and a “basic region”. The leucine zipper is responsible for dimerization of the Jun and <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> subunits. This structural motif twists two alpha helical protein domains into a “coiled coil,” characterized by a periodicity of 3.5 residues per turn and repetitive leucines appearing at every seventh position of the polypeptide chain. Due to the amino acid sequence and the periodicity of the helices, the leucine side chains are arranged along one face of the α helix and form a hydrophobic surface that modulates dimerization. Hydrophobic residues additional to leucine also form the characteristic 3-4 repeat of α helices involved in “coiled-coil” interactions, and help contribute to the hydrophobic packing that drives dimerization. Together, this hydrophobic surface holds the two subunits together.|$|E
50|$|The amygdalae {{are also}} {{involved}} in appetitive (positive) conditioning. It seems that distinct neurons respond to positive and negative stimuli, {{but there is no}} clustering of these distinct neurons into clear anatomical nuclei. However, lesions of the central nucleus in the amygdala have been shown to reduce appetitive learning in rats. Lesions of the basolateral regions do not exhibit the same effect. Research like this indicates that different nuclei within the amygdala have different functions in appetitive conditioning.Nevertheless, researchers found an example of appetitive emotional learning showing an important role for the basolateral amygdala: The naïve female mice are innately attracted to non-volatile pheromones contained in male-soiled bedding, but not by the male-derived volatiles, become attractive if associated with non-volatile attractive pheromones, which act as unconditioned stimulus in a case of Pavlovian associative learning. In the vomeronasal, olfactory and emotional systems, <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> show that non-volatile pheromones stimulate the vomeronasal system, whereas air-borne volatiles activate only the olfactory system. Thus, the acquired preference for male-derived volatiles reveals an olfactory-vomeronasal associative learning. Moreover, the reward system is differentially activated by the primary pheromones and secondarily attractive odorants. Exploring the primary attractive pheromone activates the basolateral amygdala and the shell of nucleus accumbens but neither the ventral tegmental area nor the orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, exploring the secondarily attractive male-derived odorants involves activation of a circuit that includes the basolateral amygdala, prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area. Therefore, the basolateral amygdala stands out as the key center for vomeronasal-olfactory associative learning.|$|E

In this study we investigated the expression of <b>Fos</b> and Jun <b>proteins</b> in different models of terminal differentiation of human keratinocytes and in skin from psoriasis patients. All Jun and <b>Fos</b> <b>proteins,</b> {{with the exception of}} FosB, were efficiently expressed in keratinocytes in monolayer cultures. In contrast, in normal epidermis as well as in organotypic epidermal cultures, the expression pattern of AP- 1 proteins was dependent on the differentiation stage. <b>Fos</b> <b>proteins</b> were readily detected in nuclei of keratinocytes of basal and suprabasal layers. JunB and JunD were expressed in all layers of normal epidermis. Interestingly, expression of c-Jun started suprabasally, then disappeared and became detectable again in distinct cells of the outermost granular layer directly at the transition zone to the stratum corneum. In psoriatic epidermis, c-Jun expression was prominent in both hyperproliferating basal and suprabasal keratinocytes, whereas c-Fos expression was unchanged. These data indicate that AP- 1 proteins are expressed in a highly specific manner during terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and that the enhanced expression of c-Jun in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes might contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis...|$|R

40|$|Paradoxically, fear {{conditioning}} (odor– 0. 5 mA shock) {{yields a}} learned odor preference in the neonate, presumably {{due to a}} unique learning and memory circuit {{that does not include}} apparent amygdala participation. Post-training opioid antagonism with naltrexone (NTX) blocks consolidation of this odor preference and instead yields memory of a learned odor aversion. Here we characterize the neural circuitry underlying this switch during memory consolidation. Experiment 1 assessed post-training opioid modulation of <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> expression within olfactory circuitry (olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, amygdala). Odor–shock conditioning with no post-training treatment (odor preference) induced significant changes in <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> expression in the granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb and anterior piriform cortex. Post-training opioid receptor antagonism (odor aversion) prevented the learning-induced changes in the anterior piriform cortex and also induced significant changes in <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala. Experiment 2 assessed intra-amygdala opioid modulation of neonate memory consolidation. Post-training infusion of NTX within the amygdala permitted consolidation of an odor aversion, while vehicle-infused pups continued to demonstrate an odor preference. Overall, results demonstrate that opioids modulate memory consolidation in the neonate via modulating <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> expression in olfactory circuitry. Furthermore, these results suggest that opioids are instrumental in suppressing neonate fear behavior via modulating the amygdala...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} distinct functions of <b>Fos</b> <b>proteins</b> in different mouse tissues and cell lines. Here, we perform a direct {{comparison of the}} features of exogenous c-Fos, Fra- 1 and Fra- 2 proteins expressed in murine tumor cells of epithelial origin, CSML 0. Although transactivation potential of c-Fos is much stronger than that of Fra- 1 and Fra- 2, all three proteins are capable of modulating transcription of target genes. Moreover, there is a certain degree of specificity in the induction of the transcription of AP- 1 -responsive genes by different <b>Fos</b> <b>proteins.</b> For instance, c-Fos and Fra- 1 but not Fra- 2 activated genes of the urokinase system. Additionally, not only a strong transcriptional activator c-Fos, but also Fra- 1 induced morphological alterations in CSML 0 cells. N-terminal domain of Fra- 1 was required for this function. On the other hand, Fra- 2 failed to change morphology of CSML 0 cells. We therefore conclude that c-Fos, Fra- 1 and Fra- 2 differently activate transcription of target genes and induce morphological changes in epithelioid carcinoma cells in a manner not directly linked to their transactivation potentials...|$|R
40|$|The AP- 1 {{transcription}} factor {{is composed of}} members of the Fos, Jun and ATF families, and {{plays a key role in}} tumor progression. We investigated whether <b>Fos</b> <b>proteins</b> regulate cell motility, and if so, whether this capacity is related to their transactivation potential. Two cell lines with different expression profiles of AP- 1 were employed focusing on the Fos-family members c-Fos, Fra- 1 and Fra- 2. Transactivation motifs are found in c-Fos, but not in Fra- 1 or Fra- 2. The adenocarcinoma CSML 0 cells display a low motility and do not express Fra- 1 or Fra- 2, and only very little c-Fos. In contrast, the fibroblastoid L 929 cells express both Fra- 1 and Fra- 2, but no c-Fos, and these cells display a high motility. Transfection with Fra- 1 or c-Fos, but not with Fra- 2, strongly enhanced the motility of CSML 0 cells. The effect of Fra- 1 required the presence of the N-terminal domain of this protein. Conversely, transfection with a Fos dominant-negative mutant or with anti-sense fra- 1 or fra- 2, strongly reduced the motility of L 929 cells. Changes in cell motility correlated with the morphological appearance and the degree of contact with the substratum.

Increases in the levels of Jun and <b>Fos</b> <b>proteins</b> and JNK activity have been reported in scenarios in which cells undergo apoptosis.

The study aimed to assess {{the response of the}} arcuate and periven-tricular hypothalamic nuclei, using <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> as a marker of neuron activity, and to compare that response with the GH response to differ-ent stimuli in {{the presence or absence of}} SRIF in prepubertal female rats. Rats received the following intraperitoneal stimuli: GHRH (1 μg/kg), GHRP- 6 (1 μg/kg), ghrelin (1 μg/kg), and GHRH combined with either GHRP- 6 or ghrelin, with or without SRIF pretreatment 90 minutes prior to stimulus. The animals were decapitated at different intervals; trunk blood was obtained for the measurement of GH levels using a radioim-munoassay technique, and hypothalamic sec-tions were processed for immunochemical determination of <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> expression. In the arcuate nucleus, except for GHRP- 6 all stim-uli increased <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> activity in the absence of SRIF pretreatment; the same effect was achieved by pretreatment with SRIF, although this pretreatment prevented the increase in neuronal activity following all stimuli, except that with GHRH + GHRP- 6. In the periven-tricular nucleus, stimulus with GHRH, GHRP- 6, ghrelin and GHRH+ghrelin caused a decline in <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> expression in the absence of SRIF, whereas SRIF pretreatment prompted a decrease in <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> expression that was counteracted by GHRP 6 and GHRH + ghrelin. Peak serum GH values were record-ed 15 minutes after the administration of GHRH+ghrelin and GHRH+GHRP- 6. SRIH pretreatment inhibited GH release, with a subsequent «escape » and lack of response to stimulation which lasted at least 30 minutes, except following the administration of GHRH.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{phosphorylation}} of the nuclear oncoprotein Fos by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). We demonstrate that the human c-Fos protein, phosphorylated either in vitro with purified PKA or in vivo in JEG 3 cells following treatment with forskolin, has similar phosphotryptic peptide maps. Serine 362, which constitutes part of a canonical PKA phosphorylation site (RKGSSS), is phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro. A mutant of <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> in which serine residues 362 to 364 have been altered to alanine residues is not efficiently phosphorylated in vitro. Furthermore, <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> in which serines 362 to 364 have been altered to alanine shows increased transforming potential. We propose that phosphorylation of Fos by PKA is an important regulatory step in controlling its activity in normal cell growth and differentiation.

Additionally, we aimed at investigating eventual correlations between behaviors in the plus-maze and activation of limbic structures as measured by <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> expression after the second session. Rats were tested for 5 min in the elevated plus-maze and re-tested 3, 9 or 33 days later. Other groups were tested only once.

The expression of <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> in the piriform cortex, septal nucleus and paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus in the groups tested with intervals of 9 and 33 days were statistically different from the other groups. The alterations observed in exploratory behavior in the second session in the plus-maze did not correlate with Fos expression. In conclusion, although the specific test conditions were sufficient to evoke behavioral alterations in exploration in the elevated plus-maze, they were enough to induce significant <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> expression in piriform cortex, septal nucleus and thalamic and hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei but not in other areas such as dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and amygdala nuclei, known to be also active participants in circuits controlling fear and anxiety.

Experimental approaches to the quantification of Fos induction have mainly been based on immunohistochemistry and subsequent measure of Fos immunoreactivity (IR) in sections of the SCN. In this study, the authors compare several methods of quantification using optical density image analysis or counts of Fos-IR labeled cells. To assess whether optical density measures using image analysis reflect the amount of Fos in brain tissue, the authors developed standards of known concentrations of <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> in an agar matrix. The agar standards were sectioned and treated simultaneously with sections of the SCN from animals exposed to different levels of irradiance. Optical density was found to be proportional to the quantity of Fos in the sections, indicating that this measure accurately reflects relative levels of <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> induction. Quantification by optical density analysis allows an objective measure in which the various parameters, conditions of illumination, and threshold can be maintained constant throughout the analysis. Counting cells by visual observation is more subjective because threshold values cannot be precisely defined and can vary according to the observer, illumination, degree of label, and other factors. In addition, cell counts involving direct visual observation, automated cell counts, or stereological methods do {{not take into account the}} difference in the density of label between cells, thus giving equal weight to lightly or densely stained cells.

The brains were removed and fixed, and sections containing the CEA and LH were processed for <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> immunohistochemistry. The results show that in the control group, intramuscular in-jection of a ketamine/xylazine mixture did not induce IR-Fos cells in the CEA or LH. However, in the 70 g group, IR-Fos was the strongest observed (P < 0. 05, Newman-Keuls) in the CEA and L...|$|E
40|$|Activation of the AP- 1 {{complex of}} {{transcription}} factors {{is one of}} the earliest nuclear responses to mitogenic stimuli. We demonstrate directly that AP- 1 activity is required for human cells to proliferate in response to serum. We also find that activity of the AP- 1 complex is selectively reduced in old human fibroblasts prior to their entering a fully senescent state. Levels of <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> induced through diverse signal transduction pathways, the amount of AP- 1 DNA binding activity in vitro, and the activity of an AP- 1 -dependent reporter gene in vivo are substantially decreased as fibroblasts age. Moreover, the composition of the AP- 1 complex changes, so that old cells produce predominantly Jun-Jun homodimers instead of Fos-Jun heterodimers. Changes in AP- 1 activity may be due in part to changes in posttranslational modification of <b>Fos</b> <b>protein</b> that impair its ability to form active DNA-binding heterodimers with Jun. These data suggest that changes in AP- 1 activity may contribute to the inability of senescent cells to proliferate in response to mitogens...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} <b>Fos</b> and Fos-related <b>proteins</b> {{are unable}} to form homodimers and to bind DNA {{in the absence of}} a second protein, like c-Jun for example. In order to study the implications of hydrophobic point mutations in the c-Fos leucine zipper on DNA binding of the entire c-Fos protein, we have constructed and purified a set of <b>Fos</b> mutant <b>proteins</b> harboring one or several isoleucine or leucine residues in the five Fos zipper a positions. We show that a single point mutation in the hydrophobic interface of the c-Fos leucine zipper enables the c-Fos mutant protein to bind specifically to an oligonucleotide duplex harboring the TRE consensus sequence TGA(C/G) TCA. This point mutation (Thr 169 →Ile) is situated in the a position of th...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin 1 (IL- 1) induces {{pleiotropic}} {{effects in}} many cell types during inflammation and immunity. We have recently shown how the IL- 1 signal is {{transmitted to the}} nucleus: In T cells and in pituitary cells, IL- 1 induced genes via activation of the nuclear factor AP- 1. We now demonstrate how IL- 1 activates the AP- 1 factor in liver cells, which are a major target for IL- 1 during the acute phase response in vivo. IL- 1 induced gene transcription of both AP- 1 components, c-jun and c-fos. IL- 1 also increased the stability of c-jun mRNA. We define two enhancer sites in the jun promoter that are required for induction by IL- 1. Although the binding sites share some similarity with the AP- 1 binding site, the nuclear factors binding the jun motifs are not composed of Jun or <b>Fos</b> <b>proteins.</b> Thus these data identify two binding proteins that serve {{as one of the}} first nuclear targets for IL- 1 signal transduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcription}} factor AP- 1, composed of Jun and <b>Fos</b> <b>proteins,</b> {{is a major}} target of mitogen-activated signal transduction pathways. However, {{little is known about}} AP- 1 function in normal cycling cells. Here we report that the quantity and the phosphorylation state of the c-Jun and JunB proteins vary at the M–G 1 transition. Phosphorylation of JunB by the p 34 cdc 2 –cyclin B kinase is associated with lower JunB protein levels in mitotic and early G 1 cells. In contrast, c-Jun levels remain constant while the protein undergoes N-terminal phosphorylation, increasing its transactivation potential. Since JunB represses and c-Jun activates the cyclin D 1 promoter, these modifications of AP- 1 activity during the M–G 1 transition could provide an impetus for G 1 progression by a temporal increase in cyclin D 1 transcription. These findings constitute a novel example of a reciprocal connection between {{transcription factor}}s and the cell cycle machinery...|$|R
