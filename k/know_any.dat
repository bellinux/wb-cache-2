5|$|Then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev {{sang the}} song {{together}} {{when they met}} in Moscow in 1959 to reduce the tension between them during the Kitchen Debate. As the story goes, Nixon did not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> Russian songs, but Khrushchev knew that one American song {{as it had been}} sung on the Ed Sullivan show.|$|E
5|$|Secondary School {{is a big}} {{waste of}} time. What are French {{teachers}} doing? None of us can speak French. How much maths can you do? Do you <b>know</b> <b>any</b> history? What is the point in training people {{to do things that}} none of us can do? The system seems designed to qualify you for the Indian Civil Service in 1911. We all leave school unable to drive! Now that would be quite handy.|$|E
5|$|The {{band has}} also seen musicians such as Keith Morris and Chuck Biscuits briefly {{fill in for}} a show or two. Morris, who was {{fronting}} the Circle Jerks at the time, filled in for Kiedis for a show in 1986. Kiedis was off scoring drugs and missed the band's performance so they asked Morris to fill in however Morris didn't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> of the lyrics to the songs so he screamed and yelled {{his way through the}} show. Drummer Chuck Biscuits also briefly filled in on drums back in 1986.|$|E

Its purpose is to facilitate communication between representatives of different Slavic nations, {{as well as to}} allow people who do not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> Slavic language to communicate with Slavs. For the latter, it can fulfill an educational role as well.|$|E

They do not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> of the members of team ALICE.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} claims that Sonboly {{deliberately}} targeted people of Turkish or Arab origin, groups he apparently felt had picked on him at school. The state government {{said that the}} victims were not chosen in any way and Sonboly did not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> of them. Police {{thought it was a}} coincidence that all of the fatalities were of immigrant backgrounds, as the McDonald's near the shopping mall was patronised by the children of migrants.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer's {{second major}} {{departure}} from Kant's epistemology concerns the body. Kant's philosophy was formulated {{as a response}} to the radical philosophical skepticism of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically. Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission. There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we <b>know</b> <b>any</b> object of sense perception: our own body.|$|E

25|$|A {{thorough}} {{history is}} always taken, including signalment (age, sex, breed), recent activity, diet and recent dietary changes, anthelmintic history, if {{the horse is}} a cribber, fecal quality {{and when it was}} last passed, and any history of colic. The most important factor is time elapsed since onset of clinical signs, as this has a profound impact on prognosis. Additionally, a veterinarian will need to <b>know</b> <b>any</b> drugs given to the horse, their amount, and the time they were given, as those can help with the assessment of the colic progression and how it is responding to analgesia.|$|E
25|$|Janković {{was then}} {{taken to the}} Staff Headquarters of the VRS 22nd Brigade in Kneževo, where he spoke to two survivors, Medo Sivac and Midhat Mujkanović, who told him how they had managed to survive by jumping down when the {{shooting}} started. He drove them personally to Banja Luka and later on they were transferred to the Islamic Humanitarian Association Merhamet. Jankovic said {{that because of the}} large number of victims he referred the case to the Public Safety Station in Banja Luka for further investigation and claimed that he did not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> further details concerning the perpetrators or victims.|$|E
25|$|Coincidentally Anytus appears, whom Socrates praises {{as the son}} of Anthemion, {{who earned}} his fortune with {{intelligence}} and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well-suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to <b>know</b> <b>any.</b> Socrates then questions why it is that men do not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles and Thucydides, and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of slander, warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his trial.) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue.|$|E

500|$|Tech's fight song [...] "I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech" [...] {{is known}} worldwide. First {{published}} in the 1908 Blue Print, it was adapted from an old drinking song ("Son of a Gambolier") and embellished with trumpet flourishes by Frank Roman. Then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev sang the song together when they met in Moscow in 1958 to reduce the tension between them. As the story goes, Nixon did not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> Russian songs, but Khrushchev knew that one American one {{as it had been}} sung on The Ed Sullivan Show.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{decided to}} have the film open with the statement [...] "Hell is a teenage girl" [...] to reflect the [...] "horrors" [...] of puberty and that [...] "the hellish emotions felt during high school often reappear as teenage girls mature into young women". Cody stated: There's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing makeup on her face. I always thought {{that was such a}} sad image. She's so vulnerable. I don't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> woman who hasn't had a moment {{sitting in front of the}} mirror and thinking, 'Help me, I want to be somebody else.'

500|$|Ryo {{chose to}} {{distribute}} his music on Nico Nico Douga {{because he liked}} the website along with its response system, which enables user's comments to appear overlaid on the video screen. Ryo did not originally intend to use Hatsune Miku as the vocalist for his songs, and most members of Supercell {{did not even know}} of Miku until after [...] "Melt" [...] gained popularity. [...] Since Ryo did not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> singers, he was recommended by his friends to use Miku, which he thought was a good idea since videos using Miku were already widely being distributed on Nico Nico Douga at the time.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers criticized Lone Survivor for {{focusing}} more on its action scenes than on characterization. In {{his review}} for The Star-Ledger, Stephen Whitty wrote, [...] "This {{is the sort}} of bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once, and it would work here, if Berg had the sense to develop these men as characters, first. But we don't really get to <b>know</b> <b>any</b> of them, or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, [...] "The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were." ...|$|E
500|$|At school, Julia starts {{shouting}} at Miranda for letting Annemarie drink soda and eat sandwiches, saying that because Annemarie is epileptic {{she has to}} eat a special diet. Miranda explains that she didn't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> of that. Colin is later hanging out with Sal. Colin then asks Miranda {{if she wants to}} hang out. Miranda declines saying that her mom is sick. Later on, someone taps on her door which scares her because she doesn't know anyone that knocks like that. She looks though the peep hole [...] and sees Colin. She opens the door and he looks at her then kisses her. She then kisses him back. Colin smiles and then runs off.|$|E
