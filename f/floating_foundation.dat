25|$|Ideol’s {{engineers}} have developed and patented a ring-shaped <b>floating</b> <b>foundation</b> {{based on a}} central opening system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the sloshing water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations. Foundation-fastened mooring lines are simply attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position. This <b>floating</b> <b>foundation</b> is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). Manufacturable in concrete or steel, this <b>floating</b> <b>foundation</b> allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol’s technology and planned to be built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and installed by mid-2017 {{off the coast of}} Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV). The construction of this project, France's first offshore wind turbine (precisely 2 MW), is already underway since 1 June 2016.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011, Principle Power's WindFloat Prototype was {{installed}} 4km offshore of Aguçadoura, Portugal in approximately 45m of water (previously the Aguçadoura Wave Farm site). The WindFloat was {{fitted with a}} Vestas V80 2.0-MW offshore wind turbine and grid connected. The installation was the first offshore wind turbine to be deployed {{without the use of}} any offshore heavy lift vessels as the turbine was fully commissioned onshore prior to the unit's being towed offshore. This is the first offshore wind turbine installed in open Atlantic waters, and the first to employ a semi-submersible type <b>floating</b> <b>foundation.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Before the 1906 earthquake, {{the house}} had been seven stories high, but today it is only four stories. The house is {{predominantly}} made of redwood, as Mrs. Winchester preferred the wood; however, she disliked the look of it. She therefore demanded that a faux grain and stain be applied. This is why almost all the wood in the home is covered. Approximately [...] of paint were required to paint the house. The home itself is built using a <b>floating</b> <b>foundation</b> that is believed to have saved it from total collapse in the 1906 earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. This type of construction allows the home to shift freely, as it is not completely attached to its brick base. There are roughly 161 rooms, including 40 bedrooms, 2 ballrooms (one completed and one unfinished) as well as 47 fireplaces, over 10,000 panes of glass, 17 chimneys (with evidence of two others), two basements and three elevators. Winchester's property was about [...] at one time, but the estate has since been reduced to – the minimum necessary to contain the house and nearby outbuildings. It has gold and silver chandeliers, hand-inlaid parquet floors and trim, and a vast array of colors and materials. Due to Mrs. Winchester's debilitating arthritis, special [...] "easy riser" [...] stairways were installed as a replacement for her original steep construction. This allowed her to move about her home freely as she was only able to raise her feet a few inches high. There was only one working toilet for Winchester, but all other restrooms were decoys to confuse spirits. This is also the reason why she slept in a different room each night.|$|E

40|$|GVA {{is a small}} {{engineering}} consultancy firm, with specialized focus in design of floating structures such as oil production platforms. The key business is at {{the oil and gas}} market, but the firm also have some projects at other markets. One of these is the offshore wind industry, which is a growing market with great potential in the near future. GVA has some experience in offshore wind and see greater potential in the industry to diversify their business. The purpose of this master thesis is to analyse the potential for GVA in the offshore wind market by looking at industry drivers, the underlying market development, as well as the industry structure. By matching the market characteristics with GVA resources and capabilities strategies for entering the market can be derived. The focus is narrowed down to three specific segments of the offshore wind market, where GVA has suitable competence and that can be entered with limited investments. Within the segments, substations, fixed <b>foundations,</b> and <b>floating</b> <b>foundations,</b> GVA can utilize existing in-house knowledge and hence carry out projects at lower risk. The analysis confirm the potential in the industry, but also the challenges which needs to be overcome in order for the offshore wind market to experience rapid growth. GVA’s main advantages are within the substation segment, because of the largest design scope, their former experience, existing customer relationship and possibility to enlarge the product offering. However, the analysis also shows a great future potential for GVA in <b>floating</b> <b>foundations.</b> The <b>floating</b> <b>foundations</b> segment is still in an emergent stage without dominant design and large commitment would be required to enter at this early point. Competition within fixed foundations is fierce and economies of scale are getting increasingly important. Therefore, this segment is not considered as attractive to GVA. Overall, GVA’s strengths lie in their offshore competence and experience in {{the oil and gas industry}} combined with the design expertise. On the contrary, the technical knowledge needed in offshore wind is not as advanced as in GVA’s other projects. Also, GVA is currently dependent upon one customer in offshore wind and their lower willingness to accept risks can block further development in the market. The analysis also shows that offshore wind customers value customer intimacy and operational excellence higher, in contradiction from oil and gas clients who value product leadership as the most important. This implies a need to adjust current strategies to satisfy customers in offshore wind better. The recommendations suggest focusing on customer intimacy as a differentiator at the market, but also to take a more active role in industry development and to seek new customers. By focusing on being an offshore advisor and increasing the product offering with partners this can be achieved. However, the most important recommendation for GVA is to clearly define their goal and wanted position in order to guide in decisions and to support activities performed...|$|R

60|$|A little scream from Mrs. Budd, {{which was}} dutifully {{taken up by}} the maid, {{interrupted}} the speech of the latter, and every eye was turned on Mulford, as if to ask an explanation of the groaning sound that had been heard within the wreck. The young mate comprehended only too well. The rolling of the wreck had lifted a portion of the open hatchway above the undulating surface of the sea, and a large quantity of the pent air within the hold had escaped in a body. The entrance of water to supply the vacuum had produced the groan. Mulford had made new marks on the vessel's bottom with his knife, and he stepped down to them, anxious and nearly heart-broken, to note the effect. That one surging of the wreck had permitted air enough to escape to lower it in the water several inches. As yet, however, the visible limits of their <b>floating</b> <b>foundation</b> had not been sufficiently reduced {{to attract the attention of}} the females; and the young man said nothing on the subject. He thought that Jack Tier was sensible of the existence of this new source of danger, but if he were, that experienced mariner imitated his own reserve, and made no allusion to it. Thus passed the day. Occasionally the wreck rolled heavily, when more air escaped, the hull settling lower and lower in the water as a necessary consequence. The little bubbles continued incessantly to rise, and Mulford became satisfied that another day must decide their fate. Taking this view of their situation, he saw no use in reserving their food, but encouraged his companions to share the whole of what remained at sunset. Little persuasion was necessary, and when night once more came to envelope them in darkness, not a mouthful of food or a drop of water remained to meet the necessities of the coming morn. It had rained again for a short time, in the course of the afternoon, when enough water had been caught to allay their thirst, and what was almost of as much importance to the females now, a sufficiency of sun had succeeded to dry their clothes, thus enabling them to sleep without enduring the chilling damps that might otherwise have prevented it. The wind had sensibly fallen, and the ground-swell was altogether gone, but Mulford was certain that the relief had come too late. So much air had escaped while it lasted as scarce to leave him the hope that the wreck could float until morning. The rising of the bubbles was now incessant, the crevices by which they escaped having most probably opened a little, in consequence of the pressure and the unceasing action of the currents, small as the latter were.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{floating}} {{wind turbines}} (FWTs) {{may be the}} more economical and suitable systems with which to exploit offshore wind energy in deep waters. Among {{the various types of}} <b>floating</b> <b>foundations</b> for offshore wind farms, a tension leg platform (TLP) foundation can provide a relatively stable platform for currently available offshore wind turbines without requiring major modifications. In this study, a new multi-column TLP foundation (WindStar TLP) was developed for the NREL 5 -MW offshore wind turbine according to site-specific environmental conditions, which are the same as the OC 3 -Hywind (NREL) conditions. The general arrangement, main structure and mooring system were also designed and investigated through hydrodynamic and natural frequency analyses. The complete system avoids resonance through the rotor excitations. An aero-hydro-servo-elastic coupled analysis was carried out in the time domain with the numerical tool FAST. Statistics of the key parameters were obtained and analysed and comparisons to MIT/NREL TLP are made. As a result, the design requirements were shown to be satisfied, and the proposed WindStar TLP was shown to have favourable motion characteristics under extreme wind and wave conditions with a lighter and smaller structure.

25|$|Because of the {{previous}} factors, {{one of the biggest}} difficulties with offshore wind farms is the ability to predict loads. Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw) platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for <b>floating</b> systems. <b>Foundations</b> and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore wind systems, and must take into account every single one of these factors. Load transfer in the grout between tower and foundation may stress the grout, and elastomeric bearings are used in several British sea turbines.|$|R

40|$|Floating {{offshore}} wind energy is being widely implemented in deep-water sites thanks to its numerous advantages, which among others include the access to stronger and undisturbed wind resources. In addition, considering the fast-paced growth in size and power generating capacity of {{offshore wind}} turbines, the designs of <b>floating</b> <b>foundations</b> need to be continuously improved. Therefore, proper testing (at model-scale) is necessary. To achieve this, several factors {{need to be taken}} into account. For instance, down-scaling for testing of floating structures brings challenges due to the so-called Reynolds effects, which degrade the aerodynamic response of the mounted turbine. Likewise, the rotation of the blades and the motions of the platform {{as a result of its}} interaction with waves, have an impact on the wind inflow acting upon the rotor. Thereby, modifying its instantaneous performance. This Master thesis, carried out in cooperation with MARIN (Maritime Research Institute Netherlands), focuses on developing a reliable methodology that renders in the design of a scaled-down thrust-matched 10 MW wind turbine rotor blade, for its further implementation in the testing of a floating offshore support structure. For this purpose, the aforementioned effects are investigated, and a suitable set of design tools is selected and coupled, in order to realise an optimised blade geometry. For predicting the wind turbine behaviour, this implementation relies on the Blade Element Momentum Theory. Furthermore, the resulting blade's aerodynamic performance is validated using ReFRESCO (MARIN’s in-house CFD code), against the non-dimensional parameters of the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine...|$|R
40|$|The {{wind power}} {{potential}} {{in deep water}} is huge and estimations made by The European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) suggests that floating wind power in the North Sea alone can meet the power demand in Europe four times over. Norway adopted the Offshore Energy Act in July 1, 2010 and based on this NVE was given the responsibility to assess the potential for offshore wind power along the Norwegian coast. The study areas were first revealed by the report "Offshore wind - proposed study areas" and later underwent a comprehensive assessment in the follow-up report "Offshore wind - strategic impact assessment”. Based on this work five study areas were recommended for opening, where Utsira Nord is the only area that uses a floating structure. Through {{the use of the}} energy modeling software Retscreen 4, a feasibility study has been conducted based on forecasted costs and prices for Utsira Nord in the year 2020 and 2030. It is clear from the results that a wind farm using floating structure will not be technically and economically feasible with today's forecasted price and cost scenario for neither 2020 nor 2030. At its current state, the technology is too immature and lacks suppliers. Granting <b>floating</b> <b>foundations</b> are commercialized and available by the year 2020, the costs remain too high to make a floating wind park economically profitable.

40|$|The Gautrain Rapid Rail Link is a {{state-of-the-art}} rail route {{and one of}} the ten Spatial Development Initiatives planned in Gauteng Province, South Africa. The route comprises two links, namely a link between Tshwane (Pretoria) and Johannesburg and a link between OR Tambo International Airport and Sandton. A total of 10 stations are linked by approximately 80 kilometres of rail along the proposed route. Between Johannesburg and Pretoria in the southern Tshwane region, the rail alignment is underlain by dolomite bedrock for approximately 15 km in the vicinity of Centurion between Nelmapius Drive and The Fountains, including nearly 6 km elevated on a viaduct. The stability of the rapid rail link constructed over the dolomitic sections was considered a major project risk due to its proneness to sinkholes and subsidences along this route. Construction on heterogeneous soils, pinnacled bedrock and other geohazards posed major challenges to the construction team. To facilitate detailed design and adapt proper foundation options for the viaducts founded over the dolomitic terrain, rigorous and comprehensive ground investigations were conducted by the Bombela Civils Joint Venture (BCJV).
