Each of the conditions required the driver to complete one loop of the 2.7 -mile course and the order of the conditions was counterbalanced across participants. The OSPAN condition induced a continuous secondary-task load, whereas the task load in the IVIS condition was intermittent. Any <b>driving</b> <b>sections</b> with turns were excluded from the DRT and video analyses to minimize the potential of a manual confound.|$|R
5000|$|Thames Trains had {{inherited}} a driver training package from British Rail, but this had evolved {{to the point}} where in February 1999, a concerned incoming training manager commissioned an external audit which reported “The trainers {{did not appear to be}} following the training course syllabus and supporting notes as they considered these to be ‘not fit for purpose’ with inappropriate time allowances for some sessions. The traction and introduction to <b>driving</b> <b>section</b> of the course has been extended and the six week route learning session is being used as additional practical handling”. Indeed, Michael Hodder's 16 weeks practical training had been given by a trainer who felt that [...] “I was not there to teach ... the routes. I was totally to teach ... how to drive a Turbo; the training manager was unaware of this. Details of signals which had been repeatedly passed at danger should have been supplied to trainers and passed on to trainees; no trainer had done so, and the practical trainer quoted above was unaware that SN109 was a multi-SPAD signal.Testing of trainees was similarly unstructured and unstandardised, with no clear pass/fail criteria.Under the previous British Railways training regime, trainees would have spent far longer in training and once qualified, were not allowed to drive over the notoriously difficult approach to Paddington until they had at least two years' experience on less complex routes. Hodder had only qualified 13 days earlier; he was ex-navy with no previous experience as a railway worker, but no special attention was paid to this in either training or testing. It must be concluded therefore that driver’s training was not adequate for the task for which he was being prepared. The very favourable comments made as to his progress by his various teachers have to be viewed against the background that his teachers were working with a less than perfect training programme.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design optimization process for interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSM) for hybrid electric compressors (HEC) which {{are applied to}} hybrid electrical vehicles. A hybrid electric compressor is composed of an electric motor <b>driving</b> <b>section</b> and an engine <b>driving</b> <b>section</b> which {{is connected to the}} engine by a pulley belt. A hybrid electric compressor driving motor requires half of the full driving power of a compressor. Even though an engine is not operated at the idling stop mode, the electric motor drives the air-conditioner compressor by itself so that the air conditioning system can produce its minimum cooling capacity. In this paper, the design optimization of an IPMSM for a 42 (V) applied voltage system is studied using the design of experiment (DOE) and response surface method (RSM) of 6 sigma.

40|$|Blowouts once {{covered the}} entire {{northern}} section of North Padre Island {{as a result}} of overgrazing, but are now restricted to a 5. 5 km length of beach where driving is permitted between the low water line and the toe of the foredune. A comparison between this <b>driving</b> <b>section</b> and a directly adjacent non-driving section of the beach reveals {{a significant difference in the}} ratio of storm run-up (Rhigh) to the elevation of the dune toe (Dlow), suggesting that the foredunes within the <b>driving</b> <b>section</b> are more susceptible to scarping and blowout development. Where driving is permitted, blowouts are located in areas where Rhigh/Dlow ratio is locally large, suggesting that the location of blowouts depends on the alongshore variation in storm surge. Results of a cluster analysis reveal two distinct blowout types, in which the relatively small blowouts of Cluster 1 are characterized by a small throat and limited expansion beyond the foredune. The large and more active blowouts of Cluster 2 tend to be found closer to the access road, where driving on the beach is more concentrated and the larger Rhigh/Dlow suggests a greater potential for scarping during relatively small storms. The development of these blowouts feeds back on the height of the foredune, making it susceptible to scarping and washover during tropical storms and hurricanes. It is argued that historical overgrazing and recent beach driving have significantly altered this landscape and represents a long-term threat to island resilience and have the potential to hasten island transgression with sea level rise. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Statistical analysis revealed significant increases from the first to the last <b>driving</b> <b>section</b> of alpha band power; with larger effect sizes for the alpha spindle based measures. An increased level of fatigue for drop-outs, as compared to participants who did not abort the drive, was observed only by means of alpha spindle parameters.

It is demonstrated that alpha spindles are superior to EEG band power measures for assessing driver fatigue under real traffic conditions...|$|E

The influence of different <b>driving</b> <b>sections</b> on the associations between older drivers’ eye movement and visual ability were explored via spatial analysis and visualisations [74, 75].|$|R
