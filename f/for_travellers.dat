5|$|Charing Cross {{railway station}} {{was built on}} the Strand in 1864, {{providing}} a boat train service to Europe, which stimulated the growth of hotels in the area to cater <b>for</b> <b>travellers.</b> These included the Charing Cross Hotel, attached to the station itself. Today, there are several luggage outlets and tourist agents on the Strand, as well as old postage stamp dealers. The philatelist Stanley Gibbons opened a shop at No.435 in 1891. It moved to No.391 in 1893, and is now currently based at No.399.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Turnpike Act 1734, Oldham had no turnpike road to Manchester {{for another}} 56 years and Church Lane, Oldham {{remained}} {{part of the}} main street through the town. But following a further Act of Parliament a turnpike was constructed. The first regular coach service to Manchester came into operation in October 1790, with a journey time of over 2 hours and a fare 2s.8d (about 13p), with half fare <b>for</b> <b>travellers</b> {{on top of the}} coach.|$|E

5|$|The abbey {{relatively}} quickly {{fell into}} disuse and eventual disrepair after its dissolution at the Reformation, the {{lead from the}} roof rumoured to {{have been used in}} the 16th century civil wars and the stonework plundered for housebuilding throughout the town. The ruins were a popular site <b>for</b> <b>travellers</b> during the 17th and 18th centuries, and finally in 1815 the remains were taken into the care of the State for preservation. The remains are now administered by Historic Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Alpine spaniels {{were kept}} by the canons of the monasteries in the Alps in order to search <b>for</b> <b>travellers</b> during heavy snow storms, {{including}} the Great St. Bernard Hospice in the Great St Bernard Pass between Italy and Switzerland. The dogs would be dispatched in pairs to search for fallen travellers, and were trained so that upon finding them {{would return to the}} canons in order to lead rescuers back to the unfortunate individuals. The Alpine breed was also used as a watchdog to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|Construction began around 1210 by Bishop Jocelin of Wells but principally {{dates from}} 1230. Bishop Jocelin {{continued}} the cathedral building campaign begun by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin, and {{was responsible for}} building the Bishop's Palace, {{as well as the}} choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital <b>for</b> <b>travellers</b> and a chapel within the liberty of the cathedral. He also built a manor house at Wookey, near Wells. The chapel and great hall were built between 1275 and 1292 for Bishop Robert Burnell. The windows had stone tracery. Stone bosses where the supporting ribs meet on the ceiling are covered with representations of oak leaves and the Green Man. The building is seen as a fine example of the Early English architectural style.|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{small number}} of embassies, Azerbaijan can be more {{difficult}} to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem. In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures <b>for</b> <b>travellers</b> to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E
5|$|The Pont du Gard {{has been}} a tourist {{attraction}} for centuries. The outstanding quality of the bridge's masonry led to it becoming an obligatory stop for French journeymen masons on their traditional tour around the country (see Compagnons du Tour de France), {{many of whom have}} left their names on the stonework. From the 18th century onwards, particularly after the construction of the new road bridge, it became a famous staging-post <b>for</b> <b>travellers</b> on the Grand Tour and became increasingly renowned as an object of historical importance and French national pride.|$|E
5|$|A mill {{was built}} on Welhay stream but this was {{replaced}} by tidal mills. In the 17th century the City of Bristol bought the manors of North Weston and Portishead {{for access to the}} channel and as a place to stay outside of the city and, in the 19th century, as a seaside resort. An outer sea wall was built allowing the local marshes to be drained and increased the land available for farming. The dominant architecture is early Victorian, with some buildings maintaining their original features. The expansion in residential property coincided with the construction of the dock, pier and the rail link to Bristol. The Royal Hotel by the pier was built in a Tudor Gothic style in 1830, to provide accommodation and catering <b>for</b> <b>travellers</b> on the steamers from Bristol, Wales and Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Bishop Savaric's successor, Jocelin of Wells, again {{moved the}} bishop's seat to Bath Abbey, {{with the title}} Bishop of Bath. Jocelin was a brother of Bishop Hugh II of Lincoln and {{was present at the}} signing of the Magna Carta. Bishop Jocelin {{continued}} the building campaign begun by Bishop Reginald and was responsible for the Bishop's Palace, the choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital <b>for</b> <b>travellers</b> and a chapel. He also had a manor house built at Wookey, near Wells. Jocelin saw the church dedicated in 1239 but, despite much lobbying of the Pope by Jocelin's representatives in Rome, did not live to see cathedral status granted. The delay may have been a result of inaction by Pandulf Verraccio, a Roman ecclesiastical politician, papal legate to England and Bishop of Norwich, who was asked by the Pope to investigate the situation but did not respond. Jocelin died at Wells on 19 November 1242 and was buried in the choir of the cathedral; the memorial brass on his tomb is one of the earliest brasses in England. Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells.|$|E
5|$|Built {{around long}} narrow yards, {{as well as}} serving food and drink and {{providing}} lodgings, these coaching inns also served as temporary warehouses, auction rooms and gambling halls <b>for</b> <b>travellers</b> {{doing business in the}} market. The best known was the Angel, parts of which dated to the 15thcentury. As well as providing the other functions of the Norwich inns, its yard also served as a popular theatre and venue for other performers. (Despite its significance as a city, Norwich did not have a dedicated theatre until 1758.) However, in 1699 part of the building collapsed during a performance by Thomas Doggett's troupe of players, killing a woman and injuring many of the audience. The reputation of the Angel was severely damaged, and although still used for small scale entertainments such as puppet shows, it was never again used for full scale theatrical performances.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan Mahmud Bridge, a three-kilometre {{bridge over}} the Terengganu River, {{provides}} a road link between the two banks of the river (connecting Kuala Nerus to Kuala Terengganu) and Duyong Island. The city and suburbs are relatively easy to negotiate by car. Kuala Terengganu is connected to other towns via a good network of roads that are accessible from many major towns and cities in Peninsula Malaysia. The East Coast Expressway (LPT) E8, which starts from Gombak until Kuala Terengganu, has shorten the time <b>for</b> <b>travellers</b> to drive from the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It takes four hours to drive from Kuala Lumpur to reach the city via the LPT. Visitors can also drive to Kuala Terengganu by using the Federal Route 3 from Kuantan (besides using the LPT), Kota Bharu, and Johor Bahru that offers a more scenic view of the coastline and villages. From {{the north of the}} peninsula, Kuala Terengganu is reachable via East-West Highway 4 and Second East–West Highway 185.|$|E

5|$|The airport {{has three}} {{scheduled}} flights to the Vancouver International Airport every day, with one fewer on Sunday, provided by Air Canada Express. There {{is also a}} daily flight to the Calgary International Airport provided by WestJet Encore. The airport typically also has a few flights a week leaving Calgary at 8:45 PM and arriving in Penticton {{later on in the}} night, the plane then stays at the Penticton Airport and leaves for Calgary at 7:00 AM and arrives in Calgary around 9:00 AM. However, these flights were cancelled due to runway safety issues (See Airlines and destinations, below). Kelowna International Airport has affected traffic at the Penticton Regional Airport, with the former providing more direct flight and connection options <b>for</b> <b>travellers.</b> Penticton Regional Airport also recently underwent an expansion to add more seating area in the main terminal building as an addition to the extra WestJet Encore flights on certain days coming in and out of Penticton.|$|E
