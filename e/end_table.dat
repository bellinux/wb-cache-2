6000|$|She {{nodded and}} rose. They {{made their way}} out of the Rooms and down into the {{restaurant}} on the ground-floor. They found a little table near the wall and he ordered some pâté sandwiches and champagne. Whilst they waited she counted up her money, making calculations on a slip of paper. Draconmeyer leaned back in his chair, watching her. His back was towards the door and they were at the <b>end</b> <b>table.</b> He permitted himself the luxury of looking at her almost greedily; of dropping, for a few moments, the mask which he placed always upon his features in her presence. In his way the man was an artist, a great collector of pictures and bronzes, a real lover and seeker after perfection. Often he found himself wandering towards his little gallery, content to stand about and gloat over some of his most treasured possessions. Yet the man's personality clashed often with his artistic pretensions. He scarcely ever found himself amongst his belongings without realising the existence of a curious feeling, wholly removed from the pure artistic pleasure of their contemplation. It was the sense of ownership which thrilled him. Something of the same sensation was upon him now. She was the sort of woman he had craved for always--slim, elegant, and what to him, with his quick powers of observation, counted for so much, she was modish, reflecting in her presence, her dress and carriage, even her speech, the best type of the prevailing fashion. She excited comment wherever she appeared. People, as he knew very well even now, were envying him his companion. And beneath it all--she, the woman, was there. All his life he had fought for the big things--political power, immense wealth, the confidence of his great master--all these had come to him easily. And at that moment they were like baubles! ...|$|E

Both pass (though Cory admits that his table has a few imperfections). Angela also passes with husband Matt's support, taking so much pride in it that she wants to take the table home with her. As for Simon, frustration with the heat gun and later the blowtorch causes him to melt the acrylic and fail.|$|E

There {{were three}} tables and on the end one was a stack of 4 {{different}} sized circles, largest on bottom to smallest on top.

The adventurer that did this in the quickest time would win the challenge. Due to the earlier challenges Claw, Eleanor, had a 10-second advantage meaning that 10 seconds would be taken of her final time. Sting only had a 5-second advantage so Peter had 5 seconds taken off his final time. Eleanor went first and started at a really fast pace and managed to complete the puzzle fairly quickly but in a large number of moves. Peter then went, he had not been allowed to watch Eleanor, he started at a really fast pace then stopped mid game to think. This helped him a lot and enabled him to finish in fewer moves then Eleanor. Even with the time advantages deducted Peter still won, although it was very close.|$|E

Ted insists that Chloe has a crush on Marshall because she always laughs at his lame joke about how they fit a pumpkin into a pumpkin-flavored latte. As Marshall leaves, his name is called for (an unordered) pumpkin latte on which Chloe has written her number. Later, when Marshall {{introduces}} Chloe to Ted and Barney at the bar, they tell him that she has the [...] "Crazy Eyes", an indicator of future mental instability. Both Ted and Barney give Marshall examples of their experiences with this malady; Barney's crazy-eyed date wanted a threesome with a teddy bear, while Ted's crazy-eyed date picked up a long metal rod and repeatedly hit a car that nearly hit them as {{they were about to}} cross the street. Marshall shrugs it off. The next day, as Marshall is taking a test, he receives a call from Chloe who says that she is being followed by a hunchback with a limp. Later, Marshall takes Chloe back to his apartment and suspects that she broke a picture of him and Lily that was sitting on the <b>end</b> <b>table.</b> However, it turns out that Lily has been hiding in the apartment, and pops out (much to Marshall and Chloe's surprise).
