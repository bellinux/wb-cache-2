40|$|International audienceWe {{have made}} a {{literature}} survey and performed a critical analysis of the available experimental surface tension data for the most volatile compounds in petroleum fluids: nitrogen, methane, ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane. Including the selected data with those for oxygen, xenon, krypton and those obtained recently for 16 partially <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (<b>refrigerants),</b> we propose the following extended scaled equation to represent the surface tension of these substances:σ=kTc(NAVc) 2 / 3 (4. 35 + 4. 14 ω) t 1. 26 (1 + 0. 19 t 0. 5 - 0. 25 t) where t= 1 -T/Tc is reduced temperature, k, NA, Vc, and ω are the Boltzmann constant, Avogadro number, the critical volume and the acentric factor, respectively. This equation, which only differs slightly from that proposed by Schmidt et al. [J. W. Schmidt, E. Carrillo-Nava, M. R. Moldover, Fluid Phase Equilibria 122 (1996) 187 - 206] for refrigerants, yields values for σ within 3. 5 % of the experimental values for all these compounds.

40|$|The indoor {{environment}} has frequently been ignored {{as a significant}} source of exposure to air pollutants. To date {{there are a number of}} documented examples of levels of indoor air pollutants greatly exceeding those levels which commonly occur in the outdoor environment. Among these instances are airborne buildup of polynuclear aromatics and cadmium from cigarette smoke, lead from burning candles, and vinyl chloride from use of aerosols containing this substance as a propellant. These examples suggest that there may be additional sources of indoor air pollutants, particularly <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from aerosol products, which have heretofore not been generally recognized as important. The present paper endeavors to review those instances where <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the indoor air environment may build up to concentrations of potential public health concern. These considerations may be especially relevant in future years as increasing efforts are being made to insulate buildings more efficiently as a means to conserve energy.
