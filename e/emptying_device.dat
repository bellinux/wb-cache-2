40|$|Three essays are {{presented}} concerned with device dispatching {{within the framework}} provided by trip-based material handling systems, which represent {{a wide range of}} systems such as lift trucks and unit load automated guided vehicles in industrial applications and patient movement systems in healthcare applications. The move requests (MRs) arrive according to a Poisson process, and each MR is served, one at a time, by one of the devices, according to the dispatching rule. In the first essay, a new analytic model is developed to estimate <b>empty</b> <b>device</b> travel with multiple devices operating under the modified first-come-first-served (Mod-FCFS) dispatching rule. The analytic technique used in the first essay is extended in the second essay to develop a new analytic model to estimate <b>empty</b> <b>device</b> travel with multiple devices operating under the shortest-travel-time-first (STTF) rule, which is a simple, well-known, and efficient rule but difficult to model analytically. To our knowledge, the analytic model in the second essay is the first model to explicitly estimate <b>empty</b> <b>device</b> travel under STTF. Using simulation, we show that both models perform well in estimating <b>empty</b> <b>device</b> travel and the expected device utilization. We also investigate the MR wait times under STTF, and propose a new rule, namely B-STTF, to avoid excessive wait times which are known to occur under STTF. The results show that B-STTF is as efficient as STTF while successfully avoiding excessive MR wait times. In the third essay, we model intra-facility patient movement systems as a trip-based material handling system, where a “device” represents a patient mover (PM), and each “MR” represents a patient. Using simulation, we study the performance of the patient movement system {{as a function of the}} dispatching rule and the number/location of the equipment marshalling areas (that is, wheelchairs, gurneys, and closets). System performance is measured in terms of efficiency (i. e., reducing empty travel for the PMs and the expected MR wait times) and effectiveness (i. e., avoiding excessive wait times for the MRs). We observe that the FCFS dispatching rule is less efficient but it avoids excessive patient wait times since the MRs are served according to their order of arrival. In contrast, the STTF rule is efficient but some patients experience excessive wait times, which is detrimental. We thus present a new rule that strikes a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. We also analyze the impact of the number and location of the equipment marshalling areas. We observe that carefully planning the number and location of the marshalling areas based on usage by the PMs can improve the performance of the system as much as, if not more than, a more efficient dispatching rule...|$|R

A CPU-bound process, in contrast, generates I/O requests infrequently, using more of its time doing computations. It is important that a long-term scheduler selects a good process mix of I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes. If all processes are I/O-bound, the ready queue will almost always be empty, and the short-term scheduler will have little to do.

Patients inhaled through <b>empty</b> <b>devices</b> after reading the patient information leaflet. If serious errors potentially affecting dose delivery were recorded, they repeated the inhalations after watching a training video. Inhaler technique was assessed by a trained nurse observer and an electronic inhalation profile recorder.

Results: Patient medical history could be constructed from primary and secondary diagnosis associated with individual database entries. Asthma exacerbations could be proxied by a prescription of acute oral corticosteroids, hospital admission or emergency room attendance associated with a diagnosis of asthma, lower respiratory infection or respiratory failure. Patients could be considered switch patients if they received a prescription of a pMDI after prescription of ≥ 2 DPI inhalers.

Results: pMDI and pMDI with spacer were identified correctly by 89 % and 79 % of interns. Over 90 % could identify rotahaler and nebulizer whereas only 9 % could identify turbuhaler. 79 % and 60 % could prepare pMDI and pMDI with spacer appropriately. Nebulizer preparation was performed correctly by 79 % and almost all interns could not prepare turbuhaler. Only one intern administered turbuhaler correctly.

40|$|Chronic {{immunosuppressive}} therapy may have severe side-effects. In cell transplantation, the graft can be encapsulated within a membrane chamber, providing a physical barrier against the immune system. The cell graft then becomes {{dependent on the}} diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from the surrounding microcirculation. A major drawback has been the formation of avascular fibrotic tissue around the chamber. The immunoprotective device studied (TheraCyte) has an outer membrane inducing neovascularization. However, major parts of the encapsulated graft are still lost soon after transplantation, probably because of relative hypoxia and malnutrition. The overall aim of this thesis was to assess various strategies to improve islet graft survival in the device, using rodent models. The purpose of the first paper was to improve the method for histological evaluation of the vascularization around the device. Vascular profiles within various distances from the membrane surface were counted at different times and then correlated with glucose kinetics. We found that the vascular profiles within 100 ìm had the highest correlations with glucose kinetics and concluded that vessels within this distance are important for the exchange of small molecules between the circulation and the device s lumen. Therefore, we recommend that 100 ìm {{should be used in}} histological evaluations of the membrane vascularization. In the second paper we hypothesized that preimplantation of the device should improve encapsulated islet graft survival. Previous studies have indicated that it takes up to 3 months for recovery of the microcirculation after membrane implantation. Therefore, we implanted <b>empty</b> <b>devices</b> and transplanted islets 3 months later in these chambers. This approach significantly improved the cure rates of diabetic animals, and the islet dose required for cure was reduced by about 10 times. Morphometry evaluations confirmed increased graft survival in preimplanted devices. The third paper aimed at evaluating the effects of exendin- 4 treatment on the metabolic outcome after islet transplantation. Exendin- 4 inhibits islet apoptosis, stimulates islet differentiation and regeneration and has beneficial effects on peripheral tissues. We found that exendin- 4 treatment significantly improved the metabolic outcome after free islet transplantation to the renal subcapsular site. The benefit lasted longer than the treatment, suggesting that exendin- 4 had long-standing effects on the islet graft. This substance seems to be an interesting new approach to improve the survival also of encapsulated islet grafts. In the last paper we evaluated the risk of recipient sensitization using macroencapsulated islets. A heterotopic heart graft was transplanted one month after free or encapsulated islet transplantation. The time-to-rejection was significantly shorter in the free islet group, while it did not differ between encapsulated islet graft recipients and naive animals. We therefore conclude that the device protects against sensitization, at least during the first month after transplantation. Today, side-effects of the {{immunosuppressive therapy}} are one of the main limiting factors for the use of islet transplantation. If immunoprotection could be achieved by encapsulation of the islet graft, {{it should be possible to}} widen the indications. This thesis describes promising strategies to improve the survival of macroencapsulated islet grafts, which might contribute to make macroencapsulation a clinical reality...|$|R

Animals received standard intensive care (control, n = 5), treatment with an <b>empty</b> BAL (<b>device</b> control, n = 5) or with a cell-loaded BAL (BAL-treatment, n = 5) for a period of 24 h starting 24 h after hepatectomy. Coagulation parameters studied concerned prothrombin time (PT), platelet count, the procoagulant system (factors (F) II, FV, FVII, FVIII and fibrinogen), anticoagulant system (AT III), fibrinolytic system (t-PA, PAI- 1) as well as markers of coagulation factor activation (TAT complexes, prothrombin fragment F 1 + 2). FII, FV, FVII, AT III and fibrinogen rapidly decreased after total hepatectomy in pigs in accordance with the anhepatic state of the animals. FVIII levels were not influenced by the hepatectomy. A mild drop in platelet count was seen in all groups. Treatment of anhepatic pigs with the cell-loaded BAL did not restore PT or clotting factor levels. TAT and F 1 + 2 complexes, however, were significantly increased in this group. Levels of t-PA and PAI- 1 were not influenced by cell-loaded BAL treatment. Treatment of anhepatic pigs with the AMC-BAL based on freshly isolated porcine hepatocytes does not result in an improved coagulation state due to extensive consumption of clotting factors. However, increased levels of TAT complexes and prothrombin fragments F 1 + 2 during treatment of anhepatic pigs indicate synthesis and direct activation of coagulation factors, leading to thrombin generation.

When a container is stored <b>empty,</b> its MoCo <b>Device</b> will daily report about its position and battery level {{according to a}} fixed Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) time (e.g. 12 : 00 UTC time). This way, neighbouring containers will all transmit {{around the same time}} and communication can be more easily optimized. This status is called REST mode. When the container is stuffed, its doors are closed and a MoCo Reader will send a trigger, putting the MoCo Device in Secured Transport Mode (STP mode). From now on, the MoCo Device will send 2 -hourly status updates and reports of optional sensors attached to the cargo, again according to UTC time. In addition, it will immediately report about any critical event that occurs. Finally, there is an optional mode called Secured Vessel Mode (SVE mode). By sending a trigger from a MoCo Router to a MoCo Device upon loading the container in the vessel, the MoCo Device can go to energy-saving mode, where the 802.15. 4 radio is disabled, an internal clock is scheduled and no status updates are sent until the device wakes up again.|$|R

This work aimed to predict powder aerosolisation in DPIs through numerical modelling. Methods: A multi-scale modelling technique based on the combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM) approach was developed. Results: The simulation results of the detachments of the drug particles from single carrier under different impact velocities and angles were comparable with those measured in the experiments in terms of fine particle fraction FPF loaded. Empirical equations were developed to link the detachment performance with impact velocity and impact angle. Then the dynamics of the carrier particles in Aerolizer® was simulated. The results indicated that the carrier-wall impaction was the dominant mechanism for drug aerosolisation performance. By linking the empirical equations with the carrier-wall impact energy, the predictions showed that for a given formulation mass with a fixed carrier/drug ratio, the inhaler performance decreased with carrier size and increased with air flow rate. <b>Device</b> <b>empty</b> efficiency, however, was independent with carrier size and flow rate. Conclusions: The multi-scale model was able to provide quantitative information to better understand the aerosolisation mechanisms of carrier-based formulation...|$|R
40|$|Endostatin (ES) is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of angiogenesis and tumor growth. Continuous ES delivery of ES improves the efficacy and potency of the antitumoral therapy. The TheraCyte (R) system is a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) semipermeable membrane macroencapsulation system for implantation of genetically engineered cells specially designed for the in vivo delivery of therapeutic proteins, such as ES, which circumvents the problem of limited half-life and variation in circulating levels. In order to enable neovascularization at the tissues adjacent to the devices prior to ES secretion by the cells inside them, we designed a scheme in which <b>empty</b> TheraCyte (R) <b>devices</b> were preimplanted SC into immunodeficient mice. Only after healing (17 days later) were Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing ES injected into the preimplanted devices. In another model for device implantation, the cells expressing ES where loaded into the immunoisolation devices prior to implantation into the animals, and the TheraCyte (R) were then immediately implanted SC into the mice. Throughout the 2 -month study, constant high ES levels of up to 3. 7 mu g/ml were detected in the plasma of the mice preimplanted with the devices, while lower but also constant levels of ES (up to 2. 1 mu g/ml plasma) were detected in the mice that had received devices preloaded with the ES-expressing cells. Immunohistochemistry using anti-ES antibody showed reaction within the device and outside it, demonstrating that ES, secreted by the confined recombinant cells, permeated through the membrane and reached the surrounding tissues.
