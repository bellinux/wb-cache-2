Also from the Rhondda Fawr was sculptor Robert Thomas; born in Cwmparc, his heavy cast statues have become icons of contemporary Wales, with many of his works publicly displayed in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|While the Crusades had causes <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> in {{the social}} and {{political}} situations of 11th-century Europe, the event actually triggering the First Crusade was a request for assistance from Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Alexios was worried about the advances of the Seljuqs, who had reached as far west as Nicaea, not far from Constantinople. In March 1095, Alexios sent envoys to the Council of Piacenza to ask Pope Urban II for aid against the Turks.|$|E

50|$|Squamanita citricolor is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Tricholomataceae. Found in Zaire, it was first {{described}} as new to science in 1998. Fruit bodies of the fungus have a yellow cap, and a whitish to yellowish stipe originating from a yellowish, <b>deeply</b> <b>rooting</b> basal bulb {{in the shape of}} an inverted cone. Microscopically, the fungus features very thick-walled spindle-shaped (fusiform) pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia.|$|R
40|$|The new Squamanita citricolor is {{described}} from Zaire (Democratic Republic of Congo).

Because {{it has to be}} assumed now that all Squamanita species are mycoparasites and that the basal body formerly called protocarpic tuber is in fact a deformed basidiocarp of another species infected by Squamanita mycelium it is proposed that the term ‘protocarpic tuber’ is replaced by the new term ‘cecidiocarp’...|$|R

Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Peart's {{performance}} {{style was}} <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> in hard rock. He drew {{most of his}} inspiration from drummers such as Keith Moon and John Bonham, players {{who were at the}} forefront of the British hard rock scene. As time passed, he began to emulate jazz and big band musicians Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. In 1994, Peart became a friend and pupil of jazz instructor Freddie Gruber. It was during this time that Peart decided to revamp his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components. Gruber was also responsible for introducing him to the products of Drum Workshop, the company whose products Peart currently endorses.|$|E
5|$|In Cambodia, the <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> {{tradition}} {{of using the}} Bengal and pygmy slow lorises in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Some {{people in the country}} believe dried slow loris can cure cancer. Slow lorises are also smoked for other traditional remedies. Traditional Khmer medicine practitioners in that region claim that medicines made from slow lorises can cure 100diseases, with some practitioners from the National Centre for Traditional Medicine reporting that slow loris are sometimes roasted alive under the assumption that this increases the medicine's potency. Slow lorises are also burned alive, causing their eyes to burst and release a liquid called minyak kukang (or loris oil), which is used in black magic and traditional medicine and is supposed to have life-giving qualities and act as a love potion.|$|E
50|$|This plant {{grows in}} {{undisturbed}} areas in Florida scrub habitat, {{often in the}} transition between scrub and sandhill areas. It prefers open habitat where it is not shaded by tall woody vegetation. Periodic wildfire is common {{in this type of}} habitat in its natural state, a process which keeps the taller vegetation from shading smaller herbs and shrubs. The <b>deeply</b> <b>rooting</b> taproot helps the plant to survive fires and then resprout. The plant grows in dry upland areas of the scrub in white, yellow, and gray sand types.|$|R

5|$|Polygamy is common, with 39% {{of women}} living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, {{making it difficult for}} them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} parts and {{derivatives}} of pygmy lorises in trade, {{such as the}} skin and the hair. All parts of the animal are used in traditional Khmer medicine. In Vietnam, medicine such as bone glue of monkey, is mainly produced by local people, but a smaller portion is also destined for restaurants or sold to visitors. The species is especially used for the assumed medicinal value of its hair. Traders have reported that they have difficulty keeping pace with demand—one trader claimed to have sold nearly 1,200 pygmy slow lorises during 2001–2002. In Cambodia, the <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> tradition of using the Bengal and pygmy slow loris in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh.|$|E
5|$|Under the new system, {{newly elected}} magistrates were awarded with {{automatic}} {{membership in the}} senate, although it remained difficult for a Plebeian from an unknown family to enter the senate. Several factors {{made it difficult for}} individuals from unknown families to be elected to high office, in particular the very presence of a long-standing nobility, as this appealed to the <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> Roman respect for the past. Ultimately, a new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy emerged, which replaced the old Patrician nobility. It was the dominance of the long-standing Patrician nobility which ultimately forced the Plebeians to wage their long struggle for political power. The new nobility, however, was fundamentally different from the old nobility. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only Patricians were allowed to stand for high office, and it was ultimately overthrown after those laws were changed. Now, however, the new nobility existed due to the organization of society, and as such, it could only be overthrown through a revolution.|$|E
50|$|These sands have {{decomposed}} to nutrient-poor, acidic heather soils (Podsols), partly with hardpan in the subsoil. On the south-western {{slope of}} the Teutoburg Forest, for example near Künsebeck, they occupy large areas. As a consequence of historic tillage techniques and long-term agricultural usage these soils are partly composed of <b>deeply</b> <b>rooting</b> humus, in scattered areas with a sod coat. Some isolated dells are located in south-westerly direction of the main ridge of the Teutoburg Forest, for example the Hesseln mountains. Slim clay-loam soils (Rendzina) have developed here from limestone and marlstone of the Cretaceous. These basic soils are typical locations for precious hardwood. The main ridge, for example represented by the Große Egge (=Big Harrow), is composed of sandstone of the Cretaceous. On this stone thick, acidic and rocky heather soils have built up.|$|R
40|$|Leaf area expansion, dry weight, {{and water}} {{relations}} of Phaseolus vulgaris L. and P. acutifolius Gray were compared during a drying cycle {{in the greenhouse}} to understand the characteristics which contribute to the superior drought tolerance of P. acutifolius. Stomates of P. acutifolius closed {{at a much higher}} water potential than those of P. vulgaris, delaying dehydration of leaf tissue. P. acutifolius had a more <b>deeply</b> penetrating <b>root</b> system, which also contributes to its drought tolerance. Root-shoot ratios did not differ between the two species either under well watered or water stressed conditions. Leaf osmotic potential was also similar in the two species, with no apparent osmotic adjustment during water stress. These results indicate that P. acutifolius postpones dehydration and suggest that sensitive stomates and a <b>deeply</b> penetrating <b>root</b> system are characteristics which, if incorporated into cultivated beans, might increase their drought tolerance...|$|R

5|$|Janáček {{came from}} a region {{characterized}} by its <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> folk culture, which he explored as a young student under Pavel Křížkovský. His meeting with the folklorist and dialectologist František Bartoš (1837–1906) was decisive in his own development as a folklorist and composer, and led to their collaborative and systematic collections of folk songs. Janáček became an important collector in his own right, especially of Lachian, Moravian Slovakian, Moravian Wallachian and Slovakian songs. From 1879, his collections included transcribed speech intonations. He {{was one of the}} organizers of the Czech-Slavic Folklore Exhibition, an important event in Czech culture at the end of 19th century. From 1905 he was President of the newly instituted Working Committee for Czech National Folksong in Moravia and Silesia, a branch of the Austrian institute Das Volkslied in Österreich (Folksong in Austria), which was established in 1902 by the Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Janáček was a pioneer and propagator of ethnographic photography in Moravia and Silesia. In October 1909 he acquired an Edison phonograph and {{became one of the first}} to use phonographic recording as a folklore research tool. Several of these recording sessions have been preserved, and were reissued in 1998.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary proliferating Green {{movements}} <b>deeply</b> <b>roots</b> in {{the process}} of globalization and neoliberal politics. With the facilitation of new technology, Green movements seem to become the novel vehicle to transcend the national, class, gender and racial borders. Meanwhile, ecofeminism raises the debates on woman nature nexus and posits woman at the forefront of fighting environmental crisis. This thesis parallels the two trajectories in the temporal and spatial contexts of cyborg space, ???global city??? and international environmental governance. This thesis unfolds the inherent connections, as well as contradictions in these spaces. Through scrutinizing the techniques of subjectivity in Green movements and ecofeminism, it examines the female subjects that are maneuvered, mobilized and displaced in the intersectional power dynamics of gender, class, race, sexuality and nationality of the neoliberal politics. Integrating transnational feminism, queer studies and ecofeminism, this thesis endeavors to pave new spaces for rethinking possible grounds for alliances in the neoliberal era...|$|R

40|$|Various organic {{fractions}} of an Indonesian tropical peat deposit were dated using radiocarbon accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Four different depth layers, deposited {{during the last}} 28, 000 14 C yr, were analyzed and the data compared to bulk sample analyses. The pollen extracts consistently produced the oldest dates. The bulk samples (< 250 μm and < 100 μm) often yielded the youngest dates. The age difference between the individual fractions depended on the layer depth and hence the true age of the sampled peats. The age discrepancy was highest (~ 16, 000 14 C yr) in the oldest peat material. We interpret {{this to be a}} consequence of the input of organic matter {{over a long period of}} time, with peat oxidation and/or no peat accumulation during the last glacial maximum (LGM). The age discrepancies were smaller (between 10 and 900 14 C yr) for the Holocene peat samples. It was concluded that the pollen extract fraction might be the most reliable fraction for dating tropical peat deposits that are covered by <b>deeply</b> <b>rooting</b> vegetation. © 2008, University of Arizon...|$|R
