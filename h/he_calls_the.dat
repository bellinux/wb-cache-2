5|$|Gunn {{feels the}} peak of his playing career was making what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> save of his life in the UEFA Cup match against Bayern Munich in 1993. This event was called the summit of Norwich City's history by The Independent. He is one of only nine Norwich players to win the club's Player of the Year award twice. He was made an inaugural member of Norwich City's Hall of Fame. He {{was a member of the}} Scotland {{national}} football team, making six appearances for his country in the early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|Within Christian teachings, {{the comment}} by Harris {{regarding}} what <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> self-limiting nature of prayer had been addressed years before by multiple authors. For instance, in the 19th century William Peabody discussed {{the efficacy of}} prayer {{in the face of}} what <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> immutability of the laws of nature. He said: ...|$|R

5|$|Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) berates Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{when she}} discovers that <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> entire office into {{the conference room}} every Monday to watch a movie. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) prods Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to ask Jan to give him Michael's job. After her awkward meeting with Dwight, where he {{declares}} {{he can be a}} better boss than Michael, Jan calls Michael and demands he get his branch under control.|$|E
5|$|Strange {{meanwhile}} {{finds himself}} on the moon where he meets the Watcher Uatu, who tells him that the strange events are due to an anomaly <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> Forerunner. The Forerunner is from the future and its presence {{in the past has}} disrupted reality to the point of impending annihilation of not only Strange's world but all other universes as well. Explaining his theory that the emergence of various superhumans on Stephen's Earth {{is the result of the}} universe trying to save itself, the Watcher tells Strange that he will not be able to repeat what he has learned while he is alive.|$|E
5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, which <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, {{which most}} probably contained remains {{taken out of}} the royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Bond awakens, {{tied up with}} Natalya in the helicopter, {{which has}} been {{programmed}} to self-destruct. They escape but are captured and transported to the Russian military archives, where Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin interrogates them. Just as Natalya reveals {{the existence of a}} second satellite and Ourumov's involvement in the Siberian massacre, Ourumov arrives and kills Mishkin. Intending to frame Bond for the murder, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> guards, but Bond and Natalya escape. In the ensuing firefight, Natalya is captured. Bond steals a tank and pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Trevelyan's train, where he kills Ourumov. Trevelyan escapes and locks Bond in the train with Natalya, setting it to self-destruct. As Bond cuts through the floor with his laser watch, Natalya triangulates Boris' satellite dish to Cuba. The two escape just before the train explodes.|$|E
5|$|Bones in the {{secondary}} burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is plausible {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to {{the secondary}} burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E
5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar are desperate for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High priest), is {{responsible for the death of}} their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to see that his sister has given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who predicts that the elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will be smarter. Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be good for the kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the child in a nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII. Maragathavalli, Kailasakaruppan's childless wife, rescues the abandoned child from the river, and the couple decides to raise him as their own, naming him Ukraputhan.|$|E

25|$|Extraversion and Neuroticism in the Big Five {{are very}} similar to Eysenck's traits of the same name. However, what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> trait of Psychoticism {{corresponds}} to two traits in the Big Five model: Conscientiousness and Agreeableness (Goldberg & Rosalack 1994). Eysenck's personality system did not address Openness to experience. He argued that his approach was a better description of personality.|$|E

25|$|In Rationality in Action (2001), Searle {{argues that}} {{standard}} notions of rationality are badly flawed. According to what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> Classical Model, rationality {{is seen as}} something like a train track: you get on at one point with your beliefs and desires and the rules of rationality compel {{you all the way}} to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture of rationality holds generally.|$|E
25|$|In the 6th century Jordanes named two tribes <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> Suehans and the Suetidi {{who lived}} in Scandza. They were famous for their fine horses. The Suehans were the {{suppliers}} of black fox skins for the Roman market. Then Jordanes names a tribe named Suetidi a name that is considered {{to refer to the}} Suiones as well and to be the Latin form of Sweþiuð. The Suetidi are said to be the tallest of men together with the Dani who were of the same stock.|$|E

25|$|In section one, Kant argues from {{common sense}} {{morality}} {{to the supreme}} principle of morality, which <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> categorical imperative. Kant thinks that uncontroversial premises from our shared common sense morality, and analysis of common sense concepts such as ‘the good’, ‘duty’, and ‘moral worth’, will yield the supreme principle of morality, namely, the categorical imperative. Kant’s discussion in section one can be roughly divided into four parts: (1) The good will (2) The teleological argument. (3) The three propositions regarding duty and (4) The categorical imperative.|$|E

In 1998 and 2008, he supported relaxation of the then strict laws against pornography, arguing that pornography can have some social benefits, and he has criticised what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> body-shame phobia against nudism, suggesting that nudity may be natural and healthy for society.|$|E
25|$|In Kierkegaard's meaning, purely {{theological}} assertions are subjective truths {{and they}} cannot be either verified or invalidated by science, i.e. through objective knowledge. For him, choosing {{if one is}} for or against a certain subjective truth is a purely arbitrary choice. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> jump from objective knowledge to religious faith a leap of faith, since it means subjectively accepting statements which cannot be rationally justified. For him the Christian faith {{is the result of}} the trajectory initiated by such choices, which don't have and cannot have a rational ground (meaning that reason is neither for or against making such choices). Objectively regarded, purely theological assertions are neither true nor false.|$|E
