5|$|As {{early as}} 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper {{essentially}} predicting {{the existence of}} the positron, after a paper by Paul Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the Dirac equation, which unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect. Oppenheimer, drawing on the body of experimental evidence, rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons. He argued that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a mass that is less than 0.55 {{times that of the}} Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E

30|$|There {{were several}} {{criteria}} {{used to select}} the respondents.

Rural respondents <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> rural household registration status and have lived in a village (not a small town or county). Their parents also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> rural household registration status, so they could work in or outside the village, but could not have their own shop or company.

5|$|Being a {{foreigner}} {{and possibly a}} hetaera, Aspasia was free of the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes, and thereby was allowed {{to participate in the}} public life of the city. She became the mistress of the statesman Pericles in the early 440s. After he divorced his first wife (c. 445 BC), Aspasia began to live with him, although her marital status remains disputed. Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been quite young, if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E

Elliot worries how to tell J.D. he's not moving in. And Ms. Miller goes in for her CT scan, which turns up a gigantic aneurysm in her temporal lobe. Dr. Cox breaks the news to Ms. Miller, pulling a curtain for privacy that also signals {{the end of the}} act.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually close family members. These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls gathered the instruments, substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E

5|$|Late glacial tool finds {{from the}} Upper Palaeolithic date to c.12,000BP: flint blades known as Cheddar points; smaller bladelets known as Cresswell points; scrapers; burins or lithic flakes; flint and bone awls; and a bone needle. Flint rarely occurs in Wales {{other than in}} drifts, or as small pebbles on beaches. Flint tools would {{therefore}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been brought to Gower from other areas, such as those now known as southern or eastern England, or Antrim, either as finished tools or as incomplete, or unworked, nodules. Remains of red fox, Arctic fox, brown bear, tundra vole, and possibly reindeer, were found {{at the same level}} as the Upper Palaeolithic tools, providing evidence of the climate c.12,000BP. Other animal remains excavated during the 19th century, which may predate the Late glacial finds, include mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, red deer and giant deer.|$|E

5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, there would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E

5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so {{could not have known}} about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he would probably <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E
