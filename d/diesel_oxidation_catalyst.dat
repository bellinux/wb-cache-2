5000|$|Continental Automotive Systems/NGK produce NOx sensors for {{automotive}} {{and truck}} applications. Several automobile and related {{companies such as}} Delphi, Ford, Chrysler, and Toyota have also put extensive research into development of NOx sensors. Many academic and government labs are pushing to develop the sensors as well. The term NOx represents several forms of nitrogen oxides such as NO (nitric oxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and N2O (nitrous oxide aka laughing gas). In a gasoline engine NO {{is the most common}} form of NOx being around 93% while NO2 is around 5% and the rest is N2O. There are other forms of NOx such as N2O4 (the dimer of NO2), which only exists at lower temperatures, and N2O5, for example. However, owing to much higher combustion temperatures due to high cylinder compression and turbo or supercharging, diesel engines produce much higher engine-out NOx emissions than spark-ignition gasoline engines do. The recent availability of Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) allows the properly equipped diesel engine to emit similar values of NOx at the tailpipe compared to a typical gasoline engine with a 3-way catalyst. In addition, the <b>diesel</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> significantly increases the fraction of NO2 in [...] "NOx" [...] by oxidizing over 50% of NO using the excess oxygen in the diesel exhaust gases.|$|E

The engine is a {{modified}} version of the Ford Duratorq 3.2 L diesel engine that has been adapted to meet emissions in the United States. To aid in economy, emissions, and reduce NVH, it has a high pressure common rail fuel injection system and piezo injectors that can spray up to five different injections per compression event. It has a water cooled EGR system to reduce the temperature of the exhaust gas before being recirculated through the intake. A unique feature to the emissions system is that the <b>diesel</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> (DOC) and the DPF have been combined into one singular unit as opposed to the traditional two separate units. Exhaust treatment continues with SCR which is done by the injection of diesel exhaust fluid in the exhaust to reduce NOx.

The engine also features a variable-flow oil pump to avoid wasting mechanical energy pumping excessive amounts of oil. It has cast aluminum, low friction pistons with oil squirters to keep them cool during heavy-load conditions, a die cast aluminum cam carrier to stiffen up the valve train and reduce NVH, and to increase low end durability, the crankshaft is cast iron and the connecting rods are forged.

The results indicate an increase of particle number concentration, formaldehyde emission and acetaldehyde emission while a decrease of particulate mass concentration, when the diesel engine is operated with biodiesel, compared with the diesel fuel. Adding ethanol in biodiesel can help to control particulate emissions, especially particle number concentration. However, the unregulated emissions, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and unburned ethanol are worsened with BE blended fuels. The <b>diesel</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalyst</b> (DOC) can effectively reduce particulate mass concentration, particle number concentration and unregulated emissions for all different fuels, while the conversion efficiency of DOC is different for each fuel.

Experiments were performed on a 4 -cylinder naturally-aspirated direct-injection diesel engine operating at a constant speed of 1800  rev/min for five engine loads. The experimental results show that at low engine loads, the brake thermal efficiency decreases with increase in fumigation methanol; but at high loads, it slightly increases with increase in fumigation methanol. The fumigation method results in {{a significant increase in}} hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) emissions, but decrease in nitrogen oxides (NOx), smoke opacity and the particulate mass concentration. For the submicron particles, the total number of particles decreases. In all cases, there is little change in geometrical mean diameter of the particles.

40|$|The {{influence}} of hydrogen over platinum and combined platinum–palladium <b>diesel</b> <b>oxidation</b> <b>catalysts</b> were investigated on the oxidation kinetics of CO, HC and NO. Although H 2 {{has been reported}} to {{have a positive effect on}} CO and HC oxidation as well as NO 2 formation over platinum catalysts, there is still uncertainty whether this is due to the temperature rise caused by H 2 oxidation or the result of a change in the reaction kinetics of CO, HC and NO oxidation by the production of intermediate species. The results have showed smaller H 2 concentrations are more effective in improving the catalyst light-off temperature as well as promoting NO oxidation over both platinum and platinum–palladium catalysts. It is suggested that these benefits are a result of not only the exothermic reactions which in turn increase the local catalyst temperature but also H 2 increasing the rate of reactions and the species accessibility to the catalyst active sites thus further CO, HC and NO oxidation can occur at lower catalyst temperatures...|$|R
