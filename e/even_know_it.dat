25|$|In 1927, a Canadian {{teacher and}} writer Florence Deeks unsuccessfully sued Wells for {{infringement}} of copyright and breach of trust, claiming {{that much of}} The Outline of History had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript, The Web of the World's Romance, which had spent nearly nine months {{in the hands of}} Wells's Canadian publisher, Macmillan Canada. However, it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in Toronto in the safekeeping of Macmillan, and that Wells did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> existed, let alone having seen it. The court found no proof of copying, and decided the similarities were {{due to the fact that}} the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources. In 2000, A. B. McKillop, a professor of history at Carleton University, produced a book on the case, The Spinster & The Prophet: Florence Deeks, H. G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past. According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author, and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case. In 2004, Denis N. Magnusson, Professor Emeritus of the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Ontario, published an article on Deeks v. Wells. This re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book. While having some sympathy for Deeks, he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers, she received a fair trial, adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004).|$|E

We were violated and it's not right." [...] She said, [...] "I’ve been raped, I’ve been sexually abused as a child and I’ve been fired because I wouldn’t sleep with my boss." [...] She said, [...] "I always thought it was my fault; that I didn’t do or say the right thing. I know young girls who’ve been raped and didn’t <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was rape.

And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E
500|$|Teasing John's role in [...] "Exit Wounds" [...] Marsters {{stated that}} he's someone [...] "who's in way {{over his head}} and doesn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> yet" [...] and that [...] "things do change" [...] in regards to his character. Chibnall, Marsters and {{producer}} Richard Stokes discuss the role of [...] "Exit Wounds" [...] in developing John's character and placing him on a redemptive path. Marsters felt the character to be on a [...] "journey" [...] whilst Chibnall deliberately played upon the question of [...] "can you trust him, or can't you?" [...] Stokes commented that the character isn't the [...] "selfish and anarchic" [...] character seen in [...] "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" [...] and that his [...] "affection and love for Captain Jack are enough to make him try and do the noble thing". Stephen James Walker, a writer of reference works on Doctor Who and its spin-offs, notes that because of the reluctance of Hart's collaboration with Gray and his remorse for his actions the episode leaves the audience [...] "a little more favourably disposed" [...] towards the character. In April 2008 Marsters indicated that he expected to return to Torchwood in the near future. He later expressed a desire to be part of Torchwoods fourth series after it was revealed the show would be largely produced in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on six {{songs from}} Breakaway. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{included}} as the album's opening and title track. She {{described it as}} a simple song, and further explained, [...] "I think that it's simplicity is what's beautiful about it. Whenever writers or producers come to work with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I've done; people didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was me!" [...] Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track [...] "Since U Been Gone", as [...] "not as [...] "smooth" [...] as pop or R Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, [...] "It's very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live." [...] Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, [...] "I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Because of You", was originally intended for Thankful. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. [...] "Gone", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, [...] "Addicted", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003). She remarked, [...] "I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And then I heard that Evanescence record... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.|$|E

2500|$|The single's {{original}} B-side was [...] "Don't Blame Me", {{which later}} appeared as an album track on their 1974 album Old New Borrowed and Blue. In a 1979 fan club interview, Lea said: [...] ""Don't Blame Me" [...] was a time-filler, I {{think that it}} was created as that. When it was used as a b-side, we didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was being used, it was chosen by the offices.

This is about one of those situations where the strange place that I ran into him was an awards show. I was seated a couple of seats {{away from him and}} there was so much that needed to be said, and neither one of us was willing to say it. We were both acting like we were engaged in conversations with people that we don't <b>even</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> was just miserable. I was telling my Mom about it later, and I said I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room. And then I was like, [...] "Gotta go. Bye!" [...] And my Mom is used to that at this point so, that's what this song is about." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} The Car Man differs {{completely}} from {{the plot of}} Bizet's Carmen. Although Bourne has commented {{that at least two}} characters, one male (probably Luca) and one female (Lana), were [...] "like" [...] the character of Carmen, and that Luca himself is [...] "The Car Man", no characters were intended to actually be Carmen. According to Bourne, [...] "I wasn't particularly interested in the story of Carmen, the opera. I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> that well, and I still don't know it that well, to be honest. I know there are parallels, but it was more the feeling of the music and the feeling of what we all know Carmen to be." [...] The story is loosely based on the 1934 novel The Postman Always Rings Twice by American novelist James M. Cain (1892–1977) and the 1946 and 1981 films of the same name respectively starring John Garfield and Lana Turner, and Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange.|$|E
