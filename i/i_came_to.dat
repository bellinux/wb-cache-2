5|$|In August 1918, a more {{virulent strain}} {{appeared}} simultaneously in Brest, France; in Freetown, Sierra Leone; {{and in the}} U.S. in Boston, Massachusetts. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> call it the Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain {{was not involved in}} the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E
5|$|Long ago, King Childeric <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{the forest}} to build a city while the Queen experimented with black magic to gain eternal life. A plague swept through the land, and she hid in her tower, while her husband and {{everyone}} below her perished. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty {{to go along with}} it. Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more.|$|E

5|$|When Mary <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the throne, she had Bucer and Fagius tried posthumously for heresy {{as part of}} {{her efforts}} to restore Catholicism in England. Their caskets were disinterred and their remains burned, along with copies of their books. On 22 July 1560, Elizabeth I {{formally}} rehabilitated both reformers. A brass plaque on the floor of Great St Mary's marks the original location of Bucer's grave.|$|E
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{followed}} a similar format: Dr. Cave's tenancy {{was cut short}} in 1551, when King Edward VI granted the abbey to William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, brother of the former Queen Catherine Parr. Much of the abbey stone was then {{used to create a}} new mansion on the site, for the Marquess. The Marquess only held the abbey for two years: after supporting Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, in 1553, on the accession of Bloody Mary, he was arrested and his lands were confiscated. Mary granted the abbey and mansion to her catholic supporter Edward Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings of Loughborough, however he too fell from favour when Mary's sister Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the throne.|$|E
5|$|The admirals, however, were {{reckoning}} {{without their}} sailors. The enlisted {{men of the}} High Seas Fleet, aware that Germany had lost the war, {{had no interest in}} dying {{for the sake of the}} Navy's honor. When the details of Plan 19 were leaked to the fleet, a mutiny almost instantly broke out, with sailors raising the red flag of revolution and refusing to obey their officers. Faced with a complete breakdown of discipline within his fleet, Admiral Hipper had no choice but to disperse his ships to their homeports in early November. Days later, on 11 November 1918, World War <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> an end.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} French troops helped stiffen {{resistance}} to the English, who abandoned Haddington in September 1549 and, {{after the fall of}} Protector Somerset in England, withdrew from Scotland completely. From 1554, Marie of Guise formally took over the regency, maintaining a difficult position, partly by giving limited toleration to Protestant dissent and attempting to diffuse resentment over the continued presence of French troops. When the Protestant Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the throne of England in 1558, the English party and the Protestants found their positions aligned and asked for English military support to expel the French. The arrival of English troops, and particularly the English fleet, in 1560, led to the besieging of the French forces in Leith, which fell in July. By this point Mary of Guise had died and French and English troops both withdrew under the Treaty of Edinburgh, leaving the young queen in France, but pro-English and Protestant parties in the ascendant.|$|E
5|$|When the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I succeeded to {{the throne}} there were changes in the {{leadership}} on the Isle of Wight and the castle. Worsley was dismissed in favour of a Roman Catholic appointee in 1553 and Udall was executed in 1555 {{for his role in}} the Dudley conspiracy to overthrow the Queen. When the Protestant Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the throne in 1558, however, peace was made with France and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to England. Elizabeth reappointed Worsley to his post and he carried out an extensive redevelopment of the castle. Worsley filled in half of the castle's courtyard to produce a solid artillery platform able to hold eight heavy guns with an uninterrupted field of fire over the sea, and he probably also constructed the Master Gunner's House on the other side of the castle. Nonetheless, an inspection in 1586 showed that the fortification was in poor condition. Work costing £50 was done in 1587, including the erection of an earth bulwark alongside the castle to mount additional guns. The next year saw the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish Armada, after which further repairs were carried out on the castle. By 1599 the Crown was informed that the castle, which was still considered an important defence for the Solent, needed expensive repairs.|$|E

25|$|In December 2013 in a blog {{article for}} The Spectator website {{published}} shortly after Nelson Mandela died, Rod Liddle wrote of BBC coverage: But for Christ's sake BBC, {{give it a}} bloody break for five minutes, will you?

That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion that he was a force for good rather than ill. I think <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.|$|E

25|$|The Flying Turns was {{the name}} of a roller coaster at Euclid Beach Park, but it was also the name for a type of roller coaster.
