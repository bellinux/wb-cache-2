She added, [...] " [...] different textures and things with my voice that I was really playing around with and having fun with on this record that I never even <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do, vocally".

500|$|Several Scandinavian {{actors were}} cast in major roles, {{including}} Pihla Viitala, Peter Stormare (who Arterton said had actually inspired her to start acting), Bjørn Sundquist, and Ingrid Bolsø Berdal. In addition, actors from Germany and Poland (including Thomas Mann, Rainer Bock, and Joanna Kulig) {{and other parts}} of the world were also cast. Viitala, a self-described [...] "big fan" [...] of Renner, said she was nervous at first, but found him [...] "extremely" [...] easy to approach, made a good connection, and enjoyed working with him. Wirkola said Berdal was chosen for her [...] "piercing" [...] eyes, adding: [...] "There are a lot of Norwegians in the film. Minor parts, but I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get great actors in small parts and Ingrid has a great physicality." [...] Stormare said he was only surprised at [...] "how smart Tom [...] is, and how broad this fantasy is and the span of his imagination," [...] his favourite aspect being how [...] "some of the witches are so sexy and cool." [...] He compared the film's production to being in Disneyland, saying it felt like a dream to him.|$|E

Les Daniels, in Batman: The Complete History (2004) wrote that the goal of ABC was to [...] "attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men." [...] According to Craig: [...] "I used to think the reason they hired me was because they <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ride my own motorcycle... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice." [...] A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes in television that came later (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen. As such, [...] "her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl {{through the use of a}} straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use." [...] However, Craig has also stated: [...] "I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model... They say it's because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that’s lovely." [...] During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women.|$|E

500|$|The Flyers had a {{difficult}} start to the 1987–88 season, partly attributed by Keenan {{to the absence of}} Hextall. Hextall returned to the Flyers line-up against the New York Rangers, and made over 40saves in a 2–2 tie. Just over a month later, Hextall became the first goaltender to shoot at goal and score in the NHL when he scored an empty net goal towards the end of a game against the Boston Bruins. The Flyers led 4–2 which prompted the Bruins to pull their goaltender in favour of an extra attacker. The puck was dumped into the Philadelphia zone by the Bruins, and Hextall picked it up without any players near him; his shot fired into the air, bounced and rolled into the net. Hextall had targeted becoming the [...] "first NHL goaltender to score a true goal" [...] over a year earlier, and, speaking after the game, commented that: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it. It was a matter of when." [...] Despite his early season suspension, and a shoulder injury late in the season which made him miss five games, Hextall played 62of the 67games for which he was available during the regular season. He recorded 30wins, and a GAA of3.50, slightly higher than during his rookie year. Hextall struggled in the playoffs: he was replaced in successive games of the series against the Washington Capitals having conceded four goals in each. In the final two games of the series, which the Capitals won 4–3, Hextall gave up a further 12goals, and completed the playoffs with a GAA of4.75.|$|E
500|$|After spring {{training}} in 1983, the California Angels assigned McLaughlin to minor league camp in Casa Grande, Arizona. He was eventually {{assigned to the}} Triple-A Edmonton Trappers, but was called up to the majors in June after pitcher Bruce Kison {{was placed on the}} disabled list. McLaughlin made his season debut with the Angels on June 7, against the Chicago White Sox, pitching 1 innings, giving up one earned run. When asked {{what it felt like to}} be back in the majors, McLaughlin responded, [...] "I'm just thankful the Angels gave me this an opportunity to get back in the big leagues [...] I always <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pitch but I had been labeled a trouble-maker". McLaughlin commented that the personnel on his previous teams felt he had an attitude problem, but that he did not want that to affect him while playing with the Angels, and that it was [...] "in the past". He picked up his first win of the season on July 1, against the Kansas City Royals. McLaughlin was optioned to the minor leagues in August. After hearing the news, McLaughlin was reportedly furious at the Angels front office staff and even threatened to retire. However, McLaughlin continued to play in the California minor league system, and even returned to the majors in September. In the minors that year, he played for the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers and the Double-A Beaumont Golden Gators, going a combined 5–4 with a 4.26 ERA in 26 games in 96 innings pitched. With the Angels, McLaughlin compiled a 2–4 record with a 5.17 ERA, and 45 strikeouts in 16 games, seven of which were starts.|$|E
500|$|Australian activist Julian Assange—the {{founder of}} WikiLeaks—appeared as himself. Many of his lines {{were written by}} Australian author Kathy Lette, {{who is one of}} Assange's friends. According to Lette, [...] "Julian and The Simpsons {{producers}} asked me to rewrite his scene and dialogue. I guess they just wanted me to add a little Aussie irony to the script. Julian does not suffer from an irony deficiency! I used to write a sitcom for Columbia Pictures, the long-running series The Facts of Life, so the producers <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> fire off a quip or two." [...] In 2010, Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant to extradite Assange from Britain to Sweden for questioning in relation to sexual assault allegations made against him there. Assange was arrested in England, before being freed on conditional bail until a decision would be made {{as to whether or not}} he should be extradited to Sweden. Assange recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in England. Jean, who directed Assange's performance from Los Angeles, only acquired a phone number to call and received no information about the whereabouts of the activist. According to Jean in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had found out through a rumor that Assange wanted to appear on the show. Casting director Bonnie Pietila was therefore given the task to contact Assange and make sure the guest appearance could happen. The episode features no reference to Assange's legal situation at the time of his recording. Jean commented that he is [...] "a controversial figure, and there's a good reason he's controversial. There was discussion internally whether or not to have him on the show, but ultimately we went ahead and did it." [...] Groening has said in an interview that [...] "We [...] dare ourselves to do things and Julian Assange was a dare." ...|$|E

500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E

Isaiah Washington was originally considered for the role of Derek Shepherd, which eventually went to Patrick Dempsey. Washington later received a callback from Rhimes to play Burke. He commented: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never be wrong in my heart about something so good and so genuine. Her writing just seemed very complex, very honest."
