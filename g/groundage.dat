5000|$|Rebecca <b>Groundage</b> Howard is {{reported}} to have been born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1829. A number of accounts indicate that Howard was a former slave, so this birthplace and the actual date of birth are more difficult to verify. [...] For instance, in the various census later taken in Washington Territory, Howard indicated a birthplace of Massachusetts. [...] While there may have been some slaves in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania at the time of Howard's birth in 1829, according to the Abolition of slavery timeline it was clearly illegal at that time in both states. Mrs. Howard must have had her own reasons for claiming former slave hood, which is really her business anyway.In 1843, Rebecca <b>Groundage</b> married a local cooper, Alexander Howard in New Bedford, Massachusetts. [...] Alexander Howard was 11 years her senior.|$|E
