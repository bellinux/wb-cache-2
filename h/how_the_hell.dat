500|$|Results May Vary was {{released}} on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> did he ever get to put this mess out?" [...] The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, [...] "At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto [...] But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?" [...] Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No.3 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
500|$|We had a {{marvelous}} antagonist, so omnipotent {{that for us}} to defeat it or even communicate with it, or {{have any kind of}} relationship with it, made the initial concept of the story false.

The second verse of the song is half-rapped by her. Jay-Z later appears to provide his rapped verse as he compares his relationship with Beyoncé to that of Ike and Tina Turner. He forgoes subtlety as he raps, [...] "Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ Slid the panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast". Similarly to Beyoncé, Jay-Z sings about the places they have had sex in their house.

500|$|The Frighteners was {{released}} in the United States in 1,675 theaters, and opened at #5, earning $5,565,495 during its opening weekend, averaging $3,335 per theater. The film eventually grossed a worldwide total of $29,359,216. The Frighteners ended up being a box office disappointment, mostly due to competition from Independence Day; in interviews conducted years after The Frighteners release, Jackson commented he was disappointed by Universal's ubiquitous marketing campaign, including a poster which [...] "didn't tell you anything about the picture", which he believed was the primary reason the film was not a financial success. Additionally, the film opened {{on the same day}} the Atlanta Summer Olympics began; when Jackson realized this and told the studio, they answered [...] "'We don't think so; our research indicates that's not the case...' And I just thought <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> do they know? There had only ever been three Olympic Games held in the United States in one hundred years!" [...] Jackson acknowledged The Frighteners tone made it hard to pigeon-hole and sell, and his experience on the film made him understand the importance of marketing.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Results May Vary was mainly negative. The album received [...] "generally unfavorable reviews" [...] on Metacritic, {{with a score}} of 33 out of 100.

According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> did he ever get to put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that {{can only be described as}} abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent throughout your new album—consistently crappy." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn't have bothered [...] having seen Limp Bizkit's 'other side', you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back". Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "Results May Vary has a few highlights — 'Almost Over' (very Everlast) and 'Phenomenon' (very Primus) — but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent".|$|E

50|$|Kane’s first {{stint as}} an {{informant}} lasted from 1994 to 1997 where he collected {{a total of}} $250,000. By April 1995 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was paying Kane $2,000 a week. With pressure in Montreal from the newly formed Provincial Wolverine bike squad and the recent arrest of his partner, Simard, on an unrelated murder charge, Kane would be brought into custody by the Nova Scotia RCMP for 18 months but would then be released due to the RCMP’s contradictory evidence. During his time in custody for a murder {{that he would be}} acquitted for, the RCMP would drop Kane as an informant. On August 23, 1999, a Montreal Urban Community Police Detective named Benoit Roberge approached Kane. In a few months time after that date, Kane would be under contract with the Surete du Quebec as an agent source, and not just an informant. This meant he had to detail everything he did with <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels, communicate with Roberge a few times a week, and testify about the things he did with <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels. In a 30-page contract Kane made with the police, he would have made upwards of $2 million and the total cost of his operation, including witness relocation and overtime and operating expenses for police handlers would have been over $8.6 million. Kane “kept them informed about what the top bikers in his circle were up to: where they were travelling; whom they were talking to; who had murdered whom and who was next; the Hells’ war plans against their Quebec rivals, the Rock Machine; their expansion plans into Ontario and Manitoba; and weapons and explosives purchases.” By December 1994 he told Corporal Verdon about all of the above happenings as well as <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels business connections with top members of the Italian mafia as well as their plans form an elite group of bikers called the Nomads. Some of such business connections that Kane told the RCMP about was <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels sent him twice to meet Moreno Gallo and Tony Mucci, members of the Italian mafia, to discuss drug trafficking. Kane’s reports gave unprecedented insight to <b>the</b> RCMP about <b>how</b> <b>the</b> inner echelon of <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels worked.|$|R

2500|$|With Hustle greenlit for filming, the {{production}} team began searching for actors to play both {{the main characters}} and the marks for each episode. The process was initially quite difficult; Crawford described his [...] "immediate thought [...] 'this is so good, <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> {{are we going to}} get a cast to live up to these characters?' ... Tony had created incredibly strong characters, each with their own particular style and panache, but they also had to form a believable, if unusual, 'family' unit". Robert Vaughn, the Academy Award-nominated star of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., was soon suggested as a natural choice to play Albert Stroller, the elderly 'roper' responsible for ensnaring potential marks. After meeting Vaughn over lunch, Crawford [...] " [...] straight away that he could bring a whole new dimension to the part of Albert". Vaughn was immediately offered the role, and asked to begin filming the following day.|$|E

5000|$|Ruhlen {{stresses}} the importance of the three-way i / u / a (i.e. masculine / feminine / neutral) ablaut in such forms as t'ina / t'una / t'ana ("son / daughter / child") {{as well as of the}} general American pronominal pattern na / ma (i.e. [...] "I / you"), first noted by Alfredo Trombetti in 1905. Some linguists have attributed this pronoun pattern to other than genetic causes. He refers to the earliest beginnings of the dispute, quoting from a personal letter of Edward Sapir to A.L. Kroeber (1918): [...] "Getting down to brass tacks, <b>how</b> in <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> are you going to explain general American n- 'I' except genetically?

Would {{the students of}} the Accademia delle Belle Arti di Brera be able to describe this geometry? Many artists painted scenes about Hell’s episodes, more focusing on the feelings and passions <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> is steeped in than referring to its geometry.

The work is divided into two parts: the first dedicated to mathematical foundations and the second devoted to artistic interpretation. The topics of mathematical lessons are the themes of the opening video. Intrigued by the relationships between geometric design and artistic concept, the students made scale drawings of <b>the</b> Divina Commedia’s <b>Hell,</b> by using both several paper frames types and different art techniques. Later they produced original art works by personal interpretation and unrelated to the scientific explanation. The results reflect various artistic and creative sensibilities: drawings, paintings, engravings. The artistic workshop, conducted by A. Angelini, invites the public to participate by creating own fantasy drawings given a Hell’s framework, as a sort of dream boxes. The drawings can be exhibited as well in the room...|$|R
