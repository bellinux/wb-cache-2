5|$|While Homer {{longs for}} his wife, Moe comes by the Simpsons' house to declare his {{interest}} in Marge, who turns him down. When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her in rags, Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him {{that that is not}} a good thing, but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, and can not afford to ever lose her trust again or he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

500|$|And the Mountains Echoed {{became the}} first to not deal {{directly}} with the Taliban, which featured prominently in both of his previous works. Though Hosseini did not consciously decide to avoid that topic, he stated that he was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had moved away from {{it in order to}} keep the storyline fresh. The characters' struggles were largely personal and unrelated to the political turmoil in Afghanistan. Hosseini added, [...] "I hope a day will come when we write about Afghanistan, where we can speak about Afghanistan in a context outside of the wars and the struggles of the last 30 years. In some way I think this book is an attempt to do that." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{deciding}} upon Kakashi's name, Kishimoto {{considered a}} number of possibilities: Kuwa (クワ, [...] "hoe"), Kama (カマ, [...] "scythe"), Botan (ボタン, [...] "peony"), Enoki (エノキ, a nettle tree), and Kakashi (カカシ, [...] "scarecrow"). He eventually decided upon Kakashi, and remains <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did to this day. In keeping with the meaning of his name, scarecrows are occasionally used to represent Kakashi; Naruto, for example, uses a scarecrow that is dressed like Kakashi to help him train for a combat test between the two. Likewise, scarecrows are at times added to the background of scenes in which Kakashi appears, {{as is the case}} with the cover of the Naruto manga volume three.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the eighth most-watched {{program of the}} week along with NBC's Sunday Night Football, with 11.4 million viewers, it {{received}} a 17 share in the ratings. Overall, the episode was well received by critics. Nina Hämmerling Smith of TV Guide quoted: [...] "Perhaps {{the best thing about}} the episode was the amount of screen time given to old favorites like Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). The show's most convincing writing has always been in the scenes when those two spar with House, and I was thrilled to see more of that". Most critics were surprised and interested by the performance of Chris Taub in this episode. Richard Keller of TV Squad, wrote that he was almost certain of the fact that Taub was going to be fired and he was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wasn't. He also quoted, [...] "For some reason I like Taub. Maybe because he's not pretty like the rest of them. He's just an everyday schlub who's a pretty decent doctor".|$|E

500|$|The project caused {{division}} in Blink-182, mostly between DeLonge and Hoppus. Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed," [...] DeLonge told Blender. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I felt like I had let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, [...] "The whole situation sucked. But I sang on the track because, at the heart of it, Tom and Travis are my friends. I'm sure Tom felt the tension and asked me as an offering. I was glad to have done it, and I was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> asked." ...|$|E
500|$|Basu {{wanted to}} cast a new girl from Kolkata for the autistic character. Basu's wife, Tani {{suggested}} Chopra's name for the role. However, Basu feared that audience would see [...] "the Priyanka Chopra" [...] and not the character due to Chopra's stardom. Basu explained [...] "I had the fear that I would see Priyanka Chopra in the character and Jhilmil wouldn’t work. This has happened in many films where known faces have harmed the character." [...] Priyanka Chopra was cast to play the part but, the development was not announced as Basu wanted to workshop first {{and see how it}} goes. After three days of workshop, Basu was convinced that Chopra could play the autistic part and reflected that he was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> chose Chopra for the role. Later, Basu revealed that he did not approach any actress other than Chopra for the autistic part. After Chopra was cast in the film, Kaif left the project for unknown reasons. Media reported that she may have opted out of the film because Chopra had been given a stronger role. Later, media reported that Asin was approached {{to play the role of}} the narrator, replacing Kaif. However, Asin was never signed to the project. Media reported that no other actress wanted to sign for the film because according to them, the autistic part was stronger. In July 2010, Mumbai Mirror reported that Chopra was ready to play the role of narrator and leave the autistic role, so that another actress could be cast in the film; Chopra did not want the film to stall. Basu confirmed this development and said, [...] "It’s true we’ve been unable to cast the other part." [...] After facing several casting problems, Basu chose {{to cast a}} completely new fresh face to play the second female role. In early December 2010, Ileana D'Cruz from south Indian films, was finalised for the second female lead, featuring as narrator and Kapoor's first love interest in the film.|$|E

[...] Smith continued, [...] "A year and change ago, I was trying to fucking desperately get Clerks III made for the 20th anniversary. And that desperation, I must have reeked of it, because I couldn't fucking find money and shit. But it was Tusk, it was people going 'Holy fuck! What else do you have?' And I was like, Clerks III, done. So everybody that's like, 'He failed, he failed,' thank you I failed into Clerks III. So, never trust anybody when they tell you how your story goes, man. You know your story. You write your own story.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{developed}} the Rocko character after visiting a zoo in the Bay Area and coming across a wallaby {{that seemed to}} be oblivious to the chaos around him. Murray combed through his sketchbooks, {{developed the}} Rocko's Modern Life concept, and submitted it to Nickelodeon, believing that the concept would likely be rejected. Murray felt they would not like the pilot, and he would just collect his sum and begin funding his next independent film. According to Murray, around three or four months later he had [...] "forgotten about" [...] the concept and was working on My Dog Zero when Simensky informed him that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode. Murray said that he was <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would get funding for My Dog Zero. On his website he describes My Dog Zero as [...] "that film that Linda Simensky saw which led me to Rocko." [...] "Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic" [...] was originally written as the pilot; the executives decided that Heffer Wolfe, one of the characters, would be [...] "a little too weird for test audiences". Murray, instead of removing Heffer from [...] "Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic", decided to write [...] "Trash-O-Madness" [...] as the pilot episode.|$|E
2500|$|At Loudon in the July race, Busch {{started in}} the front row {{alongside}} former teammate Brad Keselowski. After brother Kyle led 53 laps of the event, Kurt dominated the race leading for 102 laps and driving in the top ten. With about 75 laps left in the race Busch again crashed with Ryan Newman. Busch's crew fixed the car before the restart and got back on the track, but finished about 20 laps down. Kyle Busch, who finished in second spot in the race, stood up for Kurt as well as drivers such as David Gilliland, Danica Patrick and Kenseth. With his brother, Kyle spent the post-race ceremonies insulting Ryan Newman for his part in the accident. Kyle said to reporters [...] "I really hate that Kurt got tore up. He was the class of the race but man just stupidity. Ryan Newman is the biggest stupid idiot out there and is a big ogre. But we are all <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is out of a job." [...] It had been previously announced at nearly {{the same time as the}} post-race ceremonies, that Ryan Newman would not be a part of Stewart-Haas Racing in 2014. Newman just smiled when he heard these words and said [...] "They are both a heck of talent and both are good kids off the track but when they are on the track they are both not so bright.
