500|$|Iron forms {{compounds}} {{mainly in}} the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Traditionally, iron(II) compounds are called ferrous, and iron(III) compounds ferric. Iron also occurs in higher oxidation states, an example being the purple potassium <b>ferrate</b> (K2FeO4) which contains iron in its +6 oxidation state, although this is very easily reduced. Although iron(VIII) oxide (FeO4) has been claimed, the report could not be reproduced and such a species (at least with iron in its +8 oxidation state) {{has been found to}} be improbable computationally. [...] However, one form of anionic – with iron in its +7 oxidation state, along with an iron(V)-peroxo isomer, has been detected by infrared spectroscopy at 4K after cocondensation of laser-ablated Fe atoms with a mixture of O2/Ar. Iron(IV) is a common intermediate in many biochemical oxidation reactions. Numerous organometallic compounds contain formal oxidation states of +1, 0, −1, or even −2. The oxidation states and other bonding properties are often assessed using the technique of Mössbauer spectroscopy.|$|E

40|$|Iron {{assimilation}} by Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{has been}} shown to be important to their growth and virulence. Iron acquisition in vitro was studied in an agar diffusion assay employing the iron-binding protein conalbumin. The ability of various iron compounds to alter the growth-inhibitory effect of conalbumin was investigated. On an equimolar iron basis, citrate-containing iron compounds were most effective; hemin was slightly less effective; ferrous sulfate and ferrous ammonium sulfate were even less effective; and the ferric compounds, ferric nitrate, ferric chloride, and ferric dextran (Imferon), were least effective. The results suggested that, as with Escherichia coli and certain other bacteria, the Neisseria spp. may utilize a citrate-mediated iron transport system. Microbial siderophores were also tested for their ability to relieve the growth-inhibitory effect of conalbumin. Two phenolate siderophores and Desferal enhanced growth inhibition in the deferrated form, but were inactive in the <b>ferrated</b> form. Several trihydroxamates of the ferrichrome family and coprogen were inactive in either the deferrated or <b>ferrated</b> forms. Of the 12 different siderophores tested, only the dihydroxamates (schizokinen, arthrobactin, and aerobactin) were stimulatory, but then only in the <b>ferrated</b> forms. Apparently, even though those siderophores could be utilized as specific iron transport agents by the Neisseria spp., they could not compete with conalbumin for iron under these assay conditions...|$|R
40|$|Identification of {{unstable}} high-valent iron {{species in}} electron transfer reactions of ferrate(VI) (Fe$^{VI}$O$_{ 4 }$$^{ 2 -}$, Fe(VI)) {{has been an}} important challenge in advancing the understanding of the oxidative mechanisms of <b>ferrates.</b> This paper presents the first example of distinguishing various phases differing in the valence state of iron in the solid state reduction of Fe(VI) to Fe(III) oxides at 2358 C using hyperfine parameters, isomer shift and hyperfine magnetic field, obtained from nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron radiation (NFS). The NFS technique enables a fast data accumulation resulting in high time resolution of in situ experiments. The results suggest a reaction mechanism, involving Fe(V) and Fe(IV) species, in the thermal decomposition of K$_{ 2 }$FeO$_{ 4 }$ to KFeO$_{ 2 }$.

40|$|Background: Elucidation of {{the basic}} {{mechanistic}} and biochemical principles underlying siderophore mediated iron uptake in mycobacteria is crucial for targeting this principal survival strategy vis-à-vis virulence determinants of the pathogen. Although, an understanding of siderophore biosynthesis is known, the mechanism of their secretion and uptake still remains elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we demonstrate an interplay among three iron regulated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) proteins, namely, Rv 1348 (IrtA), Rv 1349 (IrtB) and Rv 2895 c in export and import of M. tb siderophores across the membrane and the consequent iron uptake. IrtA, interestingly, has a fused N-terminal substrate binding domain (SBD), representing an atypical subset of ABC transporters, unlike IrtB that harbors only the permease and ATPase domain. SBD selectively binds to non-ferrated siderophores whereas Rv 2895 c exhibits relatively higher affinity towards <b>ferrated</b> siderophores. An interaction between the permease domain of IrtB and Rv 2895 c is evident from GST pull-down assay. In vitro liposome reconstitution experiments further demonstrate that IrtA is indeed a siderophore exporter and the twocomponent IrtB-Rv 2895 c system is an importer of <b>ferrated</b> siderophores. Knockout of msmeg_ 6554, the irtA homologue in Mycobacterium smegmatis, resulted in an impaired M. tb siderophore export that is restored upon complementation with M. tb irtA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The element arsenic usually exists {{mainly as}} As() and As(V) in aqueous medium, and the {{migration}} and toxicity of arsenite {{are higher than}} those of arsenate. In order to improve the removal efficiency of arsenic, As() is generally oxidized to As(V). There are many kinds of methods to remove arsenic in an aqueous medium. When compared with others, coagulation and precipitation in <b>ferrated</b> sulfate salt is relatively simple and economical, which is suitable for use in remote rural locations. Because the As(III) is the main form of arsenic in groundwater, its transformation and removal are of widespread concern. In this paper, the behaviour of As() being removed in aqueous medium by FeSO 4, Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 and polymeric ferric sulfate (PFS) were investigated. It was found that when increasing amounts of sulfate <b>ferrated</b> salts are added the corresponding As() removal rates increased gradually until a limiting state was reached. The treatment effect of chemical agents can be shown as PFS> Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 > FeSO 4. The data for arsenite removal rates fitted the Langmiur equation well. The As() removal rates were influenced by pH, and the optimal removal rate of arsenic occurred at pH 7 ~ 9. Adsorption and co-precipitation could be the removal mechanism of As() ...|$|R

40|$|The {{virulence}} of Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{for chicken}} embryos {{can be modified}} in a predictable manner {{by the addition of}} microbial siderophores to the inoculum. "Meningobactin" and "gonobactin," siderophores isolated from iron-limited cultures of meningococci and gonococci, respectively, enhance the virulence of the relatively avirulent colony type 3 (T 3) organisms, but have essentially no effect on the virulence of T 1 organisms. Both of these compounds were found previously to stimulate in vitro growth of the pathogenic Neisseria spp. under conditions made iron limiting by the addition of conalbumin, the transferrin counterpart of chickens. Similarly, <b>ferrated</b> schizokinen and arthrobactin, both dihydroxamate siderophores which stimulated growth in iron-limited conditions in vitro, also enhanced virulence of T 3 organisms, whereas desferrioxamine B mesylate (Desferal), a trihydroxamate previously shown to be inhibitory in vitro, decreased the virulence of the T 1 colony form. This was due to the iron-binding function of the molecule, as the iron-saturated form, ferrioxamine B mesylate, did not affect virulence. An additional trihydroxamate siderophore, ferrichrome A, which was inactive on Neisseria spp. in either the deferri- or <b>ferrated</b> forms in vitro, likewise did not affect virulence in the chicken embryo model. The neisserial siderophores were more effective than the other microbial siderophores in enhancing virulence of T 3 gonococci. The results add to the evidence that the ability to acquire iron is an important determinant of virulence...|$|R

We use electronic structure calculations to disentangle the complex interactions in two <b>ferrates,</b> Sr$_ 2 $Fe$_ 2 $O$_ 5 $ and Ca$_ 2 $Fe$_ 2 $O$_ 5 $, relating the stability of the equilibrium (strain-free) and thin film structures to both previously identified and newly herein proposed descriptors. We show that cation size and intralayer separation of the tetrahedral chains provide key contributions to the preferred ground state. We show the bulk ground state structure is retained in the <b>ferrates</b> over a range of strain values; however, a change in the orientation of the tetrahedral chains, i. e., a perpendicular orientation of the vacancies relative to the substrate, is stabilized in the compressive region. The structure stability under strain is largely governed by maximizing the intraplane separation of the `dipoles' generated from rotations of the FeO$_ 4 $ tetrahedra. Lastly, we find that the electronic band gap is strongly influenced by strain, manifesting as an unanticipated asymmetric-vacancy alignment dependent response. This atomistic understanding establishes a practical route for the design of novel functional electronic materials in thin film geometries. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
