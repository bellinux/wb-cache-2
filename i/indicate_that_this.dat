5|$|According to the thirteenth-century Historia Gruffud vab Kenan, {{the mother}} of Cynan's son was Ragnailt ingen Amlaíb, a {{paternal}} granddaughter of Sitriuc. Further revealed by this source {{is the fact that}} this woman's father, Amlaíb mac Sitriuc, built and commanded a Welsh fortress called Castell Avloed. Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman, an event which could be evidence of a struggle for control of the site. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same year could in turn <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> exiled monarch sought refuge in Wales.|$|E

5|$|Vortigaunts {{are very}} {{intelligent}} and social creatures. In Half-Life, {{they serve as}} basic ground units for the Xen forces, often supporting heavier troops fighting the player and the humans in the Black Mesa Research Facility. They are capable of developing intelligent strategies and tactics to take on their enemies. Initially, Vortigaunts are enslaved to the Nihilanth, a large creature on Xen, who, in turn, claims it is a slave to unknown superiors. On Xen, the Vortigaunts are used as factory workers and drones. In Half-Life 2, Vortigaunts <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> slavery has lasted for generations. Despite this, Vortigaunts are shown to have developed an intellectual culture, valuing poetry, music and philosophy. In addition, Vortigaunts practise the husbandry of antlions, large insectoids that live in underground hives, as an ancestral tradition. The death of the Nihilanth {{at the hands of}} Gordon Freeman at the end of Half-Life frees the Vortigaunts from their slavery; consequently the Vortigaunts see Freeman as a messianic figure.|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the upper}} jaw is beak-like and {{separated}} from {{the remainder of the}} jaw by a notch. There is a single row of teeth in the lower jaw and a double row in the upper, with the bottom row fitting perfectly between the two upper rows when the mouth is closed. This specific tooth arrangement is not seen in any other reptile; although most snakes have a double row of teeth in their upper jaws, their arrangement and function is different from the tuatara's. The jaws, joined by ligament, chew with backwards and forwards movements combined with a shearing up and down action. The force of the bite is suitable for shearing chitin and bone. Fossils <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> jaw structure began developing about 180 million years ago. The tuatara's teeth are not replaced, since they are not separate structures like real teeth, but sharp projections of the jaw bone. As their teeth wear down, older tuatara have to switch to softer prey such as earthworms, larvae, and slugs, and eventually have to chew their food between smooth jaw bones. The brain of Sphenodon fills only half of the volume of its endocranium. This proportion has actually been used by paleontologists trying to estimate the volume of dinosaur brains based on fossils. However, the proportion of the tuatara endocranium occupied by its brain may not be a very good guide to the same proportion in Mesozoic dinosaurs since modern birds are surviving dinosaurs but have brains which occupy a much greater relative volume within the endocranium.|$|E

25|$|Cantor's {{article also}} {{contains}} a proof {{of the existence of}} transcendental numbers.

Since Cantor's proof either constructs transcendental numbers or does not, an analysis of his article can determine whether his proof is constructive or non-constructive. Cantor's correspondence with Richard Dedekind shows the development of his ideas and reveals that he had a choice between two proofs, one that uses the uncountability of the real numbers and one that does not.|$|E

25|$|Some modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} Josephus’s ostensible citations of Menander from a literary-analysis standpoint. The important question {{that they were}} addressing was whether Josephus’s quotations were just that, or were another example of his putting his own ideas and words into someone else’s mouth (pen). Josephus was frequently bold to do just this, notably in cases such as when a general, addressing his troops, provided an opportunity for Josephus to display his own eloquence. However, three lines of evidence <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{was not the case}} with the texts purporting to come from Menander. The first line of evidence is literary.|$|E
25|$|Cys282Tyr (or C282Y) is a {{mutation}} in the HFE gene {{that has been}} linked to most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis. Genetic techniques <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> mutation occurred roughly 60–70 generations ago or between 600 and 800 CE, assuming a generation length of 20 years. The regional distribution of this mutation among European populations indicates that it originated in Southern Scandinavia and spread with Viking expansion. Due to the timing of the mutation and subsequent population movements, C282Y is very prominent in Great Britain, Normandy, and Southern Scandinavia although C282Y has been found in almost every population that has been in contact with the Vikings.|$|E
25|$|In the {{earliest}} {{years of the}} Corps, training was performed by the individual Marine barracks where the individual was recruited before being assigned to a permanent post.

Commandant Franklin Wharton established a formal school for recruits at Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. in approximately 1808, but no records <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> served as a centralized recruit depot and the training regimen remained inconsistent and primitive due to manpower shortages and lack of funding. For example, recruits at Washington were hastily formed into a battalion in July 1861 and drilled as they marched {{on their way to}} the First Battle of Bull Run.|$|E

25|$|Anchiornis {{had very}} long legs, {{which is usually}} an {{indication}} that an animal is a strong runner. However, the extensive leg feathers <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> may be a vestigial trait, as running animals tend to have reduced, not increased, hair or feathers on their legs. Like most paravians, Anchiornis had four toes on the foot, with {{the third and fourth}} toes the longest. The first toe, or hallux, was not reversed as in perching species. The hindwings of Anchiornis were also shorter than those of Microraptor, and were made up of 12–13 flight feathers anchored to the tibia (lower leg) and 10–11 to the tarsus (upper foot). Also unlike Microraptor, the hindwing feathers were longest closer to the body, with the foot feathers being short and directed downward, almost perpendicular to the foot bones.|$|E
25|$|Smith–Magenis {{syndrome}} (SMS) is {{a complex}} syndrome involving intellectual disabilities, sleep disturbance, behavioural problems, {{and a variety of}} craniofacial, skeletal, and visceral anomalies. The majority of SMS cases harbor an ~3.5 Mb common deletion that encompasses the retinoic acid induced-1 (RAI1) gene. Other cases illustrate variability in the SMS phenotype not previously shown for RAI1 mutation, including hearing loss, absence of self-abusive behaviours, and mild global delays.Sequencing of RAI1 revealed mutation of a heptamericC-tract (CCCCCCC) in exon 3 resulting in frameshift mutations. Of the seven reported frameshift mutations occurring in poly C-tracts in RAI1, four cases (~57%) occur at this heptameric C-tract. The results <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> heptameric C-tract is a preferential recombination hotspot insertion/deletions (SNindels) and therefore a primary target for analysis in patients suspected for mutations in RAI1.|$|E
25|$|The Devonian {{and older}} rocks of Orkney are cut {{by a series}} of WSW-ENE to N-S {{trending}} faults, many of which were active during deposition of the Devonian sequences. The largest of these faults are the North Scapa Fault, East Scapa Fault and Bring-Risa Fault. Both the North Scapa and Brims-Risa faults show evidence of local reversal along part of their lengths, thought to be due to a period of transpressional deformation along the Great Glen Fault system that lies just to the east of the islands, during the Carboniferous. Small-scale folding is common and one large-scale fold is developed, the north-south trending Eday syncline. This syncline is parallel to neighbouring normal faults and thickess variations in the lower Eday Sandstone <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> structure was active during the middle Devonian.|$|E
