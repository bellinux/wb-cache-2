40|$|The USDA's National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) {{collected}} data on management practices and cow-calf herds {{as a source}} of family income from a representative sample of cow-calf producers from 23 of the leading cow-calf states. Overall, 2, 713 producers with one or more beef cows participated in the NAHMS Beef ' 97 Study, representing 85. 7 percent of the beef cows and 77. 6 percent of the beef cow operations in the United States as of January 1997. Producers whose cow-calf herds were the primary source of family income were more productive than those whose herds were a supplemental source of income. Cow-calf herds were the primary source of income for 14 percent of the producers and provided supplemental income for 69 percent of the producers. While average herd size was larger for primary income herds, nearly half of the herds with 100 or more cows were non-primary income herds. Producers whose herds were a primary source of income were more likely to dehorn cattle, castrate bull calves, and practice artificial insemination and semen testing than producers whose herds were not a primary source of income. Primary <b>income</b> <b>producers</b> {{were also more likely to}} vaccinate preweaned calves. Due to greater weaning rates and a higher weaning percentage, primary <b>income</b> <b>producers</b> produced more pounds of weaned calf per exposed cow than did non-primary <b>income</b> <b>producers</b> (440 vs. 400 pounds).

Therefore, they tend to choose between a deterministic strategy (i.e. with the use of sheepdogs) and a stochastic strategy (i.e. without sheepdogs) {{which may or may not}} result in herd losses.

Achieving private GAP certification, most notably of GlobalGAP, is a dif ficult option for low <b>income</b> <b>producers</b> in the Global South due to the high costs required for necessary investments and certification. This paper critically analyzes the ethical implications of private food safety standards in light of three theoretical perspectives from environmental sociology: ecological moderniza tion, risk society, and eco-socialism.

40|$|An {{increase}} in outward orientation in general, and in export-oriented manufacturing {{in particular is}} widely indicated as a suitable developmental path for SSA. The logic for this is drawn both from the demonstration effect of China and the earlier generation of Asian NICs, and from theory. However, the entry of China (and {{to a lesser extent}} India) into the global economy as a significant exporter of manufactures poses severe problems for export-oriented growth in SSA. This can be seen from SSA's recent experience in the clothing and textile sectors, often considered to be the first step in export-oriented manufacturing growth. Without sustained trade preferences over Asian producers, SSA's clothing and textile industry will be largely excluded from global markets and face significant threats in its domestic market.

The purpose of these papers is to explore issues related to livestock Development in the context of poverty alleviation. Livestock is vital to the economies of many developing countries. Animals are a source of food, more specifically protein for human diets, income, employment and possibly foreign exchange. For low <b>income</b> <b>producers,</b> livestock can serve as a store of wealth, provide draught power and organic fertiliser for crop production and a means of transport. Consumption of livestock and livestock products in developing countries, though starting from a low base, is growing rapidly. A community-based qualitative-quantitative poverty methodology called the Stagesof-Progress approach was used to assess household poverty dynamics and the role of livestock in 40 communities and over 3, 800 households representing two different highland regions of Peru (Puno and Cajamarca). Key to the approach used was to define with the participating communities a common understanding of poverty. The major reasons for movements into or out of poverty were elicited at both the community and household-level, and in particular, the role that livestock play in the different pathways was examined...|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{there have}} been many {{accounts}} of success stories of fair trade in a variety of low income producer communities, {{there have been}} few critical accounts that examine the varied lived experiences of people in such communities. This thesis advances a developing critical literature by exploring reasons for unequal and uneven experiences of members of a Fairtrade certified producer organisation. As fair trade has expanded into new commodities and countries, both sugar and Malawi have to date been underresearched. This thesis addresses these gaps by focussing on Kasinthula Cane Growers Limited (KCGL) in southern Malawi. Developing a critical reflection that incorporates postcolonial and post-Marxist critiques, the thesis problematises definitions and assumptions regarding empowerment as a people-centred development approach and community as a cooperative social and political formation. This reflection is used to expand existing analytical frameworks to create a Postcolonial Agricultural Production Network as a framework to focus on a complex geography embedded in a local postcolonial production place. Doing so opens space to explore uneven geographies of production and empowerment shaped by embedded social and political factors. By un-masking inequalities, hierarchies, and dependencies in the institutional environment of a producer community, and incorporating perspectives from a range of producers, both intended and unintended outcomes from Fairtrade certification are examined. The thesis reveals that despite fair trade intentions to promote democracy, transparency, and participation, unintended consequences of exacerbating inequalities and discrepancies between low <b>income</b> <b>producers,</b> and over expectations of an impoverished society, have led to variable experiences of fair trade. Identifying sites of local inequality and unable and unwilling agents of empowerment highlights the important role of place in analysis. This demonstrates how embedded social and political formations in a particular place shape different experiences of fair trade. The findings propose a lesson to incorporate a more nuanced understanding of place in fair trade approaches that challenge assumptions of harmonious producer communities to sharpen focus on embedded inequalities and uneven producer community landscapes.

The Internal Revenue Service promptly issued a ruling announcing its recognition of same-sex marriage. Academics, policymakers and activists lauded the change as finally achieving of tax equality between gay and straight married couples. This article argues that the claimed tax equality of Windsor is illusory and {{that the only way to}} achieve actual equality is to eliminate taxation on the basis of marital status. Focusing on the taxation of women in same-sex marriages, the article explores what lies beneath the putative equality gains that result from according same-sex married couples the same status as different-sex married couples. The article predicts, based on demographic statistics relating to income levels, wealth holdings, child rearing and employment patterns, that women in same-sex marriages will be less likely than other married people to reap the benefits and more likely to suffer the detriments of being taxed as married. In finding that women in same-sex marriages are at serious risk to suffer adverse consequences from their new tax status as married, the article extends the existing literature that analyzes the ways in which the tax law — though facially neutral in its treatment of heterosexual married couples — privileges traditional marriages in which men are the primary income earners and wealth holders, and adversely affects married women’s incentives and abilities to be workers, <b>income</b> <b>producers</b> and wealth holders. The article argues that the unfavorable tax treatment of women in both same-sex and different-sex marriages stems from the fictitious construction of two individuals as an irreducible economic unit, the same fiction that perpetuates traditional, male-dominated marriage. The article concludes that taxation on the basis of marital status should be curtailed through the abolition of the joint return and other reforms...|$|E
