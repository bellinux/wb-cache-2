With Mayo, one of the first editors to give Williamson work, at Standard Comics, Williamson collaborated on the jungle girl series Jann of the Jungle #16–17 (April and June 1957). Following Mayo's death, Williamson drew stories solo for the planned #18, but the series was abruptly canceled before that issue could be published.

[...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful.

The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players.
