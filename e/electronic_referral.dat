However, RDS faces logistical and theoretical challenges that threaten efficiency and validity in settings worldwide. We present innovative adaptations to conventional RDS to overcome barriers encountered in recruiting a large, {{representative sample of}} {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) who travel internationally. Novel methodological adaptations for the "International Travel Research to Inform Prevention" or "I-TRIP" study were offering participants a choice between electronic and paper coupons referrals for recruitment and modifying the secondary incentives structure from small cash amounts to raffle entries for periodic large cash prize raffle drawings. Staged referral limit increases from 3 to 10 referrals and progressive addition of 70 seeds were also implemented. There were 501 participants enrolled in up to 13 waves of growth. Among participants with a choice of referral methods, 81 % selected <b>electronic</b> <b>referrals.</b> Of participants who were recruited electronically, 90 % chose to remain with <b>electronic</b> <b>referrals</b> when it was their turn to recruit. The mean number of enrolled referrals was 0. 91 for <b>electronic</b> <b>referrals</b> compared to 0. 56 for paper coupons. Median referral lag time, i. e., the time interval between when recruiters were given their referrals and when a referred individual enrolled in the study, was 20 days (IQR 10 - 40) for <b>electronic</b> <b>referrals,</b> 20 days (IQR 8 - 58) for paper coupons, 20 days (IQR 10 - 41) for raffle entries and 33 days (IQR 16 - 148) for small cash incentives. The recruitment of MSM who travel internationally required maximizing known flexible tools of RDS while at the same time necessitating innovations to increase recruitment efficiency. <b>Electronic</b> <b>referrals</b> emerged as a major advantage in recruiting this hard-to-reach population who are of high socio-economic status, geographically diffuse and highly mobile.

40|$|Abstract Electronic health {{records are}} {{increasingly}} being used to facilitate referral communication in the outpatient setting.

40|$|Abstract Background Health {{information}} technology and electronic medical records (EMRs) are potentially powerful systems-based interventions to facilitate diagnosis and treatment because they ensure the delivery of key new findings and other health related information to the practitioner. However, effective communication involves more than just information transfer; despite {{a state of the}} art EMR system, communication breakdowns can still occur. 1 2 3 In this project, we will adapt a model developed by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) to understand and improve the relationship between work systems and processes of care involved with electronic communication in EMRs. We plan to study three communication activities in the Veterans Health Administration's (VA) EMR: electronic communication of abnormal imaging and laboratory test results via automated notifications (i. e., alerts); <b>electronic</b> <b>referral</b> requests; and provider-to-pharmacy communication via computerized provider order entry (CPOE). Aim Our specific aim is to propose a protocol to evaluate the systems and processes affecting outcomes of electronic communication in the computerized patient record system (related to diagnostic test results, <b>electronic</b> <b>referral</b> requests, and CPOE prescriptions) using a human factors engineering approach, and hence guide the development of interventions for work system redesign. Design This research will consist of multiple qualitative methods of task analysis to identify potential sources of error related to diagnostic test result alerts, <b>electronic</b> <b>referral</b> requests, and CPOE; this will be followed by a series of focus groups to identify barriers, facilitators, and suggestions for improving the electronic communication system. Transcripts from all task analyses and focus groups will be analyzed using methods adapted from grounded theory and content analysis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Â© 2015 Tuot et al. Background: Access to {{specialty}} care remains {{a challenge for}} primary care providers and patients. Implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>referral</b> and/or consultation (eCR) systems {{provides an opportunity for}} innovations in the delivery of {{specialty care}}. We con ducted key informant interviews to identify drivers, facilitators, barriers and evaluation metrics of diverse eCR systems to inform widespread implementation of this model of specialty care delivery. Methods: Interviews were conducted with leaders of 16 diverse health care delivery organizations between January 2013 and April 2014. A limited snowball sampling approach was used for recruitment. Content analysis was used to examine key informant interview transcripts. Results: <b>Electronic</b> <b>referral</b> systems, which provide referral management and triage by specialists, were developed to enhance tracking and operational efficiency. Electronic consultation systems, which encourage bi-directional communication between primary care and specialist providers facilitating longitudinal virtual co-management, were developed to improve access to specialty expertise. Integrated eCR systems leverage both functionalities to enhance the delivery of coordinated, specialty care at the population level. Elements of successful eCR system implementation included executive and clinician leadership, established funding models for specialist clinician reimbursement, and a commitment to optimizing clinician workflows. Conclusions: eCR systems have great potential to streamline access to and enhance the coordination of specialty care delivery. While different eCR models help solve different organizational challenges, all require institutional investments for successful implementation, such as funding for program management, leadership and clinician incentives...|$|E

40|$|Electronic {{referrals}} {{can improve}} access to subspecialty care in safety net settings. In January 2007, San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) launched an <b>electronic</b> <b>referral</b> portal that incorporated subspecialist triage, iterative communication with referring providers, and existing electronic health record data to improve access to subspecialty care. We surveyed primary care providers (PCPs) {{to assess the}} impact of electronic referrals on workflow and clinical care. We administered an 18 -item, web-based questionnaire to all 368 PCPs who had the option of referring to SFGH. We asked participants to rate time spent submitting a referral, guidance of workup, wait times, and change in overall clinical care compared to prior referral methods using 5 -point Likert scales. We used multivariate logistic regression to identify variables associated with perceived improvement in overall clinical care. Two hundred ninety-eight PCPs (81. 0 %) from 24 clinics participated. Over half (55. 4 %) worked at hospital-based clinics, 27. 9 % at county-funded community clinics, and 17. 1 % at non-county-funded community clinics. Most (71. 9 %) reported that electronic referrals had improved overall clinical care.

40|$|Background Meeting the {{challenge}} of tuberculosis (TB) elimination will require adopting new models of delivering patient-centered care customized to diverse settings and contexts. In areas of low incidence with cases spread out across jurisdictions and large geographic areas, a “vir-tual”model is attractive. However, whether “virtual ” clinics and telemedicine deliver the same outcomes as face-to-face encounters in general and within the sphere of public health in particular, is unknown.

The study data was gathered from project documentation, visits to key sites, analysis of electronic transactional records and stakeholder interviews. Both regional projects demonstrated effective processes of engaging hospital and general practice clinicians in developing investigation-specific eReferral forms: one with an iterative approach, and the other with a structured process. These negotiation processes among the participating clinicians have been effective in presenting, integrating and transferring specialised and locally contextualized knowledge. The resulting structured colorectal eReferral forms have shown sustained uptake and acceptance in both regions. The knowledge embedded in the forms clarifies referring criteria and collects appropriate information for referral triage. Involving both specialists and general practitioners in the form development and refinement has been identified as a key to success in both cases. In conclusion, it is critical to facilitate a negotiation process among secondary and community clinicians in order to achieve acceptable eReferral forms. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>referrals</b> and {{discharge}} summaries {{can improve}} the quality and timeliness of clinical communication. The electronic summary care record (SCR) extends the concept of digital health summaries to create a perpetually updated and centrally stored summary of care, extracting key data from local systems after each encounter. The only major SCR evaluation to date, in England, found that rates of usage were low, and any impact on care was difficult to quantify. The SCR is seen {{by some as a}} first step to building a national distributed shared electronic health record (SEHR). However, the SCR may be a problematic diversion, creating a need for centralised databases, while the SEHR can function by sharing locally stored records, letters and discharge summaries. Uncertainty about the quality and provenance of SCR data raises concerns about patient safety, as key data may be absent and old data may persist, partly {{because of a lack of}} ownership of the summary.

40|$|Background: Eighty-five {{per cent}} of the Ethiopian {{population}} lives in remote areas, without access to modern health services. The limited health care budget, chronic shortage of health care workers and lack of incentives to retain those in remote areas further jeopardize the national health care delivery system. Recently, the application of information communication technology (ICT) to health care delivery {{and the use of}} telemedicine have raised hopes. Objective: This paper analyzes the challenges, failures and successes encountered in setting-up and implementing a telemedicine program in Ethiopia and provides possible recommendations for developing telemedicine strategies in countries with limited resources. Design: Ten sites in Ethiopia were selected to participate in this pilot between 2004 and 2006 and twenty physicians, two per site, were trained in the use of a store and forward telemedicine system, using a dial-up internet connection. Teledermatology, teleradiology and telepathology were the chosen disciplines for the <b>electronic</b> <b>referrals,</b> across the selected ten sites. Results: Telemedicine implementation does not depend only on technological factors, rather on e-government readiness, enabling policies, multisectoral involvement and capacity building processes. There is no perfect &#x 2018;one size fits all&#x 2019; technology and the use of combined interoperable applications, according to the local context, is highly recommended.
