5|$|After Brian reveals Meg's {{secret to}} Peter and Lois, who don't want her seeing Luke again, he soon breaks {{out of jail}} during a prison riot and tries {{to hide in the}} Griffins' house. When Brian comes to Meg's room to {{apologize}} for what he did to her, he finds him just as Peter enters. Peter only <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening when reading the episode's plot synopsis in TV Guide (the reason he entered the rodeo), and finds out who Luke is. As Luke escapes out the window, Peter alerts Joe, who apprehends Luke. Joe also arrests Meg for harboring a fugitive, and she is sent to prison. Luke is never heard from again in the episode.|$|E

25|$|Here Strabo {{launches}} another quibble. Hipparchus, {{relying on}} Pytheas, according to Strabo, places this area south of Britain, but he, Strabo, calculates {{that it is}} north of Ierne. Pytheas, however, rightly <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Scotland as part of Britain, land of the Picts, even though north of Ierne. North of southern Scotland the longest day is 19 hours. Strabo, based on theory alone, states that Ierne is so cold that any lands north of it must be uninhabited. In the hindsight given to moderns Pytheas, in relying on observation in the field, appears more scientific than Strabo, who discounted the findings of others merely because of their strangeness to him. The ultimate cause of his skepticism is simply {{that he did not}} believe Scandinavia could exist. This disbelief may also be the cause of alteration of Pytheas' data.|$|E
25|$|After the {{introduction}} come {{the words of}} Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake {{of life in the}} present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.|$|E
25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going to happen God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God knows all that has happened in the past and all that is happening in the present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God knows all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of what we are likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E

IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10, writing that it [...] "stood strong as a heartfelt, emotional end for the TARDIS' longest serving companions (since the show's noughties' return at least), and the best episode of the season thus far". Risley also praised the three leads, though he did admit the episode [...] "left a few nitpicky questions".|$|E

500|$|Willis's review, written {{more than}} half a century past the {{original}} writing of the volume, is in some respects a gentler way of phrasing the work's immediate reception. One of Russell's contemporaries wrote: [...] "As a contribution to social science... or to the study of government, the volume is very disappointing... In this pretentious volume, Russell shows only the most superficial familiarity with progress made in the study of social phenomena or in any special field of social research, either with techniques of inquiry, or with materials assembled, or with interpretations developed... it seems doubtful that the author <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on in the world of social science." [...] (Merriam, 1939) Indeed, the very preface of the work candidly states: [...] "As usual, those who look in Russell's pronouncements for dotty opinions will be able to find a few". (Russell 1938:x) Still, some scholars, like Edward Hallet Carr, found the work of some use. (Carr 2001:131) ...|$|E
500|$|When {{writing a}} new script, Rucka tries {{to follow the}} world-building model used by William Gibson in Neuromancer and provide {{information}} about the environment through context instead of exposition. His biggest struggle is delivering details while maintaining a proper narrative pace. He sometimes self-censors [...] "exceptionally dark" [...] material {{because he does not}} want to make Lark draw it. After Lark receives a new script, the collaboration between them is [...] "immediate and constant". Lark questions Rucka about characterization and the direction of the story, resulting in rewrites and a better final product. Rucka says Lark intuitively <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening in the story even when it isn't clearly scripted. Rucka and Lark have an ongoing conversation about how to show the injustice in the way Forever is treated without being complicit in it themselves. For example, medics must remove Forever's clothes to treat her wounds. Lark wanted to avoid sexualizing the images, but also avoid being [...] "coy" [...] by simply blocking parts of her body with another character's arm. The script gives Lark no direction for aspects like architecture, clothing, or vehicle design. Designing these technical details involves research into prototype technology and takes almost as long as drawing the actual pages for the comics. The time required to create the sets is the primary reason Lark sometimes falls behind schedule.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{only was}} Isserles a renowned Talmudic and legal scholar, {{he was also}} learned in Kabbalah, and studied [...] history, {{astronomy}} and philosophy.

2500|$|The captivity storylines took a {{different}} route by using the characters of Ziva and Michael Rivkin to symbolize the [...] "two Israels American policy makers have faced over the years". Ziva is [...] "the cooperative and quiet Israeli, who has the technical and personal skills to be of enormous assistance in achieving the mission" [...] while Rivkin is [...] "bright and pro-American, {{but in this case}} tough, aggressive, thinks he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best for the United States better than the Americans, is sly and wily, and he doesn't heed the advice of his American counterparts". Both are received differently by the American agents—Ziva is respected and trusted by her colleagues; Rivkin is an object of suspicion. Steven L. Spiegel, Director of the Center for Middle East Development and Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), drew parallels between their interactions with their American counterparts and those of prominent Israeli politicians. Ziva, he reasoned, could be likened to Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, or Ehud Olmert in that she is able to agree with the American agencies on a more basic, fundamental level. Rivkin, he continued, was more like Yitzhak Shamir.|$|E
