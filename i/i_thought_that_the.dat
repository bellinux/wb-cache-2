25|$|Soon I {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people didn't like me.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Ford revealed, [...] "Blade Runner {{is not one}} of my {{favorite}} films. I tangled with Ridley." [...] Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: [...] "When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a [...] nightmare. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director's interests." [...] "I went kicking and screaming to the studio to record it." [...] The narration monologues were written by an uncredited Roland Kibbee.|$|E
500|$|The Allied command {{structure}} was soon put under strain by Australian reverses in the Kokoda Track campaign. MacArthur was {{highly critical of}} the Australian performance, and confided to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Marshall, that [...] "the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking." [...] MacArthur told Curtin that Blamey should be sent up to New Guinea to take personal command of the situation. Curtin later confessed that [...] "in my ignorance (of military matters) <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Commander in Chief should be in New Guinea." [...] Jack Beasley suggested that Blamey would make a convenient scapegoat: [...] "Moresby is going to fall. Send Blamey up there and let him fall with it!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding his past, he stated, [...] "I became {{all those}} things society {{expected}} me to become. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was <b>the</b> only thing I could be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you? Then you won't get it. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> only <b>the</b> King of Zululand had a {{right to}} tribute, and your Captain's name is not Cetywayo, is it?" ...|$|R
30|$|Lay-born Woman: I {{was a bit}} older, I {{had been}} working for a while. And when I {{randomly}} (tama tama) met my husband, and he said, “I’ve got this kind of place [a temple], {{how would you like to}} come here [get married].” <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>the</b> kind of place I could marry into, and I accepted. From there I encountered Shinran. That was my departure point. I didn’t intentionally choose it, but in the end I suppose I did choose it.|$|R
500|$|... "Cocktails" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein, who plays Human Resources {{representative}} Toby Flenderson on the series. Lost series creator J. J. Abrams was hired on as episode director, his first such credit for the series. Abrams disliked the American series when it first premiered, due to his love for the original British series. The director explained, [...] "I resented it before I saw it, because I thought, 'well, {{how are you going}} to do what Ricky and Steve did. In fact, the first season I didn't get into it at all. In the second season, they really found their voice. And that's despite having to make 22 episodes, which is twice the length of what the BBC show did. And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show became brilliant. I was really impressed by how it worked." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We're from America" [...] is {{the most}} overtly {{political}} song on the album, referencing various aspects of neoconservatism in its lyrics, such as pro-war and anti-abortion rhetoric. [...] "I Have to Look Up Just to See Hell" [...] was described by The Quietus as a [...] "maggot-infested ride into the trough of melancholy." [...] The penultimate track, [...] "Into the Fire", portrays the vocalists' mental state on Christmas Day—wherein he unsuccessfully attempted to contact Wood 158 times, and cut himself on the hands or face with a razorblade for each corresponding attempt. It was the original album closer, with Manson describing it as a [...] "glorious epic that I think will make Twiggy forever recognized as a guitar hero." [...] The album's final song, [...] "15", was completed on Manson's January 5 birthday. He called it [...] "the most important song that's been written by Marilyn Manson as an entity. It's the most unusual song I have ever heard. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album was done, [...] but {{what was happening in}} my life had not resolved itself. So on January 5, one five, I sang '15', and the lyrics tell the story of that day." ...|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{was first}} {{introduced}} to locative media websites through links from a friend, and initially found the phenomenon to be [...] "excessively nerdy and very conceptual". Despite his finding compelling {{the idea of a}} digital grid mapping the surface of the earth, Gibson saw little storytelling traction in geocaching and geohacking, and instead reworked the material into the locative art of the novel. [...] "When I started, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 'locative art' stuff would work the way immersion technology did in my earlier fiction", he commented in a subsequent interview. [...] "Then I started liking that it wasn’t going to do that." [...] The conception of the artworks in the novel was derived from the lowbrow art movement, and was inspired by the movement's talismanic Juxtapoz, the only art magazine Gibson was reading regularly at the time. The novel exhibits Gibson's characteristic brand awareness (a key plot element of Pattern Recognition), which he honed while poring over catalogues of products as part of his writing process. The author found the writing process unnerving, as the solution to the mystery of the container – the novel's MacGuffin – did not come to him until after he had written several hundred pages of manuscript.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Sir Eustace," [...] Guy said, {{when he had}} concluded, [...] "how {{do these}} matters affect you? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> by <b>the</b> treaty the west part of Artois was English." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] said Oliver, [...] "only <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> on <b>the</b> whole, I'd {{rather go}} with you. I didn't {{think that you}} were going to be gone so long." ...|$|R

2500|$|Wong {{received}} {{an invitation to}} appear in Game of Death (死亡遊戲), but declined. He was scheduled to attend a screen test {{on the set of}} Enter the Dragon after Bruce Lee had finished shooting the film and was working on dubbing. Lee returned to Hong Kong from his last trip to the United States of America in late May 1973. Thus, Wong would have attended the screen test sometime in June 1973. Wong recalled, [...] "About two months before he (Bruce Lee) died he gave me a phone call ... After this he left Hong Kong to settle his film business. When he came back, he called me up and wanted me to participate in the making of Game of Death. He had also invited me to the studio to attend a screen test. I did not promise to act in the film, yet I still went to attend the screen test to please him." [...] In a 1986 interview, Wong said, [...] "I told him (Bruce Lee) that I didn't want to go and die in my first movie! ... I wasn't in dire financial straits at the time, so I didn't have to do the film (just) to make money." [...] The role of Lee's final opponent was thus played by basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In another interview, Wong said, [...] "It was for Game of Death, but I declined because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> moves of Wing Chun style wouldn’t look good on film. I think the Wing Chun method is ugly for movies but very good and very logical for real fighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{appearing}} as oil tycoon Adam Steiffel in 1980's The Formula, which was poorly received critically, Brando {{announced his retirement}} from acting. However, he returned in 1989 in A Dry White Season, based on André Brink's 1979 anti-apartheid novel. Brando agreed to do the film for free, but fell out with director Euzhan Palcy over how the film was edited; he even made a rare television appearance {{in an interview with}} Connie Chung to voice his disapproval. In his memoir, he maintained that Palcy [...] "had cut the picture so poorly, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inherent drama of this conflict was vague at best." [...] Brando received praise for his performance, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and winning the Best Actor Award at the Tokyo Film Festival. Brando also scored enthusiastic reviews for his caricature of his Vito Corleone role as Carmine Sabatini in 1990's The Freshman. In his original review, Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "There {{have been a lot of}} movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts—but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in The Freshman?" [...] Variety also praised Brando's performance as Sabatini and noted, [...] "Marlon Brando's sublime comedy performance elevates The Freshman from screwball comedy to a quirky niche in film history." [...] Brando also starred alongside his friend Johnny Depp in the box office hit Don Juan DeMarco (1995) and in Depp's controversial The Brave (1997), which was never released in the United States. Later performances, such as his appearance in [...] (1992) (for which he won a Raspberry as [...] "Worst Supporting Actor"), The Island of Dr. Moreau (in which he was nominated for another [...] "Worst Actor" [...] Raspberry) (1996), and his barely recognizable appearance in Free Money (1998), resulted in some of the worst reviews of his career. However, his last completed film, The Score (2001), was received generally positively. In the film, in which he portrays a fence, he starred with Robert De Niro, who had portrayed Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II.|$|E

5000|$|Walker {{stated that}} Fall {{was one of}} his {{favorite}} songs on his album. He also said after recording <b>the</b> track <b>that</b> “Keith stood up and high-fived the engineer when we got done with <b>the</b> vocal and <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>the</b> first <b>that</b> I’ve ever seen that, maybe he was just glad that I got all the lyrics right, it was refreshing to know there wasn’t a lot of wasted time in the studio with Keith. He knows what he wants and he communicates <b>that</b> with <b>the</b> musicians really well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad of it, Betty, only {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{distance was}} scarcely wide enough," [...] answered Margaret, {{and left the}} subject, for {{she was thinking of}} other things.|$|R
2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know Lizzie {{wished that}} it could be so,' said Helen, 'because the twenty-eighth is St. Augustine's day; but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bishop had {{appointed}} Tuesday.' ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> now <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> general ridicule would {{overwhelm}} me. Two {{or three}} came closer, {{as if in}} pity or curiosity; and, at last, one cried out that I actually wore clothes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have <b>I</b> not? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>the</b> one sin might {{palliate}} the other. You know, aunt, no young lady, {{let her be}} ever so ill-disposed, can marry two objectionable young men,--at {{the same}} time." ...|$|R
