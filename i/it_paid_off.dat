25|$|Though it has {{now become}} very common to portray a human face on stamps, for the initial 17years {{this was not the}} case. Mr. M. H.

25|$|Tennessee's {{inability}} {{to get into the}} end zone came to an end on just the third play of the third quarter, when George took a handoff from McNair and stormed through {{the middle of the field}} for a 68-yard touchdown run. Then after several punts, the Titans put together a 13-play, 73-yard drive, featuring a 26-yard completion from McNair to receiver Chris Sanders. With 12:57 left in the fourth quarter, Del Greco finished the drive with his third field goal, increasing the Tennessee lead to 16–9. Later in the quarter, the Colts had a great opportunity to come back when wide receiver Terrence Wilkins returned a punt 87 yards to the Titans 3-yard line, but it was overruled by a replay challenge from coach Jeff Fisher. Fisher had to burn a timeout to get his challenge heard over the roaring crowd in the RCA Dome, but <b>it</b> <b>paid</b> <b>off,</b> as the replay showed Wilkins had stepped out of bounds at his own 33-yard line during the return.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October Lyon {{began their}} {{back-to-back}} matches against Liverpool {{with the first}} match being played at the historic Anfield. Despite Lyon attacking early on, it was Liverpool who got scored first with Yossi Benayoun converting. In the 33rd minute, Lyon's lone healthy centre back Cris suffered a concussion and {{was taken off the}} field before half-time, despite an attempt to continue playing. He was replaced by defensive midfielder Maxime Gonalons. Due to this, Lyon employed a more defensive style earlier in the second half, but eventually garnered enough confidence to get forward and in the 72nd minute, <b>it</b> <b>paid</b> <b>off.</b> Following a corner kick from Källström, Lyon got two chances at goal from Jérémy Toulalan and Jean Makoun before the ball was headed in by the substitute Gonalons. The goal drew the match at 1–1 and Lyon later won the match in injury time with the Argentine César Delgado scoring the game-winning goal. The victory was Lyon's first victory over an English club in the Champions League. In the return leg, Lyon managed a 1–1 draw, primarily due to the efforts of goalkeeper Hugo Lloris who performed admirably producing sharp stops from Fernando Torres, Dirk Kuyt, and Andriy Voronin in the first half, then displaying stunning reflexes to deny the Brazilian Lucas midway through the second period. Though Lyon conceded late following an amazing goal from Ryan Babel, they drew the match 1–1 with a goal from Lisandro López in injury time. The point brought Lyon's total tally to ten and assured the club a spot in the knockout stage.|$|E
