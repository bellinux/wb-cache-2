50|$|<b>In</b> 414, <b>the</b> Tuoqihan (唾契汗) and Yifu (乙弗) tribes rebelled, {{and despite}} the state of desperation Southern Liang was in, Tufa Rutan, leaving his crown prince Tufa Hutai in command at Ledu, {{launched}} an attack against Yifu—which was quite successful. However, Qifu Chipan, who had by this point succeeded Qifu Gangui as Western Qin's prince, launched an attack on Ledu, sieging it. Tufa Hutai panicked, and forced <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> into <b>the</b> inner citadel because he distrusted them, greatly weakening his own defense force, and Ledu fell. Tufa Hutai was captured.|$|R

50|$|The ethnic Uyghur-dominated {{southern}} part of Xinjiang has witnessed increasing separatist violence by Uyghurs who want to establish an independent state. On April 18 and 21, there were two fatal incidents of Uyghurs stabbing <b>Han</b> Chinese <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Kashgar. <b>In</b> July, an Uyghur mob took over a police station, threatened hostages, and battled police in a standoff that would ultimately end in 18 deaths. In that same month, a group of Pakistan-trained Uyghur youths killed 14 people in a vehicular, IED and knife attack in Kashgar.|$|R
50|$|There {{are over}} 37 {{recognized}} ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.2 million, with national minorities making up 46.5% of the population. The demographic mix {{is similar to}} Gansu province, with Han (54.5%), Tibetan (20.7%), Hui (16%), Tu (Monguor) (4%), Mongol, and Salar being the most populous groups. <b>Han</b> Chinese predominate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> of Xining, Haidong, Delingha and Golmud, and elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast. The Hui are concentrated in Xining, Haidong, Minhe County, Hualong County, and Datong County. The Tu people predominate in Huzhu County and <b>the</b> Salars <b>in</b> Xunhua County; Tibetans and Mongols are sparsely distributed across the rural {{western part of the}} province.|$|R
25|$|This {{rebellion}} became entangled {{with the}} Kumul rebellion, when a Chinese Muslim and Uyghur army under Ma Zhancang and Timur Beg marched on Kashgar against the Chinese Muslim Daotai Ma Shaowu and his garrison of Han Chinese troops. Ma Shaowu began to panic and started raising Kirghiz levies under Osman Ali to defend <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>The</b> Kirghiz were not amused at how their rebellion was crushed {{the previous year}} by Ma Shaowu, and now {{he wanted them to}} defend <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> They defected en masse to the enemy. However, Ma Zhancang also entered into secret negotiations with Ma Shaowu; he and his troops soon defected to <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> Chinese garrison <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the population of Hohhot are Han Chinese, representing 87.16 percent of <b>the</b> total population <b>in</b> 2010. Most <b>Han</b> <b>in</b> Hohhot, if their ancestry is traced several decades back, have ancestors from Shanxi, northeast China, or Hebei. Most Mongols <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> speak Chinese. A survey from 1993 of the Inner Mongolia University found that only 8 percent of Tümed Mongols (<b>the</b> majority tribe <b>in</b> Hohhot) could speak the Mongolian language. A significant portion of the population is of mixed ethnic origin. According to the anthropologist William Jankowiak, who wrote the book Sex, Death, and Hierarchy in a Chinese City (1993) about Huhehot, there is [...] "relatively little different between minority culture and <b>Han</b> culture" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> with differences concentrating around minor attributes like food and art choices, and similarities abounding over fundamental issues in ethics, status, life goals, and worldview.|$|R
2500|$|Manchu women, {{as well as}} Mongol and Chinese women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eight Banners, did not bind their feet, and {{the most}} a Manchu woman might do was to wrap the feet tightly {{to give them a}} slender appearance. [...] The Manchus, wanting to emulate the {{particular}} gait that bound feet necessitated, invented their own type of shoe that caused them to walk in a similar swaying manner. These [...] "flower bowl" [...] (花盆鞋) or [...] "horse-hoof" [...] shoes (馬蹄鞋) have a platform generally made of wood two to six inches in height and fitted {{to the middle of the}} sole, or they have a small central tapered pedestal. Many <b>Han</b> Chinese <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Inner <b>City</b> of Beijing also did not bind their feet, and it was reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1800s that around 50-60% of non-banner women had unbound feet. Bound feet nevertheless became a significant differentiating marker between Han women and Manchu or other banner women.|$|R
