5|$|Mitt Romney {{wanted to}} pursue a {{business}} career, but his father advised him that a law degree would be valuable to his career even if he never practiced law.

5|$|The {{university}} historically pioneered {{research and}} training collaborations between academia, industry and government. In 1946, President Compton, <b>Harvard</b> <b>Business</b> <b>School</b> professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm. In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses. On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration {{with the federal government}} on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940. MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.|$|E
