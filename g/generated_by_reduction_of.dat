These novel compounds were structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography. Compounds 1 and 2 are hydrolysed on prolonged exposure to air to give mesitylene and boronic acids 1 -(B(OH) 2) - 2 -R- 1, 2 -C 2 B 10 H 10 (3, R = H, 4, R = Ph respectively). Addition of fluoride anions to 1 and 2 resulted in boryl-carborane bond cleavage to give dimesitylborinic acid HOBMes 2. UV absorption bands at 318 – 333 nm were observed for 1 and 2 corresponding to local π–π*-transitions within the dimesitylboryl groups while visible emissions at 541 – 664 nm with Stokes shifts of 11920 – 16170 cm− 1 {{were attributed to}} intramolecular charge transfer transitions between the mesityl and cluster groups.

Some examples have been isolated using cryptate complexes of the alkali metal cation, e.g., Pb102− anion, which features a capped square antiprismatic shape. According to Wade's rules (2n+2) the number of cluster electrons is 22 and therefore a closo cluster.
