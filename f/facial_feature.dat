500|$|Other {{drawings}} of interest include numerous studies generally {{referred to as}} [...] "caricatures" [...] because, although exaggerated, {{they appear to be}} based upon observation of live models. Vasari relates that if Leonardo saw a person with an interesting face he would follow them around all day observing them. There are numerous studies of beautiful young men, often associated with Salai, with the rare and much admired <b>facial</b> <b>feature,</b> the so-called [...] "Grecian profile". These faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior. Salai is often depicted in fancy-dress costume. Leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated. Other, often meticulous, drawings show studies of drapery. A marked development in Leonardo's ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works. Another often-reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by Leonardo in Florence in 1479 showing the body of Bernardo Baroncelli, hanged in connection with the murder of Giuliano, brother of Lorenzo de' Medici, in the Pazzi conspiracy. With dispassionate integrity Leonardo has registered in neat mirror writing the colours of the robes that Baroncelli was wearing when he died.|$|E

At the top was {{the picture of a}} hand fairly, if not elegantly, drawn, with one finger pointing. Below it were several figures, the last of which was a girl in unmistakable Indian costume. The figure in front of her was meant to represent Cheenbuk; in advance of him was an Eskimo woman with her tail flowing gracefully behind, while before her was a hazy group of men, women, and children, which represented the tribe on the march. Adolay had obviously the artistic gift in embryo, for there was a decided effort to indicate form and motion, as well as to suggest an idea of perspective, for the woman and the tribal group were drawn much smaller than the foreground figures, and were placed on higher planes. The sketchiness of the group, too, also told of just ideas as to relative degrees of interest in the legend, while the undue prominence of the leading <b>facial</b> <b>feature</b> was an attempt to give that advice which is so forcibly expressed in the well-known phrase, [...] "Follow your nose."

To achieve privacy {{protection}} on facial image retrieval sys-tems, we propose {{a method of}} encrypting facial images with a key pro-duced from <b>facial</b> <b>features.</b> Because <b>facial</b> <b>features</b> vary even for the same person, it is not recommended to use <b>facial</b> <b>features</b> as the cryptographic key. Therefore, we propose a method for generating a key by quantiz-ing the <b>facial</b> <b>features</b> based on entropy.

30|$|Based on [27], Choi et al. [28] {{proposed}} a Baum-Welch HMM Inversion to estimate <b>facial</b> <b>features</b> from speech. The speech-facial HMMs are trained using joint audiovisual observations; optimal <b>facial</b> <b>features</b> are generated directly by Baum-Welch iterations in the Maximum Likelihood (ML) sense. The estimated <b>facial</b> <b>features</b> {{are used for}} driving the mouth movement of a 3 D face model. In the above two approaches, the <b>facial</b> <b>features</b> are simply parameterized by the mouth width and height. Both lack an explicit and concise articulatory model that simulates the speech production process, resulting in sometimes wrong mouth movements.|$|R

40|$|Internal <b>facial</b> <b>features</b> 1 We {{investigated}} {{forms of}} socially-relevant information signalled from static {{images of the}} face. We created composite images from women scoring high and low values on personality and health dimensions, and measured the accuracy of raters in discriminating high from low trait values. We also looked specifically at the information content within the internal <b>facial</b> <b>features,</b> by presenting the composite images with an occluding mask. Four of the Big Five traits were accurately discriminated {{on the basis of}} the internal <b>facial</b> <b>features</b> alone (conscientiousness was the exception), as was physical health. The addition of external features in the full face images led to improved detection for extraversion and physical health, and poorer performance on intellect/ imagination (or openness).
