50|$|Intergalactic Computer Network or <b>Galactic</b> <b>Network</b> was a {{computer}} networking concept similar to today's Internet.|$|E
5000|$|In the MMO Eve Online (2003), players {{take the}} role of pilots for hire known as [...] "capsuleers" [...] or [...] "Empyreans". Through usage of capsule technology, they have their minds {{downloaded}} and transferred to a new clone through the <b>galactic</b> <b>network</b> at the moment before death.|$|E
5000|$|Mobile Archive Suckers : Large {{spacecraft}} or mobile habitats which {{travel at}} slower-than-light speeds between the brown dwarf stars which most polities orbit. Self-contained and self-sufficient, fitted {{with their own}} A-gates, they are fuelled by plasma piped-in by T-gate from nearby stars. Generally, the ships' systems are not connected to the <b>galactic</b> <b>network</b> at large. The crews and/or passengers can, {{if they do not}} wish to experience the long subjective timescales of travel by this method, disassemble themselves in an A-gate and [...] "sleep" [...] throughout the journey.|$|E
50|$|The Festival is an upload civilisation, {{originally}} intended to repair <b>galactic</b> information <b>networks,</b> that travels from system to system via starwisps, building the facilities it needs from local materials when it arrives. It usually prefers to interact with other upload civilisations, but any will do in a pinch. It asks for information it is unfamiliar with from those it visits, and will make any kind of payment in exchange.|$|R
5000|$|A {{distress}} {{signal from the}} sleeper ship eventually reaches [...] "Relay", a major node in the <b>galactic</b> communications <b>network.</b> A benign transcendent entity named [...] "Old One" [...] contacts Relay, seeking information about the Blight and the humans who released it, and reconstitutes a human man named Pham Nuwen from an old wreck to act as its agent, using his doubt of his own memory's veracity to bend him to the Old One's will. Ravna Bergsndot, the only human Relay employee, traces the sleeper ship's signal to the Tines world and persuades her employer to investigate what the human ship took from High Lab, contracting the merchant vessel Out of Band II, owned by two sentient plant Skroderiders, Blueshell and Greenstalk, to transport them.|$|R
40|$|Gravitational microlensing {{is known}} for baryonic dark matter searches. Here we show that microlensing also {{provides}} a unique tool {{for the detection of}} low mass planets (such as earths and neptunes) from the ground. A planetary system forms a binary lens (or, a multi-point lens), and we can determine the mass ratio of the planet with respect to the star and relative distance (= separation/Einstein ring radius) between the star and planet. Such a microlenisng planet search project requires a ≈ 2 m survey telescope, and a network of 1. 5 − 2 m follow-up telescopes capable of monitoring stars in the Bulge on a 24 -hour basis. During the off-season of the <b>Galactic</b> bulge, this <b>network</b> can be used for dark matter search by monitoring the stars in the LMC and SMC. 1...|$|R
5000|$|In Norman Spinrad's novel Songs {{from the}} Stars (1980), the term avatar {{is used in}} a {{description}} of a computer generated virtual experience. In the story, humans receive messages from an alien <b>galactic</b> <b>network</b> that wishes to share knowledge and experience with other advanced civilizations through [...] "songs". The humans build a [...] "galactic receiver" [...] that describes itself:The galactic receiver is programmed to derive species specific full sensory input data from standard galactic meaning code equations. By controlling your sensorium input along species specific parameters galactic songs astral back-project you into approximation of total involvement in artistically recreated broadcast realities...|$|E
50|$|In Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Dark Samus {{arrives in}} Aether while chasing the planet's Phazon. Shortly after, Samus arrives and {{encounters}} Dark Samus many times, eventually defeating her as Dark Aether was destroyed - but a post-credits scene shows Dark Samus reforming herself in deep space. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption shows {{a team of}} Space Pirates returned to Aether to pick up Phazon, and eventually found Dark Samus, who killed {{a third of the}} Pirates and brainwashed the rest to be their leader. After discovering Phaaze, Dark Samus begins her mission to spread Phazon across the universe - one of the planets hit was the Pirate Homeworld, in order to turn the rest of the Space Pirates into followers of Dark Samus. In an attack to the Galactic Federation vessel G.F.S. Valhalla, Dark Samus steals a supercomputer, the Aurora Unit 313, which is used to implant a computer virus into the <b>Galactic</b> Federation's <b>network</b> of Aurora Units, crippling it. Shortly after, Dark Samus leads an attack on the planet Norion and corrupts Samus and other bounty hunters with Phazon. After Samus destroys the Leviathans of four planets, she goes to Phaaze, where she finally defeats Dark Samus, who then merges itself with the Aurora Unit 313 in a last-ditch effort to defeat Samus. After the Aurora Unit is destroyed, Phaaze explodes, and all Phazon in the galaxy is rendered inert.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} friends accuse {{each other}} {{of having been}} replaced by androids, but prove that they are human. The androids close in on the group and capture Peter, but Gary is determined to finish the pub crawl. After having a drink at the other two pubs along the way, he runs towards the final pub, the World's End. Andy abandons Steven and chases Gary through the streets. At the World's End, Andy confronts Gary. In the quarrel, Andy realises that Gary attempted suicide {{in the years since}} school. As he tries to stop Gary from drawing his final pint, they discover a hidden chamber and reunite with Steven. A disembodied alien entity, the Network, reveals that the limited android invasion has been responsible for all of humanity's advances in telecommunications in recent decades, as a first step to joining a <b>galactic</b> community. The <b>Network</b> offers them eternal youth by becoming androids, but they refuse. Exasperated, the Network abandons the invasion after Gary persuades them that humanity is too stupid to join the aliens. Sam arrives to drive the group out of Newton Haven as it self-destructs.|$|R
500|$|... : Samus, {{along with}} bounty hunters Rundas, Ghor, and Gandrayda, are brought {{together}} in a ship over Norion to discuss a Space Pirate infection sweeping the <b>Galactic</b> Federation supercomputer <b>network,</b> one composed of organic Aurora Unit systems. Having this network shut down allows for the Pirates to engage in large scale combat {{in an attempt to}} further spread Phazon. As a battle erupts on Norion's surface, enormous Phazon-based seedships, called Leviathans, also begin to rain from the sky onto planets in order to begin corrupting them with Phazon. After a skirmish with Dark Samus which left her asleep for a month, Samus is charged with destroying these [...] "Phazon Seeds" [...] and restoring functionality to the Federation's computer network, as the other three hunters have mysteriously cut all contact during their missions. Samus is told that after the battle on Norion, her body gained the capability to self-generating non-hazardous Phazon, allowing for her to enter a [...] "Hypermode" [...] attack frenzy with her suit's PED (Phazon Enhancement Device). After purging three planets of Phazon (including a Space Pirate homeworld), the Federation locates the source of Phazon - planet Phaaze - which is made entirely of Phazon. As the Federation engages the Space Pirates in orbit, Samus enters the depths of the planet and succeeds in destroying Dark Samus and Phaaze, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert and cleansing her body from its corruption. A ship is seen following her into Warp Space at the end. It is the third game of the Metroid Prime series, and was released for the Wii console.|$|R
