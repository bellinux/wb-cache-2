500|$|On August 22, 2011, Lee went to Liberty Studios in Toronto {{in order}} to preview five {{mastered}} songs from the band's studio album—including [...] "My Heart Is Broken"—to a selected crowd of thirty people. During an interview with MTV News, the group revealed that they wanted the song to be included on the soundtrack of movie , with drummer Will Hunt saying, [...] "I've been screaming for [...] 'My Heart Is Broken' to land in that, because I think it would fit the story so well. I got sucked into the 'Twilight' vortex by the girls at home, so by default, I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> it." [...] However, the recording was not included on the soundtrack, subsequently premiering online on September 27, 2011, two weeks prior to the album's release. When interviewed by NME, Lee confirmed that the song was to be released as the second single from Evanescence. Following this, it was sent to pop, hot adult contemporary and Hot/Mod/AC radio stations in the United States on October 31, 2011. It was also served to mainstream radio stations on November 1, 2011, and was made available for digital download on November 11, 2011, being later released to modern rock radio on February 13, 2012.|$|E

500|$|The {{first time}} Karofsky {{received}} significant notice from critics {{was for the}} second season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience {{as much as it}} did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into [...] "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own." [...] MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio dismissed [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] as [...] "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and [...] "emotionally unsound". His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as The Atlantic Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on [...] "Furt" [...] of the bullying storyline as a [...] "very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved". In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I thought giving Kurt's bully, Karofsky (...), a miniature story arc that resolved itself only partially was a smart move. Up until now, he's been kind of a walking cliché, and now he gets to be someone who's not all repressed sexuality and monstrous tendencies." [...] Reiter commented, [...] "And best of all, we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> Karofsky's character develop a bit more. It was nice to see him let loose a little and dance, but all his back-and-forthing about glee was a little confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. And when we got the video back and watched it, it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> that again.'"

However, Scobie made the claim that this was the cause for [...] "many in the chapter [...] outraged and [...] proposals to [...] "go local" [...] or to affiliate with a different national fraternity at the house meeting immediately following the visit.

2500|$|Political {{commentators}} took {{different views}} on the raids, with intelligence agencies researcher and journalist Nicky Hager suggesting the raids {{may have been the}} result of the increased police and SIS staffing and resources aimed at anti-terrorism since 2001. (The raids and the surveillance preceding them cost $8 million to plan and execute.) Veteran activist John Minto criticised the police for the move, claiming that their actions provoked a [...] "climate of fear and repression" [...] while left-leaning commentator and blogger Martyn [...] "Bomber" [...] Bradbury, sided with the police, saying that in his dealings with the activist community he had become concerned with the actions of [...] "some clowns." [...] The Herald was criticised for publishing these comments which did not mention who the [...] "clowns" [...] were or name the blog site Bradbury claimed to have communicated with them on. New Zealand Herald columnist Matt McCarten saw the raids as being over the top; [...] "Some of the young people I know who were arrested are actually vegans who don't even believe in killing animals, let alone human beings. When you get the police searching homes of environmental activists trying to save snails on the West Coast, you know that things have got really silly." [...] McCarten also stated that New Zealanders should be more worried about the country joining the US database of terrorist suspects, and [...] "the creeping powers of our secret police." [...] However the 'From the left' columnist for the Dominion Post, Chris Trotter reacted differently, saying [...] "it wasn't the actions of the police that provoked my fury, but of those who'd forced their hand."
