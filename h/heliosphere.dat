5|$|The <b>heliosphere</b> is a stellar-wind bubble, {{a region}} of space {{dominated}} by the Sun, which radiates at roughly 400km/s its solar wind, a stream of charged particles, until it collides with the wind of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|The solar wind, {{a stream}} of charged {{particles}} flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the <b>heliosphere.</b> The heliopause is {{the point at which}} pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out {{to the edge of the}} scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the <b>heliosphere.</b> The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, {{when the}} disk of the Sun {{is covered by}} that of the Moon, parts of the Sun's {{surrounding}} atmosphere can be seen. It is composed of four distinct parts: the chromosphere, the transition region, the corona and the <b>heliosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the corona, {{a stellar}} wind of plasma {{particles}} expands {{outward from the}} star, until it interacts with the interstellar medium. For the Sun, the influence of its solar wind extends throughout a bubble-shaped region called the <b>heliosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>heliosphere,</b> the tenuous {{outermost}} {{atmosphere of}} the Sun, {{is filled with the}} solar wind plasma. This outermost layer of the Sun is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfvénic—that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfvén waves, at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU).|$|E
5|$|The shell {{would be}} {{vulnerable}} to impacts from interstellar bodies, such as comets, meteoroids, and material in interstellar space that is currently being deflected by the Sun's bow shock. The <b>heliosphere,</b> and any protection it theoretically provides, would cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|Turbulence {{and dynamic}} {{forces in the}} <b>heliosphere</b> cannot affect {{the shape of the}} solar corona within, because the {{information}} can only travel at the speed of Alfvén waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the <b>heliosphere,</b> forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape, until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought {{to be part of the}} heliopause. In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{deflecting}} {{the solar}} wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly {{from outside the}} Solar system. (Many cosmic rays are {{kept out of the}} Solar system by the Sun's magnetosphere, or <b>heliosphere.)</b> By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on December 13, 2010 that Voyager 1 {{had passed the}} reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind, as measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the <b>heliosphere.</b> Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU or 10.8billion miles (17.3billion kilometers) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{announced}} in June 2012 that the probe was detecting {{changes in the}} environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause. Voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space, which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the <b>heliosphere</b> from the Sun. The craft thus began to enter the interstellar medium {{at the edge of}} the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The <b>heliosphere</b> and {{planetary}} magnetic fields (for those planets that have them) partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays. The density of cosmic rays in {{the interstellar medium}} {{and the strength of}} the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{boundary}} of the <b>heliosphere,</b> the heliopause, is {{the point at which}} the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of interstellar space. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84AU from the Sun, respectively. Voyager 1 is reported to have crossed the heliopause in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|Under Bridge and Rossi, the MIT space plasma group {{included}} Frank Scherb, Edwin Lyon, Alan Lazarus, Alberto Bonnetti, Alberto Egidi, John Belcher and Constance Dilworth, who was Occhialini's wife. Its Faraday cups have collected data on plasma throughout the solar system: near Earth on OGO-1, OGO 3 and IMP 8, in interplanetary space on WIND, {{and in the}} <b>Heliosphere</b> and Heliosheath on Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.|$|E
5|$|While Voyager 1 is {{commonly}} spoken of as having left the Solar System simultaneously with having left the <b>heliosphere,</b> {{the two are}} not the same. The Solar System is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the Sun. The craft is presently less than one seventh {{the distance to the}} aphelion of Sedna, and it has not yet entered the Oort cloud, the source region of long-period comets, regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and {{interstellar}} space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the <b>heliosphere,</b> is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of Jupiter is {{the cavity}} {{created in the}} solar wind by the planet's magnetic field. Extending up to seven million kilometers in the Sun's direction and almost to the orbit of Saturn in the opposite direction, Jupiter's magnetosphere is {{the largest and most}} powerful of any planetary magnetosphere in the Solar System, and by volume the largest known continuous structure in the Solar System after the <b>heliosphere.</b> Wider and flatter than the Earth's magnetosphere, Jupiter's is stronger by an order of magnitude, while its magnetic moment is roughly 18,000 times larger. The existence of Jupiter's magnetic field was first inferred from observations of radio emissions {{at the end of the}} 1950s and was directly observed by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Within 50 million years, the {{pressure}} and density of hydrogen in {{the centre of the}} protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion. Isochrones for Solar Mixture | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | arxiv=astro-ph/0104292 | date=2001 | volume=136 |issue=2 | pages=417–437 | doi=10.1086/321795 | bibcode=2001ApJS..136..417Y}} The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the <b>heliosphere</b> and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.|$|E

25|$|On August 30, 2007, Voyager 2 {{passed the}} {{termination}} shock and then {{entered into the}} heliosheath, approximately 1 billion miles (1.6 billion km) closer to the Sun than Voyager 1 did. This {{is due to the}} interstellar magnetic field of deep space. The southern hemisphere of the Solar System's <b>heliosphere</b> is being pushed in.|$|E
25|$|Once its {{planetary}} mission was over, Voyager 2 {{was described as}} working on an interstellar mission, which NASA is using {{to find out what}} the Solar System is like beyond the <b>heliosphere.</b> Voyager 2 is currently transmitting scientific data at about 160 bits per second. Information about continuing telemetry exchanges with Voyager 2 is available from Voyager Weekly Reports.|$|E
25|$|The Voyager {{program is}} a {{continuing}} American scientific program that employs two robotic probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, to study the outer Solar System. They were launched in 1977 {{to take advantage of}} a favorable alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and are now exploring the outer boundary of the <b>heliosphere</b> in interstellar space. Although their original mission was to study only the planetary systems of Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 2 continued on to Uranus and Neptune, and both Voyagers are now tasked with exploring interstellar space. Their mission has been extended three times, and both probes continue to collect and relay useful scientific data. Neither Uranus nor Neptune has been visited by any probe other than Voyager 2.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to a lack}} of data, {{conditions}} in local interstellar space are not known for certain. It is expected that NASA's Voyager spacecraft, as they pass the heliopause, will transmit valuable data on radiation levels and solar wind to Earth. How well the <b>heliosphere</b> shields the Solar System from cosmic rays is poorly understood. A NASA-funded team has developed a concept of a [...] "Vision Mission" [...] dedicated to sending a probe to the <b>heliosphere.</b>|$|E
500|$|The vast {{majority}} of the Solar System consists of a near-vacuum known as the interplanetary medium. Along with light, the Sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles (a plasma) known as the solar wind. This stream of particles spreads outwards at roughly 1.5 million kilometres per hour, creating a tenuous atmosphere that permeates the interplanetary medium out to at least 100AU (see [...] ). Activity on the Sun's surface, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, disturb the <b>heliosphere,</b> creating space weather and causing geomagnetic storms. The largest structure within the <b>heliosphere</b> is the heliospheric current sheet, a spiral form created by the actions of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium.|$|E
500|$|The spacecraft, still {{travelling}} at , is {{the farthest}} man-made object from Earth {{and the first}} one to leave the Solar System. Its mission has been extended and continues to this day, with the aim of investigating the boundaries of the Solar system, including the Kuiper belt, the <b>heliosphere</b> and interstellar space. Operating for [...] as of today (...) , it receives routine commands and transmits data back to the Deep Space Network.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} {{its primary}} mission with the flyby of Saturn on November 20, 1980, Voyager 1 became {{the third of}} five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity {{that will allow them}} to leave the Solar System. [...] It is pursuing an extended mission to explore the regions and boundaries of the outer <b>heliosphere.</b> On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause to become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space and study the interstellar medium.|$|E
500|$|The {{shape and}} {{form of the}} outer edge of the <b>heliosphere</b> is likely {{affected}} by the fluid dynamics of interactions with the interstellar medium as well as solar magnetic fields prevailing to the south, e.g. it is bluntly shaped with the northern hemisphere extending 9AU farther than the southern hemisphere. Beyond the heliopause, at around 230 AU, lies the bow shock, a plasma [...] "wake" [...] left by the Sun as it travels through the Milky Way.|$|E
500|$|The Oort cloud ( [...] or , {{named after}} the Dutch {{astronomer}} Jan Oort), sometimes called the Öpik–Oort cloud, is a theoretical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals believed to surround the Sun to as far as somewhere between [...] It {{is divided into two}} regions: a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud (or Hills cloud) and a spherical outer Oort cloud. Both regions lie beyond the <b>heliosphere</b> and in interstellar space. The Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, the other two reservoirs of trans-Neptunian objects, are less than one thousandth as far from the Sun as the Oort cloud.|$|E
500|$|The Millennium Park Welcome Center in the Northwest Pavilion offers {{guides to}} the park and wheelchairs. It houses {{exhibitions}} on parks and energy, and has interactive displays on how the pavilions' solar panels function and on renewable energy. There are exhibits with interactive web-based touch screens that depict the city's use of solar energy, and a dynamic multi-screen video presentation on electricity generation and usage. The building's atrium includes a sculpture by Chicago-based artists Patrick McGee and Adelheid Mers with three backlit [...] two-way mirrors. The sculpture, titled <b>Heliosphere,</b> Biosphere, Technosphere, is [...] "designed to interpret the links between the Earth's atmosphere, the solar system and scientific applications". It is the only permanent work of art by Chicago artists within the park.|$|E
500|$|In late 2012, {{researchers}} reported that particle {{data from the}} spacecraft suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause. Measurements from the spacecraft revealed a steady rise since May in collisions with high energy particles (above 70 MeV), which {{are thought to be}} cosmic rays emanating from supernova explosions far beyond the Solar System, with a sharp increase in these collisions in late August. At the same time, in late August, there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low-energy particles, which are thought to originate from the Sun. Ed Roelof, space scientist at Johns Hopkins University and principal investigator for the Low-Energy Charged Particle instrument on the spacecraft declared that [...] "Most scientists involved with Voyager 1 would agree that [...] have been sufficiently satisfied." [...] However, the last criterion for officially declaring that Voyager 1 had crossed the boundary, the expected change in magnetic field direction (from that of the Sun to that of the interstellar field beyond), had not been observed (the field had changed direction by only 2 degrees), which suggested to some that the nature of the edge of the <b>heliosphere</b> had been misjudged. On December 3, 2012, Voyager project scientist Ed Stone of the California Institute of Technology said, [...] "Voyager has discovered a new region of the <b>heliosphere</b> that we had not realized was there. We're still inside, apparently. But the magnetic field now is connected to the outside. So it's like a highway letting particles in and out." [...] The magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than Voyager 1 encountered before the termination shock. It was expected to be the last barrier before the spacecraft exited the Solar System completely and entered interstellar space.|$|E
500|$|The stellar wind {{emitted by}} Epsilon Eridani expands until it collides with the {{surrounding}} interstellar medium of diffuse gas and dust, resulting in a bubble of heated hydrogen gas (an astrosphere, {{the equivalent of the}} <b>heliosphere</b> that surrounds the Sun). The absorption spectrum from this gas has been measured with the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing the properties of the stellar wind to be estimated. Epsilon Eridani's hot corona results in a mass loss rate in Epsilon Eridani's stellar wind that is 30 times higher than the Sun's. This stellar wind generates the astrosphere that spans about [...] and contains a bow shock that lies [...] from Epsilon Eridani. At its estimated distance from Earth, this astrosphere spans 42arcminutes, which is wider than the apparent size of the full Moon.|$|E
500|$|Interplanetary space, {{the space}} around the Sun and planets of the Solar System, is the region {{dominated}} by the interplanetary medium, which extends out to the heliopause where {{the influence of the}} galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun. Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the <b>heliosphere)</b> for billions of kilometers into space. This wind has a particle density of 5–10 protons/cm3 and is moving at a velocity of [...] The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind. The discovery since 1995 of extrasolar planets means that other stars must possess their own interplanetary media.|$|E
500|$|Rather than air, {{the solar}} wind is a stream of charged particles—a plasma—ejected from the upper {{atmosphere}} of the sun {{at a rate of}} [...] It consists mostly of electrons and protons with energies of about 1 keV. The stream of particles varies in temperature and speed with the passage of time. These particles are able to escape the sun's gravity, {{in part because of the}} high temperature of the corona, but also because of high kinetic energy that particles gain through a process that is not well understood. The solar wind creates the <b>Heliosphere,</b> a vast bubble in the interstellar medium surrounding the Solar System. Planets require large magnetic fields in order to reduce the ionization of their upper atmosphere by {{the solar wind}}. Other phenomena caused by the solar wind include geomagnetic storms that can knock out power grids on Earth, the aurorae such as the Northern Lights, and the plasma tails of comets that always point away from the sun.|$|E
2500|$|Solar Wind Anisotropies (...) {{which uses}} telescopes {{sensitive}} to a characteristic wavelength of hydrogen {{to measure the}} solar wind mass flux, map {{the density of the}} <b>heliosphere,</b> and observe the large-scale structure of the solar wind streams.|$|E
2500|$|Filament {{cavities}} are cooler {{clouds of}} gases (plasma) suspended above the Sun's surface by magnetic forces. The regions of intense magnetic field look dark in images {{because they are}} empty of hot plasma. In fact, {{the sum of the}} magnetic pressure and plasma pressure must be constant everywhere on the <b>heliosphere</b> in order to have an equilibrium configuration: where the magnetic field is higher, the plasma must be cooler or less dense. The plasma pressure [...] can be calculated by the state equation of a perfect gas [...] , where [...] is the particle number density, [...] the Boltzmann constant and [...] the plasma temperature. It is evident from the equation that the plasma pressure lowers when the plasma temperature decreases with respect to the surrounding regions or when the zone of intense magnetic field empties. The same physical effect renders sunspots apparently dark in the photosphere.|$|E
