Because the grille is capable of absorbing this vibration, softer grilles are (in general) less prone to rattling except at extremely high sound pressure levels.|$|E
5000|$|One modern {{example is}} climate stability. [...] Classic {{examples}} of common goods are water and air. Water and air can be polluted: water flows can be tapped beyond sustainability, and air {{is often used}} in combustion, whether by motor vehicles, smokers, factories, wood fires. In the production process these resources and others are changed into finished products such as food, shoes, toys, furniture, cars, houses and televisions. Another example of a private exploitation treated as a renewable resource and commonly cited have been trees or timber at critical stages (used for wood and paper), oil (used for plastic, paints, <b>foam,</b> <b>fabric,</b> and often burned to create energy), mined metals (used to create machines, tools, nails, cans, coins), and crops (to become cotton and many kinds of foods). Fish stocks in international waters are also cited often. In this later example (avoiding any issues of the natural rights of the fish), while legal excluded from fishing may not apply, when fish are withdrawn from the water without any limits being imposed, living stocks of fish {{are likely to be}} depleted for any later fishermen. To describe situations in which economic users withdraw resources to secure short-term gains without regard for the long-term consequences, the term tragedy of the commons was coined. For example, forest exploitation leads to barren lands, and overfishing leads to a reduction of overall fish stocks, both of which eventually result in diminishing yields to be withdrawn periodically.|$|E
40|$|Auto {{shredder}} residue or “ASR ” is a heterogeneous mixture of largely non-metallic materials {{resulting from the}} shredding of auto bodies, appliances, and other scrap metal materials. An auto shredder is a large, electric-powered hammermill that pulverizes metal into fist-sized pieces which are then sorted by different “downstream ” metal separation processes including magnets, trommels, screens, optical scanners, eddy currents, {{and other types of}} proprietary process equipment. ASR is the material that remains after ferrous and nonferrous metals have been separated and removed from the various streams comprising the output of the shredder. Shredder output is known as “aggregate ” in the industry and is an intermediate process material that contains significant amounts of valuable ferrous and nonferrous metal that is separated and sold as commodities. In contrast, ASR consists primarily of <b>foam,</b> <b>fabric,</b> plastics, rubber, tires, glass, wood, and debris materials, along with minute amounts of remaining metallic material that is too small to be economically separated and removed from the aggregate. Following completion of processing for metals separation and removal, ASR is sent to an in-line treatment system (described below) where it is treated prior to transport off-site, primarily for use as alternative daily landfill cover.

This prediction analysis is based on Model I from the Combustion Behaviour of Upholstered Furniture (CBUF) study. The Nordtest furniture specimens ranged from 1 to 3 seaters and used two different types of <b>foam</b> and <b>fabrics.</b> Both types of <b>foam</b> and <b>fabric</b> were representative of the two extremes typically found on the market. The foams used were High Resilience Polyurethane and Standard Polyurethane. The fabrics used were 100 % polypropylene and 100 % cotton/linen blend. A total of 141 full-scale furniture tests in the Furniture Calorimeter and 33 small-scale tests in the Cone Calorimeter were conducted at the fire-testing laboratory at CSIRO in Melbourne. In addition to this a further 22 small-scale tests in the Cone Calorimeter were conducted in the fire-testing laboratory in Christchurch at the University of Canterbury. The outcomes from this study showed that Model I is a good predictor of the full-scale results for the Standard Polyurethane <b>foam</b> with both <b>fabric</b> combinations. The High Resilience Polyurethane foam burnt more readily with its cotton/linen fabric cover than with the polypropylene fabric, demonstrating that fabric effects can be quite pronounced in determining the burning behaviour of upholstered furniture. The High Resilience Polyurethane was a better performer than the Standard Polyurethane foam, in terms of producing a lower heat release rate, and was generally over predicted, confirming that for these particular furniture specimens, Model I's results range from good to conservative...|$|R

40|$|Magnetorheological fluids {{belong to}} the class of field-responsive fluids that undergo large, {{reversible}} and fast changes in their rheological properties when acted upon by an external magnetic field. 'Smart' or controllable composite materials have been obtained by doping polymers, <b>foams,</b> <b>fabrics</b> etc. with these field-responsive fluids. The resulting composite materials have potential applications in numerous fields ranging from adaptive energy absorption, automotive crash protection to microfluidic valves, mixers and separation devices. A series of stable magnetorheological (MR) fluids have been systematically characterized under steady shearing, creep and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) flow conditions. A rheometer fixture for applying nearly uniform magnetic fields up to 0. 4 T has been fabricated to measure both steady-state and transient changes in the fluid properties under applied fields. Stable MR fluids with a markedly improved dynamic response (yield stress {{as a function of}} magnetic field) compared to commercial fluids have been formulated by increasing the constituent particle size and by stabilizing the system against sedimentation. A new "soft-glassy rheology" model has been used to model the fluid response time and visco-elasto-plastic response under creep conditions and oscillatory loadings. (cont.) The experiments and model show that the evolution of chain structure and plastic collapse in these suspensions exhibits a universal scaling with the dimensionless stress s = [sigma]/[sigma]y. Structure evolution, pattern formation and dynamics of MR fluid flow in microchannel geometries has been analyzed using high-speed digital video microscopy. In order to elucidate the mechanisms that control MR structure formation, experiments have been performed while varying the magnetic field, particle size, channel geometry, concentration and fluid composition. Excellent qualitative agreement has been obtained with Brownian Dynamics simulations and useful scalings based on interplay of magnetostatic & viscous forces have been extracted to understand the field-dependent fluid response on the macro & micro scale. Novel MR elastomeric materials and microparticles have been synthesized by doping photo-curable or thermo-curable polymers with field-responsive fluids. A high-throughput micromolding technique for synthesis of controllable particles of anisotropic shapes and sizes has been developed. Flexible and permanent chain-like structures have also been synthesized using amidation chemistry. Potential microfluidic applications such as field-responsive valves, mixers and separation devices using these 'smart' materials have also been investigated. by Suraj Sharadchandra Deshmukh.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Combustion-modified {{polyurethane}} flexible foams can exhibit different flammability characteristics when {{covered with}} a fabric than when the foam alone is exposed to the same conditions. Recognizing this, regulatory and advisory agencies have turned to composite testing rather than component testing (e. g., the Boston Chair Test, California Technical Bulletin 133). It is doubtful that a small scale test could supplant the full scale tests; however, a method of screening composites would be very desirable. The Society of the Plastics Industry’s Flexible Foam Combustibility Commit-tee previously reported a classification system for foams alone using ASTM E 906 as the test procedure. Using piloted ignition and an imposed flux of 1. 75 Watts/cm 2,the foams could be partially classified. When the self-propagating flux values {{were added to the}} prior data, a classification system was developed.
