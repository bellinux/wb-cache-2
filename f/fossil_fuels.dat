40|$|The <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> {{divestment}} {{movement has}} undergone explosive {{growth over the}} last few years - expanding from encouraging educational institutions to adopt ethical investment policies to focusing upon cities, pension funds and philanthropic charities. The <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> divestment movement has attained global ambitions - challenging sovereign wealth funds and national governments to engage in <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> divestment, and pushing for <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> divestment at international climate talks - such as the Paris Climate Summit in 2015. By exploring and analysing a key campaign to 'Divest Norway', this chapter considers the efforts to globalise and internationalise the <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> divestment campaign. Part 1 explores the origins of the <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> divestment movement, and the application of such strategies in a variety of contexts. Part 2 looks at the campaign to divest Norway's sovereign wealth fund of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> investments. There has been much discussion as to whether the bold decision of Norway to engage in coal divestment will encourage and inspire other sovereign wealth funds to engage in <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> divestment.

40|$|<b>Fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> {{subsidies}} {{are a key}} barrier for economic development and climate change mitigation. While the plunge in international fuel prices has increased {{the political will to}} introduce <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> subsidy reforms, recently introduced reforms may risk backsliding when fuel prices rebound − particularly if they fail to address the underlying mechanisms that create demand for low <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> prices. Extant literature has mostly focused on the consequences of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> subsidies, including their economic or environmental impact, and the social contract that make their reform difficult. In this paper, we complement the extant literature with a socio-technical perspective of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> subsidies to explore the systemic mechanisms that often keep subsidies in place and how these mechanisms can be weakened. Specifically, in case studies of the electricity sectors in South Africa and Tunisia, we trace the socio-technical foundations of their <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> subsidy regimes and the potential of renewable energy policy in disrupting this regime We discuss the relevance of our results for national policymakers wishing to implement and international actors wishing to support <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> subsidy reform. In particular, we highlight that the socio-technical perspective of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> subsidies offers new intervention points for subsidy reform and that policy designs and assistance should strengthen technologies and actors that are most likely to destabilize the <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> subsidy regime...|$|R

5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) {{was formed}} in 1989 as a project {{under the auspices of}} the National Association of Manufacturers.
