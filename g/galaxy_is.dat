5|$|At {{the extreme}} of {{interactions}} are galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, {{as compared to the}} original galaxies. If one of the merging galaxies is much more massive than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism. The more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> torn apart. The Milky Way <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 a dwarf galaxy, {{also named}} Coma Berenices, was {{discovered}} in the constellation. The <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> a faint satellite of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda <b>Galaxy</b> <b>is</b> among the brightest of the Messier objects - making it {{visible to the}} naked eye on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.|$|E
5000|$|Dark <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{composed}} of dark matter. Furthermore, dark <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> theoretically {{composed of}} hydrogen and dust. [...] Some scientists {{support the idea}} that dark galaxies may contain stars. Yet the exact composition of dark <b>galaxies</b> <b>is</b> unknown because there is no conclusive way to spot them so far. However, astronomers estimate that the mass of the gas in these <b>galaxies</b> <b>is</b> approximately 1 billion times that of the Sun.|$|R
5|$|Irregular <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> chaotic in appearance, and {{are neither}} spiral nor elliptical. About {{a quarter of}} all <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> irregular, and the {{peculiar}} shapes of such <b>galaxies</b> may <b>be</b> the result of gravitational interaction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Some {{results from}} an imaging program to {{identify}} low-redshift (0. 09 < z < 1. 63) damped Lyα (DLA) <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> presented. The standard paradigm that was widely accepted a decade ago, that DLA <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> the progenitors of luminous disk <b>galaxies,</b> <b>is</b> now being seriously challenged.

5|$|A radio <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> {{an active}} galaxy {{that is very}} {{luminous}} in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, Quasars, and Blazars. Quasars {{are believed to be}} the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.|$|E
5|$|A spiral <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
5|$|An active <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> a {{formation}} that emits {{a significant amount}} of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.|$|E
5|$|The largest <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> giant {{elliptical}}s. Many elliptical <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{believed to}} form {{due to the}} interaction of galaxies, resulting in a collision and merger. They can grow to enormous sizes (compared to spiral galaxies, for example), and giant elliptical <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> often found near the core of large galaxy clusters.|$|R
50|$|Type Sm and Im <b>galaxies</b> {{have also}} <b>been</b> {{categorized}} as irregular galaxies with some structure (type Irr-1). Sm <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> typically disrupted and asymmetric. dSm <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> dwarf spiral <b>galaxies</b> or dwarf irregular galaxies, depending on categorization scheme.|$|R
40|$|The Einstein Observatory, Exosat, and Ginga {{observations}} of X-rays from normal <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> reviewed. Local spirals and bright spiral <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> discussed, emphasizing {{the nature of}} the X-ray sources and addressing average sample properties and correlation with other wavebands. Starburst activity and low-activity nuclei are examined. The hot ISM, halos, and cooling flows in elliptical <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> addressed, and what X-ray observations reveal about the mass of early-type <b>galaxies</b> <b>is</b> considered. The relationship between radio sources and gaseous halos and between galaxies and the X-ray background is discussed...|$|R
5|$|Based on its {{appearance}} in visible light, the Andromeda <b>Galaxy</b> <b>is</b> classified as an SA(s)b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs–Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies. However, {{data from the}} 2MASS survey showed that Andromeda is actually a barred spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar oriented along its long axis.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario <b>Galaxy</b> <b>is</b> a 2007 {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Wii. It is the third 3D game in the Super Mario series. The game was re-released as a Nintendo Selects title in 2011, and as a download via the Wii U's eShop in 2015. The story revolves around the protagonist, Mario, who is on a quest to rescue Princess Peach whilst simultaneously saving the universe from Bowser.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from galactic motion. Galaxies rotate {{much faster than}} the amount of visible matter suggests they should; the gravity from the ordinary matter {{is not enough to}} hold the galaxy together. Scientists theorize that the <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> held together by huge quantities of dark matter. Similarly, clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} objects outside our <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> {{a branch of}} {{astronomy}} concerned with the formation and evolution of Galaxies, their morphology (description) and classification, the observation of active galaxies, and at a larger scale, the groups and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the latter {{is important for the}} understanding of the large-scale structure of the cosmos.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes {{can observe}} highly {{energetic}} galactic phenomena. Ultraviolet flares are sometimes observed when {{a star in}} a distant <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> torn apart from the tidal forces of a nearby black hole. The distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.|$|E
5|$|A shell <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} {{elliptical}} galaxy where {{the stars in the}} galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.|$|E

40|$|Images of {{a sample}} of low surface {{brightness}} (LSB) disk <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> presented. These <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> generally late types; however, they are not dwarfs, being intrinsically large and luminous.

5|$|Along {{with the}} Andromeda Galaxy and its companions, the {{constellation}} also features NGC 891 (Caldwell 23), a smaller galaxy {{just east of}} Almach. It is a barred spiral galaxy seen edge-on, with a dark dust lane visible down the middle. NGC 891 is incredibly faint and small despite its magnitude of 9.9, as its surface brightness of 14.6 indicates; it is 13.5 by 2.8 arcminutes in size. NGC 891 was discovered by the brother-and-sister team of William and Caroline Herschel in August 1783. This <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> at an approximate distance of 30 million light-years from Earth, calculated from its redshift of 0.002.|$|E
5|$|Blazing Lazers, {{known as}} Gunhed in Japan, is a shoot 'em up video game {{developed}} by Hudson Soft and Compile. It {{was released in}} Japan and North America in 1989 for the TurboGrafx-16. It {{is based on the}} Japanese film Gunhed, and the references to the film were removed for the North American release. In the game, a fictional <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> under attack by an enemy space armada called the Dark Squadron, and this galaxy's only chance for survival is the Gunhed Advanced Star Fighter, who must destroy the Dark Squadron and its Super Weapons. The gameplay features fast vertical scrolling and a wide array of weapons for the player to use.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy {{appears to}} have {{predominantly}} more old stars with ages >7 years. The estimated luminosity of Andromeda <b>Galaxy,</b> , <b>is</b> about 25% {{higher than that of}} our own galaxy. However, the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light, so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the Andromeda Galaxy (including to propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega-parsecs of the Milky Way, after the Sombrero Galaxy, with an absolute magnitude of around -22.21 or close).|$|E
5000|$|Blue compact dwarf <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> blue in {{appearance}} {{because of the}} large cluster of hot massive stars. The <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> relatively dim and appear to be irregular in shape. They are typically chaotic {{in appearance}}.|$|R
50|$|The 25 target <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{chosen to}} be {{representative}} (i.e. cover the range of basic galaxy parameters and environments) of nearby (distance < 27 Mpc) early type (E and S0) galaxies. The survey also includes 3 `bonus’ <b>galaxies</b> which have <b>been</b> observed during times that the main sample <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> not available.

5|$|Even on a {{habitable}} {{planet with}} enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules are required {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> important in determining the galactic habitable zone. A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine {{the outer edge of the}} galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing formaldehyde and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither conclusive nor complete.|$|E
5|$|Examination of M87 at far {{infrared}} wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25μm. Normally such emission {{may be an}} indication of thermal emission by warm dust. However, {{in the case of}} M87, the emission appears to be fully explained by synchrotron radiation from the jet. Within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to survive for no more than 46million years because of the X-ray emission from the core. This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy. The combined mass of dust in this <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> no more than 70,000 times the mass of the Sun. By comparison, the Milky Way contains about a hundred million (108) solar masses worth of dust.|$|E
