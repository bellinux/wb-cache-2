This is {{probably}} best implemented in <b>heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> steel, as wood doesn't really give enough resistance to the side forces that develop during heavy work. Most woodworkers who use this style with wood end up making another base before very long.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, a $40 million {{expansion}} was completed. A new hot-strip mill {{was opened}} on May 20, 1953 that employed 3,000. One year later, a cold reduction mill, strip pickler, light gauge zincgrip and a <b>heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> zincgrip was completed {{at a cost}} of $12 million. At the close of the 1950s, Armco announced another $95 million upgrade, later upgraded to $145 million. In 1963, the Amanda blast furnace was completed as part of the upgrade.|$|E
500|$|Restoration work {{involved}} {{a collaboration between}} staff from British Waterways and volunteer labour. In 1966 Sulhamstead Lock was rebuilt and the re-puddling of the dry section at Limpley Stoke was begun. In 1968, restoration work was undertaken on the Bath Locks and Burghfield Lock. In Reading at Bridge Street the navigable headroom had been reduced from [...] to [...] by girders added to {{the underside of the}} bridge. This was replaced with a new bridge, enabling craft to pass more easily. The canal was reopened from the Thames to Hungerford Wharf in July 1974. Re-puddling was a long process, so experiments with the use of <b>heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> polythene to line the canal were undertaken. The Avoncliff Aqueduct was lined with a concrete [...] "cradle" [...] and made water-tight in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|In Mississippi, along State Route 63, {{chain link}} fences were built to prevent gopher {{tortoise}} mortality from traffic. These fences, made from <b>heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> wire for durability, are three {{feet high and}} are buried one foot below the surface. The fences have [...] "turnarounds" [...] at either end, which are angled fences that redirect tortoises back into the area from which they come.

2500|$|Takuro {{described}} the [...] "Expo'99" [...] as {{a dream come}} true. When the album <b>Heavy</b> <b>Gauge</b> was released, in October 1999, Takuro wrote a diary entry in Glay's official home page, describing the album as a representation of his feelings at that moment. His feelings were not of happiness, but of [...] "emptiness" [...] and {{not knowing what to}} do after [...] "doing everything" [...] they wanted to. The album is seen as a first step to a new direction in the band's career. The band considered disbanding in 2000, after releasing their , which was a suggestion made by fellow singer Yuki Isoya, whose group Judy and Mary had disbanded.|$|E

2500|$|To {{meet this}} goal, the Bearcat's {{fuselage}} was about [...] {{shorter than the}} Hellcat, and was cut down vertically behind the cockpit area. This allowed {{the use of a}} bubble canopy, the first to be fit to a US Navy fighter. The vertical stabilizer was the same height as the Hellcat's, but increased aspect ratio, giving it a thinner look. Similarly, the main wing had the same span, but having lower thickness, especially at the root. Structurally the fuselage used flush riveting as well as spot welding, with a <b>heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> 302W aluminum alloy skin suitable for carrier landings. Armor protection was provided for the pilot, engine and oil cooler.|$|E
2500|$|Since then, Glay has {{produced}} several hit singles, {{most of them}} reaching No.1 on the charts. In the period between 1997 and 2000, Glay produced six million-selling singles, being the third artist with most million-selling singles of all time. Their 13th single [...] "Yuuwaku" [...] topped Oricon yearly single ranking in 1998. In 1999, their 16th single [...] "Winter, Again" [...] was number two {{of the year and}} won the 41st Japan Record Awards [...] "Grand Prix" [...] award, which is considered the most important Japanese music award. Their albums were also massively successful; both Pure Soul (1998) and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Gauge</b> (1999), along with the compilation album [...] (2000), sold more than two million copies each.|$|E
2500|$|Braising {{pans and}} {{roasting}} pans (also known as braisers and roasters) are large, wide and shallow, to provide space {{to cook a}} roast (chicken, beef or pork). They typically have two loop or tab handles, and may have a cover. Roasters are usually made of <b>heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> metal {{so that they may}} be used safely on a cooktop following roasting in an oven. Unlike most other cooking vessels, roasters are usually rectangular or oval. There is no sharp boundary between braisers and roasters – the same pan, with or without a cover, can be used for both functions. In Europe, a clay roaster [...] is still popular because it allows roasting without adding grease or liquids. This helps preserve flavor and nutrients. Having to soak the pot in water for 15 minutes before use is a notable drawback.|$|E
50|$|In February 1932 Rover Coventry {{announced}} {{strengthening of}} their Family Ten chassis by using <b>heavier</b> <b>gauge</b> material and re-designed cross members to improve torsional rigidity. These improvements were, they said, {{the outcome of}} lengthy testing on New Zealand's and Australia's roughest roads carried out to make the cars suitable for overseas use.|$|R
50|$|The British {{eventually}} {{adopted a}} similar approach, {{but it was}} incompletely implemented when the Germans launched the 1918 Spring Offensive and proved disastrously ineffective. France, by contrast, relied on artillery and reserves, not entrenchment. The characteristic barbed wire placed before trenches, in belts 15 m deep or more, differed, too; the German wire was <b>heavier</b> <b>gauge,</b> and British wire cutters, designed for the thinner native product, were unable to cut it.|$|R
5000|$|String gauge {{is subject}} to {{personal}} preferences of the musician, but acoustic guitars are typically strung with a <b>heavier</b> <b>gauge</b> than electric guitars. The need for projection {{due to lack of}} amplification {{is one of the main}} reasons for this.(Note: strings in dark gray boxes are bronze wound. All others are plain. These are for steel string guitars, not classical nylon/gut strings. The gauge values are in inches.) ...|$|R
2500|$|The 1972 Caprice {{received}} a facelift with a revised grille that was lower in height than the '71 model {{flanked by a}} new bumper with increased protection one year ahead of the Federal mandate. This was done by a bumper within bumper design. <b>Heavy</b> <b>gauge</b> beams reinforced the bumper which {{are attached to the}} frame. The rear bumper also featured this design and now had the triple taillights now mounted in the bumper. Engine offerings were carried over from 1971 with the switch to [...] "net" [...] horsepower ratings including [...] for the standard two-barrel [...] Turbo Fire V8, [...] ( [...] with optional dual exhaust) for the four-barrel Turbo Jet 400 big-block V8 and [...] for the four-barrel dual exhaust [...] Turbo Jet V8 (rated at [...] in wagons with single exhaust). Turbo Hydramatic transmission, variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes continued as standard equipment. New to the Caprice lineup was a pillared four-door sedan. All models also featured a revised [...] "Astro Ventilation" [...] system utilizing vents in the doorjambs that replaced the troublesome 1971 version that used vents in the trunklid and {{turned out to be a}} major source of complaints to Chevy (and other GM divisions) dealers from customers. 6-way power seats, 8-track tape players, and air conditioning were optional.|$|E

5000|$|Some [...] "historically-informed" [...] strings use an {{open metal}} winding with a [...] "barber pole" [...] appearance. This {{practice}} improves the acoustic performance of <b>heavier</b> <b>gauge</b> gut strings by adding mass {{and making the}} string thinner for its tension. Specimens of such open wound strings are known from the early 18th century, {{in a collection of}} artifacts from Antonio Stradivari. [...] "Silk and steel" [...] guitar strings are overwound steel strings with silk filaments under the winding.|$|R
50|$|The <b>heavier</b> <b>gauges</b> of {{linoleum}} {{are known}} as “battleship linoleum”, and are mainly used in high-traffic situations like offices and public buildings. It was originally manufactured to meet the specifications of the U.S. Navy for warship deck covering on enclosed decks instead of wood, hence the name. Most U.S. Navy warships removed their linoleum deck coverings following the attack on Pearl Harbor, as they were considered too flammable. (Use of linoleum persisted in U.S. Navy submarines.) Royal Navy warships used the similar product “Corticine”.|$|R

25|$|A second G.P. was built, {{which was}} {{structurally}} stronger {{through the use}} of <b>heavier</b> <b>gauge</b> metal fittings and a revised structure, with power supplied by two Rolls-Royce 190hp engines (later to be renamed Falcon) driving handed four-bladed propellers in similar fashion to the first aircraft. Other changes included four ailerons, one on each wing, instead of just the upper mainplanes, engine nacelles raised clear of the lower mainplanes and scalloped trailing edges {{through the use of}} steel wire trailing edge members, (a retrograde step as the wire corroded quickly causing damage to the fabric covering).|$|R
50|$|Another problem {{discovered}} {{during construction}} of the V1 was that Rethel's monocoque technique in fact {{turned out to be}} much heavier than expected. Some of this was a problem in the actual design; since the sheets ran the length of the plane, they had to be as thick as the thickest point on the entire plane. More traditional designs could use lighter or <b>heavier</b> <b>gauges</b> in various places. The main problem, however, was that the design required considerably more rivets than expected, and as a result the plane was overweight.|$|R
50|$|The tuning is {{commonly}} used by metal and hard rock artists to achieve a heavier, deeper sound. It also makes bending easier for the player than in E standard using the same <b>gauge</b> of strings. <b>Heavier</b> <b>gauge</b> strings {{can be used in}} order to maintain tension in the strings. It is possible to play without them, but difficulties can be experienced as it becomes quite easy to unintentionally bend notes and chords out of tune. However, the ease of bends can be desirable, depending on playing style of the musician.|$|R

50|$|A guitar's frets, fretboard, tuners, headstock, and truss rod, all {{attached}} to a long wooden extension, collectively constitute its neck. The wood {{used to make the}} fretboard usually differs from the wood {{in the rest of the}} neck. The bending stress on the neck is considerable, particularly when <b>heavier</b> <b>gauge</b> strings are used (see Tuning), and the ability of the neck to resist bending (see Truss rod) is important to the guitar's ability to hold a constant pitch during tuning or when strings are fretted. The rigidity of the neck with respect to the body of the guitar is one determinant of a good instrument versus a poor-quality one.|$|R
50|$|The S.30 series were {{outfitted}} with four Bristol Perseus XIIc sleeve valve engines {{in the place}} of the Pegasus engines; the Perseus engines were more efficient but provided a lower power output of , but the decrease in thrust was effectively compensated for via the adoption of smaller diameter nacelles which had resulted in a substantial reduction in drag. It also had a strengthened airframe and used <b>heavier</b> <b>gauge</b> sheeting on the fuselage and wings; while these changes allowed the takeoff weight to be increased to 46000 lb with a corresponding range of 1500 mi, the S.30 had broadly the same performance as the preceding S.23 flying boats.|$|R
