5|$|Aboard the ship, {{passenger}} John Geiger hacks {{into the}} ship's computer system, {{and the following}} evening, he destroys the ship's communication systems and kills the captain. After remotely shutting down the ship's engines, Geiger calls the bridge to tell the first officer, Juliano, that the captain is dead and he is in charge. Juliano is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship. Geiger steals jewelry from the ship's vault. As passengers evacuate, Drew, a young deaf girl, becomes trapped in an elevator, {{and a group of}} people become trapped behind locked fire doors in a hallway filling with smoke. As Annie and Alex attempt to board the last lifeboat, Geiger programs the ship to continue sailing. The winch lowering the lifeboat jams. Alex jumps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> to rescue the passengers who are falling off, and Annie and Juliano use the ship's gangplank to get them back on deck.|$|E
5|$|Bligh {{hoped to}} find water and food on Tofua, then proceed to the nearby island of Tongatapu to seek help from King Poulaho (whom he knew from his visit with Cook) in {{provisioning}} the boat for a voyage to the Dutch East Indies. Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's stern rope and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded {{the last of his}} shore party and their supplies <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> In an attempt to free the rope from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death.|$|E
5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E
60|$|They tumbled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>the</b> girls leading Ruth, {{who still}} had her eyes bandaged.|$|R
2500|$|Gracie was so {{preoccupied with}} the Titanics sinking and work he had done on the subject that his last words were, [...] "We must get them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b> We must get them all <b>into</b> <b>the</b> boats." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{burst of}} {{laughter}} at this unconscious continuation of the joke, and the men sprang up the ladder,--down <b>the</b> side, and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> which were soon racing towards the rock.|$|R
5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E
25|$|And {{when they}} were gone up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> the wind ceased.|$|E
25|$|The team {{to capture}} Springer {{was led by}} Jeff Foster, who had helped prepare Keiko for release. On June 13, Foster's team placed a rope around her tail, moved her into a sling and hoisted her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|E
60|$|De Vignes {{concentrated}} {{his fire}} against {{one point in}} the Kent, and presently succeeded in setting her on fire. The conflagration spread, a panic ensued, and some seventy or eighty men jumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> alongside.|$|R
25|$|All {{efforts to}} free Skylark failed {{and in the}} morning shore {{batteries}} started firing on her as French troops started to gather. Boxer ordered all his men <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> and set fire to Skylark as he left.|$|R
50|$|A {{final note}} records {{the fate of}} his ship, the Alert. In 1862 during the Civil War, it was {{captured}} by the Confederate commerce raider Alabama, the crew were forced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> and <b>the</b> ship was destroyed.|$|R
25|$|The Carters also reached {{lifeboat}} number 4. William Carter {{helped his}} wife Lucile and daughter, {{also by the}} name of Lucile, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> but his son Billy had to leave his tan-and-black Airedale dog before he was allowed in the boat.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, May 13, 1876, Dayton was moored at Oregon City, {{when another}} sternwheeler, the Occident, {{owned by the}} Willamette River Transportation and Locks Company came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> basin at full steam to unload a cargo of wheat for the Oregon City Mills.|$|E
25|$|The Daysailer {{interior}} liner is a {{one piece}} moulding. It is not integral with the deck. No self-bailing {{is provided in}} this model. It is recommended that a boom-tent be used {{to reduce the amount}} of rain water getting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> A bilge pump would also be a useful extra.|$|E
50|$|All {{efforts to}} free Skylark failed {{and in the}} morning shore {{batteries}} started firing on her as French troops started to gather. Boxer ordered all his men <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> and set fire to Skylark as he left.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ahoy! Peterson, Armitage, Wilson!" [...] he screamed. [...] "Cutlasses and pistols! Clear {{away the}} long-boat! Clear away the gig! Sharkey, the pirate, is in yonder dinghy. Whistle up the {{larboard}} watch, bo'sun, and tumble <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> all hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That {{broadside}} settled it; {{seven or}} eight of their big canoes were smashed up; several of the others turned and paddled to the shore; and a moment later, {{the men who were}} attacking us leapt <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> alongside and followed their example.|$|R
25|$|The {{daughter}} of the King of Sidon gives a ring to Sir Eglamour that gives its wearer invulnerability to death. Sir Eglamour gives this ring, in turn, to Christabel before departing to undertake his third trial, and she is presumably wearing this magic ring when she is put <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and sent to what {{is expected to be}} her death.|$|E
25|$|Two {{men were}} sent {{to the top of the}} highest trees from which they {{discovered}} one of the smaller of the French ships, that of Captain Maillard, which presently sent a boat to their rescue. The boat next went to the relief of Laudonnière, who was so sick and weak that he had to be carried to it. Before returning to the ship, the remainder of the company were gathered up, the men, exhausted with hunger, anxiety, and fatigue, having to be assisted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> by the sailors.|$|E
25|$|While chasing Napoleon, di Borgo {{stretches}} a rope {{across a}} road that Napoleon is likely to take. As expected, Napoleon rides toward the rope, but he draws his saber and cuts it down. Napoleon continues at high speed to the shore where he finds a small boat. He abandons the horse and gets <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> discovering {{that it has no}} oars or sail. He unfurls the French flag from Ajaccio and uses it as a sail. He is drawn out into the open sea.|$|E
60|$|The lines, of which, {{hardly an}} instant before, not one hand's breadth {{could have been}} gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all {{dripping}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> and soon <b>the</b> whale broke water within two ship's length of the hunters.|$|R
60|$|The {{prisoners were}} ordered to descend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> which lay alongside, some sailors taking their places with them. Ruggiero was not at first to be seen, but just as Francis was {{preparing}} {{to take his place}} in <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> he came out from the cabin. One of his arms was in a sling, and his head bandaged.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{moment the}} volley was fired two boats shot out, one from each side. 'Now, give it 'em,' says I. Up we jumped, four on each side, and poured our fire <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> which warn't twelve feet away. The darkies who war rowing {{had been told}} what to do, and, to do 'em justice, they did it well. Thar was a yell from <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> as we fired, for I reckon every shot told; but {{the way they had}} got brought 'em on, and their bows struck us just at the same moment. Then at it we went with our pistols as they crowded forward and tried to get on board. It was over in half a minute, for the four blacks had seized their poles, and, shoving them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> two on each side, pushed 'em off.|$|R
25|$|Wilson survived {{as leader}} of the Labour party in opposition. In the summer of 1973, holidaying on the Isles of Scilly, he tried to board a motor boat from a dinghy and stepped into the sea. He was unable to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> and was left in the cold water, hanging on to the fenders of the motor boat. He was close to death before he was saved by passers by. The {{incident}} was taken up by the press and resulted in some embarrassment for Wilson; his press secretary, Joe Haines, tried to deflect some of the comment by blaming Wilson's dog for the problem.|$|E
25|$|A pirogue is a small, {{flat-bottomed}} boat of {{a design}} associated particularly with West African fishermen and the Cajuns of the Louisiana marsh. These are usually dugouts, and are light and {{small enough to}} be easily taken onto land. The design allows the pirogue {{to move through the}} very shallow water of marshes and be easily turned over to drain any water that may get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> The pirogue is usually propelled by paddles with one blade. It can also be punted with a push pole in shallow water. Small sails can also be used. Outboard motors are increasingly being used in many regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} {{calibrated}} {{by measuring the}} height of the gunwales above water level at each corner with the boat unladen and then measured again when known weights had been loaded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> from an overhead gantry. These measurements were logged in toll-keeper's tables and copies sent to every toll office within the boat's trading range. At toll offices if a toll collector suspected an incorrect waybill (declared cargo) {{the height of the}} four corners of the boat were checked with a gauging stick and averaged to allow for uneven cargo loading. That boat's entry in the gauging table was used to determine the cargo weight. The toll fee was worked out from the weight and cargo type.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Tom, I {{remember}} when I climbed {{up to look}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> yesterday {{that there were some}} little casks lashed under the seats, and a sailor told me they were always kept full of water in case <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> were wanted suddenly. If they are still there we might empty them out, and they could keep us afloat any time." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1622 Sir Richard Whitbourne told of how {{the birds}} were driven up <b>the</b> gang planks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b> He remarked that it was [...] "as if God had made the innocency of so poore a {{creature}} to become such an admirable instrument for the sustenation of man." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were three}} other <b>boats</b> and <b>the</b> {{remaining}} sailors, {{along with the}} first mate and Dan Baxter, wanted to crowd into these. But Captain Blossom said he would shoot the first man who tried to row away without his orders. Then some provisions were put <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> and <b>the</b> captain divided the whole company among <b>the</b> three <b>boats.</b>|$|R
25|$|Lightoller and Wilde lowered Boat 12 at 1:30a.m. {{with about}} 30 people aboard. It was first manned only by Able-Bodied Seaman Frederick Clench and was {{subsequently}} {{put in the}} charge of Able Seaman John Poigndestre. A male passenger jumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> as it was lowered past B Deck. Difficulty was encountered in unhooking the boat from the falls, requiring Poigndestre to use a knife {{to cut through the}} ropes. Several passengers from other boats were transferred into Boat 12 after the sinking and it was heavily overloaded by the time it reached Carpathia with at least 69 people aboard. It was the last lifeboat to be picked up by Carpathia, at about 8:15a.m.|$|E
25|$|In the end, about 25 {{people were}} on board when {{it left the}} deck {{under the command of}} Quartermaster Arthur Bright. Two first class passengers, Hugh Woolner and Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson, jumped from A-Deck (which had started to flood) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> as it was being lowered, with Björnström-Stefansson landing upside down in the boat's bow and Woolner landing half-out, before being pulled aboard by the occupants. Another first class passenger, Frederick Maxfield Hoyt, who had {{previously}} put his wife in the boat, jumped in the water immediately after, and was hauled aboard by Woolner and Björnström-Steffansson. The number of people on board later increased when about 10–12 survivors were transferred to collapsible D from another boat. Carpathia picked up those aboard collapsible D at 7:15a.m.|$|E
25|$|After 1891, {{the canal}} principally transported coal, and {{sometimes}} West Virginia limestone, wood, lumber, sand, and flour. (Statistics were only kept for coal.) Coal was loaded in the Cumberland basin, {{which consisted of}} dumping four carloads of coal <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> Some of the coal had to be shoveled by hand into the spaces beneath the cabins. During the loading process, nobody {{would be on the}} boat due to the dust, and mules were kept off, in case the boat sank from being loaded. Despite closing windows, dust usually entered the cabins. After loading, the ridge poles would be put, then the hatches over the ridge poles and openings. The crew would scrub down the boat (using water from the canal) to remove the dust, and the boat would be poled {{to the other side of}} the basin, where it would be hitched to the mules.|$|E
50|$|The Kriegsmarine first {{viewed the}} snorkel {{as a means}} to take fresh air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> but saw no need to run the diesel engines under water. However, by 1943 more U-boats were being lost, so the snorkel was {{retrofitted}} to the VIIC and IXC classes and designed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new XXI and XXIII types.|$|R
60|$|As the {{fishermen}} said, {{there were several}} <b>boats</b> lying near <b>the</b> vessel, and the men were leaning over the sides bargaining for fish. Handing {{the fishermen}} their promised reward, Francis sprang up the ladder to the deck. He was unnoticed, for other men had gone down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> for fish.|$|R
50|$|In August 1997, Belle of Louisville was {{partially}} sunk at her moorings; a former crew member of <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was later convicted of sabotage. The proximate {{cause of the}} sinking was flooding of the hull via a city water line left connected to a fitting that led <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat's</b> hull. Due to the swift actions of the steamer's crew {{and other members of}} <b>the</b> community, <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was rescued, repaired, and returned to service.|$|R
