40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{describes}} an experimental and theoretical inves-tigation of extinction limit of diesel pool fires suppressed by water mist. A downward-directed nozzle produced a fine water spray over small-scale opposed diesel pool <b>fires.</b> The <b>fire</b> <b>extinction</b> limit is obtained from minimum nozzle injection pressure or maximum fire size {{when the fire}} extinguishment took place. For the conditions tested, {{it is observed that}} there are two distinct regions in the relationship between the injection pressure and fire size, i. e., a fire suppression region and a fire intensification region. The transition of the two regions is dependent on the effective water flux and the plume-spray thrust ratio. It is also revealed that the fuel surface cooling is the dominant mechanism for diesel pool <b>fires</b> at <b>extinction</b> limit in the tests. The failure to cause <b>fire</b> <b>extinction</b> is mainly due to the insufficient water flux applied to remove enough heat from the fuel surface...|$|R

This work focuses on the statistics of fires and direct damages in the agriculture area in years from 1997 to 2008. Those statistics were made according to controls carried out by Czech fire-brigade and also newly appeared illness called bird flu. There were four cases of bird flu confirmed in the Pardubice area of the republic. All {{of them had to}} be quickly dissolved. There is also mentioned special equipment called ANPL 100, which was developed so as to provide <b>fire</b> <b>extinction</b> of hay towers in Český Krumlov.

30|$|Many {{countries}} have implemented <b>fire</b> <b>extinction</b> policies for long periods, {{but in many}} cases, this led to larger fuel accumulation and catastrophic fires once they did occur (Pausas and Keeley 2009).

Experiments with prescribed fires have been carried out in grassland areas of the Chaco forests (Kunst and Bravo 2003), but little is known about fire behavior in semiarid Chaco mountains, where topography might play a key role. Controlled livestock grazing could be a reasonable choice (Davison 1996).

The GABAergic (GABA) neurons are reciprocally connected with nearby dopaminergic neurons, which project mainly to the basal ganglia, a set of subcortical nuclei critical for goal-directed behaviors. Here we examined the impact of motivational states on the activity of GABA neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the neighboring dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the pars compacta.

Assuming that aerial fire-fighting activities are successfully conducted in part of the fire area, it is found that the shear wind caused by the fire may disappear and then fire whirls will terminate naturally. At the same time, the effect of partial <b>fire</b> <b>extinction</b> on the strength of fire whirl is discussed in detail.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{characteristics of}} both pure propane hydrates and the mixtures of hydrates and quartz sands were investigated by combustion experiments. The flame propagation, flame appearance, burning {{time and temperature}} in different hydrate layers were studied. For pure propane hydrate combustion, the initial flame falls in the "premixed" category. The flame propagates very rapidly, mainly {{as a result of}} burnt gas expansion. The flame finally self-extinguishes with some proportion of hydrates remaining unburned. For the hydrate-sand mixture combustion, the flame takes the form of many tiny discontinuous flames appearing and disappearing at different locations. The burn lasts for a much shorter amount of time than pure hydrate combustion. High porosity and high hydrate saturation is beneficial to the combustion. The hydrate combustion is the combustion of propane gas resulting from the dissociation of the hydrates. In both combustion test scenarios, the hydrate-dissociated water {{plays a key role in}} the <b>fire</b> <b>extinction,</b> because it is the main resistance that restrains the heat transfer from the flame to the hydrates and that prevents the hydrate-dissociated gas from releasing into the combustion zone...|$|R

The compartment was 1 m (W) × 1 m (L) × 0. 75 m (H) and the area of the ceiling vent varied in six dimensions. Fire source was n-heptane pool with three different diameters, 0. 1 m, 0. 141 m and 0. 2 m, respectively. The fuel mass loss rate, gas temperature profile and oxygen concentration in the compartment were measured and flame behaviors were recorded by a video camera. The results showed that flame extinctions were due to two factors, oxygen concentration and fuel quantity. The ceiling vent only had a small impact on the mass loss rate and gas temperature profile when the <b>fire</b> <b>extinction</b> was due to low oxygen concentration. Additionally, mass loss rates showed same values when compared to free mass loss rate for small fires, even the fire was self-extinction.
