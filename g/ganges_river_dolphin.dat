40|$|Detection {{of animals}} during visual surveys is rarely perfect or constant, {{and failure to}} account for {{imperfect}} detectability affects the accuracy of abundance estimates. Freshwater cetaceans {{are among the most}} threatened group of mammals, and visual surveys are a commonly employed method for estimating population size despite concerns over imperfect and unquantified detectability. We used a combined visual-acoustic survey to estimate detectability of <b>Ganges</b> <b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Platanista gangetica gangetica) in four waterways of southern Bangladesh. The combined visual-acoustic survey resulted in consistently higher detectability than a single observer-team visual survey, thereby improving power to detect trends. Visual detectability was particularly low for dolphins close to meanders where these habitat features temporarily block the view of the preceding river surface. This systematic bias in detectability during visual-only surveys may lead researchers to underestimate the importance of heavily meandering river reaches. Although the benefits of acoustic surveys are increasingly recognised for marine cetaceans, they have not been widely used for monitoring abundance of freshwater cetaceans due to perceived costs and technical skill requirements. We show that acoustic surveys are in fact a relatively cost-effective approach for surveying freshwater cetaceans, once it is acknowledged that methods that do not account fo...|$|R
5|$|Four {{families}} of <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae and Platanistidae) are currently recognized, comprising three superfamilies (Inioidea, Lipotoidea and Platanistoidea). Platanistidae, containing the two subspecies of South Asian <b>river</b> <b>dolphin,</b> {{is the only}} accepted family of Platanistoidea. Previously, many taxonomists had assigned all <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> to a single family, Platanistidae, and treated the <b>Ganges</b> and Indus <b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> as separate species. A December 2006 survey found no members of Lipotes vexillifer (commonly known as the baiji, or Chinese <b>river</b> <b>dolphin)</b> and declared the species functionally extinct.

40|$|Riverine {{species are}} adapted to natural habitat changes caused by {{seasonal}} flood-pulses. However, abrupt river channel changes following flooding events intersect with social systems {{of land and}} water management (e. g. agriculture,fisheries) and in turn generate significant consequences for conservation of endangered aquatic species. We investigated trade offs between changing river habitat availability and exposure to fishing intensity for a small population of <b>Ganges</b> <b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> Platanista gangetica gangetica in the Karnali basin of Nepal. A major natural flooding event in the Karnali basin in 2010 caused the river channel to shift from the Geruwa (flows through a protected area where fishing is restricted) to the Karnali channel (high fishing activity, agriculture-dominated), where dolphins moved in response. Based on our survey data (2009 â€“ 2015) and long-term hydrological trends in the basin, we found that irrigation diversions since 2012 had aggravated fishing impacts on dolphins, suggesting that their new habitat had become an â€˜ecological trapâ€™. Regression models showed that at low river depths, fishing intensity negatively affected dolphin abundance, but at higher depths no effect of fishing was observed. Two records of dolphin by catch in gill nets confirmed this, as both events corresponded with periods of sudden increase in water abstraction for irrigation. Overall, dolphin distribution shifted downstream and the population declined from 11 in 2012 to 6 in 2015. Effective protection of this <b>river</b> <b>dolphin</b> population from extinction will require the Government of Nepal to prioritize ecologically adequate river flow regimes for implementing efficient irrigation schemes and adaptive fisheries regulations in the Karnali basi...|$|R

40|$|Freshwater {{biodiversity}} {{conservation is}} generally perceived to conflict with human use and extraction (e. g., fisheries). Overexploited fisheries upset {{the balance between}} local economic needs and endangered species' conservation. We investigated resource competition between fisheries and <b>Ganges</b> <b>river</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Platanista gangetica gangetica) in a human-dominated river system in India to assess the potential for their coexistence. We surveyed a 65 -km stretch of the lower Ganga River to assess habitat use by dolphins (encounter rates) and fishing activity (habitat preferences of fishers, intensity of net and boat use). Dolphin abundance in the main channel increased from 179 (SE 7) (mid dry season) to 270 (SE 8) (peak dry season), probably {{as a result of}} immigration from upstream tributaries. <b>Dolphins</b> preferred <b>river</b> channels with muddy, rocky substrates, and deep midchannel waters. These areas overlapped considerably with fishing areas. Sites with 2 â€“ 6 boats/km (moderately fished) were more preferred by dolphins than sites with 8 â€“ 55 boats/km (heavily fished). Estimated spatial (85 %) and preyâ€“resource overlap (75 %) between fisheries and dolphins (chiefly predators of small fish) suggests a high level of competition between the two groups. A decrease in abundance of larger fish, indicated by the fact that small fish comprised 74 % of the total caught, may have intensified the present competition. Dolphins seem resilient to changes in fish community structure and may persist in overfished rivers. Regulated fishing in dolphin hotspots and maintenance of adequate dry season flows can sustain dolphins in tributaries and reduce competition in the main river. Fish-stock restoration and management, effective monitoring, curbing destructive fishing practices, secure tenure rights, and provision of alternative livelihoods for fishers may help reconcile conservation and local needs in overexploited river systems...|$|R
40|$|Freshwater {{cetaceans}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} threatened groups of mammals on earth. Limited resources for monitoring and low power to detect trends hinder the development of effective conservation. Using the southern Bangladesh subpopulation of <b>Ganges</b> <b>River</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Platanista gangetica gangetica), previously thought to be a closed population, I investigate cost-effective boat-based methods for monitoring and estimating population size, and the value of local informant data for contributing to knowledge on the status of this poorly-known subpopulation. Detectability must be accounted for during surveys to make inferences on speciesâ€™ trends. However, many surveys use methods that do not account for detectability, assuming such approaches to be cheaper. I demonstrate that a combined visual-acoustic survey is a robust and cost-effective approach for monitoring. Using data from multiple seasons and marine surveys, I show the population may not be closed. I develop correction factors to account for imperfect detectability during past visual-only surveys and use these to show there is no detectable long-term (1999 - 2012) change in the abundance of this subpopulation. Local informant data are sometimes considered to have the potential to provide information of value to monitoring population trends. A comparison of the long-term and seasonal trends from boat-based surveys and those reported by fishers showed poor agreement. Memory-related biases are likely to have impacted informant recall. However, local informant data proved useful in identifying causal mechanisms underlying dolphin susceptibility to bycatch in gillnets, in particular river depth and net mesh size. Furthermore, local informant data provided a minimum estimate of annual mortality that is deemed unsustainable, but is based on a number of assumptions and potential biases that are discussed. Combined visual-acoustic surveys and local informant data represent cost-effective tools for addressing some of the significant knowledge gaps on freshwater cetacean status, aiding the development of evidence-based conservation strategies...|$|R
