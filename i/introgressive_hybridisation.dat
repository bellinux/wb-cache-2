40|$|To {{estimate}} the <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> propensity (IHP) between transgenic oilseed rape and certain of its cross-compatible wild/weedy relatives at the landscape level, a conceptual approach was developed. A questionnaire was established enclosing the successive steps to successfully achieve <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation.</b> Each step was described and scored, {{resulting in an}} IHP value for each cross-compatible wild/weedy relative. This approach revealed that in Flanders (Belgium) Brassica rapa has the highest IHP value, followed by Hirschfeldia incana, Diplotaxis tenuifolia, Raphanus raphanistrum and Sinapis arvensis. Using these values, monitoring priorities can be defined within the pool of cross-compatible wild/weedy oilseed rape relatives. It is discussed how the numerical quantification {{may serve as a}} valuable tool in case-specific monitoring and general surveillance of transgenic oilseed rape...|$|E
40|$|The nominal {{subspecies}} of {{rock partridge}} (Alectoris graeca graeca) is widely distributed in Greece, where populations are declining due to over-hunting and habitat changes. Captive-reared chukars (A. chukar) have been massively released throughout the country, raising fear that <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> might have disrupted local adaptations leading to further population declines. In {{this study we}} used mtDNA control-region sequences and Bayesian admixture analyses of multilocus genotypes determined at eight microsatellite loci, to assess the extent of <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> in 319 wild rock partridges collected in Greece. A neighbour-joining tree split the mtDNA haplotypes into three strongly supported clades, corresponding to rock, red-legged (A. rufa) and chukar partridges. We did not detect any case of maternal introgression. In contrast, admixture analyses of microsatellite genotypes identified from four to 28 putative hybrids (according to different assignment criteria), corresponding to 1. 2 - 8. 8 % of the samples, which were widespread throughout all the country. Power and limits of admixture analyses were assessed using simulated hybrid genotypes, which revealed that {{a small number of}} markers can detect all first and second generation hybrids (F- 1 and F- 2), and up to 90 % of the first generation backrossess. Thus, the true proportion of recently introgressed rock partridges in Greece might be ca. 20 %. These findings indicate that <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> is widespread, suggesting that released captive-bred partridges have reproduced and hybridised in nature polluting the gene pool of wild rock partridge populations in Greece...|$|E
40|$|Wild potato {{relatives}} are rich sources of desirable traits for <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> into cultivated potato. One of them, Solanum commersonii (2 n = 2 x = 24, 1 EBN, endosperm balance number), {{is an important}} species belonging to the potato tertiary genepool. It {{can be used in}} potato breeding through bridge crosses and 2 n gamete production. Triploid F 1 hybrids between S. commersonii (through spontaneous 2 n egg formation) and diploid 2 EBN Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja were crossed with S. tuberosum Group Tuberosum, resulting in successive backcross 1, 2 and 3 progenies. The main aim {{of this study was to}} determine if there are any barriers to homoeologous pairing and recombination in the allotriploid (S. commersonii × potato) hybrids and their backcrosses, and so to predict if S. commersonii chromosomes can be transmitted to the next generation and introgressed into their recipient potato chromosomes. Microscopic observations of spread pollen mother cells suggested no preferential pairing in the triploid hybrids, while chromosome transmission and segregation in further meiotic stages were fairly balanced. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation with BAC probes (BAC FISH) was used to obtain markers to trace the meiotic behaviour of specific chromosome pairs. Moreover, genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) demonstrated no obvious differences in fluorescence signals between the homoeologues suggesting that repetitive sequences did not diverge much between the parental species. As a consequence, we were not able to trace the course of the S. commersonii chromosomes in the successive <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> backcross generations. Our results strongly point at a high genomic similarity between the homoeologous chromosomes promising high suitability of S. commersonii in <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> breeding of potato. </p...|$|E
40|$|Most {{population}} genetics studies of rock-wallabies conducted {{to date have}} examined remnant colonies of threatened species inhabiting southern Australia. In this study we examined the natural pattern of contemporary and long-term gene flow among colonies of the widespread and abundant short-eared rock-wallaby, Petrogale brachyotis, in the relatively unmodified landscapes of Australia's tropical north. We sampled 105 wallabies from seven colonies 1. 2 km to 250 km apart. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequence analysis was conducted on samples from all colonies and microsatellite analysis (10 loci) on samples from the three largest colonies. The microsatellite data revealed no evidence of inbreeding within colonies, but higher levels of genetic diversity {{were found in the}} Kakadu National Park population compared with the smaller, more isolated colonies at Litchfield National Park. Both the mtDNA and microsatellite results showed that populations of P. brachyotis are naturally highly structured even within this relatively intact landscape, with only limited contemporary and long-term gene flow between colonies more than 1. 2 km apart. Nine mtDNA control region haplotypes were identified within the seven colonies. There were unusually high levels of sequence divergence (up to 6. 9 %) within colonies at Litchfield NP. This divergence suggests that multiple taxa may exist within what is currently recognised as P. brachyotis. Alternatively, if current taxonomy is correct, the high levels of divergence raise the possibility of ancestral isolation and divergence of populations in allopatry with subsequent admixture at a secondary contact zone. The possibility that these unusually divergent haplotypes result from <b>introgressive</b> interspecific <b>hybridisation</b> with the sympatric P. concinna appears unlikely. 9 page(s...|$|R

These studies confirm uniqueness of the polar bear lineage, provide more time for speciation and adaptation, and have uncovered numerous candidate genes for evolutionary adaptations.

40|$|The {{decline of}} over-hunted red-legged (Alectoris rufa) and rock (A. graeca) {{partridge}} populations has been contrasted with massive releases of captive-reared birds, often hybrids with non-indigenous A. chukar. Released interspecific hybrids raise {{the risks of}} <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation,</b> and can contribute to further depress the fitness of native populations. Aiming to assess the extent of hybridisation, we genotyped the mtDNA control-region and eight nuclear microsatellites in 671 red-legged, rock and chukar partridges and hybrids, identified by phenotypic traits. Results reveal a diffuse occurrence of hybridisation: (1) 39 samples (6. 2 %) show mtDNA haplotypes discordant with their phenotypes, indicating red-legged and chukar mtDNA introgression in native rock partridges; (2) admixture analyses of the microsatellite genotypes identified 32 additional rock partridges (5. 1 %) hybridised mainly with chukars. We analysed also 39 samples collected from a presumed natural red-legged x rock partridge hybrid zone in the French Alps. Surprisingly, 28 % birds showed typical chukar mtDNAs, indicating hybridisation with introduced chukars or hybrids. This hybrid zone led to an introgression cline of chukar alleles into neighbouring Alpine rock partridges detectable up to 100 km, which was shorter than expected by neutral genetic theory, and that suggested natural selection against hybrids. These findings indicate that <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> may disrupt local adaptations in natural red-legged partridge and rock partridge populations, and call for strict control of farming and restocking operations.

40|$|The natural {{morphological}} {{variation in}} the wildcat, Felis silvestris, and morphological changes possibly caused by <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> with the domestic cat, F. catus, were examined, based on up to 39 variables concerning cranial morphology. The samples of wild-living cats originated from Scotland and southern Africa and consisted of both classical wildcat and other pelage types. Principal component and cluster analyses suggested that <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> occurred in both areas, with the consequence that the characteristics of local wildcat populations had been altered {{in terms of the}} frequencies of occurrence of certain characters, especially those concerning cranial capacity. In both regions the clustering patterns of wild-living cats can be interpreted as containing four main groups. One of these consisted mainly of 'non-wildcats' and groups furthest from the 'non-wild' cluster consisted of the highest proportion of 'wildcats' (c. 80 %). We propose that where a population is heavily introgressed, the only feasible way to define a wildcat is on the basis of inter-correlated features and conservationists must take a population-based approach to assess the extent of introgression. This approach may provide an operational standard for assessing the impact of hybridisation between wildcats and domestic cats throughout the species' range; it suggests that the Scottish wildcats may be critically endangered.

40|$|Two Tasmanian {{populations of}} E. perriniana were {{examined}} {{to determine the}} extent of morphological variation between two gene pools that have been isolated for perhaps thousands of years. Surprisingly few differences were noted despite small population sizes, high levels of disturbance and high levels of hybridisation with E. rodwayi. When compared to mainland E. perriniana, large genotypic differences were noted: e. g. mainland E. perriniana seeds required stratification whereas Tasmanian seeds did not. The growth rates, leaf shape and colour also differed markedly but reproductive characters did not. These differences are possibly the products of differing selective pressures associated with altitudinal differences rather than random genetic drift or <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation.</b> Developmental abnormalities were noted which seem to indicate that the distinctive connate form of the juvenile leaves is under relatively simple control mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Genus Sorbus is a {{very complex}} group of {{vascular}} plants. Various genetic lineages which can be fixed by apomixis are driven by interspecific hybridisation and polyploidy. Species from S. aria agg. have the highest variation probably due to an extra mechanism - <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation.</b> There are several concepts of the aggregate which are usually based on three main species: S. aria, S. umbellatta and S. graeca. Therefore, new microspecies are derived by genome doubling and hybridisation between the main species. Units of the aggregate are assessed differently as the distinction of taxa is very complicated due to the overlap of the morphological variability. The aggregate itself can be sometimes considered as a category for species of uncertain origin or identification. Four species from S. aria agg. occur in the Czech Republic.

40|$|Impacts of <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> may {{range from}} genomic erosion and species {{collapse}} to rapid adaptation and speciation but opportunities to study these dynamics are rare. We investigated the extent, causes {{and consequences of}} a hybrid zone between Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae in Guinea-Bissau, where high hybridisation rates appear to be stable {{at least since the}} 1990 s. Anopheles gambiae was genetically partitioned into inland and coastal subpopulations, separated by a central region dominated by A. coluzzii. Surprisingly, whole genome sequencing revealed that the coastal region harbours a hybrid form characterised by an A. gambiae-like sex chromosome and massive introgression of A. coluzzii autosomal alleles. Local selection on chromosomal inversions {{may play a role in}} this process, suggesting potential for spatiotemporal stability of the coastal hybrid form and providing resilience against introgression of medically-important loci and traits, found to be more prevalent in inland A. gambiae...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{documented}} that hybridisation occurs between many closely related species, but {{the importance of}} introgression in adaptive evolution remains unclear, especially in animals. Here, we have examined the role of <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> in transferring adaptations between mimetic Heliconius butterflies, {{taking advantage of the}} recent identification of a gene regulating red wing patterns in this genus. By sequencing regions both linked and unlinked to the red colour locus, we found a region that displays an almost perfect genotype by phenotype association across four species, H. melpomene, H. cydno, H. timareta, and H. heurippa. This particular segment is located 70 kb downstream of the red colour specification gene optix, and coalescent analysis indicates repeated introgression of adaptive alleles from H. melpomene into the H. cydno species clade. Our analytical methods complement recent genome scale data for the same region and suggest adaptive introgression has a crucial role in generating adaptive wing colour diversity in this group of butterflies.

40|$|Species {{introductions}} {{can provide}} unplanned and occasionally replicated experiments {{that can be}} studied to understand fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes associated with range expansions in the natural world. The cichlid species flock of Lake Malawi consists of an estimated 451 - 800 species and is a textbook example of explosive speciation that has been studied as a model system of evolution {{in the past three}} decades. In addition, fish are of major socio-economic importance to Malawian people, and they form an important source (circa 70 %) of animal protein in their diet. Furthermore, fisheries activity employs 3 % of the country's population and contributes to 4 % of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This thesis studies a well documented, human mediated introduction of a rocky-shore, plankton-feeding cichlid fish Cynotilapia afra into Lake Malawi National Park. This introduction has important evolutionary and ecological consequences on the native populations of Pseudotropheus zebra, and here I investigate its population genetic impacts using contemporary molecular genetic tools and analyses. Three hypotheses were tested: 1. Introduction events are usually associated with a small founder population size, and the resulting genetic bottleneck is expected to reduce genetic variation of C. afra in the introduced range. 2. The invasive scenario during the introduction followed a stepping stone pattern, or alternatively, it occurred as several independent introductions of C. afra in Lake Malawi National Park. 3. <b>Introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> between C. afra and P. zebra may have facilitated the introduction of the invading C. afra population and restored its depleted genetic variation associated with the founder event. Furthermore, the gene pool of C. afra has more non-native genetic material as compared to P. zebra. Samples were collected from six native and four introduced populations of C. afra, as well as three native populations of P. zebra. The latter species is from a different genus, although laboratory experiments indicate that both species hybridise in laboratory conditions. Sequence variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was analysed using 15 individuals per sample population and 60 individuals per sample population were genotyped at six microsatellite loci. These data were analysed to test the three hypotheses and identify potential source populations, infer introduction patterns (stepping stone or independent), and deduct whether <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> may have facilitated the founder event and subsequent establishment of C. afra in the invasive range in Lake Malawi Natural Park. The three data chapters in this thesis discuss the findings of the mtDNA sequence study (Chapter 2) and the microsatellite study (Chapter 3). In Chapter 4, I analyse the microsatellite data in further detail and consider the role of introgression by using Bayesian analysis tools. The mtDNA study presented in Chapter 2 reveals that C. afra and P. zebra mtDNA sequences show high levels of lineage sorting (i. e. the DNA sequences of both species are remarkably distinct). This finding is in sharp contrast to previous studies on Lake Malawi rock-dwelling cichlids which have shown that cichlid species share the same or very similar mtDNA haplotypes. Furthermore, the introduced populations showed a higher sequence and haplotype diversity than their native counterparts. This analysis suggests that elevated gene diversity was largely due to C. afra populations being founded by individuals from several genetically distinct and geographically separate populations. In Chapter 4, I discuss the role of <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> with native P. zebra, and its impact on mtDNA variation in the introduced C. afra gene pool. In Chapter 3, I show that in contrast to the signal obtained from the mtDNA, the genetic variation at the microsatellite loci exhibited a significant reduction in the introduced range. Introduced C. afra populations have a lower mean effective number of alleles (ne) than C. afra populations in their native range. I use an approximate Bayesian analysis and show compelling evidence that at least two independent introductions have contributed to the introduced C. afra gene pool, a conclusion that is supported by high probability values. This conclusion differs from that of previous studies which suggested a stepping stone introduction pattern around Thumbi West Island. Surprisingly, a population of C. afra at Domwe Island was founded by a source population from Thumbi West Island, and this stepping stone introduction pattern is supported with a high probability (95 %). Microsatellite analysis furthermore suggests that the founder event of C. afra in Lake Malawi National Park was associated with strong genetic drift associated with a genetic bottleneck. I was not able to detect this signal from the mtDNA genetic marker alone, which showed an increase in genetic variation at the mtDNA due to different source populations contributing to the founder event (see Chapter 2). These combined studies reported in Chapter 2 and 3 thus demonstrate that microsatellites may be well-suited to investigate questions related to conservation issues such as bottlenecks associated with founder events, while mtDNA is more suited to reveal the evolutionary processes and establish different source populations that have contributed to the introduction. In Chapter 4, I analyse the level of genetic differentiation at microsatellite loci, and show that the introduced C. afra and native P. zebra populations at Thumbi West Island are genetically more similar (G'ST= 0. 36 +/- 0. 05) than the species-pair at Otter point (G'ST= 0. 94 +/- 0. 18) and Domwe Island (G'ST= 0. 55 +/- 0. 09). In addition, C. afra and P. zebra at Thumbi West Island showed a lower genetic distance than allopatric C. afra or P. zebra populations from Otter point and Domwe Island. Further analysis using a Bayesian assignment approach supports previous findings and demonstrates the likelihood of <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> between an introduced C. afra and a native P. zebra population at Thumbi West Island. No evidence of introgression is found at Otter point and Domwe Island, where the C. afra and P. zebra populations show distinct genetic structure. The occurrence of <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> at Thumbi West between species from distinct genera shows that translocations can have a dramatic impact even on the gene pools of heterospecific recipient populations. The results from this work have crucial implications in evolution of cichlid fishes and in invasion biology when predicting the evolution of invasiveness. In summary, the thesis shows that hybridisation, as well as the introduction of multiple genetically differentiated source populations has increased the genetic diversity of introduced C. afra populations, and this may have facilitated their establishment in Lake Malawi National Park. Translocation of cichlid species in Lake Malawi can have a dramatic impact even on heterospecific gene pools. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

This study uses RAPD data, as a total DNA marker, and morphometrics, as potentially revealing hybridisation and introgression, to throw further light on the origin of the above mentioned contact zone. Individuals of the two taxa sampled from the range do not show a F 1 hybrid profile for RAPD or for morphometrics. To integrate this results with the previously published sequence data (ITS and chloroplast spacer trnL-F) it is proposed that <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> has occurred in A. villosa subsp. bernisii, while for A. filicaulis the contact zone occurs at the intraspecific level.

This wild gene pool is potentially threatened by forest fragmentation and degradation, and by <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> with locally improved coffee varieties. We genotyped 703 coffee shrubs from unmanaged and managed coffee populations, using 24 microsatellite loci. Additionally, we genotyped 90 individuals representing 23 Ethiopian cultivars resistant to Coffee Berry Disease (CBD). We determined population genetic diversity, genetic structure, and admixture of cultivar alleles in the in situ gene pool. We found strong genetic differentiation between managed and unmanaged coffee populations, but without significant differences in within-population genetic diversity. The widespread planting of coffee seedlings including CBD-resistant cultivars most likely offsets losses of genetic variation attributable to genetic drift and inbreeding. Mixing cultivars with original coffee genotypes, however, leaves ample opportunity for hybridisation and replacement of the original coffee gene pool, which already shows signs of admixture. In situ conservation of the wild gene pool of C. arabica must therefore focus on limiting coffee production in the remaining wild populations, as intensification threatens the genetic integrity of the gene pool by exposing wild genotypes to cultivars. status: publishe...|$|E

We investigated Stylophora species boundaries from the Red Sea and the associated Symbiodinium by sequencing seven DNA loci.

Low genetic differentiation, weak isolation, and strong gene flow were found among morphospecies although no signals of genetic recombination were evident among them. Stylophora mamillata harboured Symbiodinium clade C whereas the other two Stylophora morphospecies hosted either Symbiodinium clade A or C. These evolutionary patterns suggest that either gene exchange occurs through reticulate evolution or that multiple ecomorphs of a phenotypically plastic species occur in the Red Sea. The recent origin of the lineage leading to the Red Sea Stylophora may indicate an ongoing speciation driven by environmental changes and incomplete lineage sorting...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> is an {{evolutionary}} catalyst producing novel variants able {{to explore new}} ecological niches and evolve as new hybrid taxa. However, the role of ‘hybrid swarms’ – highly variable populations produced following interspecific hybridisation – in generating this evolutionary novelty has been poorly studied. Aims: We examine the alternative origins of tetraploid hybrid derivatives of Senecio vulgaris and S. squalidus, via local polytopic formation or long-distance dispersal from a single perennial hybrid swarm around Cork, Ireland. Methods: Morphometric, isozyme and chloroplast DNA analysis. Results: The Cork hybrid swarm and UK hybrid swarms exhibited {{a broad range of}} morphological variation and contained individuals similar to the stable tetraploid hybrid derivatives; S. eboracensis and S. vulgaris var. hibernicus. Chloroplast DNA analysis shows that S. eboracensis did not evolve from the Cork hybrid swarm. However, UK S. vulgaris var. hibernicus populations exhibit a broad range of variation for both chloroplast and isozyme markers, but were not distinguishable from Cork material. Conclusions: Our study confirms that S. eboracensis did not evolve from the Cork hybrid swarm, and while our analyses could not demonstrate this conclusively for S. vulgaris var. hibernicus the ease with which hybrid swarms have been generated in the past makes a polytopic origin for S. vulgaris var. hibernicus the most likely scenario.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} phylogenies of {{the small}} but ecologically and horticulturally important Australian genus Correa (Rutaceae). Consensus phylogenies generated using parsimony were congruent with their counterparts generated by Bayesian analysis, although usually less well resolved. The phylogeny generated from the second internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA supported the monophyly of Correa and identified two well supported clades (one comprising C. lawrenceana and C. baeuerlenii and the other containing all other species of the genus). Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the combined trnL-trnF spacer and the trnK intron (including the matK gene) regions of chloroplast DNA also supported the monophyly of Correa and of the C. lawrenceana/ C. baeuerlenii clade, but the topology among the other species differed markedly from that in the ITS-based phylogeny. The major clades identified in the chloroplast phylogenies seemed to follow geographic patterns rather than species boundaries, with different samples of C. glabra bearing chloroplast genotypes from different clades. These patterns {{are likely to be}} because of independent evolution of the chloroplast and nuclear genomes, and are typical of cases of <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> among species or incomplete lineage sorting of chloroplast genomes leading to incongruence between chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies.

40|$|Inter-specific genetic {{relationships}} among regional populations of {{two species of}} grouper (Plectropomus maculatus and Plectropomus leopardus) were examined using mitochondrial and nuclear markers. mtDNA revealed contrasting regional inter-specific patterns whilst nuclear markers revealed contrasting patterns among markers, irrespective of region. In eastern Australia (EA) the species form a single mtDNA lineage, but the two species are reciprocally monophyletic in Western Australia (WA). This supports previous evidence for hybridisation between these species on the east coast. WA P. leopardus forms a sister relationship with the EA P. leopardus-maculatus clade while WA P. maculatus is more basal and sister to the P. leopardus lineages, indicating mtDNA does not suffer from incomplete lineage sorting for these species. In contrast, one of three nuclear markers (locus 7 - 90 TG) differentiated the species into two reciprocally monophyletic clades, with no evidence of hybridisation or ancestral polymorphism. The remaining two nuclear markers (2 - 22 and ETS- 2) did not separate these two species, while distinguishing other plectropomid species, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting at these nuclear loci. These results together with coalescence analyses suggest that P. leopardus females have hybridised historically with P. maculatus males and that P. maculatus mitochondria were displaced through <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> and fixation in the P. maculatus founder population on the Great Barrier Reef. The contrasting regional patterns of mtDNA structure {{may be attributed to}} Quaternary sea-level changes and shelf width differences driving different reef configurations on each coast.

The grey partridge (Perdix perdix) {{has been an}} important European game species for centuries, widely subject to translocation and stocking. After ca 80 years releasing reared grey partridges into Danish wild partridge areas, this study investigated whether an indigenous Danish grey partridge still existed. We predicted that (i) an indigenous Danish partridge would belong to the western European clade (W 1) and (ii) would be more closely related to the historical, indigenous grey partridges than to farm bred partridges. These predictions were tested analysing the variation in the mitochondrial control region (CR 1) and microsatellite markers in museum samples representing the ancestral indigenous Danish grey partridge, contemporary (recent) wild grey partridges and farmed grey partridges from the five largest farms in Denmark. Phylogeography- and population structure analyses showed traces of the indigenous Danish grey partridges amongst recent wild partridges in certain areas and significant genetic differences between reared, farmed partridges and historical- and recent partridges. The results also showed that the indigenous Danish grey partridges belonged to the western European clade (W 1 haplotype). A foreign stocking effect was detected on the remote island of Bornholm, where the current population originated from introduced Danish and Bohemian grey partridges. The loss of haplotype diversity over time in certain geographical areas probably results from serious declines in wild Danish grey partridge numbers in recent decades. This combined with the 2 observation that hybridisation between released stocked and wild partridges can occur may complicate recovery of partridge populations...|$|E

The latter data set also suggests that M. assamica sensu lato is paraphyletic, since M. erythroptera, which is always treated as a separate species, is nested within the M. assamica complex. I propose that the polytypic species S. burkii comprises six sibling species. Some of these are found to breed sympatrically, although mainly or entirely segregated altitudinally. Mitochondrial DNA suggests that the S. burkii complex is non-monophyletic, and also that the divergence of the different taxa is much older than indicated by morphological and vocal data. According to the molecular phylogeny, both the genera Seicercus and its assumed sister genus Phylloscopus are paraphyletic. That is corroborated by independent data. The phylogenetic study of the genus Motacilla reveals incongruence between mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA and non-molecular data. I conclude that the nuclear gene tree reflects the organismal phylogeny more faithfully than the mitochondrial gene tree. The latter is likely to have been affected by <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation,</b> possibly also stochastic lineage sorting. The most remarkable result that is strongly supported by both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA is that M. flava is non-monophyletic...|$|E
40|$|The genus Phebalium Vent. (Rutaceae, tribe Boronieae) {{includes}} some 45 species of shrubs and undershrubs, {{distributed in the}} southwest and southeast regions of Australia and in the northern island of New Zealand ([Bentham and Mueller, 1863] and [Engler, 1896]). A consistent feature of all investigated species {{is the presence of}} coumarins ([Quader et al., 1992] and [Ghisalberti, 1997]). In a major taxonomic revision, the genus was divided into four sections, Phebalium, Eristemoides, Gonioclados, and Leionema (Wilson, 1970). The species Phebalium brachycalyx P. G. Wilson is included in the section Phebalium, which comprises 19 species characterized by stem, leaves, and outside petals lepidote, and by an inflorescence in terminal umbel. Several taxa of this section previously led to the isolation of 7 -geranyloxycoumarins, 8 -prenylated coumarins, and linear furocoumarins ([Rashid et al., 1992] and [Quader et al., 1992]). It was recognised (Wilson, 1970) that a number of the West Australian species of Phebalium sect. Phebalium hybridised and intergraded into one another and in that context P. brachycalyx underwent <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> with both P. filifolium and P. tuberculosum. More recently, Wilson (1998) has indicated that it may not be possible to maintain those taxa separated within this group. Accordingly, we refer to the collection here as P. aff. brachycalyx as it exhibits many of the characteristics ascribed to that taxon but clearly falls within the boundaries of the “super-species”. In a continuation of our studies on Australian Rutaceous plants (Girard et al., 2002), we report here the isolation and structure determination of two new heraclenol derivatives from P. aff. brachycalyx leaves and twigs, together with the identification of 22 other coumarins...|$|E

A total of 464 B. rapa plants belonging to 14 populations growing either in close proximity to B. napus (i. e. sympatric 1 km) were assessed for chloroplast capture using PCR (trnL-F) and CAPS (trnT-L-Xba I) markers.

40|$|The Jaera albifrons species {{group of}} {{intertidal}} isopods is characterised by strong sexual isolation mediated by female discrimination against heterospecific male tactile-stimulatory courtship behaviour.   This {{is the first}} study to examine the genetic basis of traits involved in tactile mediated sexual isolation.   To determine the genetic architecture of male secondary sexual characters (species-specific hair traits carried on the legs of males and a carpus leg-segment shape difference) associated with sexual isolation, experimental hybrid populations of J. albifrons and J. ischiosetosa were used to construct AFLP-based genetic linkage maps.   A number of chromosomal differences (Robertsonian fusions) between the parental species were shown {{to be associated with}} reduced hybrid fertility.   A quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping study revealed that the number of hairs and carpus shape have a complex genetic basis, involving a number of QTL showing dominance, epistasis and possible pleiotropic effects.   These QTL mapped largely to putative regions of restricted recombination, especially chromosomal rearrangements. The qualitative difference, however, was shown to be controlled by a single (or several closely linked) QTL that did not map to a region of restricted recombination.   These findings suggest that <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> {{played an important role in}} speciation in the J. albifrons species group and that chromosomal rearrangements allowed incipient species to persist in the face of ongoing gene flow.   The extensive sharing of a single 16 S rDNA mitochondrial haplotype supports the assertion that gene flow has been important.   The reinforcement of premating isolating by natural selection against costly hybridisation is suggested as the mechanism of speciation between these species.   The complete dominance of the J. albifrons allele at the QTL controlling the qualitative difference between the species supports this model of speciation.

40|$|In {{forensic}} entomology, {{knowledge of}} insect taxonomy, development, behaviour and ecology {{is required to}} allow accurate data interpretation from entomological evidence in investigations. In this thesis, five forensic entomology related studies {{have been carried out}} and discussed in two Malaysian forensically important fly families, the Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae. These studies involve the taxonomy, species checklist, ecological distribution, dipteran succession pattern on pig carcasses in Sarawak and DNA-based species identification analysis. A detailed taxonomical study of Sarcophagidae encompasses the examination of external morphological characters, and their terminology was constructed. Several important taxonomical characters were identified and their usefulness in establishing taxonomical key was evaluated. Knowledge of basic anatomy is important when inferring relationships among the sarcophagid flies. The ecological distribution study of Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae explores whether certain species are more associated with particular ecological habitats (e. g. urban, forest, swamp, etc.). Environmental influences (e. g. habitats and elevations) are discussed with regard to the presence of fly species. Habitat-specific species were also proposed. Understanding the distribution and ecology of these fly species may facilitate criminal investigations, especially in determining the location of the first crime scene. Species checklists of Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae were also obtained. Rates and stages of decomposition of two scavenged and clothed pig carcasses were studied in a tropical rainforest in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia. Comparisons between these two carcasses revealed that the scavenged carcass decomposed faster than the clothed one. Some important fly species were proposed to serve as the time (e. g. decomposition stage) and location (e. g. habitat) indicators. Diptera species were significantly different between these two pig carcasses due to differences in physical condition of the carcasses. The efficacy of DNA-based identification of forensically important fly Calliphoridae species in Malaysia was evaluated using two genetics markers, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and II as well as 28 S ribosomal DNA. Evolution and speciation of Chrysomya defixa and Chrysomya pinguis, such as incomplete lineage sorting, <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation,</b> and ancestral polymorphism were also discussed. PCR-RFLP analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I was also employed to facilitate species identification of Chrysomya in Malaysia. Similar DNA-based study was conducted for Malaysian Sarcophagidae. However, only cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and II was included for the DNA barcoding analysis of 49 sarcophagid species. From the phylogeny, almost all species of Sarcophagidae were monophyletic except for Boettcherisca javanica, which provide strong evidence for proposal of new combination of genera, such as Rosellea notabilis, Pseudothyrsocnema borneensis, Bellieriomima globovesica and Bellieriomima uniseta...|$|E
40|$|The Mytilus edulis species complex, {{comprised}} of M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus, is antitropically distributed in temperate coastal regions of all oceans and main seas of the world. This genus has been heavily {{studied in the}} Northern hemisphere but Southern hemisphere populations have received much less attention. This thesis aims to place Southern hemisphere blue mussels into global evolutionary relationships among Mytilus species and investigate aspects of their molecular ecology, including, effects of non-native Northern hemisphere species introductions, biogeography across the Southern hemisphere, regional phylogeographic patterns and population genetics within New Zealand. Southern hemisphere blue mussel phylogenetic reconstruction resulted in the detection of a monophyletic M. galloprovincialis lineage. Two new molecular markers developed with specificity for this lineage and congruence among phylogenetic investigations indicates a panhemispheric distribution of this M. galloprovincialis lineage with implications for naming a new sibling species of the M. edulis complex. This proposed new species, M. meridianus, is distributed in South America, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand and Australia at latitudes between ~ 30 °S and ~ 55 °S. Non-native M. galloprovincialis introduced from the Northern hemisphere have been present in NZ, Australia and Chile for at least ten years and hybridise with native blue mussels. Introgression is observed in New Zealand and Australian but not Chilean hybrid regions. The limited number of introduced mussels in Australia induces hybrid swamping of non-native alleles but an interlineage gender bias towards non-native maternal parents may result in eventual loss of the unique genomic content of native blue mussels in NZ. Southern hemisphere blue mussels form a monophyletic sister clade to a haplogroup shared by Northern hemisphere M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis. Although single gene histories are not congruent with respect to evolutionary relationships within the Northern hemisphere due to <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> after speciation, {{it is clear that}} Southern hemisphere blue mussels arose from a species native to the northeast Atlantic Ocean after speciation of the three ‘M. edulis complex’ members. Within the Southern hemisphere monophyletic clade lies three reciprocally monophyletic clades restricted to the geographic regions South America/Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand and Australia. Phylogeographic analysis indicates past gene flow between South American/Kerguelen Islands and New Zealand populations that has ceased at present day and ongoing gene flow between South America and the Kerguelen Islands likely via the West Wind Drift. Within NZ, population subdivision inferred from mtDNA indicates genetic variation is distributed within an east-west phylogeographic split on the North Island. These populations experienced gene flow in the past that has ceased at present day. Microsatellite allele frequencies indicate a different population subdivision within the northwest North Island that has been narrowed down to a 15 km stretch of coastline in a sheltered bay. The abrupt discontinuity within a small geographic area does not conform to classic population subdivision in this broad-cast spawning species, therefore, further investigation into the genomic content of northwest North Island mussels with respect to introgressed non-native genes is warranted. Resolving complex phylogenetic patterns from interspecific introgression is key to understanding the evolutionary history of Southern hemisphere M. galloprovincialis. Further characterisation of hybrid introgression would increase accuracy of (1) inferences of processes contributing to hybridisation dynamics and (2) population subdivision in NZ. Probing the basis for variation of hybridisation dynamics would help to predict the outcomes of Northern hemisphere M. galloprovincialis introductions {{in other areas of the}} world...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} aridification of the Australian landmass {{over the}} past 25 Myr has long been hypothesised {{to be a major}} driver of speciation, diversification and extinction in the Australo-Papuan region. My dissertation uses the Australo-Papuan butcherbirds and magpies (Corvoidea: Artamidae: Cracticinae: Cracticus) to test the relative impact of palaeoenvironmental changes on the population history of closely related species with different habitat preferences. I particularly focus on the biogeographic and demographic consequences of major changes in climate and landscape during the Pliocene and Pleistocene (5. 3 Ma - 11, 700 ya) on the (1) widespread open-habitat generalist Pied Butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis), (2) rainforest and mangrove restricted Black Butcherbird (C. quoyi), and (3) the white-throated butcherbird species-group (subgenus Bulestes) that has three allopatric species distributed in monsoonal savanna (Black-backed Butcherbird, C. mentalis and Silver-backed Butcherbird, C. argenteus), and arid, semi-arid and temperate forests and woodlands (Grey Butcherbird, C. torquatus). Phylogeographic analyses indicate that palaeoenvironmental changes during the Plio-Pleistocene have had a profound, but variable, impact on the population history of these species. Range-wide phylogeographic structuring suggests that arid habitats associated with the 2 ̆ 7 Carpentarian Barrier 2 ̆ 7 region are unlikely to have represented a significant barrier to dispersal for the more arid-adapted C. nigrogularis and C. torquatus, whereas this region has likely caused long-term isolation of north-eastern and north-western Australian populations of the mesic-adapted C. quoyi, and between savanna-adapted C. argenteus and C. mentalis. This result accords with ecological niche model reconstructions of suitable Pleistocene habitats and multilocus coalescent divergence with gene flow analyses for the white-throated butcherbird species-group. Integration of palaeodistribution models and spatially explicit genealogical data support a scenario where a climate-induced range shift resulted in secondary contact between north-western Australian C. argenteus and southern Australian C. torquatus allowing <b>introgressive</b> <b>hybridisation</b> and mitochondrial (mtDNA) capture. Phylogeographic analyses also suggest that increased dune activity and aridity in central-western Australia during the Pleistocene caused range contractions and population differentiation in the more arid-adapted C. nigrogularis and C. torquatus. Multilocus phylogeographic structuring of Australian and New Guinean populations of the savanna-adapted C. mentalis and the mesic-adapted C. quoyi were consistent with the former species having dispersed more recently across the exposed Arafura Shelf that intermittently connected Australia and New Guinea during the Pleistocene than the latter. This result accords with palaeoenvironmental reconstructions that suggest these intermittent land connections were dominated by open grassland and woodlands habitats. In the final research chapter I investigate the impact of earlier phases of aridity and changes in landscape on the speciation history of the Australo-Papuan cracticids (Cracticinae: Cracticus, Strepera and Peltops) using multiple nuclear introns, mtDNA and multispecies coalescent models. This approach supports: (1) the recent taxonomic decision to place the morphologically divergent Australian Magpie (C. tibicen) in the butcherbird genus Cracticus rather than retaining it in the monotypic genus Gymnorhina, (2) the hypothesis that aridification {{over the past}} 25 Myr allowed the diversification of the open-woodland-adapted lineages such as Strepera and Cracticus, and (3) the hypothesis that rainforest-adapted lineages, such as the New Guinean endemic genus Peltops, persisted on the proto-New Guinean island archipelago prior to the recent formation of the New Guinean landmass 2 - 5 Myr. This thesis presents the first complete and well-supported species-level phylogeny of the Australo-Papuan cracticids, as well as the first molecular assessment of species boundaries and evolutionary history of butcherbird species in the genus Cracticus. Key taxonomic implications from my dissertation are that the (1) Australian and New Guinean lineages of C. quoyi should be raised to species-level, (2) recently diverged members of the white-throated butcherbird species-group warrant species-level recognition despite widespread sharing of nuclear alleles and mtDNA paraphyly, (3) morphologically differentiated Australian Magpie C. tibicen is a member of Cracticus, and (4) species-boundaries within Peltops warrant a comprehensive molecular and morphological revision...|$|E
