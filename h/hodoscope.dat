50|$|The TREAT <b>hodoscope</b> {{consists}} of a front collimator, a rear collimator, a bank of detectors, electronics to interface to the detectors, and a data acquisition system. The collimator has 10 columns with 36 rows, which are aligned to an array (or arrays) of 360 detectors. The <b>hodoscope</b> provides time and spatial resolution of fuel motion during transients and in-place measurement of fuel distribution before, during, and after an experiment. One array of detectors {{consists of}} Hornyak Button detectors. The Hornyak Button is a fast neutron detector that {{consists of a}} film of ZnS applied to lucite, which together form the 'button'.

The calorimeter is designed to measure incident particle energies, and the <b>hodoscopes</b> are designed to provide incident particle tracking information. The calorimeter and <b>hodoscopes</b> both use Hybrid Photo Diodes (HPDs) with high voltage settings at 6 kV for the calorimeter and 9 kV for the <b>hodoscopes.</b> We describe {{the performance of the}} calorimeter module during a 42 day flight at balloon altitude (2 - 6 mbars), including HV stability, noise values as calculated from pedestal value distributions, gain variations of the electronics, and trigger.

In this case, the experimenter could use two segments shaped like strips, arranged in two layers. One layer of strips could be arranged horizontally, while a second layer could be arranged vertically. A particle passing through the wall would hit a strip in each layer; the vertical strip would reveal the particle's horizontal position when it crossed the wall, while the horizontal strip would indicate the particle's vertical position.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1989 the Queen Mary group joined {{another large}} {{collaboration}} called H1. The H1 collaboration had embarked on building a huge detector for the world's first proton-electron collider, HERA, which was being constructed at the DESY laboratory in Hamburg. The Queen Mary group was responsible for designing and constructing a time-of-flight <b>hodoscope</b> for H1, a piece of apparatus that proved crucial to {{the operation of the}} experiment as it reduced the unwanted background by a factor of a hundred. Many of the initiatives came from Kalmus's colleagues Graham Thompson and Eric Eisenhandler, particularly after Kalmus became Head of Department at Queen Mary, University of London in 1992 and had less time for research.|$|E
