Maximum values of IMP and the time required to reach them were also affected by the temperature. 3) The k_i’, rate-constant of App-IMP, was generally smaller than k_i, but the relative magnitude for different temperature in the former was approximated to that in the latter. Then, the application of above calculations may be of some use in discussing the relation of temperature to nucleotides-degradation. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} lactic acid on immune mediator release from vaginal epithelial cells. METHODS: The human vaginal epithelial cell line, VK 2 /E 6 E 7, was cultured in {{the presence or absence}} of physiological concentrations of lactic acid, and in {{the presence or absence of}} the viral Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, poly (<b>inosinic</b> acid: cytidylic <b>acid).</b> Supernatants were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 23, transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. RESULTS: Vaginal epithelial cells spontaneously released IL- 1 beta (25. 9 pg/mL), IL- 8 (1. 0 ng/mL), TGF-beta (175 pg/mL), and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (33. 8 ng/mL). Only TGF-beta production was marginally enhanced (49 %) by addition of lactic <b>acid</b> alone. Poly (<b>inosinic</b> acid: cytidylic <b>acid)</b> by itself stimulated the release of IL- 6 (305 pg/mL) and enhanced IL- 8 production (2. 8 ng/mL). The combination of poly (<b>inosinic</b> acid: cytidylic <b>acid)</b> and lactic acid markedly increased IL- 8 production (5. 0 ng/mL) and induced the release of IL- 1 beta (96. 2 pg/mL). The poly (<b>inosinic</b> acid: cytidylic <b>acid)</b> -mediated lactic acid effect on IL- 1 beta and IL- 8 release was abrogated when the lactic acid was neutralized or if acetic acid was substituted for lactic acid. CONCLUSION: Lactic acid enhances the release of selective mediators from vaginal epithelial cells and stimulates antiviral immune responses.

40|$|Part I: The {{leaves of}} nec rd (a single gene {{necrotic}} maize mutant) become necrotic {{when they are}} exposed to light for a few days. Extensive analysis has failed to reveal any difference in chemical composition between leaves of normal plants and of homozygous nec rd plants before any necrotic symptoms are visible (prenecrotic leaves). Treatment of nec rd seedlings with various metabolites (B vitamins, purines, pyrimidines, amino acids, etc.) did not prevent the appearance of necrosis. The rate of photosynthesis of prenecrotic leaves is normal at low light intensities but 20 to 50 % of normal at saturating light intensity. C 14 O 2 feeding experiments indicate that the carbon fixing reactions function normally in the mutant. Hill reaction rates are also similar in mutant and normal plants, as is the metabolism of labelled inorganic phosphate. CMU, which specifically inhibits photosynthesis to the extent of about 90 %, delays the onset of visible necrotic damage and reduces the severity of subsequent necrotic symptoms. It is suggested that the nec rd lesion is in some reaction associated with photosynthesis and that it causes the accumulation of one or more toxic substances. These lower rate of photosynthesis and damage cell membranes. The necrotic phenotype would appear {{to be the result of}} the breakdown of cell compartmentalization. Part II: The kinin, 6 -benzylaminopurine (benzyladenine), is converted to a number of low molecular weight materials by senescing leaves of Xanthium pensylvanicum Wall. (cocklebur). A major product is the riboside, benzyladenosine, which has been identified by comparison of its properties with those of benzyladenylic synthesized enzymatically using E. coli nucleoside phosphorylase and by degradative studies. The ribotide, benzyladenylic acid, also appears to be present. Labelled adenylic, guanylic and <b>inosinic</b> <b>acids</b> are produced, as are small amounts of adenine and guanine. Substantial amounts of label are also found in urea and in a ureide. Small amounts of labelled adenylic and guanylic acids are found in the RNA of the leaf, but benzyladenylic acid itself does not appear to be incorporated into RNA in measurable amounts. Part III: Low molecular weight material obtained from excised accessory glands of Pontania pacifica (gall-wasp) promotes the growth of Pontania galls on Salix alba (willow). Paper chromatographic analysis has indicated that uridine, uric acid and two unidentified adenine containing compounds are prominent constituents of this mixture. Uric acid and the two adenine containing compounds substantially increase the growth rate of small galls from which the larva has been removed while uridine has slight growth promoting activity. Various related compounds (e. g. adenosine, adenine and guanosine) also have growth-promoting activity. It appears likely that such compounds play an important role in the growth and development of Pontania galls...|$|R

40|$|Uric acid (UA) is a purine {{metabolite}} that selectively inhibits peroxynitrite-mediated reactions {{implicated in}} the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Serum UA levels are inversely associated with the incidence of MS in humans because MS patients have low serum UA levels and individuals with hyperuricemia (gout) rarely develop the disease. Moreover, the administration of UA is therapeutic in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Thus, raising serum UA levels in MS patients, by oral administration of a UA precursor such as inosine, may have therapeutic value. We have assessed the effects of inosine, as well as <b>inosinic</b> <b>acid,</b> on parameters relevant to the chemical reactivity of peroxynitrite and the pathogenesis of EAE.

40|$|Humans {{with the}} Lesch-Nyhan {{syndrome}} have an X-chromosomal mutant gene that causes severe neurological and developmental abnormalities. The patients are deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts hypoxanthine to <b>inosinic</b> <b>acid,</b> a major precursor of adenine and guanine nucleotides. Paradoxically, the enzyme defect causes hypernormal {{de novo synthesis}} of <b>inosinic</b> <b>acid,</b> which manifests itself as excesses of hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid. The {{first step in the}} de novo pathway is thought to be rate-limiting, due to feedback repression by adenine and guanine nucleotides. The derepressed rate of purine production in mutants and their failure to thrive could result from reduction in the amounts of nucleotides derived from <b>inosinic</b> <b>acid</b> to levels that are inadequate for normal feedback control and for nucleic acid synthesis needed in growth. Studies with cultured cells, reported here, support the interpretation that mutants are, in effect, nucleotide-deficient. Skin fibroblasts from patients fail to proliferate in media that do not contain supplementary adenine or folic acid, a participant in two stages of purine biosynthesis. The folic acid requirement of mutant cells is at least 50 -fold greater than that of normal cells, which can synthesize all the nucleotides needed for growth without exogenous adenine. Both folic acid and adenine supplements are thought to provide mutant cells with the means of making more <b>inosinic</b> <b>acid</b> available for conversion to adenine and guanine nucleotides.

Metabolism of {{methylated}} purines in Escherichia coli: derepression of purine biosynthesis. J.

Information obtained from in vivo and in vitro systems demonstrated that the metabolism of 6 -methylaminopurine and 6 -methoxypurine utilized identical pathways. The riboside derivatives are formed either by direct ribosidation via nucleoside phosphorylase or, indirectly, by dephosphorylation of the 5 ′-phosphoribosyl derivatives which are synthesized via adenylate pyrophosphorylase. Information obtained {{with the aid of}} strain W- 11 /DAP (lacking adenylate pyrophosphorylase) demonstrated that both pathways were important to the growing cells.
