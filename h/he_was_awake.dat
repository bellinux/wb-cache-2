25|$|Some Sunni {{scholars}} {{do believe}} in Raj’a, believing in the return of number of people such as Seven Sleepers synchronous {{with the appearance of}} the Mahdi. Jalaluddin Al-Sayuti wrote about the raj`a but in a different way from the Shiites. According to his book The Possibility of Seeing the Prophet and the Angels (Arabic: تنوير الحلك في إمكان رؤية النبي والملك,) Suyuti claims to have seen the Prophet Muhammad over 70 times while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake.</b> According to him, in contrast to Shiite belief, the return of the Prophet Muhammad is not limited to a specific time in the future. Al-Sayuti did not mention if any other religious figures will return after death before the resurrection. According to Abu 'Abdullah Al-Qurtubi, raj`a is understood as the lack of physical presence of a prophet, who marks his apparent death by absence in the physical world but will reappear, from time to time, to those who are pure in heart. The Maliki scholar Ibn al-Arabi, known for his exegesis of the Sunan al-Tirmidhi, stated that seeing and hearing the prophets while awake is possible for the pure believer.|$|E
500|$|The {{moment that}} Cupid and Psyche are {{revealed}} {{is an example}} of [...] "Keatsian intensity" [...] as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in between in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version of the Psyche myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to see them at all or if he was dreaming. This inability of the narrator to know if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including [...] "Ode on Indolence", [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to be in love with Psyche, representing the mind.|$|E
2500|$|... "Oblivion" [...] was {{originally}} published in Black Clock No. 1 (Spring 2004/Summer 2004). In this story, the narrator, Randall Napier, recounts his exhausting fight with his wife Hope over his alleged snoring, which she claims has been so loud that it keeps her awake at night. Randall protests, maintaining that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> and consequently unable to snore, while his wife was actually asleep. Eventually they travel to a Sleep Clinic in order to monitor their behaviors and determine for certain who is right.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was also}} a precipitous decline in the boss himself. 1950 marked Mack's 50th year in Philadelphia and his 87th birthday, and {{for the better part}} of a decade it had been obvious he was going senile. [...] He would spend most games asleep in the dugout, leaving game {{strategy}} in the hands of his coaches. [...] Whenever <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake,</b> he often made strange calls that the players and coaches usually disregarded. He would also call for players from decades earlier to pinch-hit; in the 1940s it was not uncommon for him to yell [...] "Baker!" [...] or [...] "Foxx!" [...] – sluggers he had sold off decades before. Most ominous of all, the crowds at Shibe Park were so small that the other AL teams could not even begin to cover their travel expenses, leading the other owners to complain that the gates at Shibe Park were too small to justify the trip. [...] Despite this, the A's managed to awaken from their slumber and tally three straight winning seasons from 1947 to 1949. [...] This led to hopes that the A's would give [...] "The Grand Old Man of Baseball" [...] the perfect 50th anniversary present – a pennant. [...] However, the 1950 season was an unmitigated disaster. [...] By May 26, they were 11-21, their season all but finished. [...] On that date, Mack's sons Roy and Earle gently pushed their father into announcing his retirement at the end of the season.|$|E
2500|$|Reviews {{following}} {{months after}} publication contained limited positive {{appraisal of the}} poem. William Roberts's review, for the August 1816 British Review, was more positive than previous analysis but with no detail about the work: [...] "passing over the two other poems which are bound together with 'Christabel', called 'The Fragment of Kubla Khan', and 'The Pains of Sleep'; in which, however, there are some playful thoughts and fanciful imagery, which we would gladly have extracted if our room would have allowed it." [...] The next review came in the January 1817 Monthly Review, with the anonymous reviewer questioning: [...] "Allowing every possible accuracy to the statement of Mr. Coleridge, we would yet ask him whether this extraordinary fragment was not rather the effect of rapid and instant composition after <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>awake,</b> than of memory immediately recording that which he dreamt when asleep? By what process of consciousness could he distinguish between such composition and such reminiscence? Impressed as his mind was with his interesting dream, and habituated as he is ... to the momentary production of verse, will he venture to assert {{that he did not}} compose, and that he did remember, the lines before us?" [...] The review then concluded, [...] "His 'psychological curiosity', as he terms it, depends in no slight degree on the establishment of the previous fact which we have mentioned: but the poem itself is below criticism. We would dismiss it with some portentous words of Sir Kenelm Digby, in his observations on Browne's religio Medici: 'I have much ado to believe what he speaketh confidently; that he is more beholding to Morpheus for learned and rational as well as pleasing dreams, than to Mercury for smart and facetious conceptions'." ...|$|E
