40|$|L-glutamate, {{typically}} as its Na salt (MSG), elicits a taste termed umami. A characteristic {{feature of}} umami taste is the synergistic potentiation of glutamate taste by purine nucleotide (<b>inosine,</b> guano-sine) <b>monophosphates.</b> This is manifested as an enhanced electro-physiological response from taste receptor cells, as {{an increase in}} nerve firing rate, or as increased preference in behavioral assays. Apart from this enhanced intensity, {{it is not clear}} whether the addi-tion of nucleotides also leads to a change in the perceived quality of glutamate in animals and humans. The magnitude of nucleotide-potentiation in nerve recordings varies considerably between the chorda tympani (CT) and glosso-pharyngeal (GL) nerves (Ninomiya et al., 1993). Single-unit record-ings further highlight the heterogeneity of umami responses in that nucleotide-potentiated signals are seen in distinct fiber-types (sucrose-best or glutamate-best) in the CT and GL nerves (Ninomiy...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Nucleoside-nucleotide mixture {{has been}} shown to improve gut {{morphology}} and reduce the incidence of bacterial translocation in protein deficient mice. AIMS [...] To compare the reparative effect of nucleoside-nucleotide mixture and their individual components on maintenance of gut integrity and bacterial translocation based on their differential metabolism and utilisation. METHODS [...] ICR (CD- 1) mice were randomised into eight groups of 10 animals each and fed 20 % casein diet (control), protein free diet, or protein free diet supplemented with 3 M cytidine, uridine, thymidine, <b>inosine,</b> guanosine <b>monophosphate,</b> or nucleoside-nucleotide mixture for four weeks. On the fourth week, each mouse was injected lipopolysaccharide intraperitoneally (50 micrograms/ 500 microliters) and the incidence of bacterial translocation, caecal bacterial populations, and the ileal histology, noted 48 hours later. RESULTS [...] The death rate in the control group was 40 % compared with 10 % in the nucleoside-nucleotide mixture and 20 % each in the individual components groups, respectively. Bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph node did occur in 100 % of the surviving mice fed the control diet in comparison with 44 % (nucleoside-nucleotide), 50 % (cytidine), 75 % (thymidine), 75 % (uridine), 63 % (inosine), and 63 % (guanosine monophosphate). Histologically, the damage to the gut was more distinct in the protein free diet group. Villous height, crypt depth, and wall thickness in the nucleoside-nucleotide mixture group mean (SEM) (5. 01 (0. 34); 0. 87 (0. 14); 0. 33 (0. 10)), were respectively, higher compared with the protein free diet (3. 34 (0. 34); 0. 61 (0. 03); 0. 18 (0. 04)) group. In the cytidine group, crypt depth (0. 86) (0. 08)), and wall thickness (0. 30 (0. 002)) were higher. The same measurements in the components groups tended to be higher than the protein free diet group. Caecal bacterial populations were, however, similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results suggest that dietary nucleosides and nucleotides are essential nutrients for intestinal repair; nucleotides or cytidine provide a better response...|$|R
40|$|In Coffea arabica leaves, the purine ring of {{theobromine}} (3, 7 -dimethylxanthine) and caffeine (1, 3, 7 -trimethylxanthine) {{is provided}} by de novo purine biosynthesis: (a) [14 C]glycine, [14 C]bicarbonate, and [14 C]formate were incorporated into <b>inosine</b> 5 [prime]- <b>monophosphate</b> (IMP), sum of adenine nucleotides ([sigma]Ade), theobromine, and caffeine; and (b) incorporation of [14 C]formate into IMP, [sigma]Ade, theobromine, and caffeine was inhibited by azaserine, a known inhibitor of de novo purine biosynthesis. Capacity of coffee leaves to salvage added purines was demonstrated by incorporation of [14 C]hypoxanthine into [sigma]Ade and the incorporation of [14 C]adenosine, [14 C]adenine, [14 C]inosine, and [14 C]hypoxanthine into both theobromine and caffeine. Consistent with synthesis of theobromine from two separate purine nucleotide pools, one synthesized de novo and one via salvage, added xanthine 5 [prime]-monophosphate (XMP), inosine, or hypoxanthine failed to reduce the incorporation of [14 C]formate into theobromine but diluted the specific radioactivity of [14 C]adenosine and [14 C]adenine incorporated into theobromine. Evidence that theobromine is not the immediate precursor of caffeine is provided: (a) [14 C]xanthine was incorporated into caffeine but not into theobromine; (b) exogenous xanthine diluted the specific radioactivity of caffeine synthesized from [14 C]adenine and [14 C]hypoxanthine but caused accumulation of radiolabel in theobromine; (c) allopurinol, a known inhibitor of the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine, reduced incorporation of [14 C]adenine and [14 C]hypoxanthine into caffeine but caused accumulation of radiolabel in theobromine; and (d) incorporation of [14 C]formate into caffeine, but not into theobromine, was reduced by added XMP, inosine, or hypoxanthine...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cytokinins (CKs) are a {{group of}} plant growth {{regulators}} {{that are involved in}} several plant developmental processes. Despite the breadth of knowledge surrounding CKs and their diverse functions, much remains to be discovered about the full potential of CKs, including their relationship with the purine salvage pathway, and other phytohormones. The most widely used approach to query unknown facets of CK biology utilized functional genomics coupled with CK metabolite assays and screening of CK associated phenotypes. There are numerous different types of assays for determining CK quantity, however, none of these methods screen for the compendium of metabolites that are necessary for elucidating all roles, including purine salvage pathway enzymes in CK metabolism, and CK cross-talk with other phytohormones. Furthermore, all published analytical methods have drawbacks ranging from the required use of radiolabelled compounds, or hazardous derivatization reagents, poor sensitivity, lack of resolution between CK isomers and lengthy run times. Results In this paper, a method is described for the concurrent extraction, purification and analysis of several CKs (freebases, ribosides, glucosides, nucleotides), purines (adenosine <b>monophosphate,</b> <b>inosine,</b> adenosine, and adenine), indole- 3 -acetic acid, and abscisic acid from hundred-milligram (mg) quantities of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf tissue. This method utilizes conventional Bieleski solvents extraction, solid phase purification, and is unique because of its diverse range of detectable analytes, and implementation of a conventional HPLC system with a fused core column that enables good sensitivity without the requirement of a UHPLC system. Using this method we were able to resolve CKs about twice as fast as our previous method. Similarly, analysis of adenosine, indole- 3 -acetic acid, and abscisic acid, was comparatively rapid. A further enhancement of the method was the utilization of a QTRAP 5500 mass analyzer, which improved upon several aspects of our previous analytical method carried out on a Quattro mass analyzer. Notable improvements included much superior sensitivity, and number of analytes detectable within a single run. Limits of detection ranged from 2 pM for (9 G) Z to almost 750 pM for indole- 3 -acetic acid. Conclusions This method is well suited for functional genomics platforms tailored to understanding CK metabolism, CK interrelationships with purine recycling and associated hormonal cross-talk. </p...|$|R
