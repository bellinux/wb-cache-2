40|$|Origins {{of phrase}} {{structure}} analysis To understand {{the properties of}} modern phrase structure grammars, {{it is useful to}} place their development in a wider formal and historical context. Phrase structure grammars and associated notions of phrase structure analysis have their proximate origins in models of Immediate <b>Constituent</b> (<b>IC)</b> analysis. Although inspired by the programmatic syntactic remarks in Bloomfield (����), these models were principally developed by Bloomfield’s successors, most actively in the decade between the publication of Wells (����) and the advent of transformational analyses in Harris (����) and Chomsky (����). The central intuition underlying models of IC analysis was that the structure of an expression could be exhibited by dividing the expression into parts (its immediate constituents), further subdividing these parts, and continuing until syntactically indivisible units were obtained. This style of analysis was motivated in part by a belief in the ������� � of syntactic relations, in particular the view that the most important relations held between immediate constituents. The process of analyzing syntax is largely one of finding successive layer...|$|R

This circumstance is leading to many research programs seeking new alternatives to control biofilm formation by this pathogen. In this study we show that a potent inhibition of biofilm mass production can be achieved in community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive strains using plant compounds, such as individual <b>constituents</b> (<b>ICs)</b> of essential oils (carvacrol, citral, and (+) -limonene). The Crystal Violet staining technique {{was used to evaluate}} biofilm mass formation during 40 h of incubation. Carvacrol is the most effective IC, abrogating biofilm formation in all strains tested, while CA-MRSA was the most sensitive phenotype to any of the ICs tested. Inhibition of planktonic cells by ICs during initial growth stages could partially explain the inhibition of biofilm formation. Overall, our results show the potential of EOs to prevent biofilm formation, especially in strains that exhibit resistance to other antimicrobials. As these compounds are food additives generally recognized as safe, their anti-biofilm properties may lead to important new applications, such as sanitizers, in the food industry or in clinical settings...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing cornstalks to produce chaetoglobosin A by C. globosum W 7 in solid-batch fermentation and to determine an optimal method for purification of the products. The output of chaetoglobosin A from the cornstalks was 0. 34 mg/g, and its content in the crude extract was 4. 80 %. Purification conditions were optimized to increase the content of chaetoglobosin A in the crude extract, including the extract solvent, temperature, and pH value. The optimum process conditions were found to be acetone as the extractant, under room temperature, and at a pH value of 13. Under these conditions, a production process of the antifungal chaetoglobosin A was established, and the content reached 19. 17 %.

The Minimum inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of OVEO and CAR against S. aureus cocktail was 1. 25 µL/mL, while the MIC of ROEO and CIN was 10 µL/mL. The Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index of the combined EOs or ICs was ≤ 0. 5 indicating a synergic interaction. The incorporation of OVEO and ROEO or CAR and CIN at different combinations in cheese and meat broths caused a decrease (p ≤ 0. 05) of initial counts of S. aureus. Combined application of 1 / 8 MIC OVEO and 1 / 4 MIC ROEO or 1 / 4 MIC CAR and 1 / 4 MIC CIN in meat and cheese samples reduced (p ≤ 0. 05) the viable cells counts and caused morphological changes in S. aureus cells, such as cell shrinkage and appearance of blebbing-like structures on cell surfaces. However, in cheese and meat samples the decrease in viable cell counts was smaller (p ≤ 0. 05) than that observed in cheese and meat broths. These findings reinforce the potential of the use of OVEO and ROEO or CAR and CIN in combination to control S. aureus in cheese and meat matrices...|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} of food preservation by using essential oils (EOs) and their individual <b>constituents</b> (<b>ICs)</b> is attracting enormous interest worldwide. Until now, researchers considered that treatments with such antimicrobial compounds did not induce bacterial resistance via a phenotypic (i. e. transient) response. Nevertheless, {{the emergence of}} genotypic (i. e. stable) resistance after treatment with these compounds had not been previously tested. Our results confirm that growth of Escherichia coli MG 1655 in presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the ICs carvacrol, citral, and (+) -limonene oxide do not increase resistance to further treatments with either the same IC (direct resistance) or with other preservation treatments (cross-resistance) such as heat or pulsed electric fields (PEF). Bacterial mutation frequency was likewise lower when those IC’s were applied; however, after 10 days of re-culturing cells in presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the ICs, {{we were able to}} isolate several derivative strains (i. e. mutants) displaying an increased minimum inhibitory concentration to those ICs. Furthermore, when compared to the wild type (WT) strain, they also displayed direct resistance and cross-resistance. Derivative strains selected with carvacrol and citral also displayed morphological changes involving filamentation along with cell counts at late-stationary growth phase that were lower than the WT strain. In addition, co-cultures of each derivative strain with the WT strain resulted in a predominance of the original strain in absence of ICs, indicating that mutants would not out-compete WT cells under optimal growth conditions. Nevertheless, growth in the presence of ICs facilitated the selection of these resistant mutants. Thus, as a result, subsequent food preservation treatments of these bacterial cultures might be less effective than expected for WT cultures. In conclusion, this study recommends that treatment with ICs at sub-inhibitory concentrations should be generally avoided, since it could favor the emergence of hyper-resistant strains. To ascertain the true value of EOs and their ICs in the field of food preservation, further research thus needs to be conducted on the induction of increased transient and stable bacterial resistance via such antimicrobial compounds, as revealed in this study...|$|R

The writer tries {{to figure out the}} kinds of structures of modification, found in the final drafts, written by students of the English Department of Faculty of Letters in Petra Christian University, especially from the class of Writing IV. Besides, the study is also to determine the most common kind of structures of modification, the most common kind of modifier and head, and to observe the kinds of grammatical deviations involved in the structures of modification. During the research, the theory of Francis on structures of modification is used as the framework, supported by Fitikides's theory for the error clarification. The data collected from the five selected students' final drafts are read carefully to identify the structures of modification. Then, they are analysed by using immediate <b>constituent</b> (<b>IC)</b> analysis in order to indicate the head and the modifier. The findings show that the various kinds of structures of modification are : noun that is modified by noun, adjective, function word, phrase, and clause; verb modified by adverb and phrase; adjective as the phrase -head; both phrase and clause as the heads of adverb, function word, phrase, and clause; and noun functioning as the phrase-modifiers. Compared to all kinds of structures of modification, clause which function as modifier of clause have the most highest frequency. In particular, both the modifier and the head consist of noun, adjective, adverb, phrase, and clause. Besides, there are also verb functioning as the head and function word as the modifier. The modifier and the head which are the most frequently used are phrase. Furthermore, several kinds of grammatical deviations involved in the structures of modification also appear in the data, amongst others incorrect omissions, unnecessary words, and confused words. The incorrect omissions constitute six categories; those are omissions of prepositions, articles, possessive nouns, relative pronouns, function words, and conjunctions. The unnecessary words are also divided into six categories : unnecessary prepositions, articles, `as', relative pronouns, modal auxiliaries, and to be.

We model a software architecture of SoS by the adoption of SosADL, a novel architectural description language(ADL) for SoS, and transform it to DEVS, a formalism for simulation of SoS. Our approach offers a dynamic view to architectural descriptions of SoS, preserving the architectural integrity of the SoS, and supporting the visualization and validation of emergent behaviors. We evaluate our proposal through a case study conducted within the context of a real SoS in operation for flood monitoring in an urban area.

By using a system of high-bandwidth impedance sensors and drive electronics, the physical <b>constituents</b> of <b>ICs</b> such as buried/surface dielectrics, buried/surface conductors and PN junctions could be detected. This thesis takes an initial step toward high-bandwidth electroquasistatic (EQS) imaging by exploring the use of high-frequency imaging. When combined with impedance sensors having a high spatial density, it could be possible to develop a very-high-bandwidth scanning imaging system. The system explored here uses a capacitively-coupled electrode array in order to distinguish various features such as a dielectric layer or a variable air gap based on measured electrode impedance. The frequency at which the impedance is measured is near 500 MHz. Also, this system can be potentially used to image depth information and dielectric composition by using multi-wavelength electrode arrays. This thesis presents the selection and layout for the high-speed drive electronics and the construction and modeling of the driven electrode arrays.

40|$|The initial {{timing of}} face-specific effects in event-related {{potentials}} (ERPs) {{is a point}} of contention in face processing research. Although effects {{during the time of the}} N 170 are robust in the literature, inconsistent effects during the time of the P 100 challenge the interpretation of the N 170 as being the initial face-specific ERP effect. The interpretation of the early P 100 effects are often attributed to low-level differences between face stimuli and a host of other image categories. Research using sophisticated controls for low-level stimulus characteristics (Rousselet, Husk, Bennett, & Sekuler, 2008) report robust face effects starting at around 130 ms following stimulus onset. The present study examines the independent components (ICs) of the P 100 and N 170 complex in the context of a minimally controlled low-level stimulus set and a clear P 100 effect for faces versus houses at the scalp. Results indicate that four ICs account for the ERPs to faces and houses in the first 200 ms following stimulus onset. The IC that accounts for the majority of the scalp N 170 (icNla) begins dissociating stimulus conditions at approximately 130 ms, closely replicating the scalp results of Rousselet et al. (2008). The scalp effects at the time of the P 100 are accounted for by two <b>constituent</b> <b>ICs</b> (icP 1 a and icP 1 b). The IC that projects the greatest voltage at the scalp during the P 100 (icP 1 a) shows a face-minus-house effect over the period of the P 100 that is less robust than the N 170 effect of icN 1 a when measured as the average of single subject differential activation robustness. The second constituent process of the P 100 (icP 1 b), although projecting a smaller voltage to the scalp than icP 1 a, shows a more robust effect for the face-minus-house contrast starting prior to 100 ms following stimulus onset. Further, the effect expressed by icP 1 b takes the form of a larger negative projection to medial occipital sites for houses over faces partially canceling the larger projection of icP 1 a, thereby enhancing the face positivity at this time. These findings have three main implications for ERP research on face processing: First, the ICs that constitute the face-minus-house P 100 effect are independent from the ICs that constitute the N 170 effect. This suggests that the P 100 effect and the N 170 effect are anatomically independent. Second, the timing of the N 170 effect can be recovered from scalp ERPs that have spatio-temporally overlapping effects possibly associated with low-level stimulus characteristics. This unmixing of the EEG signals may reduce the need for highly constrained stimulus sets, a characteristic that is not always desirable for a topic that is highly coupled to ecological validity. Third, by unmixing the constituent processes of the EEG signals new analysis strategies are made available. In particular the exploration of the relationship between cortical processes over the period of the P 100 and N 170 ERP complex (and beyond) may provide previously unaccessible answers to questions such as: Is the face effect a special relationship between low-level and high-level processes along the visual stream...|$|R

In the current study we performed an exemplary application of a virtual parallel screening approach to identify potential targets for 16 secondary metabolites isolated and identified from the aerial parts of the medicinal plant RUTA GRAVEOLENS L. Low energy conformers of the isolated constituents were simultaneously screened against a set of 2208 pharmacophore models generated in-house for the IN SILICO prediction of putative biological targets, i. e., target fishing. Based on the predicted ligand-target interactions, we focused on three biological targets, namely acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the human rhinovirus (HRV) coat protein and the cannabinoid receptor type- 2 (CB (2)). For a critical evaluation of the applied parallel screening approach, virtual hits and non-hits were assayed on the respective targets. For AChE the highest scoring virtual hit, arborinine, showed the best inhibitory IN VITRO activity on AChE (IC (50) 34. 7 muM). Determination of the anti-HRV- 2 effect revealed 6, 7, 8 -trimethoxycoumarin and arborinine to be the most active antiviral <b>constituents</b> with <b>IC</b> (50) values of 11. 98 muM and 3. 19 muM, respectively.

We evaluated our approach by conducting two case studies using a ï¬‚ood monitoring system that is intended to be part of a smart city. Results indicate that ASAS can successfully generate functional simulations for the SoS operation, which in turn can enable to reason and monitor an SoS operation, taking into account its dynamic nature...|$|R
40|$|Synovial {{fluids and}} paired sera taken from {{patients}} either before, after {{or at the}} time of diagnosis of definite rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were compared with samples from patients with unclassified inflammatory arthropathies (IA). Raised levels of immune complexes (IC) were detected in some RA patients by C 1 q binding activity but in the majority of both RA and IA patients by the platelet aggregation test; levels were usually higher in joint fluids than in sera. IgM rheumatoid factors (RF) and IgA RFs were lower in synovial fluids but IgF RF levels were similar in matched samples. Synovial fluid to serum albumin ratios were used to estimate synovial permeability (inflammation) and then to calculate which patients synthesized macromolecules locally in the synovium. Local synthesis of RFs was detected in a greater proportion of RA than IA patients and only two patients formed RFs locally in the first months of symptoms. Half the patients in both groups however appeared to synthesize or trap <b>IC</b> <b>constituents</b> and in many patients there was evidence of local synthesis within 6 months after their symptoms had started. We conclude that local synthesis of large amounts of RFs is uncommon {{in the early stages of}} RA but that IC of unknown composition are synthesized or localized in the affected joints of many patients with RA and inflammatory arthropathies shortly after their symptoms appear...|$|R

This {{study was designed to}} determine if the anti-inflammatory effects of individual herbal constituents of ASHMITM exhibited synergy. METHODS: Effects of ASHMI and its components aqueous extracts of Lingzhi (Ganoderma lucidum), Kushen (Sophora flavescens) and Gancao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), on Th 2 cytokine secretion by murine memory Th 2 cells (D 10. G 4. 1) and eotaxin- 1 secretion by human lung fibroblast (HLF- 1) cells were determined by measuring levels in culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Potential synergistic effects were determined by computing interaction indices from concentration-effect curve parameters. RESULTS: Individual Lingzhi, Kushen and Gancao extracts and ASHMI (the combination of individual extracts) inhibited production of interleukin (IL) - 4 and IL- 5 by murine memory Th 2 cells and eotaxin- 1 production by HLF- 1 cells. The mean 25 %-inhibitory-concentration (IC 25) values (mg/mL) for ASHMI, Lingzhi, Kushen and Gancao for IL- 4 production were 30. 9, 79. 4, 123, and 64. 6, respectively; for IL- 5 production were 30. 2, 263, 123. 2 and 100, respectively; for eotaxin- 1 were 13. 2, 16. 2, 30. 2, and 25. 1, respectively. The IC 50 values (mg/mL) for ASHMI, Lingzhi, Kushen and Gancao for IL- 4 production were 158. 5, 239. 9, 446. 7, and 281. 8, respectively; for eotaxin- 1 were 38. 1, 33. 1, 100, and 158. 5, respectively. The interaction indices of ASHMI <b>constituents</b> at <b>IC</b> 25 were 0. 35 for IL- 4, 0. 21 for IL- 5 and 0. 59 for eotaxin- 1. The interaction indices at IC 50 values were 0. 50 for IL- 4 and 0. 62 for eotaxin- 1 inhibition. Inhibition of IL- 5 did not reach IC 50 values. All interaction indices were below 1 which indicated synergy. CONCLUSION: By comparing the interaction index values, we find that constituents in ASHMITM synergistically inhibited eotaxin- 1 production as well as Th 2 cytokine production...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Intellectual capital (IC) is {{attracting}} increasing attention from scholars and practitioners {{in the private}} sector, while research {{in the public sector}} is still in its embryonic stage, especially in regards to local governments. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to fill this gap by channelling conceptual and empirical findings from the large body of IC literature. Design/methodology/approach The research investigates IC in action in the local government domain. A survey has been carried out involving both managers and politicians of all Italian local governments (ILGs) with more than 40, 000 inhabitants. In order to define the <b>constituents</b> of each <b>IC</b> dimension perceived by ILGs, principal component analysis was used in investigating the results. Findings Results highlights how IC components are perceived in ILGs: human capital is a combination of aptitudes in pursuing target performances, sense of ownership and motivations; relational capital is a combination of values, relationships and acts; structural capital includes procedures and routines supporting the decision-making process, the ability of achieving objectives and handling changes. Research limitations/implications While the research findings are limited due to being based on a survey in a single country, they present opportunities for future research regarding further testing of how IC is perceived in LGs in different context. The conclusion could be beneficial also for standard setters, providing a path to support the IC disclosure by LGs. Originality/value The paper contributes to a narrow strand of research – IC in LGs – adding new knowledge in “IC in action” research stream...|$|R
40|$|The {{phytochemical}} {{profile and}} anti-inflammatory activity of Gaultheria procumbens dry lipophilic leaf extracts were evaluated. Forty compounds {{were identified by}} GC-MS, representing 86. 36 % and 81. 97 % of the petroleum ether (PE) and chloroform (CHE) extracts, respectively, with ursolic acid (28. 82 %), oleanolic acid (10. 11 %), methyl benzoate (10. 03 %), and methyl salicylate (6. 88 %) dominating in CHE, and methyl benzoate (21. 59 %), docosane (18. 86 %), and octacosane (11. 72 %) prevailing in PE. Three components of CHE were fully identified after flash chromatography isolation and spectroscopic studies as (6 S, 9 R) -vomifoliol (4. 35 %), 8 -demethyl-latifolin (1. 13 %), and 8 -demethylsideroxylin (2. 25 %). Hyaluronidase and lipoxygenase inhibitory activity was tested for CHE (IC 50 = 282. 15 ± 10. 38 μg/mL and 899. 97 ± 31. 17 μg/mL, respectively), PE (IC 50 = 401. 82 ± 16. 12 μg/mL and 738. 49 ± 15. 92 μg/mL), and nine of the main <b>constituents</b> versus heparin (<b>IC</b> 50 = 366. 24 ± 14. 72 μg/mL) and indomethacin (IC 50 = 92. 60 ± 3. 71 μg/mL) as positive controls. With the best activity/concentration relationships, ursolic and oleanolic acids were recommended as analytical markers for the extracts and plant material. Seasonal variation of both markers following foliar development was investigated by UHPLC-PDA. The highest levels of ursolic (5. 36 – 5. 87 mg/g DW of the leaves) and oleanolic (1. 14 – 1. 26 mg/g DW) acids were observed between August and October, indicating the optimal season for harvesting...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT &# 946;-Glucuronidase inhibitors are {{suggested}} as potential hepatoprotective agents. Swertia chirayita (Roxb.) Buch. -Ham. ex C. B. Clarke, Gentianaceae, {{is known for}} its hepatoprotective and anti-hepatotoxic activity in Ayurvedic system of medicine for ages. This plant is substituted by other species like S. decussata Nimmo ex C. B. Clarke and S. bimaculata (Siebold & Zucc.) Hook. f. & Thomson ex C. B. Clarke. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare metabolite profile and &# 946;-glucuronidase inhibitory activity of these three important species of Swertia and to identify the active <b>constituents.</b> S. chirayita (<b>IC</b> 50 210. 97 µg/ml) and S. decussata (IC 50 269. 7 µg/ml) showed &# 946;-glucuronidase inhibitory activity significantly higher than that of silymarin, the known inhibitor of the enzyme. The activity of S. bimaculata was low. The metabolites present in the three species were analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS based metabolomics approach. Five amino acids, twenty one organic acids, one inorganic acid, eight fatty acids, twenty one phenols including xanthones, eight sugars, seven sugar alcohols, five terpenoids and amarogentin were identified. Activities of the xanthones mangiferin (IC 50 16. 06 µg/ml), swerchirin (IC 50 162. 84 µg/ml), decussatin (IC 50 195. 11 µg/ml), 1 -hydroxy- 3, 5, 8 -trimethoxy xanthone (IC 50 245. 97 µg/ml), bellidifolin (IC 50 390. 26 µg/ml) were significantly higher than that of silymarin (IC 50 794. 62 µg/ml). Quinic acid (IC 50 2. 91 mg/ml), O-acetylsalicylic acid (IC 50 48. 4 mg/ml), citric acid (IC 50 1. 77 mg/ml), D-malic acid (IC 50 14. 82 mg/ml) and succinic acid (IC 50 38. 86 mg/ml) also inhibited the enzyme &# 946;-glucuronidase. The findings suggest that constituents, in addition to the xanthones, probably also contribute to the bioactivity of different Swertia species by synergistic effect. Further in vivo study is required to support the claim...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the meanings and {{the forms of}} Multi Word Expressions (MWEs) are stored in the mental lexicon (e. g., [1, 2]). To comprehend these over-learned expressions the combination of single words meanings might not be readers’ most effective strategy. In the present study we used ambiguous idioms (e. g., land on someone’s feet) that have both a conventional meaning and a semantically well-formed literal interpretation, to isolate and compare the cognitive operations at play during compositional and non-compositional processing of the same sequences of words. The strings were inserted in different contexts: an Idiomatic Context Condition (IC) (1); a Literal Context Condition (LC) (2); a Control Condition (CC) where the last word of the idiom string was embedded in a literal sentence (3). The predictability of the last word of the idiom strings was equally very high across conditions. In Experiment 1, we recorded Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). We assumed that processing idiomatic configurations of words [3] involves recognition [4] and whole meaning integration processes. Therefore we expected that {{the recognition of the}} idiomatic strings should be facilitated in IC compared to LC and this could be reflected in a larger P 300 effect. The integration of the idiomatic meaning in the sentential context might be reflected in N 400 effects, [5]) or, alternatively, in P 600 effects [6] if additional inferences based on vocabulary information are needed to preserve sentence coherence. The ERP waveforms showed an early positive effect (P 300 -like) on the penultimate word of the expression in IC. The processing of the last constituent was also influenced by the previous context: a late positive effect was observed on the last idiomatic <b>constituent</b> in <b>IC</b> compared to CC. To test whether the literal meaning of the idioms was computed even in idiomatic contexts [3] we ran a cross-modal lexical decision times experiment (Experiment 2) in which the visual target was either related or unrelated to the literal meaning of the last constituent of the idiom string. The results showed that regardless of context the literal meaning of the last constituent of the expression was still available at the offset of the idiom string. This suggests that the meanings of the constituent words are activated even when the idiom has been recognized as a conventional expression. Overall, our results show that idiom comprehension processes differ from literal processing: idioms need to be first recognized as such and recognition is easier when idioms are inserted in idiomatic contexts. At the end of the expression the conventional meaning is integrated into the sentence and because of the local ambiguity of the string readers might need to draw additional inferences to preserve sentence coherence, retrieving and integrating the conventional meaning of the expression...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that some of the secondary metabolites (polyacetylenes and polyenes) isolated from the raw lipophilic extract of Echinacea pallida roots have good cytotoxic activity on cancer cell lines 3. In particular, pentadeca-(8 Z, 13 Z) -dien- 11 -yn- 2 -one was found to be the most active <b>constituent,</b> with an <b>IC</b> 50 value of 32. 17 ± 3. 98 uM on pancreatic MIA PaCa- 2 cancer cells and 2. 34 ± 0. 33 uM on colonic COLO 320 cancer cells, after 72 h of exposure. This compound is present in the roots in a not-oxidized form but, during the drying process and the subsequent storage, a change in its concentration was observed, which has been attributed to a possible oxidation process. As part of our ongoing research on bioactive metabolites from Echinacea, the aim of this research was the evaluation of the stability of this secondary metabolite by RP-HPLC-DAD 2 under the experimental conditions applied during the biological assays. The study was initially carried out on the lipophilic crude extract obtained from E. pallida roots and then it was focused on the individual component isolated and purified from the plant material by preparative chromatographic techniques. The results showed a moderate change in the HPLC profiles of E. pallida crude extract in 72 h, with an increase of hydroxylated derivatives. The oxidation kinetic of the most active compound, pentadeca-(8 Z, 13 Z) -dien- 11 -yn- 2 -one, was found to be quite slow, since the % area of the intermediate hydroperoxide was about 25 % after 72 h of exposure. The final product of the oxidation process, i. e. the hydroxilated derivative (i. e. 8 -hydroxy-pentadeca-(9 E, 13 Z) -dien- 11 -yn- 2 -one, available thanks to a synthetic approach), was not observed in the HPLC chromatogram after 72 h. Considering that during the first 24 h of exposure, the % area of the hydroperoxide intermediate is below 15 %, the observed cytotoxic activity can be mainly attributed to the genuine not oxidized compound...|$|R
40|$|A brain {{computer}} interface (BCI) {{allows the}} user to communicate with a computer using only brain signals. In this way, the conventional neural pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles are bypassed, thereby enabling control of a computer by a person with no motor control. The brain signals, known as electroencephalographs (EEGs), are recorded by electrodes placed {{on the surface of}} the scalp. A requirement for a successful BCI is that interfering artifacts are removed from the EEGs, so that thereby the important cognitive information is revealed. Two systems based on second order blind source separation (BSS) are therefore proposed. The first system, is based on developing a gradient based BSS algorithm, within which a constraint is incorporated such that the effect of eye blinking artifacts are mitigated from the <b>constituent</b> independent components (<b>ICs).</b> The second method is based on reconstructing the EEGs such that the effect of eye blinking artifacts are removed. The EEGs are separated using an unconstrained BSS algorithm, based on the principles of second order blind identification. Certain characteristics describing eye blinking artifacts are used to identify the related ICs. Then the remaining ICs are used to reconstruct the artifact free EEGs. Both methods yield significantly better results than standard techniques. The degree to which the artifacts are removed is shown and compared with standard methods, both subjectively and objectively. The proposed BCI systems are based on extracting the sources related to finger movement and tracking the movement of the corresponding signal sources. The first proposed system explicitly localises the sources over successive temporal windows of ICs using the least squares (LS) method and characterises the trajectories of the sources. A constrained BSS algorithm is then developed to separate the EEGs while mitigating the eye blinking artifacts. Another approach is based on inferring causal relationships between electrode signals. Directed transfer functions (DTFs) are also applied to short temporal windows of EEGs, from which a time-frequency map of causality is constructed. Additionally, the distribution of beta band power for the IC related to finger movement is combined with the DTF approach to form part of a robust classification system. Finally, a new modality for BCI is introduced based on space-time-frequency masking. Here the sources are assumed to be disjoint in space, time and frequency. The method is based on multi-way analysis of the EEGs and extraction of components related to finger movements. The components are localised in space-time-frequency and compared with the original EEGs in order to quantify the motion of the extracted component...|$|R
