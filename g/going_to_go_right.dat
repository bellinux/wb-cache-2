500|$|Kirkwood branded Mercedes [...] "a savvy, ballsy {{girl that}} can't say no and is unapologetic about it". Metcalfe has {{described}} Mercedes {{as someone who}} [...] "hates every woman in Hollyoaks" [...] except her own sisters, and as someone who talks too much and has a [...] "mouth like a foghorn". She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes [...] "always looks after her family and would never do anything to deliberately hurt them. Mercedes' heart is definitely in the right place". Metcalfe observed that Mercedes is [...] "completely mad" [...] and she [...] "just does whatever she feels like doing at the time. She doesn't exactly think things through". Metcalfe further explained that Mercedes did not [...] "consider consequences", which led her to unintentionally [...] "destroy everything". She elaborated on this, saying that Mercedes never has a happy ending [...] "because she can't. I don't think with Mercedes there is ever a happy ending. Just when something might go her way or something's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> for her, she destroys it". She said that her character is [...] "used to getting her own way" [...] so she thought that despite her actions, [...] "everything will turn out right in the end". She opined that Mercedes was at her best in this state, being [...] "minxy and destructive". Metcalfe described Mercedes in this way: [...] "Whatever she does that's bad, she manages to justify in her head. She doesn't have much self-worth and she knows what she's like". Metcalfe also expressed the hope that Mercedes could be happy [...] "free and single". She explained that Mercedes was unable to remain happy, saying: [...] "she has moments of happiness but ruins them herself". She went on to explain that due to Mercedes' first love having [...] "messed her up", Mercedes behaved [...] "the way she is where men are concerned". She further explained that Mercedes believed she could change but was disappointed when she could not. Metcalfe said, [...] "When she says that she's going to change, she actually means it; she just can't sustain it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course I am," [...] {{he replied}} more calmly, [...] "but I can't help it. For some days now I've had {{a sort of}} feeling that {{something}} was going to happen--that--well, that things weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right.</b> And this morning when I got up, I made up my mind that I would tell you." ...|$|E
25|$|We have {{to adjust}} the AMT. That has to be reduced. We {{have to get rid}} of the death tax, which is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> zero in 2010, which is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> create an {{incentive}} – I can't imagine what kind of an incentive it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> create. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|R

2500|$|Best's sixth goal saw him go one on {{one with}} Northampton goalkeeper Kim Book. Best made a feint <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> which put Book on his backside, before he went left and walked {{the ball into the}} net. Of the goal Book said: [...] "I {{remember}} thinking George was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> one way, but he dropped his shoulder and went the other, and by then I was already on the deck. He was just too good for me." [...] Best's six goal performance earned him an invitation to No 10 Downing Street from UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had also regularly written fan letters to him. In 2002 the British public voted Best's record breaking performance #26 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.|$|R
60|$|For {{three hours}} he writhed on that door-step, till {{he came to}} hate it; it {{was as much a}} prison as his room at the Zapps' had been. He hated the areaway grill, and a big brown spot on the pavement, and, as a truck-driver hates a motorman, so did he hate a pudgy woman across the street who peeped out from a second-story window and watched him with cynical interest. He finally could endure no longer the world's criticism, as {{expressed}} by the woman opposite. He started as though he were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> now to some place he had been intending to go to all the time, and stalked away, ignoring the woman.|$|E
5000|$|Kleefisch made {{national}} news during the Wisconsin gubernatorial race in October 2010 when footage {{of an interview}} she had done just weeks after she announced her run was uncovered. The hour-long interview contained footage where she showed concern about changing existing marriage laws and discussed where marriage laws might go if changed. [...] "This doesn't just have roots in the Bible. This has roots in fiscal common sense. We can't, at this point, afford to just be handing out money to anyone. This is a slippery slope {{in addition to that}} — at what point are we going to okay marrying inanimate objects? Can I marry this table, or this — you know, clock? Can we marry dogs? This is ridiculous. Biblically, again I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> back to my fundamental Christian beliefs, marriage is between one man and one woman." [...] The story became {{national news}} after it was discovered that Kleefisch's uncle Chris Pfauser has been in an openly gay relationship for 18 years, and Pfauser said after hearing the comments that he would vote for his niece's opponent.|$|E
5000|$|... “I {{was running}} down Harvick {{there for a}} little bit and once I got close to him he started to pick up his pace a little bit, which was good because I needed him to run out of gas,” Logano said. “I started to catch him a little bit and I drove into one too hard and started to wheel hop. I just about lost it and at that point you just hope he runs out of gas, which he did in the last corner. It makes up for last week. We lost the race last week the same way, so it makes up for it to get it this week.” “I had a chance,” Kyle Busch said after {{finishing}} second. “I could’ve went up there, I could’ve raced the 22, I could’ve passed him. I felt like I was better than he was, but my crew chief called in scared on the fuel situation from last week and I don’t blame him. We definitely didn’t want to run out again. We wanted to make sure we could be there at the end.” “We ran pretty good with just the way the fuel strategy worked out, we had to save a lot battling with Kevin (Harvick)," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "I thought (Joey Logano) and (Kyle Busch) were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>right</b> by me and we actually had a lot of car left." ...|$|E

She vows to change every time she does something wrong, and it’s getting to the point now where no one’s buying it". —Jennifer Metcalfe on how Mercedes has developed through her tenure (2012). Kirkwood branded Mercedes [...] "a savvy, ballsy girl that can't say no and is unapologetic about it".
