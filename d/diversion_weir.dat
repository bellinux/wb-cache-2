The Plan foresaw the construction of a dam at Maqarin on the Yarmouk River at the Jordanian-Syrian border as well as a <b>diversion</b> <b>weir</b> further downstream to divert the Yarmouk waters for irrigation of the Jordan Valley. Based on a 1953 water sharing treaty with Syria, Jordan made plans and sought funding for the dam from the United States. Israel, which diverted water from the Yarmouk to the Sea of Galilee for its own use, was not consulted, and the U.S. decided not to fund the Maqarin dam. Thus, much of the river’s winter flows drained to the Dead Sea and left insufficient water resources for the development of irrigation in Jordan. Despite this, Jordan embarked on the construction of the East Ghor Canal with U.S. funding to develop irrigation in the Northeastern Jordan Valley with the limited water it had available.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Permanent rivers are {{the main}} sources of {{renewable}} water supply for the croplands under the irrigation and drainage schemes. They are also {{the major source of}} sediment loads transport into the storage reservoirs of the hydro-electrical dams, <b>diversion</b> <b>weirs</b> and regulating dams. Sedimentation process results from soil erosion which is related to poor watershed management and human intervention ion in the hydraulic regime of the rivers. These could change the hydraulic behavior and as such, leads to riverbed and river bank scouring, the consequences of which would be sediment load transport into the dams and therefore reducing the flow discharge in water intakes. The present paper investigate sedimentation process by varying the Manning coefficient "n " by using the SHARC software along the watercourse in the Dez River. Results indicated that the optimum "n " within that river range is 0. 0315 at which quantity minimum sediment loads are transported into the Eastern intake. Comparison of the model results with those obtained by those from the SSIIM software within the same river reach showed a very close proximity between them. This suggests a relative accuracy with which the model can simulate the hydraulic flow characteristics and therefore its suitability as a powerful analytical tool for project feasibility studies and project implementation...|$|R

40|$|The {{alteration}} of hydrological regimes through {{the construction of}} dams and minor <b>diversion</b> <b>weirs</b> has significant detrimental ecological effects on the downstream river reaches. In the case whereby approximately 99 % of the Mean Annual Flow (MANF) has been diverted, the flow regulation has often resulted in a constriction in the river channel and a reduction in complexity of the aquatic and riparian vegetation and encroachment of terrestrial plant species. The Snowy River Increased Flows (SRIF) environmental flow program aims to return 21 % of the MANF to the Snowy River below Jindabyne. This revised flow regime attempts to re-introduce the hydrological cues such as seasonal flow patterns, annual floods and greater daily flow variability. In the case of the Snowy River, a higher magnitude annual flood was introduced to flush sediment and vegetation within the river channel and the more variable daily flow rate aims create a more natural and complex riparian and aquatic vegetated habitat. This study examined the changes in aquatic and riparian vegetation at two sites in the Dalgety Uplands macro-reach of the Snowy River using four band colour infra-red high-resolution aerial photography in 2007, 2010 and 2013. A supervised maximum likelihood classification to determine vegetation classes and post-classification change detection was used to quantify the vegetation changes. The results indicated than an increase in flow magnitude was able to create a more open water and aquatic habitats. Furthermore an increase in the frequency of inundation across the lower benches increased the abundance of flood tolerant amphibious species and removed water susceptible species. These changes are reflective {{of the importance of the}} moisture gradient in riparian zones and the zonation of riparian plant species is largely determined by the flow regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{reinstatement}} {{of natural}} flow regimes is a rapidly emerging issue in river restoration worldwide. In northern Victoria, Australia, efforts are presently underway {{to restore a}} natural, intermittent flow regime to several streams which have received perennial diversions for both irrigation and stock and domestic water-supplies for over 100 years. A pipeline to deliver water to landholders will significantly reduce transmission losses throughout the system allowing irrigation canals and <b>diversion</b> <b>weirs</b> to be decommissioned. The motivation for flow alteration in this system lies primarily in reducing inefficiencies in water delivery which, in turn, {{will be used to}} meet escalating demands on water resources. The ecological impact of the flow regime shift on these streams is likely to be substantial. This study utilized an existing artificial hydrological gradient (from perennial to intermittent) in two creek systems, to explore relationships between flow regime and a range of ecological variables. These data provide a benchmark against which to assess ecological changes once flow has been altered and form the basis for predicting changes that can assist future management decisions. Data collected from 10 sites across a strong hydrological gradient detected clear differences in geomorphology, water quality and biotic assemblages (macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish). By examining the relationship between flow regime and the distribution of biota we identify both the positive and negative outcomes of restoring naturally intermittent flow regimes within artificially perennial lowland streams. The reinstatement of intermittent flow regimes in artificially perennial streams will continue {{in many parts of the}} world as water delivery via these systems becomes increasingly uneconomical. While flow restoration may in principle be regarded as a positive step, these findings emphasize the need to consider fully the ecological consequences of restoring historical hydrological regimes to streams within the context of other human induced catchment disturbances.

40|$|Although spate {{irrigation}} systems are risk-prone, {{they can be}} an important component for livelihood security in semi-arid areas. Spate uses water (flood water), which upstream users often do not require, as rainfall during these periods is more than sufficient. The use of this flood water for spate irrigation is therefore a good opportunity to convert water with a low opportunity cost to high value water. As more rivers are closing, due to socio-economic and climate changes, spate irrigation may become increasingly relevant in semi-arid areas. Spate {{irrigation systems}} pose institutional and technical challenges: collective action is challenged by complex upstream-downstream interactions between users within the system, and the high labour demands for regular reconstruction of temporary <b>diversion</b> <b>weirs</b> and intake structures. This paper describes a spate irrigation system in Makanya village, Tanzania that emerged in response to increased upstream water use. We use three of the four dimensions (hydrological, hydraulic and sociological) of spate irrigation proposed by Van Steenbergen (1997) to assess the Makanya spate irrigation system. The Makanya spate irrigation system has an organisational structure that is similar to the canal irrigation (furrow) committees located upstream, and effectively deals with the institutional demands of managing water in spate irrigation systems. Water allocation is reminiscent to the water sharing arrangements existing in the full irrigation system, which previously was in place at the site and in the high- and midlands of the Makanya catchment and therefore set this system apart from the traditional spate irrigation practice elsewhere. Technically, a major challenge is the reconstruction of the head works after each flood. Another aspect is the changes in the river bed. Flash floods carry sediments that deposit on the fields, raising the elevation of the irrigated land every year and making it increasingly difficult for the river water to enter the plots. Improving system efficiency through modernisation of the diversion and distribution structures in this case is not feasible due to the huge amounts of sediments delivered to the system each year. Instead investments in conjunctive use of groundwater could be the solution because it involves a relatively small intervention, minimises the physical disturbance of the system, and therefore is likely to respect the existing locally developed water management arrangements.

40|$|The {{agricultural}} structure of modern Korean society {{is based on}} the cultivation of rice. However, the climatic and natural conditions of Korea were significantly different from those of Jiangnan, China or Kansai, Japan, where rice farming was well developed. As a result, rice farming in Korea followed a different route compared to the aforementioned regions. Securing irrigation facilities was most important, and a particular emphasis was put on early cultivation in order to overcome the seven to eight-month-long dry season during the winter and spring (October to May). The development of rice farming in Korea accelerated the development of the mountainous regions, where it was possible to construct <b>diversion</b> <b>weirs,</b> which were traditional irrigation facilities. As rice farming came to be closely associated with regional development, which became particularly prominent in the mountainous regions, sajok (hereditary yangban), or local elites, began to move from the plains and hilly regions, where they had originally resided, to the mountainous regions. Various aspects of premodern Korean society that became distinct after the mid- to late eighteenth century were different from those of China and Japan during the same period of time. The Chinese gentry and Japanese samurai generally resided in cities around the mid- to late seventeenth century. However, a closed regional structure in which agricultural villages ruled over cities was firmly instituted in Chosǒn. Behind the development of rice farming technologies and regional development, which created differences in the process of modernization in the three countries, were the differences in natural environment. Korea, which had the least suitable environment for rice farming, attempted to circumvent this environmental problem by developing the mountainous regions and adopting yiangbǒp (transplanting rice seedling), which {{led to the development of}} the mountainous regions and movement of local elites to agricultural villages. Local elites in agricultural villages abhorred and oppressed trade and craft, which threatened agricultural communities, and as a result, it was barely possible for merchants to flourish or for commercial capitalism to develop. This was the fundamental difference between Korea and Jiangnan, China or Japan. Due to the fact that Korea had the least favorable agricultural environment and geographic conditions among the three East Asian countries, and thus least developed commercial capitalism, Korea suffered the most in the process of modernization among the three nations, being annexed and colonized by Japanese Imperialism for 36 years (1910 ~ 1945) ...|$|R
40|$|Capture {{fisheries}} and aquaculture in Lao PDR {{are based on}} water resource ecosystems which consist mainly of rivers and streams, hydropower and irrigation reservoirs, <b>diversion</b> <b>weirs,</b> small water bodies, flood plains and wet-season rice-fields. The total area of water resources for capture fisheries {{is believed to be}} more than 1. 2 million ha. The estimated consumption of inland fish in Lao PDR is approximately 167, 922 tonnes per year while consumption of other aquatic animals is estimated at 40, 581 tonnes per year. Most of the consumption is from internal production (i. e. imports are of minor importance), so these figures represent approximate catches or yield from fisheries. These estimated yields are conservatively valued at almost US$ 150 million per year. The people of Lao PDR, especially in the rural communities that account for more than 75 per cent of the population, still depend upon the country's fish and other aquatic animals as their most reliable sources of animal protein. The estimate of actual fish consumption per capita (kg/capita/ year) of inland fish is 24. 5 kg, while other aquatic animals account for about 4. 1 kg and marine products around 0. 4 kg, to make a total of 29 kg of fish and aquatic products consumed per capita per year. As aquaculture in Lao PDR expands, many forms of production systems are being developed, for example pond culture, communal ponds, rice-cum-fish culture and cage culture. Most fish culture systems in Lao PDR are small-scale. Such forms of production systems are divided into sub-categories depending on the nature and main activity of the producers. According to the Department of Livestock and Fisheries, aquaculture production in 2007 accounted for 54, 750 tonnes in an area of more than 42, 000 ha, including cage culture in the Mekong and some tributaries. There has been a significant increase in intensive tilapia production in recent years in Lao PDR (MRC Technical Paper No. 5 April 2002) based on tilapia cage culture in the Mekong river and irrigation reservoirs. In last two years, an enterprising farmer has established about 360 cages. Constraints in the large-scale development of tilapia cage culture are the lack of technical support (e. g. extension services) to the farmers and insufficient supply of advanced fingerlings. Morever, tilapia cage culture in the Mekong river system is perceived to be difficult to sustain because of environmental factors such as river flooding and strong currents during the rainy season and the lack of water during the dry season...|$|R
