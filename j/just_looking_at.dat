500|$|... "Book of the Stranger" [...] was {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. He joined the series as a director in the sixth season. He also directed the previous episode, [...] "Oathbreaker". In an interview Sackheim commented on the Jon and Sansa reunion stating [...] "Sometimes as a director, you're <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> what's in front of you, and not {{taking into account the}} bigger picture and the epic nature of two siblings who have been separated for six seasons — and have never had scenes together, and were both really looking forward to it — reuniting. The only note I gave them during the scene was, [...] "Hold yourself back. As much as it's joyous to see each other, you're equally as scared. You don't know what to expect." [...] The operative word was fear. Fear of the unknown. In a way, it added to the emotional resonance of the scene." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{shot on the}} streets of Los Angeles and in a studio soundstage. It begins with Frusciante {{standing}} alone on a pedestal wearing a red-and-white-striped collared shirt, brown khaki pants, brown shoes, and a purple, green and multicolored chullo, with white stitched wolves in the middle. He plays a 1966 Ocean Turquoise Fender Jaguar behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted cloudy sky. His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Frusciante's then-girlfriend, Toni Oswald, selected his clothes that day. Frusciante remembers Van Sant's surprised, though favorable, reaction: [...] "when I got [...] Gus Van Sant was <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me and going 'God I'm so glad you wore that hat. I'm so glad you wore that shirt. Oh! Those pants are so great I'm so glad you wore those'". The video marks a significant shift in Frusciante's on-camera behavior; he no longer wished to jump around fervently as he had done in the band's prior music videos.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Ipswich, Ramsey began experimenting with a new style of play that would {{eventually}} lead to success in the World Cup and led to his England team being styled, [...] "The Wingless Wonders". As natural wingers were not always known for their defensive qualities, Ramsey started dropping them in favour of attacking midfielders who could also drop back into defensive roles. This system proved revolutionary as it often baffled opposing fullbacks, who would naturally {{expect to see a}} winger coming down the flank at them once the ball was kicked off: instead, the attacking midfielders and strikers were taking the ball through the middle of the defence and scoring. This style of play proved successful at Ipswich, but really showed its worth when England travelled to Spain to play a friendly with them before the World Cup. As Bobby Charlton remarked, [...] "The Spanish fullbacks were <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> each other while we were going in droves through the middle". To win in Spain, who were the reigning European Champions, was rare for an English team and was evidence that Ramsey's techniques were working.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as he puts it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... and the thing is, I'm <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear inside my head ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E
500|$|The band made {{extensive}} use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)" [...] feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and [...] "Let Down" [...] was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band {{to work at a}} different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that [...] "the biggest pressure was actually completing [...] We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff." [...] Yorke was satisfied with the quality of the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien was similarly pleased with the recordings, estimating that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: [...] "I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural.... Something special happens when you're playing live; {{a lot of it is}} <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen." [...] Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would [...] "start to think about it and it would sound really lame." ...|$|E

During the 1990s, Hopkins had the chance to work with Bart the Bear in two films: Legends of the Fall (1994) and The Edge (1997).

2500|$|Due to {{different}} standards of beauty {{for men and}} women, men are often not diagnosed as anorexic. Generally men who alter their bodies do so to be lean and muscular rather than thin. In addition, men who might otherwise be diagnosed with anorexia may not meet the DSM IV [...] criteria for BMI since they have muscle weight, but have very little fat. [...] Men and women athletes are often overlooked as anorexic. Research emphasizes the importance to take athletes' diet, weight and symptoms into account when diagnosing anorexia, [...] instead of <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> weight and BMI. For athletes, ritualized activities such as weigh-ins place emphasis on weight, which may promote the development of eating disorders among them. [...] While women use diet pills, which is an indicator of unhealthy behavior and an eating disorder, men use steroids, which contextualizes the beauty ideals for genders. This also shows men having a preoccupation with their body, which is an indicator of an eating disorder. In a Canadian study, 4% of boys in grade nine used anabolic steroids. Anorexic men are {{sometimes referred to as}} manorexic.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Gunther Schuller declared, [...] "On {{one point}} there is {{universal}} agreement: Tatum's awesome technique." [...] That technique {{was marked by}} a calm physical demeanor and efficiency. [...] Tatum did not indulge in theatrical physical or facial expression. [...] The effortless gliding of his hands over difficult passages baffled most who witnessed the phenomenon. [...] He especially astonished other pianists to whom Tatum appeared to be [...] "playing the impossible." [...] Even when playing scintillating runs at high velocity, it appeared that his fingers hardly moved. [...] Hank Jones said: When I finally met him and {{got a chance to}} hear him play in person, it seemed as if he wasn't really exerting much effort, he had an effortless way of playing. It was deceptive. You'd watch him and you couldn't believe what was coming out, what was reaching your ears. He didn't have that much motion at the piano. He didn’t make a big show of moving around and waving his hands and going through all sorts of physical gyrations to produce the music that he produced, so that in itself is amazing. There had to be intense concentration there, but you couldn’t tell by <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him play.|$|E

2500|$|While {{initially}} touted {{to return}} to Augusta State University for the 2011/12 season as late as 11 July 2011, Purser announced just three days later that he was unlikely to play another NCAA season. While Purser said he enjoyed his time with the Jaguars, he said it may be better for {{him to stay in}} Perth, citing [...] "At this stage it looks like I might be staying, just because academically my units that I've started back here [...] don't match up. I think, <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a number of factors, that I may be staying." [...] Soon after, Purser informed coach Dip Metress of his departure, after joining a shortlist of players fighting for the final spot on the Perth Wildcats roster – the most successful team in the National Basketball League (NBL). Joining Purser on the shortlist included three members of the Wildcats' 2010/11 extended squad – Greg Hire, Tom Jervis and Everard Bartlett. No matter the outcome, Wildcats coach Rob Beveridge guaranteed Purser involvement with the team in 2011/12, with the worst-case scenario being a development player role. Not to Purser's displeasure, on 11 August, Hire was awarded with the final roster spot. Purser was undeterred by the Wildcats' decision not to award the final spot to him, instead relishing the prospect of becoming an NBL development player. Purser appeared in 10 games for the Wildcats during the 2011/12 season, scoring a total of 20 points. Highlights for Purser included scoring 6 points in 5½ minutes against the New Zealand Breakers at home on 23 December 2011 in just his third NBL game; being nominated for the NBL's Round 23 Play of the Week for his athletic three-point play in the final period against the Cairns Taipans on 11 March 2012; and being nominated for the NBL Rookie of the Year Award. The Wildcats finished the regular season in second place with a 19–9 record and took down the third-seeded Gold Coast Blaze 2–1 in the semi-finals, with Purser seeing game time in Game 3 on 7 April 2012. The Wildcats went on face the New Zealand Breakers in the NBL Grand Final series, where they were defeated 2–1.|$|E
