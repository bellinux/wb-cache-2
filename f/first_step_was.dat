5|$|The Canary Islands were colonised in two waves. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the {{occupation}} of Tenerife and La Gomera 1.9–2.3 million years ago, followed by a separate invasion of El Hierro and La Palma 1.3–1.8 mya.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{a precise}} {{characterization}} of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the conic constant of the mirror as built was , instead of the intended −1.00230. The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, {{as well as by}} analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|Marshall and Nichols began {{assembling}} the resources they would need. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to obtain a}} high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although {{there was also a}} special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose. Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|Rubinstein's <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to found}} the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its {{objectives}} were {{to educate people}} in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to {{a considerable amount of}} Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to secure}} {{retirement}} benefits for custodians throughout the state. In 1928, {{just a year}} after CSEA formed, the union helped push through SB 551, which allowed school districts to establish retirement benefits for all school employees, not just teachers. More importantly, it became the first law on the books recognizing school employees other than teachers and administrators.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Dix {{helped raise}} funds for the {{national}} monument to deceased soldiers at Fortress Monroe. Following the war, she resumed her crusade to improve the care of prisoners, the disabled, and the mentally ill. Her <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to review the asylums and prisons in the South to evaluate the war damage to their facilities.|$|E

25|$|Through {{more than}} 70 {{years as a}} {{functional}} but neglected government building, the Palace fell into disrepair. After Hawaii became a state, Governor John A. Burns began an effort to restore the palace in the 1960s. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to move the former Iolani Barracks building from its original position northeast of the palace. It now serves as a visitors center for the palace.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2003 reforms {{subsidies}} {{have been}} linked to the size of farms, so farmers get the same for a hectare of land regardless of how much land they own. So while subsidies allow small farms to exist, large farms tend to get the larger share of the subsidies. With the 2008 Health Check of the CAP, a <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> taken towards limiting CAP payments to very large landowners.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{to connect}} Buenos Aires and the Fortines (fortresses) with {{telegraph}} lines. The government signed {{a peace treaty}} with chieftain Juan José Catriel. But he broke it a short time later, as together with chieftain Namuncurá and 3,500 warriors, he attacked Tres Arroyos, Tandil, Azul, and other towns and farms. The casualties were higher than in 1872: Catriel and Namuncurá's forces killed 400 settlers, captured 300, and drove off 300,000 head of cattle.|$|E

25|$|These {{goals for}} {{structural}} change could have improved {{the efficiency of}} resource allocation while doing {{a great deal to}} lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required both time and the ability to restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to stop the built-in inflationary process, but to do it without adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> {{undertaken}} {{with careful}} {{concern for the}} environment, including monitoring by specialized consultants, since the region has a rich archeological heritage. Among the hundreds of caverns in the region, the one at Lapa Vermelha stands out. Located 2.7km (1.6mi) from the airport, the oldest female cranium in the Americans was discovered there, dated at roughly 12 thousand years old. Confins is certified by the ISO 9001 standard, covering ten processes in the administrative, operational, safety/security and maintenance areas.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010, the Gorham's Cave complex was {{put forward}} {{to compete for}} a {{nomination}} as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Professor Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, was responsible for co-ordinating the efforts to obtain this nomination. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> a proposal to the United Kingdom cultural authorities to get Gorham's Cave complex added to the UK's World Heritage Tentative List. Such a list is revised every ten years, and the process for a new list was ongoing at {{the date of the}} submission.|$|E

25|$|The Church of the Presidents is {{the last}} {{remaining}} structure associated with all seven presidents who vacationed in Long Branch. In 1999 the Long Branch Historical Museum Association began fundraising efforts to save the building. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to stabilize the building {{to prevent it from}} collapsing. The wood flooring was removed and reinforced concrete was poured to support the building. Steel supports replaced wooden pilasters that had deteriorated. The stained-glass windows, original altar, organ, and handmade pews were removed and put in storage during renovation.|$|E
25|$|General Jan Christiaan Smuts, {{a member}} of the Imperial War Cabinet, was sent to confer with Allenby {{regarding}} the implementation of a French qualification to the War Office's Joint Note No. 12—that no troops from France could be redeployed to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Smuts was {{on his way back to}} London in February when the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> taken to accomplish his suggestion of crossing the Jordan River and capturing the Hedjaz Railway, and the front line was extended eastwards with the successful capture of Jericho.|$|E
25|$|In 1715 Swedenborg {{returned}} to Sweden, where he devoted himself to natural {{science and engineering}} projects {{for the next two}} decades. A <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> his meeting with King Charles XII of Sweden in the city of Lund, in 1716. The Swedish inventor Christopher Polhem, who became a close friend of Swedenborg, was also present. Swedenborg's purpose was to persuade the king to fund an observatory in northern Sweden. However, the warlike king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint Swedenborg assessor-extraordinary on the Swedish Board of Mines (Bergskollegium) in Stockholm.|$|E

25|$|After the 1930s, Dallas was {{controlled}} {{in all aspects}} by the Dallas Citizens Council, {{a group of about}} two hundred men who had both achieved unusual success in their careers and demonstrated an unusual willingness to work on projects they believed would help build a great city. In 1954 with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end racial segregation in public schools, the Citizens Council soon acknowledged that desegregation was inevitable, and they sought {{to make the best of}} it. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> the formation of the Biracial Committee. For the most part, the Citizens Council had already decided what to do, and the Biracial Committee helped get it done. They decided to prepare for school desegregation by desegregating the community bit by bit.|$|E
25|$|Loading a {{submarine}} was a lengthy process that took weeks. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to pump the forward ballast tanks empty which elevated the bow {{out of the}} water. Once it was dismantled, the ballast tanks were then filled to lower the bow and flood the well deck to allow the submarine to be winched aboard. The well deck's water-tight doors were then closed and {{the water in the}} dock was pumped overboard while the submarine settled onto its wooden bilge blocks. The bow was then reassembled and hatch covers were installed over the well deck. These prevented the ship from taking on water during a storm and allowed the crew to perform any necessary maintenance on the submarine while under way.|$|E
25|$|During the {{communist}} era, travelling to the West {{was a long}} process for Hungarian citizens. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> to obtain an invitation, preferably from a relative {{in the country to}} be visited, and a promise of full financial support. With such an invitation, and assuming he could get a passport, a Hungarian could travel westwards once a year. However, in the absence of such an invitation, he could travel to the West only once every three years. The Communist-era visa restrictions restricted Hungarian artists and musicians since it hindered their ability to travel abroad. As a result, many chose to leave Hungary and settle in the West, such as famed cellist János Starker, who emigrated to the United States in 1948 because it was impossible for him to tour abroad with a Hungarian passport.|$|E
