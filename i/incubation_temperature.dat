25|$|The order Legionellales {{comprises}} two families, Legionellaceae and Coxiellaceae. The family Legionellaceae {{includes the}} genera Legionella and relatives Fluoribacter and Sarcobium. The colonies that appeared around {{the third day}} in the CYE slants were grey and raised with a “ground-glass appearance". It was positive for both oxidase and catalase production. Strains of L. jordanis are thin, motile Gram-negative rods that {{range in size from}} 0.3 to 0.9µm wide by 2 to 20µm long. In addition, it is not encapsulated or nonspore-forming. After being stained with Sudan B, many of the cells did not have fat deposits. Gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry show that all known species of Legionella contain large amounts of branched-chain fatty acids. DNA that was unlabeled from BL-540 was tested against labeled DNAs from the six recognized Legionella species. When reactions were performed at an <b>incubation</b> <b>temperature</b> of 60°C, relatedness of BL-540 to the other DNAs were between 4 and 20%. When reactions were performed at a higher <b>incubation</b> <b>temperature</b> of 75°C, the relatedness ranged from 0 to 10%. The results indicated that L. jordanis was a new species. The two strains, BL-540 and ABB-9, were almost identical when DNA relatedness reactions were performed at both 60 and 75°C.|$|E

25|$|Crocodiles, most {{sea turtles}} and some lizards control {{offspring}} gender by manipulating {{the temperature of}} the developing eggs' environment; i.e. they do not have distinct sex chromosomes. Live-bearing reptiles do not regulate sex through <b>incubation</b> <b>temperature.</b> A study in 2009, which examined 94 living species of reptiles, birds and mammals, found that the genetic control of sex appears to be crucial to live birth. It was concluded that with marine reptiles such control predated viviparity and was an adaptation to the stable sea-climate in coastal regions. Genetics likely controlled sex in ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs and plesiosaurs.|$|E
25|$|The {{green sea}} turtles exhibit sex {{differences}} by their development and appearance. As adult turtles, males are easily distinguishable from the females {{by having a}} larger tail and longer claws on the front flippers. The hatching time and sex of the turtles {{are determined by the}} <b>incubation</b> <b>temperature</b> of the nest. Hatchings occur more quickly in nests that are warmer than nests that are in cooler conditions. Warm nesting sites above 30 degrees Celsius favor the development of females, whereas nesting sites below 30 degrees Celsius produce males. The position of the egg in the nest also affects sex-determination. Eggs in the center tend to hatch as females due to the warmer conditions within the nest.|$|E
500|$|Hatchlings {{range in}} color from light brown to almost black, lacking the adult's {{distinct}} yellows and reds. Upon hatching, they measure about [...] and weigh about [...] The eggs are typically {{laid on the}} beach in an area above the high-tide line. The eggs are laid near the water so the hatchlings can return to the sea. The loggerhead's sex is dictated by the temperature of the underground nest. Incubation temperatures generally range from 26-32°C (79-90°F). Sea turtle eggs kept at a constant incubating temperature of 32°C become females. Eggs incubating at 28°C become males. An <b>incubation</b> <b>temperature</b> of 30°C results in an equal ratio of male to female hatchlings. Hatchlings from eggs {{in the middle of the}} clutch tend to be the largest, grow the fastest, and be the most active during the first few days of sea life.|$|E
40|$|Offspring {{phenotype}} {{is strongly}} influenced by the environmental conditions experienced early in ontogeny when embryos are rapidly organizing physiological systems. Numerous evolutionary theories posit that processes that match offspring phenotype to their environment can enhance survival and fitness into adulthood. Importantly, the phenotype that is most beneficial for a given environment often differs between sexes. Turtles with temperature-dependent sex determination are a powerful system in which to investigate how early environmental conditions impact offspring phenotype and sex because these traits are affected by both maternally derived steroids and <b>incubation</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The following research focuses on how natural variation in maternal steroids and fluctuating <b>incubation</b> <b>temperatures</b> affect offspring behavior and sex. In Trachemys scripta hatchlings, behavioral types consisting of repeatable and correlated behaviors exist, and are robust to maternal steroids and <b>incubation</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Conversely, offspring sex is affected by both maternal steroid levels and fluctuating <b>incubation</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Late season clutches have higher concentrations of maternally derived estrogens {{and are more likely}} to produce female hatchlings. This seasonal increase in female biased sex ratios is exacerbated by subtle increases in diurnally fluctuating <b>incubation</b> <b>temperatures,</b> as would occur across the nesting season. Embryos are sensitive to brief exposures to warm <b>incubation</b> <b>temperatures,</b> which mimic heat waves, with a seasonal pattern in the sensitivity where late season eggs produce more females at any given heat wave duration. Embryos in three climatically disparate populations of T. scripta respond similarly to heat waves during incubation. Models derived from the empirical studies, which were designed to predict sex ratios based on thermal variability, perform better than models based on temperature aggregation methods (e. g. average). Taken together, these data underscore the importance of considering biologically meaningful variation and provide insight into how phenotype is affected by early developmental conditions. The results shed light onto how sex is determined in nature in species with TSD, ultimately informing their conservation and management in rapidly changing environments...|$|R

2500|$|A major {{challenge}} in bisulfite sequencing is {{the degradation of}} DNA that takes place concurrently with the conversion. The conditions necessary for complete conversion, such as long incubation times, elevated temperature, and high bisulfite concentration, {{can lead to the}} degradation of about 90% of the incubated DNA. [...] Given that the starting amount of DNA is often limited, such extensive degradation can be problematic. The degradation occurs as depurinations resulting in random strand breaks. Therefore, the longer the desired PCR amplicon, the more limited the number of intact template molecules will likely be. This could lead to the failure of the PCR amplification, or the loss of quantitatively accurate information on methylation levels resulting from the limited sampling of template molecules. Thus, it is important to assess the amount of DNA degradation resulting from the reaction conditions employed, and consider how this will affect the desired amplicon. Techniques {{can also be used to}} minimize DNA degradation, such as cycling the <b>incubation</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E

50|$|He is {{a pioneer}} in the {{relatively}} new field (actually rebirth) of phenotypic plasticity, or the process by which the environment induces different phenotypes from a given genotype. When considering that species without sex chromosomes possess all of the genes necessary to develop the phenotype of both sexes, it becomes apparent that the process of sex determination and sexual differentiation represents a form of phenotypic plasticity. Using the leopard gecko (E. macularius) as the animal model system, Dr. Crews determined how the experience of temperature during a narrowly defined period of embryogenesis affects the total phenotype of the adult organism, accounting for much of the variation observed among individuals in morphology, growth, endocrinology, neural activity, and neuroanatomy.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: {{to explore}} the effect of low <b>incubation</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the {{consequent}} slowing of bacterial metabolism on the bactericidal action of anti-tuberculosis drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: counting of surviving bacteria during exposure of static cultures to 1 mg/L isoniazid, 2 mg/L rifampicin, 0. 5 or 2 mg/L TMC 207 and 40 or 160 mg/L pyrazinamide, usually for periods of 21 days at temperatures of 37, 25, 22, 19, 16 or 8 °C. RESULTS: the bactericidal activities of isoniazid and rifampicin were progressively reduced at 25 and 22 °C, and were minimal at lower temperatures. TMC 207 was immediately bactericidal at 37 °C, {{in contrast to the}} early static phase reported with log phase cultures, and showed less change in activity as <b>incubation</b> <b>temperatures</b> were reduced than did rifampicin or isoniazid. Pyrazinamide was more bactericidal when <b>incubation</b> <b>temperatures</b> were reduced below 37 °C and when the static seed cultures were most dormant. CONCLUSIONS: these results {{can be explained by the}} surmise that at low temperatures bacterial energy is at a low level with only just sufficient ATP to maintain homeostasis, making the bacteria more susceptible to the blocking of ATP synthesis by TMC 207.
