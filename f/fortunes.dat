50|$|The <b>Fortune</b> 500 is {{an annual}} list {{compiled}} {{and published by}} <b>Fortune</b> magazine that ranks 500 of the largest United States corporations by total revenue for their respective fiscal years.

5|$|Another {{possibility}} {{was suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians {{for at least some}} of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's <b>fortunes</b> were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's <b>fortunes</b> were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the idea that Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the idea that Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{appointment}} of Herbert Chapman in 1925 that Arsenal had their first period of major success; Chapman modernised and reformed the club's practices and tactics, and under him and his successor George Allison (who took over after Chapman's death in January 1934), Arsenal won five First Division titles and two FA Cups in the 1930s. After the Second World War, Tom Whittaker continued the success, leading the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup. After Whittaker's death Arsenal's <b>fortunes</b> gradually declined; by 1966, they were in mid-table obscurity and had not won a trophy in thirteen years.
