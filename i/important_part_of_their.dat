5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.|$|E
5|$|Snowfall can be {{beneficial}} to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator, conserving {{the heat of the}} Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop growth, both directly and via runoff through streams and rivers, which supply irrigation canals. The following are examples of rivers that rely on meltwater from glaciers or seasonal snowpack as an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> flow on which irrigation depends: the Ganges, many of whose tributaries rise in the Himalayas and which provide much irrigation in northeast India, the Indus River, which rises in Tibet and provides irrigation water to Pakistan from rapidly retreating Tibetan glaciers, and the Colorado River, which receives much of its water from seasonal snowpack in the Rocky Mountains and provides irrigation water to some 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares).|$|E

5|$|US {{cast members}} Kevin Clash and Marty Robinson have cast and trained the {{international}} puppeteers. At first, Muppet builder Kermit Love constructed the puppets {{for the new}} shows in the US. According to Gikow in 2009, Jim Henson's Creature Shop, overseen by Connie Peterson, has taken over puppet creation. The producers of Sisimpur, the Bangladesh co-production, created their own traditional puppets because their puppet-making craft is thousands of years old and an <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> culture. The producers of each co-production developed and built their own sets, live-action videos, and animations in-country. After they developed, produced, and aired the new show, they conducted research to ascertain whether their curriculum goals were met, just as {{was done in the}} US after the first season of Sesame Street. According to producer Nadine Zylstra, they faced unusual challenges rarely experienced in the US. For example, riots and conflicts between Serbs and Albanians in 2004 delayed production of the Kosovo co-production for three months. In 2005, a nationwide strike in Bangladesh temporarily stalled production of their show.|$|E

40|$|Suspects {{awaiting}} trial often {{claim that they}} cannot remember <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> violent crimes. It is not unusual that forensic experts readily accept such claims and interpret {{them in terms of}} dissociative amnesia or, more specifically, a red-out. This interpretation hinges on the assumption that heightened levels of stress implicated in violent crimes interfere with memory. We argue that the notion of red-out is a priori not plausible and that alternative interpretationsprimarily malingering and substance-induced organic amnesiashould be considered and ruled out first before concluding that memory loss is dissociative in nature. We illustrate our point with four cases that superficially have thecontours of red-out tragedies. We believe that, in such cases, neuropsychological tests and/or psychopharmacological information on dose-response relationships can assist forensic experts to exclude malingering or substance-induced amnesia. There is no reason for not using tests and tools from neuropsychology and psychopharmacology...|$|R
30|$|Although we {{have used}} here formal {{education}} and employment status as a straightforward marker of class position, the focus on CARs entails that peoples’ incorporated forms of capital or “habitus” (ways of thinking, saying and acting) are equally <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> class position (Bourdieu, 1986). These habitual dispositions are acquired and reproduced in social contexts and guide peoples’ orientation of practice (Bourdieu, 1990), which is imbued by intersectional hierarchies. The interplay between class and gender {{is the most important}} for this work. The amassed forms of capital, which cluster into certain class positions, are usually inherent to the nation-states, with concomitant forms of recognition and value. As a result, migration may mean that cultural capital is devalued (Weiss, 2005) and gender norms diverge (Amelina, 2013), often effectively limiting parents’ and children’s future life chances (Pratt, 2012). In this view, many CARs cannot be simply transferred from one country to the other (Erel & Ryan, 2018; Nowicka, 2014).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a case for a new {{generation}} of research on the question of school choice. This case is based on two premises. First, it is likely that taxpayers, who have school aged children and taxpayers who don't, differ with respect to their preferences concerning education. Since al taxpayers must decide on whether and how much school choice should be allowed, it is important to see how these preferences intersect with respect to both educational and extracurricular outputs of the educational process. Second, any policy decision focuses on maximizing a set of goals given a series of constraints. Therefore, it is necessary to examine all aspects of the school choice question simultaneously in order to make incisive policy recommendations. This paper presents a simple economic model which shows the importance of these premises in the policy decision and suggests that the next generation of researchers should consider these premises as <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> investigation. ...|$|R

40|$|What {{was once}} classed as 'savage ornament', {{which could not}} {{possibly}} register as architecture, has today morphed into the stuff of 'iconic architecture'. From another perspective, {{what began as a}} whare tupuna or a fale tele has sometimes turned into curios, for a time only or for ever. Along with the changes in status, these houses also changed their performative roles. This paper briefly traces the journeys abroad of Māori whare and Samoan fale, in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which were designed for purposes other than that <b>of</b> <b>their</b> destinations, and some fale and whare that were designed to travel abroad in the 1960 s and early 2000 s.

40|$|Cultural {{industry}} {{workers at}} times compromise {{the values and}} tastes that are <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> artistic identities to accommodate commercial demands. I argue that workers resolve frustrations that arise from such compromises through identity work, individuals’ active construction <b>of</b> <b>their</b> identities in social contexts. Using ethnographic data from fieldwork at a reality television production company, I describe two identity work strategies, distancing and evaluative tweaking, that workers use to maintain their artistic integrity despite producing work that does not meet <b>their</b> standards <b>of</b> quality. The manner through which these strategies emerged during micro social interaction differed between managers and non-managers. Managers used distancing and evaluative tweaking to simultaneously do identity work and regulate their employees’ identities when justifying decisions that threatened shared values and tastes. On the other hand, employees distanced themselves from managers while venting to colleagues about managers’ decisions that conflicted with their idiosyncratic values and tastes. These dynamics are illustrated through a setting that has received insufficient ethnographic attention, reality television production. Some reality television workers prefer to portray “real” and “authentic” situations. These workers employ identity work strategies to maintain artistic integrity when distorting reality to create the drama and conflict they consider marketable...|$|R
