The {{stress of the}} study is placed on the control elements found in small purchase procedures. It is noted that the simplification of procedures desirable for these types of purchases has been complicated by an excess of control and an overabundance of documentation. The thesis identifies areas for future study leading to increased efficiency in small purchasing. Buying techniques investigated are the Blanket Purchase Agreement, the <b>Imprest</b> <b>Fund,</b> the Purchase Order and Fast Payment Procedures. Recommendations are made for both immediate and long-range improvement of the small purchasing system. [URL] Supply Corps, United States Nav...|$|E

The manner in which the material requisition billing process was conducted before and after IDA implementation is reviewed. The primary goal of Project IDA was the improvement in the timeliness and accuracy of financial information The specific purpose of the thesis is to determine whether or not IDA goals are being achieved. This thesis resolved that the initial IDA implementation achieved those goals with respect to procurement and to blanket purchase agreements. Additional procedures are required which will include <b>imprest</b> <b>fund</b> and referral transactions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} the impact on workload redistribution resulting from the use of government credit cards at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). Because workload requirements, particularly the Supply Department's, may have been redistributed across other departments at NPS, these will be identified and measured. Primary data on procurement cases was collected from the Comptroller's Department and the procurement branch of the Supply Department. Pre-credit card procedures (purchase orders, BPAs and the <b>Imprest</b> <b>Fund)</b> and related purchase action volume were identified and measured, as well as government credit card procurement procedures and related purchase action volume. The intent is to identify any workload requirements, such as technical screening, procurement and material receipt, which may have been redistributed as a result of using government credit cards.

The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to analyze the cost effectiveness of the government-wide credit card within the Naval PostGraduate Procurement Department. The intent {{of the study is}} to review current management policies relating to the credit card program, analyze the small procurement process and make recommendation on the usage of credit card at Naval PostGraduate School. A questionnaire and cost benefit analysis was developed to explain the credit card at the NPS and compare the BPA, purchase order and <b>imprest</b> <b>fund</b> with the credit card. Cardholders and authorizing officials are the operators in this system and were the respondents in the questionnaire. The thrust of the study is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the small procurement division {{in the area of the}} credit card use. By identifying the cost and benefits of the credit card and other procurement programs, the NPS small procurement division will have the information necessary to determine which method of procurement is most cost effective for a particular purchase...|$|E
