I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy.

I {{must be able to}} illustrate either their activities, their emotions, or their changes in mood by the way they dance, all the while keeping the dance movements footed in reality and yet making the movements sort of odd and eccentric." [...] This philosophy was reflected in the early scene from The Band Wagon, when Fred Astaire walks down a railroad platform singing [...] "By Myself."

[...] Cissé underlined the importance of scoring twice with speculation rife: [...] "It is clear scoring two goals in the Super Cup is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> {{because there has been}} a lot of speculation about me of late and about my position within the club." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher stated the importance of the two goals for Cissé: [...] "Cissé wanted to prove a point – he wanted to show everyone what he can do and great credit to him.

[...] Wilson continued, [...] "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor." [...] Amanat added, As much as Islam is a part of Kamala’s identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's about what happens when you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms your sense of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of the many ways she defines herself.|$|E

The player, on as a substitute, {{received}} the ball from Tony Adams and with his back to goal [...] "some 20 yards out", turned and curled it past goalkeeper Paul Jones.

500|$|One week later, despite {{signing a}} {{contract}} extension with Marseille, Nasri was linked with a move to Premier League club Arsenal. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger had been tracking Nasri since watching him play at the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. It was later revealed that the contract extension Nasri signed with Marseille was simply protocol to allow Marseille to receive a higher transfer fee for the player. The Bouches-du-Rhône-based club was seeking £14million for the young midfielder. Ahead of UEFA Euro 2008, both Nasri's agent and Wenger admitted that offers were made for the player and that a move to the English club was imminent. The deal was ultimately concluded following the competition on 11 July 2008 with Nasri agreeing to a four-year contract. The transfer fee was undisclosed, but has been purported {{to be in the}} region of £12million. Upon arriving at the club, Nasri admitted Wenger was one of the primary reasons for him joining the club: [...] "The fact that Arsène Wenger gives great opportunities to young players is very <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Arsène has a great reputation and {{he is one of the}} best managers in the world." ...|$|E

Songs on the album, {{with the exception}} of [...] "What'll I Do", were written by Janet Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and mixed by Steve Hodge and Dave Rideau; [...] "What'll I Do" [...] was written and produced by Jackson and Jellybean Johnson. Jackson took a larger role in songwriting and production than she did on her previous albums. She explained that [...] "ll my records are personal, and janet, is the most personal of them all. That's why this time around it was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to write all the lyrics and half of the melodies." [...] Jam described the record as being [...] "a more mature album musically." [...] David Ritz noted that Jackson and her producers took risks by experimenting with musical influences that had not appeared in their previous work. He explained: [...] "She asked Kathleen Battle and Public Enemy's Chuck D to contribute—an opera diva and a hardcore rapper, two artists one would not associate with Janet—and somehow pulled if off. Beyond Jam and Lewis, there's now a recognizable Janet Jackson production style that's gutsy and, in some cases, even eccentric." ...|$|E

"Looking back on Herakles today, I {{find the}} film rather stupid and pointless, {{though at the}} time it was an <b>important</b> test <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> It taught me about editing {{together}} very diverse material that would not normally sit comfortably as a whole. For the film I took stock footage of an accident at Le Mans where something like eighty people died after fragments of a car flew into the spectators' stand, and inter-cut it with footage of bodybuilders, including Mr. Germany 1962. <b>For</b> <b>me</b> it was fascinating to edit material together that had such separate and individual lives.

While Bubblegum is resistant to embrace magical ways of thinking, by the episode's end, she realizes that [...] "magic has its uses". Moynihan later noted on his personal website that, [...] "in helping to write the episode, it wasn’t <b>important</b> (<b>for</b> <b>me)</b> to impart an idea of who is right or wrong about magic and science {{in the land of}} Ooo. It was important to impart the idea of a complex and contradictory fantasy." [...] He later argued that using the [...] "science v. religion" [...] debate to backdrop an episode was enjoyable because it allowed him to have [...] "fun with both sides of the perspective spectrum." [...] Likewise, Wellmann thought the show's willingness to explore weighty subjects is one of the ways the show has been so successful. He wrote, [...] "one of the biggest strengths of Adventure Time [...] that it’s bold to explore topics like [...] science v. religion in a non-judging, open-minded way." ...|$|E
500|$|Early breaker Denifl {{was alone}} in front and had about two minutes of an {{advantage}} with [...] to go.

Pinot launched an attack from the group, but Špilak had the resources {{to keep up with}} him for a while but was ultimately dropped. Pinot passed the passive Denifl before the arch signaling the last kilometer (flamme rouge) and took a solo victory. Pozzovivo finished second while Špilak settled for third. However, it became soon apparent that Dumoulin would not lose much more than the minute and a half that was his objective. He passed the line 1' 37" [...] down on Pinot. [...] "I'm very happy, it was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and the team. We came here to win a stage, and I had good legs today.

He also rejected calls from the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Canada to stop all protests in Ottawa. Cannon condemned the LTTE for preventing civilians from leaving areas being attacked and using them as human shields. Bev Oda and the Conservative Party of Canada both condemned the use of LTTE flags, insisting that they symbolize connection with a terrorist organization. David Miller and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty also condemned the Gardiner Expressway blockade. Liberal Party of Canada leader Michael Ignatieff had made statements on the protests in a few occasions. Ignatieff urged the Harper government to break its silence and take initiative in condemning the violence. He stated {{that there are no}} military solutions to the conflict and that the war must stop under a worldwide initiative and internationally coordinated diplomatic strategy. On 21 April, Ignatieff met with a few Tamil leaders in Ottawa to discuss the humanitarian crisis. On the occasion, he said the following: [...] "I am deeply concerned about escalating violence in Sri Lanka, and the resulting deaths of thousands of civilians. It was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to hear from Tamil Canadians, whose family and friends in Sri Lanka are suffering first hand from this crisis.
