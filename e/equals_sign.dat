40|$|Thesis (MEd (Education)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. Numerical and {{algebraic}} equations {{require understanding}} of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> as an equivalence relation. Teachers and learners, however, often have an operational, rather than a relational, {{understanding of the}} <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> This conception {{is viewed as a}} misconception. This study investigates the extent to which Grade 6 learners at a particular school have this and other misconceptions regarding equality, with the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> as focus. It also investigates this school’s Grade 1 to 6 teachers’ specialised content knowledge (SCK) regarding equality, again focusing on the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> Ultimately the study wishes to establish whether there might be a possible relationship between the level of these teachers’ SCK of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> and learners’ misconceptions of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> In particular, it tries to answer the question whether teachers’ SCK of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> could possibly promote or prevent the forming of such misconceptions in learners, as well as whether teachers’ SCK of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> could possibly help them identify learners’ misconceptions and help learners form the correct conceptions. This research project is framed within an interpretive paradigm. It focuses on one school taking the form of a theory-led case study in which a mixed method approach is used. Data collection methods include teacher questionnaires followed by two focus group interviews with teachers, based on data collected from questionnaires. In addition, data is collected through a series of lesson observations on number concepts and assessment. Grade 6 learners answered a set of questions structured {{in the form of a}} test to investigate their understanding of equality and the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> Six learners were purposefully selected, based on their answers to the questions, and interviewed. Although this school is a high-performing academic school, results indicate that few learners have a flexible operational or basic relational view of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> The same group of learners that struggle with closure seems to struggle with the misconception of using all the numbers in an equation to solve a particular equation. The majority of Grade 6 learners cannot define the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> correctly. According to results, the nature of Grade 1 - 6 teachers’ SCK of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> shows that teachers lack skills to prevent, reduce or correct misconceptions about the <b>equal</b> <b>sign...</b>|$|R

The author argues for the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> to be accorded equal status and attention as the addition and subtraction symbols by both the curriculum and Grade 1 textbooks and also makes an argument for the introduction of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> first (using appropriate pictorial representations and artefacts) before the introduction of the plus and minus signs...|$|R

30|$|The {{improved}} performance on equivalence problems {{in both groups}} has important implications, {{particularly with respect to}} relational thinking, as researchers have previously argued that students who struggle to understand the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> appear to engage in meaningless computations instead of reflecting on the relationships that exist between numbers [17, 20]. As such, without viewing the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> symbol as a relational one, further relational thinking can be impeded. We speculate that the students in our study improved their understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> because they were encouraged to create equivalent and more manageable expressions when attempting to solve mental mathematics problems. For example, without the explicit use of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign,</b> students could transform 49 [*]+[*] 51 into the equivalent expression  50 [*]+[*] 50, thereby making the expression more manageable to solve mentally. Despite the fact that the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> was not demonstrated while such mathematical transformations were shared and discussed during the intervention, the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> is implicit in this transformation, as the two expressions are equivalent and each can be substituted for the other [18].|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate pre-service teachers and student misconceptions of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign,</b> and then offer suggestions to pre-service teachers, teachers, university programs, and schools to prevent common misconceptions from occurring in classrooms. Some students do not realize the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> can have two different functions, operational and relational. There are several different reasons for this misconception, beginning {{with the lack of}} defining what the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> is and what it means in the classroom. In the first study, eighteen participants were interviewed to explain their responses when evaluating student work to gain an in-depth knowledge of pre-service teachers' perceptions of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> and their ability to evaluate a students' response to a specific math task. Results showed that pre-service teachers {{have a better understanding of}} the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> and may be ready to teach the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> as a relationship between numbers. Furthermore, pre-service teachers would benefit greatly from evaluating students' work and looking for common misperceptions that students may have. In the second study, six fifth grade classes were studied to determine if there was a positive relationship for teaching atypical type equivalence statements to students and performing better on equivalence questions. Three classes from Spring 2011, were administered a test; two of the test items were used to analyze their understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> In Fall 2011, another three fifth grade classes participated in lessons, which required students to analyze atypical type equivalence statements, and then they were given the same two test items. Results from this study supported the use of atypical type equivalence statements because more students in the experimental group correctly responded to the two items and were also able to justify their responses with work that exemplified good understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> as being a relationship. Both of these studies support increasing student and pre-service teachers understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> and the misconceptions students have regarding the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> University programs and schools should utilize these results to require preservice teachers and teachers to evaluate student work to identify common misconceptions and teach the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> as a relationship between both sides and not as an operation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of two different policies for implementing new mathematics standards in two schools, for grades two through five, on student understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> The study also examined teachers’ knowledge of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> The research used a mixed methods design to explore differences in student understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> as a result of how standards were implemented in two adjoining states with two different decisions as to when the standards would be implemented. This dissertation shares research that may be of interest to teachers, administrators, teacher educators and other stakeholders. The main constructs under investigation were student understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign,</b> teacher knowledge regarding the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> including how it is taught and assessed, and the impact of different implementation schedules for new mathematics standards on student performance on their knowledge of the meaning of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> - a standard that was not previously explicit in either state. The study was conducted in two adjoining Midwestern states in three separate schools (fifth grade students from one of the states are housed in a middle school building for overcrowding reasons and are equivalent to fifth grade students in an elementary setting). Each school as per their state mandates, followed the timeline for new mathematics standards implementation with one school in the fourth year of implementation and the other two (same district) in their first year. The sample was 1, 182 students in second, third, fourth and fifth grade and their forty-two classroom teachers. Students and teachers from the three schools were given the Mathematical Equivalence Knowledge Assessment (MEKA) as a measurement of teacher knowledge and student understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> Data from teacher interviews and surveys were used to complement findings related to their students’ understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> and their classroom practices related to this topic. A hierarchical linear model was used to detect differences between student scores on the MEKA in each school in the two states. To determine the impact of teacher knowledge of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> on student understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> an unconditional hierarchical linear model and a follow up ANCOVA were conducted using the MEKA results from both teacher and student participants. The same model was also used to detect significant differences found between student scores on the MEKA in one state and student scores on the MEKA from another state where each state followed a different timeline for new standard implementation. Findings from the study reveal that the different timeline for the implementation of the mathematics standards in the two states appears to have an impact on students’ understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> and indicated that teacher knowledge was not a significant predictor of student understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> However, the results also show that state implementation timeline and a students’ grade level were significant predictors of student understanding of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> Through the interviews teachers were also found to have difficulty predicting their students’ performance on the MEKA, had varying definitions of the meaning of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign,</b> and many suggested that they did not explicitly teach or assess the meaning of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign...</b>|$|R

We describe how the children constructed different meanings for the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> in each setting. It appears {{that the nature of}} the meaning constructed is highly dependent on specificities of the task design and the tools available. In particular, the microworld offers the potential for children to adopt a meaning of equivalence for the <b>equal</b> <b>sign.</b> CHILDREN’S PERCEPTIONS OF THE <b>EQUAL</b> <b>SIGN</b> There exist “two intuitive meanings of equality among preschoolers ” that correspond to equivalence and operation (Kieran, 1981). When conceived of as an operator the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> would be expected to generate an answer from a sum. In contrast, when conceived of as equivalence the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> would be regarded as a static relation between two expressions that are the same in value. However school children attend to the operator meaning more readily than equivalence (Behr et al, 1980). The reasons for this have been identified by Ginsburg (1977) as based in the way the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> is encountered in the classroom. Invariabl...|$|R

Instead, they perceive the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> as an indication that a particular procedure is to be performed. As students mature, and as their exposure to the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> and equality relations in multiple contexts increases, most obtain the ability to interpret the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> as an indicator of an equivalence relation. Incorrect usages of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign,</b> however, by post-algebra students indicate a tendency for students to regress back to a comprehension of the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> as an operator symbol or to ignore the <b>equal</b> <b>sign</b> altogether. The purpose of this project was to develop an instrument that is relevant to objectives associated with the interpretation of the equals relation, and to perform a test reliability analysis to assess measurement reliability and construct validity for the instrument. The model that was utilized to develop items for the instrument followed a general item development and validity assessment model proposed by Cangelosi. This model requires an iterative process that includes a peer review of objectives and instrument items by a panel of experts and a revision of the items based upon recommendations from the panel. A pilot test was synthesized from the revised items and administered to a group of subjects, and an instrument reliability analysis and an item efficiency analysis were performed.
