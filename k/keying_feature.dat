50|$|Pin {{temperature}} is measured where the pin projects from the engagement surface. The maximum permitted pin temperatures, are 70 °C, 120 °C, and 155 °C, respectively (the higher temperatures {{are not applicable}} to interconnection couplers). The pin {{temperature is}} determined by the design of the appliance, and its interior temperature, rather than by its ambient temperature. Typical applications with increased pin temperatures include appliances with heating coils such as ovens or electric grills. It is generally possible to use a connector with a higher rated temperature with a lower rated appliance inlet, but the <b>keying</b> <b>feature</b> of the inlet prevents use of a connector with a lower temperature rating.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{connector}} contacts {{are typically}} Beryllium copper (BeCu) or Phosphor bronze {{which is then}} plated with gold or some other non-corrosive, highly-conductive metal. The contacts are contained by a dielectric insulator (typically a layered construct of various polymers or glass depending upon connector series and manufacturer, and often known as the insert) and are housed in an enclosure (i.e., shell), that is often die-cast aluminum and plated or anodized for corrosion protection. The contacts may be captive or removable using a special tool. The electrical connection into the system at the contact terminal is either a soldered or crimped connection. The seal between the shell and insert may be moisture resistant or a hermetic seal. The inserts in each connector half must be oriented for correct mating, and the shell or insert usually contains a <b>keying</b> <b>feature</b> to prevent mis-mating that could damage the connector or result in an electrical problem. Cable clamps and other mounting hardware may be provided, and the mated halves are usually secured by a locking mechanism to prevent disengagements.|$|E

40|$|According to Gibson (1962) {{fixation}} on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters {{has a major}} role in the development of emergent literacy. But it was still unknown which role <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters had on children who can’t read or write conventional. The following hypotheses where tested in this research: ‘Do 4 -year old children fixate more on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters than 3 -year old children?’, ‘Do 4 -year old children fixate longer on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters than 3 -year old children?’, ‘Mediates letter knowledge the relation number of fixations on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters and emergent writing?’ and ‘Mediates letter knowledge the relation fixation time on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters and emergent writing?’ In this research 75 4 -year old and 104 3 -year old children participated. The Tobii eye tracker x 2 - 60 recorded the fixation count and duration on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters. Besides using the eye tracker device, a letter knowledge task has been taken. At the same time a test was taken to determine the stage of emergent writing. The first task of the letter perception test was not significant (P >. 05). But there was a significant difference between the 3 - and 4 -year old and the second task fixation count on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters, t (171) = - 2. 05, p =. 042. A significant difference between the 3 - and 4 -year old was shown on the second task fixation duration on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters, t (171) = - 2. 83, p =. 005. Additionally can be concluded that letter knowledge (p <. 01) mediates significant between the first and second task fixation duration and the first and second task fixation count on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters and emergent writing. Concluding, from the early childhood letter {{fixation on}} <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters has influence on the further development of emergent literacy...|$|R
40|$|The kidneys {{are very}} vital organs. Failing kidneys lose {{their ability to}} filter out waste products, {{resulting}} in kidney disease. To extend or {{save the lives of}} patients with impaired kidney function, kidney replacement is typically utilized, such as hemodialysis. This work uses an entropy function to identify <b>key</b> <b>features</b> related to hemodialysis. By identifying these <b>key</b> <b>features,</b> one can determine whether a patient requires hemodialysis. This work uses these <b>key</b> <b>features</b> as dimensions in cluster analysis. The <b>key</b> <b>features</b> can effectively determine whether a patient requires hemodialysis. The proposed data mining scheme finds association rules of each cluster. Hidden rules for causing any kidney disease can therefore be identified. The contributions and key points of this paper are as follows. (1) This paper finds some <b>key</b> <b>features</b> {{that can be used to}} predict the patient who may has high probability to perform hemodialysis. (2) The proposed scheme applies k-means clustering algorithm with the <b>key</b> <b>features</b> to category the patients. (3) A data mining technique is used to find the association rules from each cluster. (4) The mined rules can be used to determine whether a patient requires hemodialysis...|$|R

A third <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> of the future processor is a dual decoder front-end that dramatically reduces start-up delays found in most software-translation implementations. Because of its dominance in the marketplace, the x 86 ISA is employed for describing and evaluating the future processor. 1...|$|R

The theoretical foundations of such integrated service models are described by the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care, which distinguishes six integration dimensions (clinical, professional, organisational, system, functional and normative integration). The aim {{of the present study}} is to refine the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care by developing a taxonomy that specifies the underlying <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of the six dimensions. Methods:  First, a literature review was conducted to identify features for achieving integrated service delivery. Second, a thematic analysis method was used to develop a taxonomy of <b>key</b> <b>features</b> organised into the dimensions of the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care. Finally, the appropriateness of the <b>key</b> <b>features</b> was tested in a Delphi study among Dutch experts. Results:  The taxonomy consists of 59 <b>key</b> <b>features</b> distributed across the six integration dimensions of the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care. <b>Key</b> <b>features</b> associated with the clinical, professional, organisational and normative dimensions were considered appropriate by the experts. <b>Key</b> <b>features</b> linked to the functional and system dimensions were considered less appropriate.
