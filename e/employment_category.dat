50|$|However, 2011 Census {{data can}} help us see how {{occupational}} trends have changed in this area over time. As stated above, census data from 1881 shows that the areas of most employment for women during that time was in 'Domestic Services' and 'Workers in Dress', in 2011 the highest <b>employment</b> <b>category</b> for women is 'Human Health and Social Work Activities', with 71 women in this category, which could be linked to 'Domestic Services', however a complete contrast to {{this is the second}} highest <b>employment</b> <b>category</b> in 2011 for women which was 'Retail Trade, Repair of Motor Vehicles and Motor Cycles', with 57 women in this category, showing how employment for women has changed over time. For men in 2011 the highest <b>employment</b> <b>category</b> is now 'Construction' with 71 men working in this sector, and the second highest <b>employment</b> <b>category</b> is 'Manufacturing' with 61 men working in this sector.

40|$|Much {{research}} on precarious employment compares permanent workers {{with one or}} two other broadly-defined <b>employment</b> <b>categories.</b> We developed a more refined method of examining precariousness by defining current employment arrangements in terms of job characteristics. These <b>employment</b> arrangement <b>categories</b> were then compared in terms of socio-demographics and self-reported job insecurity. This investigation was based on a cross-sectional population-based survey of a random sample of 1, 101 working Australians. Eight mutually exclusive <b>employment</b> <b>categories</b> were identified: Permanent Full-time (46. 4 %), Permanent Part-time (18. 3 %), Casual Full-time (2. 7 %), Casual Part-time (9. 3 %), Fixed Term Contract (2. 1 %), Labour Hire (3. 6 %), Own Account Self-employed (7. 4 %), and Other Self-employed (9. 5 %). These showed significant and coherent differences in job characteristics, socio-demographics and perceived job insecurity.

30|$|Looking at {{the average}} partial effect {{of being in}} the welfare and <b>employment</b> <b>category</b> in t− 1, we see similar but less {{pronounced}} effects compared to receiving welfare in t− 1. The average partial effects {{of being in the}} welfare and <b>employment</b> <b>category</b> compared to those of receiving welfare benefits only indicate that having a job while receiving welfare benefits, on average, is associated with better chances to exit welfare benefit receipt and to move into the <b>employment</b> <b>category.</b> Generally, it can be stated that employed welfare benefit recipients lie between non-employed welfare recipients and employed non-recipients, as already turned out in the descriptive analysis. When using survey data to measure state dependence in the welfare and <b>employment</b> <b>category,</b> the transition probability into welfare benefit receipt in t is underestimated by less than 1 percentage point. Thus, though using survey data with a fair amount of welfare benefit misreporting by respondents, the average partial effects of past benefit receipt are not biased substantially.|$|E

40|$|MONASH is {{a dynamic}} general {{equilibrium}} model of the Australian economy. This article describes a new labour-market specification for MONASH {{in which people are}} allocated in year t to categories according to their labourmarket activities in year t – 1. People in each category plan their labour supplies by solving an optimisation problem. Via these problems, we introduce the assumption that people in <b>employment</b> <b>categories</b> supply labour more strongly to employment activities than do people in unemployment categories. Thus we find that employment-stimulating policies in t – 1 increase labour supply in t by shifting the composition of the labour force in t in favour of <b>employment</b> <b>categories</b> and away from unemployment categories. We illustrate this idea by using MONASH to simulate the Dawkins proposal to combine a freeze on award wage rates with tax credits for low-wage workers in low-income families. We find that the Dawkins policy would generate a significant short-run increase in employment. With the increase in employment generating an increase in labour supply, the employment benefits of the policy would persist over many years. However, in the long run, we would expect the effect of the policy on aggregate employment to be small and to depend on how the policy affected the ratio of real after-tax wage rates to unemployment benefits...|$|R

Again, the difference emerges from the different base categories between the different data sources. Since employed welfare recipients display a higher probability of being employed welfare recipients in t than do employed non-recipients, the average partial effect of receiving welfare benefits is lower when comparing to both employed welfare recipients and employed non-recipients as opposed to employed non-recipients only.|$|E
