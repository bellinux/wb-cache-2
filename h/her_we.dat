Victoria persuades Olivia's servant to disguise himself as her rich uncle, the original owner of the land that Laura now holds. He convinces Laura that the titles are worthless, so in a rage she rips them up. Victoria reveals herself to Don Carlos, who repents and pledges himself to her again. Meanwhile, Olivia gets married to Julio, the man she wanted all along.|$|E

500|$|Somewhat surprisingly, Clinton {{faced an}} erosion of support from women voters during her campaign, with her numbers declining {{throughout}} 1999. [...] This was partly a typical pattern seen with women candidates where they have an early surge of female support, which then wears off, and it was partly due to her early campaign stumbles. [...] But it also reflected the particular set of mixed feelings that women had towards Clinton's marriage and the ambition and the power she derived from it. [...] The problem was especially acute among some female demographics; one of her longtime advisers later said, [...] "Women in the educated professional class?

500|$|Germain and Klasky {{initially}} {{planned to}} portray the character as divorced, but Nickelodeon executives rejected the idea, feeling that the subject would be inappropriate for younger viewers.

[...] Germain stated this prevented them from saying much about the character in earlier seasons, adding: [...] "We mention that she exists but we don't {{tell you what happened}} to <b>her.</b> <b>We</b> even made a joke out of it in one episode.

[...] To promote the album, Jackson appeared in various magazines, and performed on the Today Show and Billboard Awards. Jackson's Us Weekly cover, revealing her slim figure after heavy media focus was placed on her fluctuations in weight, became the magazine's best-selling issue in history. 20 Y.O. was released in September 2006 and debuted at number two on the Billboard200. The album received mixed reviews, with multiple critics chastising the production and involvement of Jermaine Dupri.

500|$|Throughout his writings, Du Bois {{supported}} women's rights,Donaldson, Shawn, [...] "Women's Rights", in Young, pp. 219–221. but {{he found}} it difficult to publicly endorse the women's right-to-vote movement because leaders of the suffragism movement refused to support his fight against racial injustice. A Crisis editorial from 1913 broached the taboo subject of interracial marriage: although Du Bois generally expected persons to marry within their race, he viewed the problem as a women's rights issue, because laws prohibited white men from marrying black women. Du Bois wrote [...] " [...] laws leave the colored girls absolutely helpless for the lust of white men. It reduces colored women {{in the eyes of the}} law to the position of dogs. As low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry <b>her...</b> <b>We</b> must kill [...] not because we are anxious to marry the white men's sisters, but because we are determined that white men will leave our sisters alone."Du Bois quoted in Lubin, Alex (2005), Romance and Rights: The Politics of Interracial Intimacy, 1945–1954, University Press of Mississippi, pp. 71–72.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Justin Francis, and co-directed by Nick Cannon {{on the island of}} Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The video became notable for the pair, {{due to the fact that}} it was during its conception and recording that they began dating, and eventually wed two months later. The video was shot in early April 2008, but was delayed until May, with several critics suggesting it because of the couples engagement. In an interview with Fox News, Cannon spoke of his feelings when first speaking with Carey regarding the video:"From the first time we sat down to discuss the video at the Beverly Hills Hotel, we connected. We had so much in common spiritually, and we laugh at the same things. I didn't have to put on my Mac Daddy suave mode. I was able to be myself with <b>her.</b> <b>We</b> are both eternally 12 years old." [...] The pair eloped in the Bahamas, at Carey's private estate in Eleuthera, and wed on April 30, 2008. The couple stayed on the island for over two weeks after the nuptials for their honeymoon, which is why the video was delayed until mid-May, so Carey would be able to promote it in time.|$|E

500|$|In Freaks, {{director}} Tod Browning of Dracula fame helms {{a picture}} that depicts a traveling circus populated {{by a group of}} deformed carnival freaks. Browning populated the movie with actual carnival sideshow performers including [...] "midgets, dwarfs, hermaphrodites, Siamese twins, and, most awful, the armless and legless man billed as the 'living torso'". There is also a group of Pinheads, who are depicted as fortunate in that they are not mentally capable enough to understand that they disgust people. But the truly unsavory characters here are the villains, the circus strongman Hercules and the beautiful high-wire artist Cleopatra, who intends to marry and poison Hans, the midget heir who is enamored of her. At a dinner celebrating their union, one of the freaks dances on the table as they chant [...] "gooble-gobble, gobble, gobble, one of us, one of us, we accept <b>her,</b> <b>we</b> accept her." [...] Disgusted, Cleopatra insults Hans and makes out with Hercules in front of him. When the freaks discover her plot, they exact revenge by mutilating Cleopatra into a freak. Although, circus freaks were common in the early 1930s, the film was their first depiction on screen. Browning took care to linger over shots of the deformed, disabled performers with long takes of them including one of the [...] "living torso" [...] lighting a match and then a cigarette with his mouth. The film was accompanied by a sensational marketing campaign that asked sexual questions such as [...] "Do the Siamese Twins make love?", [...] "What sex is the half-man half-woman?", and [...] "Can a full grown woman truly love a midget?" [...] Surprisingly, given its reaction to Frankenstein, the state of Kansas objected to nothing in Freaks. However, other states, such as Georgia, were repulsed by the film and it was not shown in many locales. The film later became a cult classic spurred by midnight movie showings, but it was a box-office bomb in its original release.|$|E
