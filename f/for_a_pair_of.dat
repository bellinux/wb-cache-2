5|$|In 1912, the Russian Navy sought {{builders}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> light cruisers; the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig won the contract. The {{two ships}} were originally {{ordered by the}} Russian Navy as Maraviev Amurskyy and Admiral Nevelskoy from the Schichau-Werke that year. The two ships were laid down in 1913; Maraviev Amurskyy was launched on 11 April 1914, after which fitting-out work commenced. Both ships were requisitioned by the German Navy on 5 August 1914, and were renamed Pillau and Elbing, respectively. Elbing was launched on 21 November 1914. Pillau and Elbing were commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 14 December 1914 and 4 September 1915, respectively.|$|E

They defeated the No.23 Nittany Lions 27–11, and returned to Tuscaloosa <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> home games against the North Texas Mean Green and the Arkansas Razorbacks. Against North Texas, the Alabama defense was dominant and secured the first shutout for the Crimson Tide defense since the 2009 season with their 41–0 victory. The following week, Alabama opened conference play with a 38–14 victory over No.14 Arkansas and then defeated the No.12 Florida Gators 38–10 to extend their record to 5–0. After their victory over Florida, the Crimson Tide regained their No.2 ranking in the AP Poll.|$|E

5|$|The CVP {{also has}} several dams on the San Joaquin River—which has far less average flow than the Sacramento—in order to divert its water to {{southern}} Central Valley aqueducts. The Friant Dam, completed in 1942, {{is the largest}} component of the Friant Division of the CVP. The dam crosses the San Joaquin River where it spills out of the Sierra Nevada, forming Millerton Lake, which provides water storage for San Joaquin Valley irrigators {{as well as providing}} a diversion point <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> canals, the Friant-Kern Canal and the Madera Canal. The Friant-Kern Canal sends water southwards through the Tulare Lake area to its terminus at Bakersfield on the Kern River, supplying irrigation water to Tulare, Fresno, and Kern counties. The Madera Canal takes water northwards to Madera County, emptying into the Chowchilla River.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{traveled}} to face rivals, the California Golden Bears, led by fourth–year head coach Jeff Tedford and quarterback Joe Ayoob. Although the Bears handed the Trojans their last loss in 2003, they were struggling in the season, having lost {{three out of}} the last four games and dropping out of the rankings {{for the first time since}} 2003. The Trojans scored first after Ayoob's first of four interceptions in the game, on a LenDale White rush. Ayoob recovered after the interception, and led the Bears to a field goal to cut their deficit to four at the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Leinart rushed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> touchdowns to give the Trojans a 21–3 lead at half-time. After a pair of White rushing touchdowns, the Bears scored again on a Chris Manerino rush that ended scoring in the game, with the Trojans winning 35–10. With the win, the Trojans clinched at least a share of the Pac-10 title and increased their winning streak to 32games, tied for the sixthlongest in history.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are medium in length, and do not reach the first molars. Their back margin is angular, not rounded as in eastern voalavo. The diastema (the gap between the upper incisors and molars) is shorter than in eastern voalavo. The bony palate is broad and lacks notable ridges and other features, except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> foramina (openings) near {{the place where the}} first and second molars (M1 and M2) meet.

In the bony roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, wide sphenopalatine vacuities (openings) are present. A thin alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone on the lower side of the skull separating two foramina) is present in specimens from Marojejy, but not in those from Anjanaharibe-Sud. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, is reduced.|$|E
