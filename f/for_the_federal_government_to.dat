5|$|Various {{other plans}} were {{considered}} to address the debt issues during the first session of Congress, but none were able to generate widespread support. In September 1789, with no resolution in sight and the close of that session drawing near, Congress directed Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to prepare a report on credit. In his Report on the Public Credit (the first of three fiscal and economic policy reports), Hamilton called for the federal assumption of state debt and the mass issuance of federal bonds. Hamilton believed that these measures would restore the ailing economy, ensure a stable and adequate money stock, and make it easier <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> borrow during emergencies such as wars. He also proposed redeeming the promissory notes issued by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution at full value. Many former soldiers had sold their notes {{at a fraction of}} face value, believing them to be worthless. He planned to buy back the promissory notes from their current holders. This idea drew loud objections from many who were of the opinion that the notes should be paid back either to the original holder or to both the current and original holder.|$|E

25|$|The Law on Fisheries {{requires}} that {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) levels are set for fishery stocks. It defines these levels as the “scientifically justified annual catch of aquatic biological resources of particular species in a fishing area”. However, the Law on Fisheries {{then goes on to}} state that industrial fisheries are not necessarily required to base their catch on TAC. The Law does not explain this further, but calls <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> issue a special TAC setting statute. Pacific salmon is the main stock that will probably not have TAC, but will have regulated fishing effort instead.|$|E

In June 1947, the Public Accounts Committee recommended that a commission be struck to examine the claims of Japanese Canadians living in Canada (many Japanese Canadians had been deported to Japan during the war) for losses resulting from receiving less than the fair market value of their property.|$|E

In 1939, Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939, which restricted political campaign activities by federal employees.

25|$|Holt came {{to regard}} the {{referendum}} as indicative of {{a shift in the}} national mood. In the following months, he toured Aboriginal communities and consulted with indigenous leaders, including Charles Perkins and Kath Walker. Despite opposition from state governments, he created a new Office of Aboriginal Affairs within the Prime Minister's Department, as well as a new advisory body called the Council of Aboriginal Affairs (chaired by H. C. Coombs). According to Coombs and Paul Hasluck, Holt had little interest in indigenous affairs before becoming prime minister. Despite this, he brought about a fundamental shift in the way policy was handled, paving the way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> assume many of the powers and responsibilities that had previously been the preserve of the states. Indigenous academic Gary Foley has said that Holt's death was a setback for Aboriginal people, as his successors did not show the same commitment to the framework that he established.|$|E

25|$|The Federal Treasury {{was nearly}} out {{of gold in}} 1895, at {{the depths of the}} Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> buy gold from his and European banks but it was {{declined}} in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan {{came up with a plan}} to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5million ounces, to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue. The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court, under Taft, {{compiled}} a conservative record in Commerce Clause jurisprudence. This had the practical effect {{of making it}} difficult <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> regulate industry, and the Taft Court also scuttled many state laws.

In late 1999, Harper called <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> establish clear rules for any future Quebec referendum on sovereignty.

500|$|Despite {{calls from}} Clarke <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> use its power of {{reservation}} {{to stop the}} legislation, Bulyea granted royal assent December 16. [...] Sifton, {{in his capacity as}} provincial treasurer, immediately tried to access the money; the Royal, Dominion, and Union banks, where the funds were deposited, refused payment. [...] Attorney-General Mitchell sued the banks; on November 4, 1911, Justice Charles Allen Stuart of the Supreme Court of Alberta found in the government's favour. [...] The Royal Bank appealed this ruling and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government to use its powers of disallowance to strike down the provincial act. [...] In the meantime, Sifton announced a new railway policy that would see eight new lines constructed by private companies with the assistance of provincial loan guarantees, including several pioneer lines; this policy, in its resemblance to the Rutherford policy, met with the approval of the Cross faction, and the Liberals were once more united.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, the UFA {{government}} {{passed the}} Mineral Tax Act, which taxed mineral rightsholders {{at a rate}} of three cents per acre. [...] The two largest such rightsholders, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Hudson's Bay Company, urged the federal government to use its power of disallowance {{to put a stop to}} the legislation. When the federal government complied, Brownlee protested its action on three grounds: first, as a direct tax the proposed levy was within Alberta's rights under section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, and it was constitutional convention <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> exercise disallowance only when the impugned legislation was clearly unconstitutional. Second, disallowance allowed the province no recourse to the courts, where the constitutionality of the legislation could be tested. Third, the federal government's stated reasons for disallowing the legislation, which were released belatedly by justice minister Ernest Lapointe, were (according to Brownlee) erroneous and led Brownlee to suggest that Lapointe, a Québécois lawyer trained in the civil law tradition of his home province rather than the common law system used in the rest of Canada, must be unfamiliar with the land-holding system outside of Quebec. Brownlee's attacks were rejected, and the disallowance stood.|$|E

Howard remained loyal to Premier Campbell, praising his October 2010 announcement {{of using the}} remainder of the budget to cut income tax by 15%, two weeks before the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services was to deliver its report on public consultation for budget priorities. After Campbell resigned, and the tax cut undone, the 2011 BC Liberal leadership election ensued. Along with Richmond's other two MLAs, John Yap and Linda Reid, Howard endorsed Kevin Falcon to be the new party leader, citing Falcon's willingness to listen to all arguments and saying [...] "I think he can bring a new dynamic, a youthful energy to the discussion; he's a great speaker, a great debater." [...] Christy Clark eventually won the leadership and became premier but, like Campbell, did not include Howard in the executive council. In March 2012, Premier Clark promoted Howard to a parliamentary secretary position under the Ministry of Transportation and directed to focus on air services agreements where he served until September. In early 2013, Howard was selected by BC Liberal caucus chair, Gordon Hogg, to assist with the party's investigation into the party's alleged use of government resources and employees in partisan promotional efforts in certain ethnic communities.|$|E
