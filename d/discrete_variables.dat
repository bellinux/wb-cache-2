2500|$|The Ising model ( [...] ; [...] ), {{named after}} the {{physicist}} Ernst Ising, is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. The model consists of <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> that represent magnetic dipole moments of atomic spins that can be {{in one of two}} states (+1 or −1). The spins are arranged in a graph, usually a lattice, allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. The model allows the identification of phase transitions, as a simplified model of reality. The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is one of the simplest statistical models to show a phase transition.|$|E
2500|$|These five ideas {{turn out}} to be <b>discrete</b> <b>variables,</b> but the profit rate will go up or down, {{depending}} on the choice of measure. Andrew Kliman states in his book The failure of capitalist production that [...] "I believe that there are many different legitimate ways of measuring rates of profit, and that none serves as an all-purpose measure. The most relevant rate of profit to consider always depends upon the particular question being addressed." [...] This pluralist approach provides plenty possibilities for all kinds of different interpretations of all kinds of profit rates, depending on what the question is thought to be, to which a profit rate {{is supposed to be the}} answer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{central limit theorem}} applies in {{particular}} to sums of independent and identically distributed discrete random variables. [...] A sum of discrete random variables is still a discrete random variable, so that we are confronted with a sequence of discrete random variables whose cumulative probability distribution function converges towards a cumulative probability distribution function corresponding to a continuous variable (namely that of the normal distribution). [...] This means that if we build a histogram of the realisations of the sum of [...] independent identical <b>discrete</b> <b>variables,</b> the curve that joins the centers of the upper faces of the rectangles forming the histogram converges toward a Gaussian curve as [...] approaches infinity, this relation is known as de Moivre–Laplace theorem. The binomial distribution article details such an application of the central limit theorem in the simple case of a discrete variable taking only two possible values.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{numerical}} methods {{to study the}} quantum mechanical three-body scattering system using the Schrodinger equation. Traditionally, a partial-wave decomposition of the total wave function is carried out first, allowing the scattering system to be solved one partial wave at a time. This is convenient when the interaction is central, causing the total angular momentum to be conserved during the collision process. This is not possible {{in the presence of}} a non-central interaction such as a laser field, where the total angular momentum is not conserved during the collision process. The <b>Discrete</b> <b>Variable</b> Representation is a new method for solving the quantum-mechanical three-body scattering problem to obtain the total cross section. The implementation of this new method for the two-body problem has been successfully applied to real systems. The extension to the three-body problem is the next logical step. For this thesis bipolar spherical harmonics are used in the implementation of the three-body <b>Discrete</b> <b>Variable</b> Representation. This <b>Discrete</b> <b>Variable</b> Representation is capable of working with any combination of interactions, including non-central interactions. The total cross section computation for a three-particle elastic-scattering numerical example is used to illustrate the potential of this <b>Discrete</b> <b>Variable</b> Representation method.
