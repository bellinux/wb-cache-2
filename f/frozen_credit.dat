25|$|The 2008 {{financial}} credit crisis {{led to the}} collapse of several notable investment banks, such as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (one of the largest investment banks in the world) and the hurried sale of Merrill Lynch and the much smaller Bear Stearns to much larger banks, which effectively rescued them from bankruptcy. The entire financial services industry, including numerous investment banks, was rescued by government loans through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Surviving U.S. investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted to traditional bank holding companies to accept TARP relief. Similar situations occurred across the globe with countries rescuing their banking industry. Initially, banks received part of a $700 billion TARP intended to stabilize the economy and thaw the <b>frozen</b> <b>credit</b> markets. Eventually, taxpayer assistance to banks reached nearly $13 trillion, most without much scrutiny, lending did not increase and credit markets remained frozen.|$|E

5000|$|Investment banks Bear Stearns, {{founded in}} 1923 and Lehman Brothers, over 100 years old, collapsed; Merrill Lynch was {{acquired}} by Bank of America, which remained in trouble, as did Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The ensuing financial crisis of 2008 saw Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley [...] "abandon their status as investment banks" [...] by converting themselves into [...] "traditional bank holding companies", thereby making themselves eligible to receive billions of dollars each in emergency taxpayer-funded assistance. By making this change, {{referred to as a}} technicality, banks would be more tightly regulated.

5000|$|The park {{opened to}} [...] "awesome" [...] reviews. The Times of London's writer Chris Haslam {{concluded}} that America’s newest theme park brought the genre [...] "from the preschool plastic of Disney {{to a new}} age of insubordinate adolescence {{through a combination of}} nerdy attention to detail, startling irreverence and sly wit." [...] Beth J. Harpaz, Associated Press travel editor, declared Nights in White Satin: The Trip as one of her all-time favorite rides from any park, right up there with Disney's popular Soarin' Over California ride. However, Hard Rock Park had stated the park could accommodate up to 30,000 visitors a day, and in light of the <b>frozen</b> <b>credit</b> markets, the park could not secure sufficient finance to underwrite its planned advertising campaign. As the 2008 economic downturn deepened during the summer, high gas and hotel prices coupled with limited advertising by the park led to lower-than-expected attendance. The park cited “macroeconomic conditions that significantly depressed overall demand in the travel and leisure industry” and a lack of cash to advertise. The park had borrowed {{a lot of money and}} could not convince investors to provide more help to keep the park going.|$|E
50|$|John Angelo and Michael Gordon {{founded the}} firm on {{strategies}} {{with which they}} had 15 years prior experience: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and convertible arbitrage. The multi-strategy platform was added in 1993 {{as a way to}} offer investors a single fund which captured many of Angelo, Gordon’s investment strategies and which could tactically allocate as markets shifted. In 1998, the leveraged loan business was added {{as an extension of the}} distressed debt business. The firm began buying real estate as early as 1990 through investments in the distressed debt of bankrupt real estate companies. In 1993, as real estate markets buckled under the weight of too much debt, the firm launched its opportunistic real estate strategy investments with the goal of improving and repositioning the property by increasing operating income. In early 2002, the company added core plus real estate to its real estate strategies as it was able to benefit from its operating partner network, and purchase high quality real estate. Since 2005, the firm has expanded its real estate offerings through a dedicated opportunistic Asian real estate strategy. In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the European banking crisis of 2011, Angelo, Gordon added European real estate to its strategies as prices were depressed and liquidity was severely curtailed in the region. Net Lease real estate strategy was established in 2005 to focus on below investment grade tenants. Angelo, Gordon further expanded into the intersections of real estate and credit with the addition of real estate debt in 2006 and residential and consumer debt in 2008. In 2009, Angelo, Gordon was one of only nine private investment firms to partner with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in PPIP—the Private-Public Investment Partnership. The U.S. government invested alongside the selected firms to unlock the <b>frozen</b> <b>credit</b> markets in the wake of the global financial crisis. This was a successful program. The firm took advantage of the post-2008 financial crisis contraction in bank lending to smaller companies through senior secure direct lending to energy companies in 2013 and to middle market borrowers in the private equity sponsor community in 2014. In October 2013, Larry Schloss became the president of Angelo, Gordon and Co. In March 2016, Mr. Schloss left the firm.|$|E
50|$|The new {{minister}} of Finance started by withdrawing the 100 guilder note in July 1945. Those holding notes {{were given a}} blocked bank credit. This note had {{been the subject of}} distrust anyway and many were held by war profiteers. On 25 September 1945 it was announced that as of the next day all banknotes were withdrawn and all bank <b>credits</b> <b>frozen.</b> All paper cash handed in gave rise to a credit on a blocked bank account. For one week, until 2 October 1945 there was no valid paper money in the country with a single exception. Everyone with a distribution card could change ten guilder in withdrawn notes for new money. This action was known as Lieftinck's tenner. Significantly, although the amount was small, it was enough for a week.|$|R

A burned spy is blacklisted from all government agencies and resources; his bank accounts are <b>frozen</b> and his <b>credit</b> is trashed.

He is also forced to deal with the family he went halfway around the world to get away from—particularly his mother, Madeline Westen, who could not be happier to have her son back in town.|$|R
40|$|The {{main reasons}} and motivations which cause the {{withdrawal}} of Ukrainian popu lation’s money from deposit accounts at bank institutions are examined in the article. The author describes characteristics of savings behavior of Ukrainian citizens {{during the period of}} financial crisis. According to data of the “Tsentr” analytical group opinion poll (2009), the structure of population’s savings preferences has not gone through noticeable changes. Obtaining a positive savings experience as bank institu tions clients, people keep on considering such form of money savings as the best one. Even the fact that accounts of many Ukrainian depositors have been <b>frozen</b> at some <b>credit</b> and savings banks found on verge of bankruptcy did not ward them off. In such a case, people are disappointed rather in a concrete bank agency than in a hole banking system. The impacts which can attract the population’s deposit money to problematical banks after their “sanation” are also studied in the article. The author carries out an operational classification of motivational structure of population’s deposit activity. In particular, the deposit savings of population can serve not only as the mean of resolving both current and future financial problems, but as a kind of stabilizing factor regarding social and psychological state of a concrete person...|$|R

40|$|Economic recessions {{are often}} portrayed as {{short-term}} events. However, as a substantial body of economic literature shows, {{the consequences of}} high unemployment, falling incomes, and reduced economic activity can have lasting con-sequences. For example, job loss and falling incomes can force families to delay or forgo a college education for their children. <b>Frozen</b> <b>credit</b> markets and depressed consumer spending can stop the creation of otherwise vibrant small busi-nesses. Larger companies may delay or reduce spending on R&D. In each of these cases, an economic recession can lead to “scarring”—that is, long-lasting damage to individuals’ economic situations and the economy more broadly. Th is report examines {{some of the evidence}} demonstrating the long-run consequences of recessions. Findings include: Educational achievement: • Unemployment and in-come losses can reduce educational achievement by threatening early childhood nutrition; reducing families ’ abilities to provide a supportive learning environment (including adequate health care, summer activities, and stable housing); and by forcing a delay or abandonment of college plans...|$|E
40|$|Facing {{the worst}} {{financial}} crisis since the Great Depression, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has responded with sweeping, unprecedented actions to aid a slowing economy and stimulate a <b>frozen</b> <b>credit</b> market. We {{focus on the}} policy changes instituted by the Fed and their wealth effects on banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms, savings and loans institutions and primary dealers. More specifically, we analyse {{the actions of the}} Fed that involved the modification of the terms on which financial institutions can borrow from the Discount Window (DW) and the creation of new liquidity enhancing facilities like the Term Auction Facility (TAF), the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). We find that changes to the DW {{and the creation of a}} similar program, the TAF, had almost no effect on its intended beneficiaries - depository institutions. These results are consistent with Cecchetti (2009). Also, we find that new measures implemented by the Fed towards restoring the repurchase agreement market were well received by both depository institution and primary dealers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{cyclical}} path {{of economy}} is a common place in the economic theory. The economic crisis that started in 2007 was not {{only one of the}} most severe since the WWII but it came unexpectedly. The cause of the crises and of the surprise consists in the economic models and theories that were founded on the rationality and maximization behavior of the economic actor. People lack the rationality the mainstream economics assume. This is why both economists and simple people do not act as theory predicts and finally economy does not tend toward equilibrium but suffers recurrent crises. This crisis started as a financial one, because of the subprime loans made in USA, but have spread in production sector because of <b>credit</b> <b>frozen,</b> is now in transforming into a social crisis because of austerity measures taken by governments. The paper analyzes the theoretical foundation of economic theory and how the facts that characterize the recent economic evolution fit with the non mainstream theories. It presents the figures of the economic evolution in the last 3 years and explains them based of the agentâ€™s behavior described by Herbert Simon and Daniel Kahneman. Their challenge of mainstream economics is based on an analyze of human behavior. Herbert Simon introduced the concept of bounded rationality as opposed to perfect rationality postulated by neoclassic economics and Daniel Kahneman realized experiments that proved that people cannot stick with the performances assumed by mainstream economics. Their conclusion permit to understand the approach of George Soros who says that people actions are bounded by reflexivity and as a consequences sometimes economy move not toward but far from equilibrium, creating bubbles that end in financial and economic crises. As Akerlof mention the cause of the crisis is the reliance of a false theory which said that we are safe. The conclusion is that we need new theories more close to the real life and an agent description that capture the limited characteristics of the human being despite the abstract â€œhomo oeconomicusâ€...|$|R
