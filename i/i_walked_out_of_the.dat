500|$|Critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 stars out of 4 {{and called it}} [...] "painfully and unremittingly intense" [...] and a [...] "superb example of filmmaking craft." [...] He also stated [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theater, there were knots in my stomach from the film's roller-coaster ride of violence." [...] Walter Goodman of The New York Times {{said it was a}} [...] "flaming, flashing, crashing, {{crackling}} blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics." [...] Time magazine featured the film on the cover of its , 1986, issue, calling it the [...] "summer's scariest movie". Time reviewer Richard Schickel declared the film [...] "a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore." [...] The selection of Aliens for a Time cover was attributed to the successful reception of the film, as well as its novel example of a science fiction action heroine. Echoing Times assessment, Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader called the film [...] "one sequel that surpasses the original." [...] On the negative side, Gene Siskel described Aliens as [...] "one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses" [...] and that [...] "toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn't want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said the mule. [...] "It's {{too dark to}} see much. Aren't these camels too sickening for anything? <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my lines to get a little peace and quiet here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Till the {{pleasure}} grown too strong [...] Left me muter evermore, [...] And, the winding road being long, [...] <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight, before, [...] And so, wrapt in musings fond, [...] Issued (past the wayside pond) [...] On the meadow-lands beyond.|$|R
60|$|Here our conference ended. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study a very {{different}} being from what I was on entering it. I had gone in with {{the air of a}} professor about to deliver a lecture; I came out like a student who had failed in his examination, and been degraded in his class.|$|E
6000|$|... "Milor!" [...] {{was all she}} said, but {{of course}} I understood. I {{had no idea that}} English milors could be thus treated by pert maidens. But what cared I for social {{amenities}} just then? My hand had closed over the duplicate key of the safe, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room {{in the wake of the}} damsel. Theodore had disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you believe}} it--two nights later, I saw the fellow--after the theatre, in a restaurant--whole party of people--big plate of {{so and so}} in front of him--quart bottle of so and so on ice--such and such and so forth. I stepped over to him--tapped him on the shoulder: 'See here,' I said, 'if you won't obey my instructions, you can't expect me to treat you.' <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place." ...|$|E
60|$|I went to London resolving to {{act upon}} the {{paternal}} advice, and oh! how I {{longed for the}} day when I should be married, vowing in my secret soul that I would light a cigar as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> St. George's, Hanover Square.|$|R
6000|$|... "Explain yourself," [...] I said coldly, {{in a very}} chilly voice. [...] "Courtenay Ivor, I {{give you}} three minutes to explain. At {{the end of that}} time, if you can't {{exonerate}} yourself, <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this house to give you up, as I ought, to the arm of Justice!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I sold it {{off of a}} line, ‘It’s amother and {{daughter}} and they’re more like friends than mother {{and daughter}}.’ And they all perked up and literally said, ‘Great, we’ll buy that’. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> there and turned to my manager {{at the time and}} said, ‘That’s all I got. I don’t know what the show is.’” -Amy Sherman-Palladino on her initial pitch to The WB ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he added, [...] "we {{ran out of}} the gale, and I had bitter {{words to}} face when we reached Vancouver. As one result of it <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city with four or five dollars in my pocket--though there was a share due to me. Then I rode up into the ranges in an open car to mend {{railroad}} bridges in the frost and snow. It {{was not the kind of}} home-coming one would care to look forward to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} see her again now before I depart. I left her, as I have said, by Don Jose's bedside. The street was dark, the houses shut up, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town in the night. Not a single street-lamp had been lit for two days, and the archway of the gate was only a mass of {{darkness}} in the vague form of a tower, in which I heard low, dismal groans, that seemed to answer the murmurs of a man's voice.|$|E
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. After all, {{what was}} the use of saying anything? And what could I say that would have done me any service? If they were capable of {{thinking}} me a thief,--which they certainly did,--nothing that I could say would remove the impression. Nor, as I thought, was it suitable that I should defend myself from such an imputation. What were the Greenes to me? So I walked slowly out of the room, and never again saw one of the family from that day to this.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean the}} morning when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Belarab's stockade on your arm, Captain Lingard, {{at the head of}} the procession. It seemed to me that I was walking on a splendid stage in a scene from an opera, in a {{gorgeous}} show fit to make an audience hold its breath. You can't possibly guess how unreal all this seemed, and how artificial I felt myself. An opera, you know. [...] ." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, in February 2011, Williams, {{reflecting}} on {{why he had}} left the rehab facility, said to reporters that [...] "I love Dr. Phil. I don't want to bash him in any way. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> treatment because it was a little scripted, I felt. There was no anonymity. I want him to know that his cares and his concerns will not be in vain. I am going to try and truly get back into the swing of things." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Edwards left {{the band and}} began {{performing}} as a solo acoustic artist. He would later recall: I liked the sound of bronze strings on rosewood better than steel strings on magnets, and so <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that club in Vermont, rented myself a van and PA system, and started traveling around the colleges in New England by myself, without gigs, just setting up in the lobbies of dormitories on a Saturday. Pretty soon I started getting a following.|$|R
60|$|Availing {{myself of}} the {{permission}} of the king to go where I would, a little later in the day <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town towards the Valley of Bones in order to ascertain for myself whether what Goza had told me was true. So it proved, for about three hundred yards {{from the mouth of the}} valley, which at that distance looked like a black hole in the hills, I found soldiers stationed about ten paces apart in a great circle which ran right up the hillside and vanished over the crest. Strolling up to one of these, whose face I thought I knew, I asked him if he would let me pass to see my friend, the Opener of Roads.|$|E
6000|$|After {{giving an}} account of all I knew, which was very little, other gents who were {{employed}} in the concern were examined; and I went back to prison, with my poor little wife on my arm. We had {{to pass through the}} crowd in the rooms, and my heart bled as I saw, amongst a score of others, poor Gates, Brough's porter, who had advanced every shilling to his master, and was now, with ten children, houseless and penniless in his old age. Captain Sparr was in this neighbourhood, but by no means so friendly disposed; for while Gates touched his hat, as if I had been a lord, the little Captain came forward threatening with his bamboo-cane and swearing with great oaths that I was an accomplice of Brough. [...] "Curse you for a smooth-faced scoundrel!" [...] says he. [...] "What business have you to ruin an English gentleman, as you have me?" [...] And again he advanced with his stick. But this time, officer as he was, Gus took him by the collar, and shoved him back, and said, [...] "Look at the lady, you brute, and hold your tongue!" [...] And when he looked at my wife's situation, Captain Sparr became redder for shame than he had before been for anger. [...] "I'm sorry she's married to such a good-for-nothing," [...] muttered he, and fell back; and my poor wife and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court, and back to our dismal room in the prison.|$|E
6000|$|The road still {{grew more}} and more picturesque, and now lay along ridges, at the bases of which were deep ravines and hollow valleys. Woods were not wanting; wilder forests than I have seen since leaving America, of oak-trees chiefly; and, among the green foliage, grew golden tufts of broom, making a gay and lovely {{combination}} of hues. I must not forget to mention the poppies, which burned like live coals along the wayside, and lit up the landscape, even {{a single one of}} them, with wonderful effect. At other points, we saw olive-trees, hiding their eccentricity of boughs under thick masses of foliage of a livid tint, which is caused, I believe, by their turning their reverse sides to the light and to the spectator. Vines were abundant, but were of little account in the scene. By and by we came in sight, of the high, flat table-land, on which stands Civita Castellana, and beheld, straight downward, between us and the town, a deep level valley with a river winding through it; it was the valley of the Treja. A precipice, hundreds of feet in height, falls perpendicularly upon the valley, from the site of Civita Castellana; there is an equally abrupt one, probably, on the side from which we saw it; and a modern road, skilfully constructed, goes winding down to the stream, crosses it by a narrow stone bridge, and winds upward into the town. After passing over the bridge, I alighted, with J----- and R-----, [...] . and made the ascent on foot, along walls of natural rock, in which old Etruscan tombs were hollowed out. There are likewise antique remains of masonry, whether Roman or of what earlier period, I cannot tell. At the summit of the acclivity, which brought us close to the town, our vetturino took us into the carriage again and quickly brought us to what appears to be really a good hotel, where all of us are accommodated with sleeping-chambers in a range, beneath an arcade, entirely secluded {{from the rest of the}} population of the hotel. After a splendid dinner (that is, splendid, considering that it was ordered by our hospitable vetturino), U----, Miss Shepard, J-----, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little town, in the opposite direction from our entrance, and crossed a bridge at the height of the table-land, instead of at its base. On either side, we had a view down into a profound gulf, with sides of precipitous rock, and heaps of foliage in its lap, through which ran the snowy track of a stream; here snowy, there dark; here hidden among the foliage, there quite revealed in the broad depths of the gulf. This was wonderfully fine. Walking on a little farther, Soracte came fully into view, starting with bold abruptness out of the middle of the country; and before we got back, the bright Italian moon was throwing a shower of silver over the scene, and making it so beautiful that it seemed miserable not to know how to put it into words; a foolish thought, however, for such scenes are an expression in themselves, and need not be translated into any feebler language. On our walk we met parties of laborers, both men and women, returning from the fields, with rakes and wooden forks over their shoulders, singing in chorus. It is very customary for women to be laboring in the fields.|$|E
5000|$|Schoen {{also wrote}} many of Count Basie's earlier {{arrangements}} in the mid-1930s. He {{commented on the}} time when Basie paid him for some of his arrangements: [...] "He owed me some money one night after a gig. I had written several arrangements for him and he paid me one hundred dollars in single dollar bills. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that Harlem club with the biggest wad of cash in my pocket. I {{had never been so}} scared in my life." ...|$|R
5000|$|As he has {{explained}} in interviews, “Following {{the success of}} The Why Cafe, I went to visit my agent in New York {{to talk about what}} my next project would be. After our discussions, I made the decision to write a non-fiction book about the Big Five for Life. When I returned home, my wife had rented the best of Oprah from Netflix, and when I finished watching the show about South Africa, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my bedroom at 2:00 a.m., and knew I had to do something bigger.” ...|$|R
5000|$|I've {{forgotten}} the percentage the publisher took out, {{but it was}} something like a 60-40 thing, and they took the larger percentage. ... The chief administrator at Cable sic didn't want to give me distribution, and while he was talking, the head of the company came in, and saw the material. I talked to him for about a half-hour. And <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> there dazed. We had a reasonable deal, and they did the best they could. They gave us a contract and were going to pay for three books....|$|R
5000|$|On 1 May 2017, Higgins {{announced}} {{the release of}} the single, saying: [...] "I really felt like I'd seen something special when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preview the other day. I cried many, many tears (and it’s not often I cry during my own songs!) so please go and see it when it comes out. I feel incredibly honoured to {{have been a part of}} it." ...|$|E
5000|$|During 1948, Reg, {{still with}} the South Australian Mines Department, was in Britain in {{association}} with uranium {{on behalf of the}} government; Griselda has said that she met Reg [...] "on ...the island of Arran, .... Well there was I with three nursing sisters I’d held up with, and as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant that night, they stopped me and said, ‘I bet you can’t get a date with the Australian before midnight tonight, for tomorrow. I said ‘How much is it worth’, they said ‘five quid’, and I said ‘that’ll do me’. I got the five quid, got the date, and I always say, I won him in a bet." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{hearing about}} another {{upcoming}} storyline with colleague Shona McGarty, Discipline said to New Magazine: [...] "It {{could be a}} lot worse! Shona's a lovely person and a great actress. And she's beautiful! There are loads of beautiful girls in EastEnders, aren't there?". He is instantly caught in a love triangle between his character Tyler, Whitney and Fatboy. For the upcoming boxing storyline, Discipline shaved all of his hair off to reflect the circumstances. Discussing his new look, the 22-year-old said: [...] "I didn't mind, but it makes me look a lot younger. When I first had it done, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> make-up room and David Essex was p*ssing himself. He said, 'You look about ten years old, mate!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That you may swear to," [...] he cried. [...] "It's a pure, bright, A number 1 paper; the St. Jo Sunday Herald. The idea of {{the series}} was quite my own; I interviewed the editor, put it to him straight; the {{freshness}} of the idea took him, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that office with the contract in my pocket, and did my first Paris letter that evening in St. Jo. The editor did no more than glance his eye down the head-lines. 'You're the man for us,' said he." ...|$|R

5000|$|When I Iistened to him, {{something}} funny {{happened to me}} - a peculiar kind of {{feeling that he was}} describing my state and not his state. Why did I want to know his state? He was describing something, some movements, some awareness, some silence - [...] "In that silence there is no mind; there is action" [...] - all kinds of things. So, I am in that state. What the hell have I been doing these 30 or 40 years, listening to all these people and struggling, wanting to understand his state or the state of somebody else, Buddha or Jesus? I am in that state. Now I am in that state. So, then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tent and never looked back.|$|E
5000|$|Raja Sen of rediff.com was {{particularly}} {{critical of the}} film, also expressing dissatisfaction with its length. He remarked, [...] "I feel older. A showing of Karan Johar's mammoth 22-reel Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna has left me unbelievably exhausted. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall feeling my cheeks for stubble, wondering if my clothes are suddenly dated and my hair's turned grey. I've lost a sizeable chunk of my life, and you will too". Unlike other critics, he identified flaws in the script and criticised the strength of characters saying [...] "The characters are cardboard, the setting is glitzy, the songs are tiresome, and the story oscillates between high melodrama and slapstick hilarity, going nowhere. Rarely has a weak script relied so completely on pretty people with big names to carry every line through".|$|E
5000|$|Bitch was {{conceived}} during the Sticky Fingers sessions in October 1970. Richards was late that day, {{but when he}} arrived he transformed a loose jam into the trademark riff found on the released take. Andy Johns claims: [...] When we were doing Bitch, Keith was very late. Jagger and Mick Taylor had been playing the song without him and it didn't sound very good. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kitchen and {{he was sitting on}} the floor with no shoes, eating a bowl of cereal. Suddenly he said, Oi, Andy! Give me that guitar. I handed him his clear Dan Armstrong Plexiglass guitar, he put it on, kicked the song up in tempo, and just put the vibe right on it. Instantly, it went from being this laconic mess into a real groove. And I thought, Wow. THAT'S what he does. The song is also notable for its heavy brass section that punctuates the guitar riff after the choruses. Mick Jagger said: The brass for me is great, especially on like Bitch. I mean as long as it's used sort of tastefully. I'm not saying I'd like to work with a band with sort of five or six brass. But I wouldn't mind a band with sort of 5 saxophones ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{that year}} he mounted {{a show of}} O'Keeffe's works next to some amateurish {{paintings}} on glass by Becky Strand. He did not publish a catalog of the show, which the Strands took as an insult. Paul Strand never forgave Stieglitz. He said [...] "The day <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> into the Photo-Secession 291 [...] in 1907 was a great moment in my life… but the day <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> An American Place in 1932 was not less good. It was fresh air and personal liberation from something that had become, for me at least, second-rate, corrupt and meaningless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, {{while the}} Professor picked the little girls--who were more frightened than hurt--off the ground, and the pupils {{clustered}} around him closely grouped, <b>I</b> calmly <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the school-house, turned a corner, and escaped unnoticed to {{a grove of}} trees that stood near" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{had missed}} {{promotion}} to the First Division by a point.

But he always assured me that, no matter what, my job would be safe. I turned up for that meeting having been told it was to discuss new terms. Instead, I was told that I was being sacked.
