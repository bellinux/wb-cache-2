40|$|Dennett {{argues that}} we can <b>be</b> mistaken about <b>our</b> own {{conscious}} experience. Despite this, he repeatedly asserts {{that we can}} or do have unchallengeable authority of some sort in <b>our</b> <b>reports</b> about that experience. This assertion takes three forms. First, Dennett compares our authority {{to the authority of}} an author over his fictional world. Unfortunately, that appears to involve denying that there are actual facts about experience that subjects may be truly or falsely reporting. Second, Dennett sometimes seems to say that even though we may be mistaken about what <b>our</b> conscious experience <b>is,</b> <b>our</b> <b>reports</b> about “what it’s like to be us ” must be correct. That view unfortunately requires a nonstandard and (by Dennett) unremarked distinction between facts about consciousness and facts about “what it’s like”. Third, Dennett says that reports about experience may be “incorrigible”. However, that claim stands in tension with evidence, highlighted by Dennett himself, that seems to suggest that people can be demonstrably mistaken about their own experience. Dennett needlessly muddies his case against infallibilism with these unsatisfactory compromises...|$|R

The report {{focuses on}} City neighborhood-based public {{involvement}} processes, {{with an emphasis}} on neighborhood budgeting and planning. Our conclusion was that the City has established effective neighborhood budgeting and planning processes. The processes were generally consistent with the intent of Ordinance 27709 that authorized the Neighborhood Planning and Assistance Program in 1987, and Resolution 29015 that created a planning framework to respond to growth issues in designated urban villages. The information provided by Seattle citizens through neighborhood budgeting and planning efforts has been useful to City officials in decision-making processes. The audit contains findings and recommendations to refine the neighborhood involvement structure and better integrate City and neighborhood efforts to encourage consistent and broad representation of community groups in neighborhood processes. In addition, the City should clarify City and citizens ’ roles and responsibilities for neighborhood involvement efforts, particularly as new processes are developed. We received excellent cooperation from City departments and citizen representatives throughout our review process.

The monitoring effort consisted of a roadside survey along Interstate 5 and written correspondence with representatives from the United States Marine Corps, Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy, and the BN&SF Railway, formerly the AT&SF Railway. The types of hazards which could affect plant safety resulting from shipment of hazardous materials past the plant which were evaluated include: 1) asphyxiant, 2) toxic, 3) explosive, and 4) flammable. The results of this effort found the hazard to the plant from shipment of materials along Interstate 5 and the BN&SF Railway remains within the acceptance criteria of Standard Review Plan 2. 2. 3 and is therefore acceptable.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} test of {{the accuracy}} of the NNSS at the fixed positions in mid-lat zone have been reported by many researchers. We had the chance to pay a visit to Honiara at regular intervals through five years, and we did evaluation tests at low-lat zone. This <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>report</b> of the result of {{the accuracy of the}} NNSS. We calculated the positional errors between the station and the fixed positions by the NNSS, and abandoned extreme errors, consequently, the calculated results by the remaininig data showed 0. 3 NM southerly latitudinal deviation and only few longitudinal deviation. When the data were classified by conditions of observation, they showed the great value of RMS and low accuracy in the case of lower elevation angles (5 °～ 9 °). Therefore, when a high accuracy pssition is required, we should exclude the data of lower elevation angles, though in this case, the number of data goes down off about 10 percent. ホニアラ港におけるNNSSの精度については,測地系に対する補正値が得られないので断定は出来ないが,南寄りの定偏差があり,東西方向のそれは少ない. 測定条件によって区分してみると,夜間の電離層による影響でやや大きなばらつきを生ずる. 更に衛星の最大仰角によって定偏差が異なり,ばらつきの方向にも差があり,特に低高度(5 ～ 9 °) のばらつきが著しく,高精度の船位を要求される場合には,測定回数は約 1 割減少するものの,これらのデータはカットした方がよい. 長崎港の結果とは直接比較出来ないが,緯度方向の定偏差が大きく,全般的にばらつきが大きい傾向がみられるものの,データ数が少ないこともあり断定は出来ない...|$|E

40|$|We {{are pleased}} to submit our final report on the {{untethered}} scratch drive actuator. In this project, {{we were asked to}} analyze or improve a fundamental design based on the knowledge that we have accumulated during this course. We chose to explore the developing area of sensing and actuating technologies realized by the scratch drive actuator. This relatively new technology was chosen because we are all space engineers with a strong interest in robotics on the macroscopic scale, and the idea of researching robotics on the microscopic scale was very appealing. Our objective for this project was to gain an understanding of the basic mechanisms that the untethered scratch drive actuator is using, as well as to present an analytical and qualitative analysis of the devices themselves. Based on these analyses, we will attempt to predict future applications of the devices and their relative chances of success. While this was our first encounter with the untethered scratch drive actuator, we all did a considerable amount of research {{in order to understand the}} ideas presented in the technical reports on the device. Combined with the knowledge on microsystems gained in class, we feel that we now have a thorough and rigorous understanding of the device. The work that has already been done on this technology is quite impressive, and while we are not experts in the field, it has convinced us that the scratch drive actuator and its possible descendants have many far-ranging future applications. Enclosed <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>report.</b> We await your review of our project, Sincerely...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the central}} roles of the National Council is {{to work closely with}} the Nursing and Midwifery Planning and Development Units within each of the Health Boards to plan and make {{provision}} for additional funding for continuing education. This funding is over and above the normal funding that each Health Board has available for continuing education. It is intended to be used to address areas of continuing education that might not normally be funded. One of the most important functions of this funding would be to ensure that greater access to post-registration training/education and continuing professional development is provided. This newsletter contains a detailed report on the activities of the National Council over the past year in this area. These courses are for the benefit of all nurses and midwives. A large number of nurses and midwives will benefit from these courses in every branch of the profession. One of the regular features in this newsletter <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>report</b> on the progress of the Nurse and Midwife Prescribing Project, managed jointly by the National Council and An Bord Altranais.
