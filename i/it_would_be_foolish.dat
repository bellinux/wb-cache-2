5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, I see clearly <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish,</b> for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E
25|$|On December 6, 2006, Deming {{testified before}} the US Senate {{committee}} on the Environmental and Public Works, concluding that The amount of climatic warming {{that has taken place}} in the past 150 years is poorly constrained, and its cause--human or natural--is unknown. There is no sound scientific basis for predicting future climate change with any degree of certainty. If the climate does warm, {{it is likely to be}} beneficial to humanity rather than harmful. In my opinion, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to establish national energy policy on the basis of misinformation and irrational hysteria.|$|E

"I {{should not}} think of asking him for money; but when he offered me this small sum--for to him it is small--I could {{not think of}} refusing. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>foolish</b> when our funds are so low, and I shall soon be in a {{position}} to repay him." ...|$|R

She asked if <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too <b>foolish</b> to give such a name, and mamma said the only {{question}} <b>was,</b> whether she <b>would</b> like indifferent people to ask the reason of it.' ...|$|R
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN gave [...] "Now is Not the End" [...] a {{score of}} 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "Great" [...] episode, and praised the titular character, who he thought was [...] "expertly played" [...] by Atwell, {{as well as her}} dynamic with D'Arcy's Jarvis. Goldman felt that the period setting was used well, despite the episode feeling [...] "like a TV show compared to the Marvel movies (being a TV show and all)", and was happy that series was attempting to [...] "entertain on its own merits", rather than try [...] "to add some huge important element to [...] giant overarching storyline". Goldman did feel that Carter needed a more specific villain to fight, but stated that [...] "With only eight episodes, that hopefully will change quickly". Alan Sepinwall at HitFix found that the series had learned from the mistakes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and stood as its own entity. He praised Atwell's performance, the visual/period style, and D'Arcy as Jarvis, but he felt that Carter's sexist colleagues were cartoonish, saying [...] "not that sexism didn't exist in the era, but that it's a tough thing to dramatize from a modern perspective without feeling winky and smug. It's a dance many period dramas have to do, not always successfully, and while <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to pretend a woman like Peggy wouldn't have had to deal with these kinds of idiots all the time, Agent Carter is at its liveliest when the three stooges are nowhere to be seen".|$|E
2500|$|This {{provoked}} Hitler to send Canaris to Spain {{again in}} an effort to convince Franco to join the Axis and soften his [...] "outrageous" [...] demands. To the contrary, Canaris once more reminded Franco that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to join the side that was doomed to lose the war.|$|E
2500|$|Deming {{has criticized}} [...] "sustainability" [...] as a {{misleading}} concept, a chimera," [...] {{at least as}} far as it pertains to technology, pointing out that [...] "present day technologies and practices are never sustainable, nor should we expect them to be [...] [...] [...] [...] rojections of current technology into the future are always invalid because technology does not stand still [...] [...] [...] [...] echnological progress is our birthright and destiny." [...] In 2003, speaking at a meeting of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association, Deming said, [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to try to predict what our technological capabilities will be , just as it would have been foolish for someone from the 19th century to try to predict what we could do today." ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{military}} orders {{may have}} fought on foot as dismounted knights. This <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> favorable in circumstances were {{the ground was}} difficult or else too narrow for large numbers of cavalry.

5000|$|In particular, his {{chapter on}} Genghis Khan and the Mongol {{invasion}} {{runs counter to}} dominant European views of the time. Prefacing his introduction to the Mongol empire, which was larger than the British empire and lasted as long, he said: [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> not to recognize the greatness of Europe. But <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> equally <b>foolish</b> to forget the greatness of Asia." ...|$|R
2500|$|As president, however, Polk sought {{compromise}} and renewed the earlier offer {{to divide the}} territory in half along the 49thparallel, {{to the dismay of}} the most ardent advocates of manifest destiny. When the British refused the offer, American expansionists responded with slogans such as [...] "The Whole of Oregon or None!" [...] and [...] "Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!", referring to the northern border of the region. (The latter slogan is often mistakenly described as having {{been a part of the}} 1844 presidential campaign.) When Polk moved to terminate the joint occupation agreement, the British finally agreed in early 1846 to divide the region along the 49th parallel, leaving the lower Columbia basin as part of the United States. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 formally settled the dispute; Polk's administration succeeded in selling the treaty to Congress because the United States was about to begin the Mexican–American War, and the president and others argued <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> [...] to also fight the British Empire.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 May, German High Command grew very confident. The Allies seemed {{incapable}} {{of coping with}} events. There appeared to be no serious threat from the south – indeed General Franz Halder, Chief of Army General Staff, {{toyed with the idea}} of attacking Paris immediately to knock France out of the war in one blow. The Allied troops in the north were retreating to the river Scheldt, their right flank giving way to the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to remain inactive any longer, allowing them to reorganize their defence or escape. Now it was time to bring them into even more serious trouble by cutting them off. The next day the Panzer Corps started moving again, smashed through the weak British 12th and 23rd Territorial divisions, occupied Amiens and secured the westernmost bridge over the river Somme at Abbeville isolating the British, French, Dutch and Belgian forces in the north. In the evening of 20 May, a reconnaissance unit from 2nd Panzer Division reached Noyelles, [...] to the west, where they could see the estuary of the Somme flowing into The Channel.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar differ greatly {{on their}} views of Caesar and Brutus. Many have debated whether Caesar or Brutus is the protagonist of the play, because of the title character's death in Act Three, Scene One. But Caesar compares himself to the Northern Star, and perhaps <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> not to {{consider}} him as the axial character of the play, around whom the entire story turns. Intertwined in this debate is a smattering of philosophical and psychological ideologies on republicanism and monarchism. One author, Robert C. Reynolds, devotes attention to the names or epithets given to both Brutus and Caesar in his essay [...] "Ironic Epithet in Julius Caesar". This author points out that Casca praises Brutus at face value, but then inadvertently compares him to a disreputable joke of a man by calling him an alchemist, [...] "Oh, he sits high in all the people's hearts,/And that which would appear offence in us/ His countenance, like richest alchemy,/ Will change to virtue and to worthiness" [...] (I.iii.158-60). Reynolds also talks about Caesar and his [...] "Colossus" [...] epithet, which he points out has its obvious connotations of power and manliness, but also lesser known connotations of an outward glorious front and inward chaos.|$|E
6000|$|Flora {{changed her}} ground, and laughed. [...] "We {{are getting into}} the heroics," [...] she said, [...] "when <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very <b>foolish</b> to break up our plans, only because we have found a {{pleasant}} cousin. There is nothing serious in it, I dare say. How silly of us to argue on such an idea!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, no," [...] he said, with decision, [...] "it's {{only the}} old {{associations}} that it calls up, that's all. As for baccy, I've bin so long without it now, that I don't want it; and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> in me to rouse {{up the old}} cravin'. There, you light it, Jack.

50|$|My own attitude, which I {{share with}} many of my colleagues, is simply that {{mathematics}} is a language. Like English, or Latin, or Chinese, there are certain concepts for which mathematics is particularly well suited: <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as <b>foolish</b> to attempt to write a love poem {{in the language of}} mathematics as to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using the English language.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} always {{glad to see}} you down here, Bessy, you know, {{whenever}} you like to come; but it is certainly best for you and the young ones for you to accept the offer.

60|$|Teddy was not {{disposed}} {{to run from}} the enemy; but his companions insisted <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more than <b>foolish</b> to risk an encounter, and he {{allowed himself to be}} led away at a rapid pace.|$|R
6000|$|... "What you do mean, I think, is this;--that you owe {{a duty to}} your aunt, the {{performance}} of which is not altogether agreeable. Nevertheless <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> in you to omit it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What {{would you}} pay me, Mr. Wampole, if I joined you?” asked Leo cautiously. He {{did not like}} the man’s looks, but still thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to throw a chance of work aside.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Underwood {{would think}} that as bad as Edgar's drawing,' said Wilmet. 'No, no, Felix, you have learnt one {{business}} thoroughly, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to begin a fresh one now. Besides, how about Mr. Froggatt?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a mistake, my boy; you do {{care for}} <b>it,</b> and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very <b>foolish</b> {{if you did}} not. What you mean is, that, on this {{particular}} point, you value your love more than the world's opinion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a <b>foolish</b> {{thing to}} do, captain. There ain't no saying what redskins may be {{wandering}} {{in the woods}} in time of war.

60|$|He parted quite {{amicably}} from de Marmont, {{promising to}} call in upon him in the morning. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to quarrel with that young wind-bag now. He knew some things, and talked of a great many more.|$|E

40|$|It <b>was</b> a <b>foolish</b> {{moment when}} prime {{minister}} Bob Hawke promised that by 1990 no child in Australia <b>would</b> <b>be</b> living in poverty.

Likewise, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a <b>foolish</b> academic who would offer 'the solution' {{to the problem of}} asylum seekers. Intractable social problems do not have simple solutions.

2500|$|Archdeacon Richard Davies, a 17th-century Anglican cleric, {{wrote of}} Shakespeare: [...] "He dyed a Papyst". The Catholic Encyclopedia (1912) states that [...] "Davies, an Anglican clergyman, {{could have had}} no {{conceivable}} motive for misrepresenting the matter in these private notes and as {{he lived in the}} neighbouring county of Gloucestershire he may be echoing a local tradition" [...] but concludes that Davies' comment [...] "is by no means incredible, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> obviously <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to build too much upon an unverifiable tradition of this kind".|$|R
