40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the principles of}} a Home Automation system dedicated to power management that adapts power consumption to available power ressources according to user comfort and cost criteria. The system relies on a multi-agent paradigm. Each agent is embedded into a power resource or an equipment, which may be an environment (thermal-air, thermal-water, ventilation, luminous) or a service (washing, cooking), and cooperates and coordinates its action with others in order to nd acceptable near-optimal solution. The control algorithm is decomposed into two complementary mechanisms: an <b>emergency</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which protects from constraint violations, and an anticipation mechanism, which computes the best future set-points according to predicted consumptions and productions and to user criteria. The paper details a negotiation protocol used by the both mechanisms and presents some preliminary simulation results. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{critical}} function of sleep is to prevent uncontrolled neuronal feedback while allowing rapid responses and prolonged retention of short-term memories. Through learning the brain is tuned to react optimally to environmental challenges. Optimal behavior will often require rapid responses and the prolonged retention of short-term memories. At a neuronal level, these correspond to recurrent activity in local networks. Unfortunately, when a network exhibits recurrent activity, small changes in the parameters or conditions can lead to runaway oscillations. Thus, the very changes that improve the processing performance of the network can put it at risk of runaway oscillation. To prevent this, stimulus-dependent network changes should only be permitted {{when there is a}} margin of safety around the current network parameters.

30|$|Global {{petroleum}} {{demand is}} continually increasing and petroleum continues {{to represent a}} high proportion of energy consumption and is {{regarded as one of the}} most important resources in the world (British Petroleum 2015). Petroleum shortages, such as those caused by serious natural disasters, war or security incidents, will bring on an energy crisis that will negatively impact on normal social processes and life. The petroleum shortage emergency scheduling system can effectively ameliorate the problem of a petroleum shortage in a certain region. The USA, Germany and other developed countries have already built petroleum shortage emergency management systems and have enacted relevant management laws. However, China, the world’s second largest petroleum consumer after the USA (Asia Pacific Energy Research Center 2015), has not established an effective petroleum shortage <b>emergency</b> <b>mechanism</b> or a shortage emergency management department. In addition, the seriously unequal distribution of petroleum and the large gap in the consumption capacities between different regions highlight the regional conflicts of petroleum supply and demand in China (Lu and Gao 2016). Therefore, it is necessary to propose a petroleum shortage emergency scheduling system to alleviate the regional imbalance of the petroleum supply, especially in China.|$|E

40|$|Anaerobic energy-yielding {{processes}} in human tissues, as estimated from 02 -debt, have been {{thought to be}} important in the exertions of athletics (1, 2) or of hard work (3). Recent studies (4) have suggested that the anaerobic metabolism induced by hypoxia plays a part in almost all activity, whether severe or mild, although mild activity may be associated with 02 -debts too small to measure. Rather than an <b>emergency</b> <b>mechanism,</b> anaerobic metabolism may therefore {{be a part of the}} ordinary daily life of mammals. This anaerobic mechanism of energy supply is called forth by inadequacy of oxygen supply relative to tissue requirements, and the ability of the oxygen transport mechanisms to meet tissue demands may become the critical factor at specific levels of relative hypoxia (5). Therefore it seemed possible that in patients with diseases of the oxygen transport system (lungs, blood and circulation) tissue anaerobic metabolism might be even more important, and perhaps a significant determinant of physical disability. The older concept of 02 -debt (6) is a static one largely because of the manner of its measurement, but it has contributed a great deal to the understanding of oxygen supply which could not be learned from blood flow and oxygen concentrations alone.

40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{critical}} function of sleep [3] is to prevent uncontrolled neuronal feedback while allowing rapid responses and prolonged retention of short-term memories. The goal of learning is optimal behavior, and this sometimes requires the integration of sensory stimuli that are widely separated in time. At a neuronal level, this corresponds to persistent activity in local networks. Unfortunately, when a network exhibits persistent activity, small changes in the parameters or conditions can lead to runaway oscillations. Thus, the very changes that improve the processing performance of the network can put it at risk of runaway oscillation. To prevent this, stimulus-dependent plasticity should only be permitted {{when there is a}} margin of safety around the current network parameters. We propose that a critical role of sleep is to establish a margin of safety by exposing the network to a variety of conditions and inputs, observing for erratic behavior, and adjusting the parameters accordingly. During wakefulness this margin of safety is gradually consumed, ultimately requiring refreshment by another period of sleep. When sleep is not possible, an <b>emergency</b> <b>mechanism</b> comes into play to prevent runaway oscillations; this is done at the expense of processing efficiency, and constitutes tiredness. We contend that this theory matches the phenomenology of sleep and tiredness better than do alternative theories, such as the memory consolidation theory [1, 2, 5]. This theory also makes a number of novel testable predictions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the family}} Streptococcaceae, the genes {{encoding}} zinc ABC uptake systems (called zit or adc) are regulated by a coencoded MarR family member (i. e., ZitR or AdcR), {{whereas in the}} great majority of bacteria, these genes are regulated by Zur, the Fur-like zinc-responsive repressor. We studied the zit operon from Lactococcus lactis and its regulation in response to Zn(II) in vivo. zit transcription is repressed by Zn(II) in a wide concentration range starting from nontoxic micromolar levels and is derepressed at nanomolar concentrations. The level of zit promoter downregulation by environmental Zn(II) is correlated with the intracellular zinc content. The helix-turn-helix domain of ZitR is required for downregulation. In vitro, the purified protein is a dimer that complexes up to two zinc ligands per monomer and specifically binds two intact palindromic operator sites overlapping the - 35 and - 10 boxes of the zit promoter. DNA binding is abolished by the chelator EDTA or TPEN and fully restored by Zn(II) addition, indicating that the active repressor complexes Zn(II) with high affinity. These results suggest that derepression under starvation conditions could be an essential <b>emergency</b> <b>mechanism</b> for preserving Zn(II) homeostasis by uptake; under Zn(II) -replete conditions, the function of ZitR repression could be to help save energy rather than to avoid Zn(II) toxicity. The characterization of a MarR family zinc-responsive repressor in this report gives insight into the way Streptococcaceae efficiently adapt to Zn(II) fluctuations in their diverse ecological niches...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, the supernetwork {{theory is}} used to {{describe}} the cross-regional <b>emergency</b> scheduling <b>mechanism</b> for petroleum shortages. Based on the analysis of a cross-regional <b>emergency</b> scheduling <b>mechanism,</b> we proposed a supernetwork model to find the optimal strategy in a petroleum shortage emergency. Considering the emergency costs and time, we establish the entire emergency response targets and design the optimal rescue behaviour. To solve the problem, an effective algorithm was used to simulate and conduct the parameter analysis. The simulation comparison results show that the cross-regional petroleum emergency scheduling pattern is superior with low emergency costs and high petroleum output. The advantages of the cross-regional scheduling will be strengthened with an increase in emergency response capabilities and regional associations, but they will disappear after achieving the maximum emergency capability. However, the single-regional emergency dispatch is preferable for conditions with little vulnerability. These conclusions have certain guiding significance for the formulation of relevant emergency policies and provide useful thoughts for decision-making, regardless of cross-regional or single-regional scenarios.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} protein X {{provides}} {{the connection between}} damage to Escherichia coli DNA and inhibition of septation and cell division. This connection is needed to guarantee that each new bacterium receives a complete DNA copy. We present several new experiments here which demonstrate that {{the degree to which}} septation is inhibited following damage to DNA is correlated with the amount of protein X that is produced. Rifampin selectively blocks protein X production. This drug was shown to allow cells whose DNA had been damaged by nalidixic acid to resume septation. Several mutants formed septa-less filaments and also produced protein X at 42 °C; rifampin both inhibited their production of protein X and permitted them to form septa and divide. Essentially complementary results were obtained with a dnaA mutant which at 42 °C stopped making DNA, did not produce protein X, and continued to divide; added bleomycin degraded DNA, induced protein X, and inhibited septation. These results, as well as previous observations, are all consistent with the proposal that protein X is produced as a consequence of DNA damage and is an inhibitor of septation. We suggest that septation could require binding of a single-stranded region of DNA to a septum site in the membrane. Protein X could block this binding by combining with the DNA. This control could provide an <b>emergency</b> <b>mechanism</b> in addition to the usually proposed coordination in which completion of DNA synthesis creates a positive effector for a terminal step of septation. Or it could be the sole coordinating mechanism, even under unperturbed growth conditions...|$|E
40|$|Confocal laser {{scanning}} microscopy and the potentiometric fluorescence probe tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester were used to measure changes in membrane electrical potential (DeltaPsi(m)) in individual mitochondria after isolation or in the living cell. Recordings averaged over small mitochondrial populations revealed a gradual decline in DeltaPsi(m) caused by the light-induced generation of free radicals. Depolarization was attenuated by dithiothreitol or acidification. In contrast, individual organelles displayed rapid spontaneous depolarizations caused by openings of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP). Repetitive openings and closings of the pore gave rise to marked fluctuations in DeltaPsi(m) between the fully charged and completely depolarized state. Rapid spontaneous fluctuations in DeltaPsi(m) were observed in mitochondria isolated from rat heart and in mitochondria in living endothelial cells. The loss of DeltaPsi(m) of mitochondria in the living cell coincided with swelling of the organelle and the breakdown of long mitochondrial filaments. In the individual mitochondrion, oxidative stress initially triggered pore openings of shorter duration, before prolonged openings caused the complete dissipation of DeltaPsi(m) and a measurable efflux of larger solutes. Generalizing this scheme, we suggest that under conditions of prolonged oxidative stress and/or cellular Ca(2 +) overload, short openings of MTP might serve as an <b>emergency</b> <b>mechanism</b> allowing the partial dissipation of DeltaPsi(m), the fast release of accumulated Ca(2 +) ions and the decreased generation of endogenous oxygen radicals. In contrast, loss of matrix metabolites, swelling and other structural damage of the organelle render prolonged openings of the transition pore deleterious to mitochondria and to the cell...|$|E
40|$|This article aims {{to uncover}} the legal {{background}} behind the European Union’s response to the ongoing refugee crisis. Pursuant to its Agenda on Migration, the EU has implemented a wide set of legal, financial and operative measures to face {{the challenges of the}} mass inflows of refugees onto its territory. Some of these measures aim to respond to what was classified as the most pressing duty of saving lives in the Mediterranean and strengthening EU external borders. Others aim to uphold the EU’s international obligations and values by assisting the third countries most affected. A core set of measures was then introduced to repair the existing EU legal framework on asylum, proven as dysfunctional when faced with the unprecedented pressures of incoming refugees. These measures came about {{in the context of an}} already deficient Common European Asylum System, yet the Union still decided to place the Dublin Regulation as a starting point for all operative plans dealing with the refugee crisis within the Union territory. Although the Dublin Regulation was not envisaged to function in a time of crisis, all the EU measures introduced were in effect merely exceptions to that inherently inefficient system. On the other hand, a true <b>emergency</b> <b>mechanism</b> was not something the Union lacked during the crucial moments of creating an operative plan for the Agenda. The existing Union framework on asylum creates two quite different concepts for determining the Member State responsible for providing international protection to refugees – one for regular asylum procedures, and another for emergency situations. By choosing the former instead of the latter, the EU went for the wrong option. The author’s position is that the Union in its centralised capacity failed to activate an efficient legal framework to respond to a crisis of the present magnitude, thus creating a perfect ground for individual Member States to become the main actors of crisis management, each invoking its own political particularities and national interests. The outcome was polarisation of the Member States, every day moving farther away from the ever-closer Union...|$|E
