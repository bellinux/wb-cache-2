40|$|Neutron {{scattering}} elastic scans are a time-efficient {{method to}} obtain {{an overview of the}} dependence of the microscopic dynamics on a control parameter, usually the temperature. In the conventional treatment of elastic scan data multiple scattering is ignored. This leads to an inconsistency at low wave vector Q which is resolved by an additional fit parameter. In this paper a simple model of multiple scattering is presented which allows fitting the data without this <b>extraneous</b> <b>parameter.</b> Limits of the model are discussed and an application on elastic scan data from a glass-forming liquid is demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract — Lambda lifting is a {{technique}} for transforming a program with local function definitions into a program consisting only of global function definitions. The best known lambda lifting algorithm computes the minimal set of <b>extraneous</b> <b>parameters</b> needed by each function in O(n 3) steps by solving a system of set equations which are recursive if the functions in the program are mutually recursive. Mutually recursive functions give rise to strongly connected components in the call graph of a program. Danvy and Schultz observed that all functions in a strongly connected component can be given {{the same set of}} free variables as <b>extraneous</b> <b>parameters.</b> Based on this observation, they developed an O(n 2) graph-based lambda lifting algorithm. This article illustrates how Danvy’s and Schultz’s algorithm is an approximation of Johnsson’s algorithm for a certain class of programs and describes an O(n 3) graph-based lambda lifting algorithm that yields the same results as Johnsson’s algorithm.

40|$|In this paper, a {{nonlinear}} flapping equation {{for large}} inflow angles and flap angles is established {{by analyzing the}} aerodynamics of helicopter blade elements. In order to obtain a generalized flap equation, the Snel stall model was first applied to determine the lift coefficient of the helicopter rotor. A simulation experiment for specific airfoils was then conducted to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} Snel stall model as it applies to helicopters. Results show that the model requires no <b>extraneous</b> <b>parameters</b> compared to the traditional stall model and is highly accurate and practically applicable. Based on the model, the relationship between the flapping angle and the angle of attack was analyzed, as well as the advance ratio under the dynamic stall state...|$|R
40|$|Software systems should {{consist of}} simple, conceptually clean {{components}} interacting along narrow, well-defined paths. All too often, {{this is not}} reality: complex components end up interacting for reasons unrelated to the functionality they provide. We refer to knowledge within a component that is not conceptually required for the individual behaviour of that component as extraneous embedded knowledge (EEK). EEK creeps in to a system in many forms, including dependences upon particular names and the passing of <b>extraneous</b> <b>parameters.</b> This paper proposes implicit context {{as a means for}} reducing EEK in systems. Implicit context combines a mechanism to reflect upon what has happened in a system through queries on the call history with a mechanism for altering calls to and from a component. We demonstrate the benefits of implicit context by describing its use to reduce EEK in the Java Swing library...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapidly}} growing number of cosmic {{microwave}} background measurements on various scales, there is real hope {{that the number of}} acceptable models for structure formation will be limited to a very few in the near future. Yet any given model can always be saved by introducing and tuning <b>extraneous</b> free <b>parameters.</b> To better understand this question of "nature versus nurture" for temperature fluctuations, it is useful to know not only the general features of anisotropy predictions but also their causes. Extracting the physical content of our other works, we present here a simple account of cosmic microwave background anisotropies on all scales. In particular, we show that analytic approximations can trace the structure of the so-called "Doppler peaks," which arise due to the adiabatic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid. We also show how the finite thickness of the last scattering surface and the Silk damping mechanism can be described in a unified way by photon diffusion. In order to present a specific example, we focus on comparing the primordial isocurvature baryon (PIB) model with the standard cold dark matter model (CDM). In particular, we explain why PIB generically predicts larger non-oscillatory anisotropies from the 1 ^∘ to 10 ^∘ scale which may already be in conflict with experiments.

The conference proceedings may also be accessed online via Springer: Part I and Part II. International audienceWe studied the influence of visual feedback on the tactual perception of both speed and spatial period of a rotating texture. Participants were placed {{in a situation of}} perceptual conflict concerning the rotation speed of a cylindrical texture. Participants touched a cylindrical texture of gratings rotating around its axis at a constant speed, while they watched a cylinder without gratings rotating at a different speed on a computer screen. Participants were asked to estimate the speed of the gratings texture under the finger and the spacing (or spatial period) of the gratings. We observed that the tactual estimations of both speed and spacing co-varied with the speed of the visual stimulus, although the cylinder perceived tactually rotated at a constant speed. The first effect (speed effect) could correspond to the resolution of the perceptual conflict in favor of vision. The second effect (spacing effect) is apparently surprising, since no varying information about spacing was provided by vision. However, the physical relation between spacing and speed is well established according to every day experience. Thus, the <b>parameter</b> <b>extraneous</b> to the conflict could be influenced according to previous experience. Such cross-modal effects could be used by designers of virtual reality systems and haptic devices to improve the haptic sensations they can generate using simple (constant) tactile stimulations combined with visual feedback...|$|R
