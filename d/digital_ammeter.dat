50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>ammeter</b> designs use a shunt {{resistor}} {{to produce a}} calibrated voltage proportional to the current flowing. This voltage is then measured by a digital voltmeter, through use of an {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC); the digital display is calibrated to display the current through the shunt. Such instruments are often calibrated to indicate the RMS value for a sine wave only, but many designs will indicate true RMS within limitations of the wave crest factor.|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{examined}} the influence of temperature on the mean power out of silicon solar cell. Sensitive <b>digital</b> <b>ammeter</b> and voltage were connected in series and parallel across the silicon solar cell housed in a plastic encasement with clean anti –reflection with 100 W electric heater to provide variation of temperature which was kicked started with and increased in step up to. Open circuit, reverse bias current and voltage were taken at various temperatures and the mean power computed from the values of shunt resistance for all temperature values...|$|E
40|$|One {{major change}} of the future {{revision}} of the International System of Units (SI) is a new definition of the ampere based on the elementary charge e. Replacing the former definition based on Ampère's force law will allow one to fully benefit from quantum physics to realize the ampere. However, a quantum realization of the ampere from e, accurate to within 10 ^- 8 in relative value and fulfilling traceability needs, is still missing despite many efforts have been spent {{for the development of}} single-electron tunneling devices. Starting again with Ohm's law, applied here in a quantum circuit combining the quantum Hall resistance and Josephson voltage standards with a superconducting cryogenic amplifier, we report on a practical and universal programmable quantum current generator. We demonstrate that currents generated in the milliampere range are quantized in terms of ef_J (f_J is the Josephson frequency) with a measurement uncertainty of 10 ^- 8. This new quantum current source, able to deliver such accurate currents down to the microampere range, can greatly improve the current measurement traceability, as demonstrated with the calibrations of <b>digital</b> <b>ammeters.</b> Beyond, it opens the way to further developments in metrology and in fundamental physics, such as a quantum multimeter or new accurate comparisons to single electron pumps.

30|$|The SPV module (number 2007.20. 685) {{which is}} {{manufactured}} in the year 2007 by M/s Rajasthan Electronics and Instruments Ltd, Jaipur, India is studied. The module has been connected to a rheostat <b>ammeter</b> <b>digital</b> multimeter (DT 9205 A, Agronic Ltd.). Other instruments used are the digital thermometer (SE- 221 -P-K, Agronic Ltd.) to measure cell temperature, the Thermo-Hygro Clock (288 -CTH, Agronic Ltd.) to measure ambient temperature and humidity and digital luxmeter (range 0 to 50, 000 lux in three ranges of 0 to 2, 000, 0 to 20, 000, and 0 to 50, 000 lux; accuracy ± 5 %, ± 2 least count) to measure solar flux. Data are taken for one whole year from 2010 to 2011.|$|R
