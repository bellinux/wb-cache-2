40|$|A thermal-spike {{model has}} been applied to {{characterize}} the damage structure of the latent tracks generated by high-energy ion irradiations on LiNb O 3 through electron excitation mechanisms. It applies to ions having <b>electronic</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> both below and above the threshold value for lattice amorphization. The model allows to estimate the defect concentrations in the heavily damaged (preamorphized) regions that have not reached the threshold for amorphization. They include the halo and tail surrounding the core of a latent track. The existence of the preamorphized regions accounts for a synergy between successive irradiations and predicts a dependence of the amorphization threshold on previous irradiation fluence. The predicted dependence is in accordance with irradiation experiments using N (4. 53 MeV), O (5. 00 MeV), F (5. 13 MeV), and Si (5 and 7. 5 MeV). For <b>electronic</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> above the threshold value the model describes the generation of homogeneous amorphous layers and predicts the propagation of the amorphization front with fluence. A theoretical expression, describing this propagation, has been obtained that is in reasonable agreement with silicon irradiation experiments at 5 and 7. 5 MeV. The accordance is improved by including in a simple phenomenological way the velocity effect on the threshold. At the highest fluences (or depths) a significant discrepancy appears that may be attributed to the contribution of the nuclear collision damage. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

50|$|Computer {{simulation}} {{methods to}} calculate the motion of ions in a medium have been developed since the 1960s, and are now the dominant way of treating stopping power theoretically.

The new technique uses high-energy medium-mass ions, such as Cl, with <b>electronic</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> above the threshold value for amorphization (5 - 6 keV/nm), reaching the maximum value a few micrometers inside the crystal. At the ultralow fluence regime (1012 - 1013 cm- 2) an effective nanostructured medium is obtained that behaves as an optical waveguide where light propagates transversally to the amorphous nanotracks created by every single impact. The method implies a reduction of 4 orders of magnitude with respect to He implantation. The optical waveguides present reasonable losses (∼ 10 dB/cm) and significant second-harmonic generation (SHG) and electro-optic (EO) responses (> 50 % bulk) for the lowest fluences. © 2007 Optical Society of America.

50|$|The term {{electronic}} sputtering {{can mean}} either sputtering induced by energetic electrons (for example in a transmission electron microscope), or sputtering due to very high-energy or highly charged heavy ions that lose {{energy to the}} solid, mostly by <b>electronic</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>power,</b> where the electronic excitations cause sputtering.

50|$|The {{effect of}} {{irradiation}} on materials {{is rooted in}} the initial event in which an energetic projectile strikes a target. While the event is made up of several steps or processes, the primary result is the displacement of an atom from its lattice site. Irradiation displaces an atom from its site, leaving a vacant site behind (a vacancy) and the displaced atom eventually comes to rest in a location that is between lattice sites, becoming an interstitial atom. The vacancy-interstitial pair is central to radiation effects in crystalline solids and is known as a Frenkel pair (FP). The presence of the Frenkel pair and other consequences of irradiation damage determine the physical effects, and with the application of stress, the mechanical effects of irradiation by the occurring of interstitial, phenomena, such as swelling, growth, phase transition, segregation, etc., will be effected. In addition to the atomic displacement, an energetic charged particle moving in a lattice also gives energy to electrons in the system, via the <b>electronic</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>power.</b> This energy transfer can also for high-energy particles produce damage in non-metallic materials, as so called ion tracks.|$|E

However, their light yield for electron excitation {{has proven to be}} lower than that predicted by early models. New experimental data are needed to improve the theoretical understanding of the cathodoluminescence (CL) that will, in turn, lead to materials that are significantly brighter. Beside the existing CL and photo luminescence (PL) measurements, one can provide new information by studying ion-induced luminescence (IL). Ions penetrate substantially deeper than electrons and their light yield should therefore not depend on surface effects. Moreover, the energy density released by ions can be much higher than that of electrons and photons, which results in possible saturation effects, further testing the adequacy of models. We exposed the above yttrium compounds to three ion beams, H (3 MeV), C (20 MeV), Cu (50 MeV), which have substantially different <b>electronic</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>powers.</b> H was selected to provide an excitation close to CL, but without surface effects.

Since I+ 7 {{is one of the}} ions used, these measurements also simulate fission fragment damage in pyrochlores and identify a potential host lattice for inert matrix fuel. X-ray diffraction on the irradiated materials indicate amorphization in Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 at the lowest S-e used, and a transition to anion-deficient fluorite (Fm (3) over barm) structure with about 1 % decrease in volume in Nd 2 Zr 2 O 7 and Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 at higher S-e. In Nd 2 Zr 2 O 7 this is followed by amorphization and Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 does not amorphize even at the highest S-e employed. Raman analysis of Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 and Nd 2 Zr 2 O 7, indicate an increase of Zr coordination number after irradiation and the bands become broader due to disordering. Analysis of the results shows that the radiation susceptibility of these pyrochlores in the <b>electronic</b> <b>stopping</b> regime strongly depends on the radius ratio of A to B cations and hence on the energy required for formation of cation antisites and anion Frenkel pairs, similar to their susceptibility in the nuclear stopping regime.

40|$|Application {{of carbon}} {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) in various fields demands {{a thorough investigation}} of their stability under irradiation. Open structure, ability to reorganize and heal defects, and large surface-to-volume ratio of carbon nanotubes affect materials' radiation response so that it differs from their bulk counterparts. Despite the work conducted to this date, radiation damage and mechanisms governing the evolution of CNTs under irradiation are still deficient in fundamental understanding. This dissertation is aimed to comprehend and characterize radiation response and crystalline-to-amorphous transition in ion and electron irradiated carbon nanotubes using various techniques, including but not limited to, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. It shows that ion irradiation {{can be used to}} engineer properties of nanotubes in a controllable manner and significantly improve thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the material. This work also establishes the role of nuclear and <b>electronic</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> in thermal diffusivity enhancement: thermal properties of irradiated CNTs are governed by nuclear <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> of bombarding species. The change of thermal properties with irradiation is driven by two competing mechanisms: inter-tube displacement-mediated phonon transport and defect-induced phonon scattering. In addition to experiments, molecular dynamic simulations are used to confirm validity of the obtained results. Radiation damage in CNTs at various temperatures as a function of ion energy, flux and fluence is examined. Mechanisms governing crystalline-to-amorphous transition under electron and ion irradiations are explored, applicability of previously suggested models discussed, and new models introduced. The results show enhanced defect annealing at elevated irradiation temperatures, which delays the formation of amorphous regions.

Epitaxially-grown GaN layers (2 mu m thick) have been irradiated by 2. 0 MeV Au ions to 1. 0 x 10 (15) and 1. 4 x 10 (15) cm(- 2) at 155 K and to 7. 3 x 10 (15) cm(- 2) at 200 K. The irradiation-induced damage has been analysed by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy in a channelling direction (RBS/C). For a better determination of the ion-induced disorder profile, an iterative procedure and a Monte Carlo code (McChasy) are combined to analyse the ion channelling spectra. With increasing irradiation dose, separated amorphous layers develop from the sample surface and near the damage peak region. Formation of large nitrogen bubbles with sizes up to 70 nm is observed in the buried amorphous layer, while the surface layer contains small bubbles with a diameter of a few nanometres due to significant nitrogen loss from the surface. Volume expansion from 3 % to 25 % in the irradiated region is suggested by cross-sectional transmission electron microscope and RBS/C measurement. The anomalous shape of the Au distributions under three irradiations indicates out-diffusion of Au towards the sample surface. The results from the complementary techniques suggest that nitrogen is retained in the damaged GaN where the crystallinity is preserved. Once the amorphous state is reached in the surface region, GaN starts to decompose and nitrogen escapes from the surface. Furthermore, experimental results show considerable errors in both the disorder profile and the ion range predicted by the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter code, indicating a significant overestimation of <b>electronic</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> of Au ions in GaN...|$|R
