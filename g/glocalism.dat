Then Paragraph 2 deals with several very general fundamentals on semiotic activities and semiotic disciplines, on one hand, and forms of “trace inscriptions” and canonic dimensions of “width”, “height” and “depth” of Ragioneria, on the other hand; finally it identifies the languages {{as a sort of}} fil rouge for the formation and fruition of the signs of the entire discipline is suggested. Then Paragraph 3 deals with the principal language types of Ragioneria, highlighting the opportu-nity of tending to “stronger” languages as they equally consider the context (including the current “globalization”) and the content (from denotingfor designation, rather than evocatingon), with a progressive polarization towards “regionality” as “depth” of space and time, which nowadays is especially critical for the discipline. Finally Paragraph 4 deals with branches of regionality of Ragioneria, under the light of a geo-political, historical and cultural <b>glocalism,</b> and with languages of the discipline which best fit to the context of the so-called “internationalization” of the present and near likely future. On the whole, the paragraph draws the conclusions of the paper, aiming at the virtuous circle of a flexible multi-cultural harmonization, rather than at the vicious one of a rigid mono-cultural standardization...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of endless {{theoretical}} debates on the benefices and drawbacks of cultural globalisation {{and the emergence of}} a global culture, the present article analyses different aspects of the rise of the Indian Novel written in English (INE). It focuses on various strategies of cultural legitimation and global recognition INE has found in its various stages of evolution and on the recent fictional formulae it has adopted, in order to see {{the extent to which the}} “global” paradigm can be applied to this type of writing. The aim of the article is to demonstrate that INE, though usually associated to the idea of “global novel” – on account of its hybrid status as a “born translated” postcolonial text, its global circulation, international recognition, impressive sales figures and extraordinary success – traverses a moment of relative crisis. Currently considered a complex literary phenomenon in possession of a recognized protean character and a successful formula of integration on globalised cultural markets, INE seems to escape close categorisations, to defy paradigms and to promote its own formula of <b>glocalism.</b>             In order to meet this challenge, the article reviews some of the most important theoretical approaches to globalisation and glocalisation in relation to cultural productions, to the significant impact these have on the new economic and cultural reconfigurations of the contemporary world and to the clash between local and diasporic cultural identities. It also provides a short history of the evolution of the INE and of the current critical debates that divide the Indian literary stage on the issue of global versus local literatures in relation to such concepts as authenticity, cultural essentialism, cosmopolitanism and regionalism...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{apparent}} paradox of mutuality in Britain {{at the turn}} of the millennium. It contrasts the relative decline of building societies via demutualisation, against the continual governmental support for and growth of credit unions. It begins by constructing a cultural conceptualisation of mutuality, which comprises of four interrelated elements: trust, reciprocity/habit, longevity, and caution. These are formalised in an organisational model of cooperation, which seeks to explain how mutuals function in reality. Both these models are employed to assess the validity of competing explanations of contemporary mutuality. First, a functionalist interpretation, which assumes that demutualisation is an inevitable result of growth, is examined. Second, a neo-Marxist analysis, which believes resource appropriation by building society management, was the motivation for change. However, neither theory was substantiated by the evidence because they could not fully explain why demutualisation did not occur earlier or why new mutuals, namely credit unions, were being established. Consequently a third interpretation synthesising the Neo-Marxist thesis with a cultural post-modern glocal turn was developed. Accordingly, demutualisation occurred because building societies became disembedded from society. First, the culmination of paternalism produced a transformation in the trust relationship between members and management. Second, in the political and economic spheres, Thatcherism and globalisation marginalised any alternative perspectives to the neo-liberal narrative, through the commodification of the personal; discrediting and abasement of the mutual; and the imposition of a crypto-Utopian discourse. Alongside this assault on mutuality a counter-culture of opposition to globalisation, <b>glocalism,</b> created spaces for new mutuals, such as credit unions. Many of these entities deliberately prioritised social over economic objectives and based their attachment on a small locality. By examining mutuals holistically it is hoped that this thesis contributes to a sociological understanding of how cooperative organisations are affected by the state and hypercapitalism...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I discuss {{critically}} contemporary {{visual art}} exhibitions that {{have addressed the}} Balkans as a structure of representation. These exhibitions, fourteen in number, have been organised by international and local curators in Western and Central European cities and in the Balkan region between 1999 and 2006. I consider these exhibitions as ideological mechanisms which in their effects formulate Balkan "otherness", and sustain neoIiberal policies and market cultural particularities. Curatorial discourses are examined in relation to critiques of stereotypical representations of the Balkans, systematised in the discourse of Balkanism. The critique of Balkanism was elaborated in the 1990 s and 2000 s by theorists notably Maria Todorova and draw a distinction to Edward Said's notion of Orientalism. I adopt two methodological axes to {{provide the basis for}} my analysis of the exhibitions. The first axis addresses the Balkans as a concept which reflects the immaterial character of Western domination in the region; the second defines Balkan particularity in opposition to the universaIism of humanism and Marxism. These provide the critical basis for the analysis of "the Balkans" as a concept that systematises Balkan ambiguity as cultural particularity disregarding the materiality of the capitalist structures in which it has been formulated as yet another cultural product. In the exhibitions, the imaginary, immaterial character of the Balkans is manifested in the particularity of Balkan ambiguity and in concepts such as Balkan in-betweenness, heterotopia, invention, becoming, utopia and <b>glocalism,</b> all used in different ways to undermine the often rigid and authoritative universalist assumptions. In my view, the curatorial representations of the Balkans far from disputing Balkan stereotypes serve to typify Balkan particularity which is constructed as a brand name, and by so-doing naturalise the ideology of the universality of globalised capitalism which I understand as "false consciousness" and "cynical reason". Drawing upon Slavoj Zizek's idea of "parallax view", I contend that the Balkan stereotypical representations can only be contested if we change perspectives, engage with the universality of the "part of no-part" or class struggle and, therefore, question the very logic of capitalism which sustains the concept of the Balkans.

40|$|Literacy and {{immigration}} scholars have not considered how refugees and immigrants negotiate the subtle and important connections between marriage, literacy, and {{migration to the}} United States. This chapter attempts to move these understudied connections to the forefront and does so by examining {{the ways in which}} young Iraqi and Yemeni immigrant and refugee women and men strive to become literate and simultaneously search for husbands and wives. Investigating these social connections involved in finding the appropriate spouse inevitably brings researchers to the field of education, as those young immigrants considered find themselves in a crisis that brings educational, economic, political, and religious factors into play. And, in order to understand these interconnections we have to take seriously the issue of how transnationalism, the phenomenon of living locally with global connections, demonstrates both the local and global tensions of refugees and immigrants as they interact in shared cultural sites. Moreover, transnational literacy, as described in this chapter, is evoked as a means to sort through particular literacy practices that simultaneously foster status and knowledge and explain the youths’ sense of powerlessness and desperation as well as their perceptions of their success. The tension, between literacy as success and literacy as threat to marriage fosters crises of “glocal” proportions (see Robertson 1995; Sarroub, 2008). Measures taken by the young people to combat their own desperation by mobilizing literacy practices in the milieu of unfamiliar and often alien(ating) American cultural norms are the features that best express how <b>glocalism</b> can be understood. The working definition of literacy in the context of marriage and transnationalism is that of a social event that accounts for communication with and through print as well as talk and rituals. Thus, literacy is broadly conceived to encompass local activity such as reading and writing that can be tangibly documented in addition to the communication norms with which people convey meaning and communicate with others. “Situated” and “local” literacies are now commonplace names in the research literature (see Alvermann, Hinchman, Moore, Phelps, 2 ̆ 6 Waff, 2006; Barton, Hamilton, 2 ̆ 6 Ivanic, 2000; Lewis, Moje, 2 ̆ 6 Enciso, 2007; Rush, Eakle, 2 ̆ 6 Berger, 2007), but they also serve as an important reminder that in everyday life, people often do not distinguish among different types of literacies, such as school vs. home, print vs. oral communication, in the same ways that scholars of literacy do in relation to achievement in schools. For example, in transnational contexts that mix the oral rituals of Muslim weddings with the print literacies of U. S. visa and citizenship forms, literacy takes on more ambiguous and fluid roles. Young people engage in the literacy practices necessary to achieve certain expected ends (such as travel to find a spouse) and sometimes, {{as in the case of}} some young Muslim women, being literate and educated reduces their chances of finding a spouse from the homeland...|$|E
40|$|Cinema, as {{a complex}} social and {{cultural}} phenomenon, has been recently challenged by digital media cultures and aesthetics since the 1990 s. In this study, Hong Kong cinematic productions, blending the West and the East, and flexibly manoeuvring production and post-production with limited resources, are used to demonstrate the advent of new digital cinematic aesthetics and productions {{in the era of}} globalization and digitalization. The production culture and aesthetics of local cinema has been, to a great extent, internally modified by the impacts of digital media cultures and technologies, especially digital effects and computer animation of unprecedented imaginary spaces and perspectives for creative productions. The increasing complexity of digital cinematic productions and the rapidly changing cultural production systems bring in newcomers of alternative modes/choices of thoughts and interpretations, thus facilitating production/product differentiation and de-differentiation to cater for the increasing and changing demands of active audiences. The vigorous struggle for cultural representations in digital cinematic aesthetics by producers and consumers of disparate repertoires is the focus of analysis in this research. Empirical evidences suggest a new paradigmatic model to study cultural representations of digital cinematic aesthetics within contemporary creative systems of production and consumption. The findings generally support the advent of the ten new aesthetics of digital cinema as a global trend as well as a new <b>glocalism</b> in the Hong Kong cases. While most interviewed producers and audiences articulate the new characteristics of digital cinematic aesthetics, many audiences show disjunctive judgments toward those local filmmakers' treatments to cross-fertilize video game with their cinematic productions. This reveals the inevitability of internal modifications of organization cultures and representational practices to create new digital cinematic aesthetics and productions within new dynamics of digital media cultures and technologies in the fast changing media ecology. Hong Kong filmmakers and computer animators show their strength and flexibility to glocalize digital cinematic aesthetics and productions by integrating digital visual effects with local film and production cultures, especially in comedic and martial arts cinematic productions. However, it seems that there are larger discrepancies concerning the tastes and aesthetic judgments toward cultural representations in digital cinematic aesthetics by cross-fertilization with video game between general audiences and professionals. This study reflects that the rigid, director-oriented Hong Kong film production system is too demanding on the film director's independent ability of coordination and greatly influences the development of cultural representations in digital cinema by collective imaginative inputs of increasing complexity and flexibility. Producers and consumers of disparate repertoires of cultural practices contribute to the meaning construction of multiple layers of digital effects and computer animation by systematic coordination and collaboration. In other words, the "spectrum of cultural representations", as a framework, helps us understand the complexity and creativity of the new digital cinematic aesthetics from production to consumption practices. This study is a multidimensional investigation of the moments of creativity and struggles over organization cultures and representational practices by both cultural producers and audiences. There are case studies of the general trend of digital cinematic productions in Hollywood and the specific development of digital cinema in Hong Kong, as well as in China. From these empirical analyses, ten new characteristics of digital cinematic aesthetics are generalized. They include (l) amplification, (2) free referencing, (3) seamlessness and believability, (4) multiple-layered composition, (5) patterning, (6) imaginary perspectives, (7) collective imaginative inputs, (8) cross-fertilization with comic, (9) cross-fertilization with video game, and (10) cross-cultural, cross-historical, cross-genre production. Such inductive findings are also deployed to study the social functions of both producers and audiences in the meaning construction of digital cinematic aesthetics and productions within the dynamics of digitalization and globalization. Eighteen in-depth interviews of production insiders, five focus groups of disparate generations of movie audiences and amateurs, and eleven case studies of Hong Kong digital cinematic productions have been examined. The empirical validity about the ten new forms of digital cinematic aesthetics and their production and consumption is investigated, and also achieved by intensive and interactive case studies, production studies and audience studies, combining textual and discourse analyses and production and reception analyses.
