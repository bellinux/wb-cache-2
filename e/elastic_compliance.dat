40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{establish}} a methodology to determine the equivalent elastic properties of fractured rock masses by explicit representations of stochastic fracture systems, and to investigate the conditions for the application of the equivalent continuum approach for representing mechanical behavior of the fractured rock masses. A series of numerical simulations of mechanical deformation of fractured rock masses at different scales were conducted with a large number of realizations of discrete fracture networks (DFN), based on realistic fracture system information and using the two-dimensional distinct element program, UDEC. General theory of anisotropic elasticity was used for describing the macroscopic mechanical behavior of fractured rock masses as equivalent elastic continua. Verification of the methodology for determining the <b>elastic</b> <b>compliance</b> tensor was conducted against closed-form solutions for regularly fractured rock mass, leading to very good agreements. The main advantage of the developed methodology using the distinct element method is that it can consider complex fracture system geometry and various constitutive relations of fractures and rock matrix, and their interactions.

Understanding the effects of fracture geometrical distribution, such as length, spacing, persistence and orientation, is important for quantifying the mechanical behavior of fractured rock masses.

As an illustration, the explicit secular equation is obtained for surface waves in incompressible monoclinic materials with the symmetry plane at x_ 3 = 0.

The displacements and stresses for surface waves are often {{expressed in terms of}} the elastic stiffnesses, which can be unbounded in the incompressible limit.
