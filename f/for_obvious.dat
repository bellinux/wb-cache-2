5|$|Neuropsychological tests {{such as the}} mini–mental state {{examination}} (MMSE) are widely {{used to evaluate the}} cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. Neurological examination in early AD will usually provide normal results, except <b>for</b> <b>obvious</b> cognitive impairment, which may not differ from that resulting from other diseases processes, including other causes of dementia.|$|E
5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, <b>for</b> <b>obvious</b> reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E

25|$|Although {{successful}} as a precision timekeeper, the Admiralty <b>for</b> <b>obvious</b> reasons wanted a timekeeper on every major ship, and Kendall's {{was too expensive}} and took too long to make. Kendall made a simplified version (K2) in 1771, leaving out the complicated remontoir system. But the result was still too costly and, moreover, not as accurate as the original.|$|E

25|$|Both the Eastern {{practice}} of alchemy and the later Western practice are remarkably similar in their methods and ultimate purpose. To be sure, {{the desire to}} create an elixir of immortality was more appealing to the Taoists, but European alchemists were not averse to seeking out formulas for various longevity-boosting substances. The secret of transmuting one element into another, specifically base metals into gold or silver, was equally explored by both schools <b>for</b> <b>obvious</b> reasons.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{research}} has established that Arnold's success was {{not due to}} the form of detent escapement, but to his original methods of adjusting the balance spring for positional errors by manipulating the overcoil terminal curve. <b>For</b> <b>obvious</b> reasons, Arnold tried to keep these methods secret, certainly it is recorded that he clearly expressed his concerns about possible plagiarism to Earnshaw, warning him {{in no uncertain terms}} not to use his Helical balance spring.|$|E

25|$|Placing {{the hand}} of a dead or {{unconscious}} person on a scanner to gain unauthorized access has become a common plot device. However, a MythBusters episode revealed that this doesn't work (at least with the scanners available to the program). But Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman found a way to convert fingerprints lifted from the hand to a photographic form that the sensor would accept. <b>For</b> <b>obvious</b> reasons, they refuse to reveal the technique.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>obvious</b> reasons, the Talmud adds to {{the biblical}} {{regulations}} a prohibition against consuming poisoned animals. Similarly, the Yoreh De'ah prohibits the drinking of water, if the water had been left overnight and uncovered {{in an area where}} there might be serpents, on the basis that a serpent might have left its venom in the water. In a place where there is no suspicion of snakes, this prohibition does not apply (tosafos, beitzah 6a).|$|E
25|$|When {{isolated}} from the base-camp, on distant sorties or remote observations, it was prudent for only the skilled radio operators {{to establish and maintain}} medium and/or long range communications (a life-line for evacuation, re-supply, etc.) often assisted by a fugacious relay station tactically placed in an expedient vicinity (higher ground). The use of Morse code decreased after the introduction of more reliable radios. <b>For</b> <b>obvious</b> reasons, at least one skilled radio operator had to be present (even if alone for a while) on observation posts and relay stations, as maintaining a constant connection to the base-camp and/or JOC was critical for successful outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Paul {{denounced the}} {{reporting}} on these newsletters as “old news {{that has been}} rehashed {{for over a decade}} … once again being resurrected <b>for</b> <b>obvious</b> political reasons.” In a statement put out by his campaign, Paul said further that “the quotations in The New Republic article are not mine and do not represent what I believe or have ever believed. I have never uttered such words and denounce such small-minded thoughts.” He blamed the articles on several ghostwriters who had contributed to the newsletters, which {{he said he did not}} edit, while he was busy practicing medicine full-time.|$|E
25|$|With {{interest}} growing, {{the members}} {{decided that it}} was time to formalize the group and scheduled a meeting for September 10, 1889. Seventeen men showed up for this first official gathering, which resulted in the election of Brother Fairchild as leader of the group. The office he assumed was dubbed “King Devil,” in honor of the moniker the brotherhood had earned. Brother Sidney D. Smith was elected Secretary on the same day and the basics began to take shape. They immediately decided to limit membership to Master Masons <b>for</b> <b>obvious</b> reasons. It was also voted that Brothers R.R. Riddell and H.P. Tompkins would be the first candidates for the Order and an initiation date was set.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 28 {{overhead}} gantries {{were set up}} along {{the boundaries of the}} RZ, including the areas surrounding Orchard Road. These gantries were monitored by auxiliary police officers who carried out visual checks and recorded any violations. Fines were usually S$70 and <b>for</b> <b>obvious</b> traffic management reasons, licences were not sold at the control points of the RZ. Users had to buy, in advance, a special paper licence at a cost of S$3 per day, which was sold at post offices, petrol stations, area licence sales booths or convenience stores, on a monthly or daily basis. This licence was displayed on the car windscreen or on the handle bars for motorcycles during hours of operation. Initially, they were 7.30 am to 9.30 am daily, except on Sundays and public holidays. However, it soon had to be extended to 10.15 am, to control the surge of vehicles waiting to enter just after 9.30 am. In 1989, the evening peak had to be restricted too, and in 1994, the ALS was extended from 7.30 am to 6.30 pm.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, on Caladan, Duke Leto Atreides bids Duncan Idaho farewell. Duncan {{is headed}} for Ginaz, where he will study to become a swordmaster. Leto and his friends, Kailea and Rhombur Vernius, are still {{struggling}} to liberate the siblings' former homeworld, but they have made little progress so far. Kailea becomes Leto's concubine, though he refuses to marry her <b>for</b> <b>obvious</b> political reasons. Rhombur seeks out a companion from the Bene Gesserit order and is matched with a young woman named Tessia who gives him {{a new sense of}} drive and purpose. After receiving a plea for help from C'tair Pilru, an Ixian rebel, Rhombur begins supplying the Ixian resistance with limited aid, though his attempts are greatly hindered by the Emperor's Sardaukar. Kailea soon gives birth to Leto's son, Victor. After the child's birth, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her role as Leto's concubine, wanting the Duke to marry her so that their son can succeed his father someday. Kailea's lady-in-waiting, Chiara, is actually a Harkonnen agent sent to poison Kailea's mind against Leto.|$|E
25|$|In stylistic {{terms the}} motets of the Gradualia form a sharp {{contrast}} {{to those of the}} Cantiones sacrae publications. The vast majority are shorter, with the discursive imitative paragraphs of the earlier motets giving place to double phrases in which the counterpoint, though intricate and concentrated, assumes a secondary level of importance. Long imitative paragraphs are the exception, often kept for final climactic sections in the minority of extended motets. The melodic writing often breaks into quaver (eighth-note) motion, tending to undermine the minim (half-note) pulse with surface detail. Some of the more festive items, especially in the 1607 set, feature vivid madrigalesque word-painting. The Marian hymns from the 1605 Gradualia are set in a light line-by-line imitative counterpoint with crotchet pulse which recalls the three-part English songs from Songs of sundrie natures (1589). <b>For</b> <b>obvious</b> reasons, the Gradualia never achieved the popularity of Byrd's earlier works. The 1607 set omits several texts, which were evidently too sensitive for publication {{in the light of the}} renewed anti-Catholic persecution which followed the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. A contemporary account which sheds light on the circulation of the music between Catholic country houses, refers to the arrest of a young Frenchman named Charles de Ligny, who was followed from an unidentified country house by spies, apprehended, searched and found to be carrying a copy of the 1605 set. Nevertheless, Byrd felt safe enough to reissue both sets with new title pages in 1610.|$|E
500|$|Rashid Khalidi states about Darwaza, [...] "Moved {{as he was}} by {{the civilization}} of Arabs, he evoked a distant Arab past. <b>For</b> <b>obvious</b> reasons Islam was central to that past. But {{in the case of}} Darwaza, Islam was {{important}} not as the binding substance of the nation, but as a culture and civilization. In other words, culture, language, and history not religious solidarity were posited as the glue that was to hold the Arab nation together." [...] According to Khalidi, Darwaza contributed to Arab nationalism in the practical and intellectual domains greatly.|$|E
