These compounds were thermoplastically {{incorporated into a}} low-density polyethylene matrix via solid inert carriers [wood flour (WF) and talc and molecular sieves] with physically immobilized EOs. The concentrations of the antibacterial modifiers on the carriers and in the resulting composites were determined with three chromatographic techniques (gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, pyrolysis and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography). The effects of such modifications to the mechanical properties of the prepared composites were studied by stress-strain analysis. Interactions on the polymer matrix carriers were observed by scanning electron microscopy. The prepared composites were also tested for antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains. The highest efficiency of isothermal immobilization was found for systems consisting of ALY and WF. This finding was in accordance with microbiological studies. The phase of immobilizing the EOs did not influence the mechanical properties of the studied composites. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, <b>Inc.</b> <b>Ministry</b> of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech Republic within the NPU I program [LO 1504]; EUPRO [LE 12002]; Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University in Zlin [IGA/CPS/ 2015 / 003]; Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology of the Republic of Slovenia [P 4 - 0015...|$|E

40|$|Group C {{rotavirus}} (GpCRV) has {{a worldwide}} distribution; however, its epidemiology and ecology are still unclear. Evidence {{for a possible}} zoonotic role has been postulated recently for Brazilian children strains. The {{aim of this study}} was to monitor GpCRV in children <= 15 years with acute gastroenteritis during the 2007 - 2010 national Brazilian rotavirus surveillance, and to undertake the molecular characterization of the major VP 6 capsid protein. A total of 3, 019 fecal samples were first screened for Group A rotavirus (GpARV). A total of 2, 205 GpARV ELISA negative samples were tested further for the presence of GpCRV by SDS-PAGE, electronic microscopy, and RT-PCR for the VP 6 gene. The genetic diversity of GpCRV was carried out by sequencing the VP 6 gene. GpARV and GpCRV infections were detected in 24. 6 % (742 / 3, 019) and 0. 3 % (8 / 3, 019), respectively. The GpCRV detection rate increased from 0. 2 % (1 / 422) in 2007 to 1 % (7 / 708) in 2008, and GpCRV cases were not detected in 2009 and 2010. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the strains belonged to the human lineage, and showed a genetic relationship with the GpCRV strain from Japan isolated in 2009. None of the study sequences was related closely to animal GpCRV strains. This study provides further evidence that GpCRV is a minor cause of acute childhood gastroenteritis in Brazil, and does not suggest that GpCRV may assume epidemiological importance in the future, even after the introduction of a GpARV vaccine. In addition, the molecular analyses of the GpCRV samples in this study do not support the zoonotic hypothesis. J. Med. Virol. 83 : 1631 - 1636, 2011.

During this period, Sox 5 expression is maintained in the crest-derived satellite glial cells in all the cranial ganglia. In contrast, Sox 5 is only transiently expressed in a subpopulation of differentiating neurons of both neural crest and placode origin.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{have demonstrated that}} the adipose tissue plays {{a central role in}} regulating overall energy balance. Obesity results from a chronic deregulation of energy balance, with energy intake exceeding energy expenditure. Recently, new mechanisms that control the obesity phenotype such as the equilibrium between white and brown adipose tissue function has been identified. In this context, it is becoming increasingly clear that in addition to cellular growth, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) also regulate lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in white and brown differentiation programs focusing on AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways, which may play differential roles in white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue development. In view of the worldwide epidemic of obesity and its associated metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, targeting these kinases may represent a potential approach for reducing adiposity and improving obesity-related diseases.

The {{purpose of the study}} was to identify the most effective methods of preventing burnout among practicing social workers, as well as the best interventions should burnout symptoms become present. The five leadership domains of organization, education, professional associations, personal support (interpersonal), and self-care (intrapersonal) and two leadership styles of transactional and transformational are examined to help identify these “best practices. ” The methodology for the study included a review of literature, completion of questionnaires by social workers currently working at SET <b>Ministry,</b> <b>Inc.,</b> in Milwaukee, WI, and a focus group comprised of Milwaukee community leaders. The data gathered were then reviewed and analyzed to form conclusions and develop recommendations for the five leadership domains. The findings and analysis showed that each questionnaire respondent had suffered at least one of the 13 burnout symptom indicators at some point in their career. The most common burnout symptoms were stress, frustration, and fatigue. In addition, the same strategies social workers used to overcome previous burnout symptoms are the strategies they continue to use to prevent burnout today. The most sustainable practitioner will be partners in transformational leadership with members of the leadership domains. Recommendations include developing collaborative relationships between universities and social work agencies to ensure the social work student receives tools for self-care to prevent burnout symptoms from occurring. Formal mentoring programs within the workplace as well as an in-house support group for social workers are recommended as well as more transparent communication between leadership at SET <b>Ministry,</b> <b>Inc.</b> and the social work staff.

40|$|Nitroxidative {{stress in}} cells occurs mainly through {{the action of}} {{reactive}} nitrogen and oxygen species (RNOS) on protein thiol groups. Reactive nitrogen and oxygen species- mediated protein modifications are associated with pathophysiological states, but can also convey physiological signals. Identification of Cys residues that are modified by oxidative stimuli still poses technical challenges and these changes have never been statistically analyzed from a proteome-wide perspective. Here we show that GELSILOX, a method that combines a robust proteomics protocol with a new computational approach that analyzes variance at the peptide level, allows a simultaneous analysis of dynamic alterations in the redox state of Cys sites and of protein abundance. GELSILOX permits the characterization of the major endothelial redox targets of hydrogen peroxide in endothelial cells and reveals that hypoxia induces {{a significant increase in}} the status of oxidized thiols.

40|$|During {{the course}} of evolution, viruses have learned to take {{advantage}} of the natural resources of their hosts for their own benefit. Due to their small dimension and limited size of genomes, bacteriophages have optimized the exploitation of bacterial host factors to increase the efficiency of DNA replication and hence to produce vast progeny. The Bacillus subtilis phage φ 29 genome consists of a linear double-stranded DNA molecule that is duplicated by means of a protein-primed mode of DNA replication. Its genome has been shown to be topologically constrained at the size of the bacterial nucleoid and, as to avoid generation of positive supercoiling ahead of the replication forks, the bacterial DNA gyrase is used by the phage. In addition, the B. subtilis actin-like MreB cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the organization of φ 29 DNA replication machinery in peripheral helix-like structures. Thus, in the absence of an intact MreB cytoskeleton, φ 29 DNA replication is severely impaired. Importantly, MreB interacts directly with the phage membrane protein p 16. 7, responsible for attaching φ 29 DNA at the cell membrane. Moreover, the φ 29 -encoded protein p 56 inhibits host uracil-DNA glycosylase activity and has been proposed to be a defense mechanism developed by the phage to prevent the action of the base excision repair pathway if uracil residues arise in replicative intermediates. All of them constitute incoming examples on how viruses have profited from the cellular machinery of their hosts. © 2012 Elsevier <b>Inc.</b> Spanish <b>Ministry</b> of Science and Innovation (BFU 2008 - 00215); Fundación Ramón ArecesPeer Reviewe...|$|R

Results: Lifetime social fears are quite common in both developed (15. 9 %) and developing (14. 3 %) countries, but lifetime SAD {{is much more}} common in the former (6. 1 %) than latter (2. 1 %) countries. Among those with SAD, persistence, severity, comorbidity, and treatment have dose response relationships with number of social fears, with no clear nonlinearity in relationships that would support a distinction between generalized and non-generalized SAD. The distinction between performance fears and interactional fears is generally not important in predicting these same outcomes.

Forty-five Wistar rats aged 36 to 42 days and weighing 200 to 230 g were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 20), which received distilled water, and an experimental group (n = 25), which received 2 weekly doses of 1 mg/kg of chemically pure sodium alendronate. The animals were killed after 60 days of treatment. The tibias were removed for analysis of bone mineral density by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Then, the maxillary incisors were extracted for analysis of the mineralized dental tissues using fluorescence spectroscopy (FS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), bright field microscopy (BFM), and cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH) testing. DXA and CSMH data were subjected to statistical analysis by Kruskal-Wallis test (5 % significance level). The experimental group presented higher bone mineral density than the control group by DXA. FS analysis revealed presence of alendronate in the mineralized dental tissues of the specimens of the experimental group. Significant morphological differences were not found by SEM and BFM. Enamel and dentin (100 and 300 mu m from the dentinoenamel junction) CSMH data did not show significant difference between the control and experimental groups. Based on the obtained results, we conclude that while alendronate increased the bone mineral density and was incorporated into the mineralized dental tissues it did not cause significant alterations in the morphology and microhardness of rat incisor enamel and dentin.
