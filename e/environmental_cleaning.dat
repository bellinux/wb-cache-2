50|$|One method found {{effective}} is {{to screen}} and isolate incoming patients from other facilities, and renew focus on hand-washing.

50|$|Although a {{consensus}} exists {{for the need}} of prevention protocols, infection control practices often vary among hospitals, even within close geographic area. In a survey of 15 hospitals within the Toronto area, many hospitals employed varying combinations of basic infection control practices. Eight different practices were observed among the 15 hospitals, some of which included {{in the most recent}} publication of guidelines from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Some of these recommendations include laboratory testing, active surveillance, screening (rectal swab, urine culture), hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, <b>environmental</b> <b>cleaning,</b> laundry waste management, and isolation with dedicated equipment and nursing staff. However, only five hospitals had written policies describing how to respond to an outbreak. Many public health initiatives are moving towards a more standardized approach at multiple levels: among local facilities (especially long-term and acute care), regional hospitals, national institutions, and global practices. A standardized approach of prevention may help to more effectively reduce the emergence of CRE.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Researching Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals (REACH) {{study will}} {{generate}} {{evidence about the}} effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel cleaning initiative that aims to improve the environmental cleanliness of hospitals. The initiative is an <b>environmental</b> <b>cleaning</b> bundle, with five interdependent, evidence-based components (training, technique, product, audit and communication) implemented with environmental services staff to enhance hospital cleaning practices. Methods/design: The REACH study will use a stepped-wedge randomised controlled design to test the study intervention, an <b>environmental</b> <b>cleaning</b> bundle, in 11 Australian hospitals. All trial hospitals will receive the intervention and act as their own control, with analysis undertaken of the change within each hospital based on data collected in the control and intervention periods. Each site will be randomised {{to one of the}} 11 intervention timings with staggered commencement dates in 2016 and an intervention period between 20 and 50 weeks. All sites complete the trial {{at the same time in}} 2017. The inclusion criteria allow for a purposive sample of both public and private hospitals that have higher-risk patient populations for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The primary outcome (objective one) is the monthly number of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemias (SABs), Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) infections, per 10, 000 bed days. Secondary outcomes for objective one include the thoroughness of hospital cleaning assessed using fluorescent marker technology, the bio-burden of frequent touch surfaces post cleaning and changes in staff knowledge and attitudes about <b>environmental</b> <b>cleaning.</b> A cost-effectiveness analysis will determine the second key outcome (objective two) : the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from implementation of the cleaning bundle. The study uses the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (iPARIHS) framework to support the tailored implementation of the <b>environmental</b> <b>cleaning</b> bundle in each hospital. Discussion: Evidence from the REACH trial will contribute to future policy and practice guidelines about hospital <b>environmental</b> <b>cleaning.</b> It will be used by healthcare leaders and clinicians to inform decision-making and implementation of best-practice infection prevention strategies to reduce HAIs in hospitals.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of antibiotic resistant bacteria {{is a serious}} public health issue affecting millions of people. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) is {{a leading cause of}} healthcare acquired infections today. Research has shown that patients infected or colonized with MRSA shed the bacteria into the environment, where the bacteria can survive {{for long periods of time}} and become potential sources of infection. Currently, infection prevention efforts focus on active surveillance, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment use and antimicrobial stewardship, with less attention given to <b>environmental</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Nevertheless, <b>environmental</b> <b>cleaning</b> is essential to remove infectious agents from environmental surfaces and prevent transmission. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of <b>environmental</b> <b>cleaning</b> programs in removing MRSA from environmental surfaces at an acute care hospital and a long-term care facility. Environmental swabs or sponge samples were collected from five locations (floor, television remote, call bell, bathroom doorknob and bed rail) pre- and post-terminal cleaning from the rooms of patients infected or colonized with MRSA. These swabs or sponges were then analyzed through culture isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the presence of MRSA. A total of 120 environmental samples were obtained from two medical facilities. Culture analysis followed by confirmatory PCR analysis for the mecA gene showed that 18 of the 120 samples (15 %) were positive for the presence of MRSA of which 16 were collected pre-cleaning (89 %), and 2 were collected post-cleaning (11 %). The location of the positive pre-cleaning samples included the floor (5), call bell (4), bed rail (4), bathroom doorknob (2) and TV remote (1), and the positive post-cleaning samples included the floor (1) and call bell (1). The results confirm the presence of MRSA on surfaces in patient rooms and suggest that <b>environmental</b> <b>cleaning</b> was effective, but there is potential for rooms to remain contaminated. Future research should focus on identifying the most effective cleaning programs to ensure rooms are safe for patients...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the range of cleaning practices and processes in 11 Australian hospitals and to discuss the challenges this variation poses to the implementation of clinical trials or changes to hospital cleaning practices. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used to determine cleaning practices and processes in hospitals participating in the ‘Researching Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals’ (REACH) study. A standardised template and approach was used to collect information. Data collection activities included structured on-site discussions, a review of hospital practices and a document review of policy and procedural documents related to cleaning. Results Variations in the auditing process used to evaluate <b>environmental</b> cleanliness, <b>cleaning</b> practices, product use, training and communication pathways available to cleaning staff were identified. There was also variation in workforce structure and responsibilities for cleaning. Conclusion This paper is the first to describe the differences in cleaning practices between Australian hospitals. The variations identified present a number of challenges for the conduct of research and have important implications for both monitoring of and standards for cleanliness. These challenges include implementing a practice change or cleaning study where hospitals have different processes, practices and structures...|$|R
