5|$|South Dakota can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} three regions: eastern South Dakota, western South <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> the Black Hills. The Missouri River serves as a somewhat stark boundary in terms of geographic, social and political differences between eastern and western South <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> the geography of the Black Hills differs from its surroundings {{to such an extent}} that it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. South Dakotans also at times combine the Black Hills with the rest of western South <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> refer to the two resulting regions, divided by the Missouri, as West River and East River.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} three regions: eastern South Dakota, western South <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> the Black Hills. The Missouri River serves as a boundary in terms of geographic, social, and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota. The geography of the Black Hills, long considered sacred by Native Americans, differs from its surroundings {{to such an extent}} it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. At times the Black Hills are combined with the rest of western South <b>Dakota,</b> <b>and</b> people often refer to the resulting two regions divided by the Missouri River as West River and East River.|$|E
5|$|The Black Hills are in {{the southwestern}} part of South <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> extend into Wyoming. This range of low {{mountains}} covers , with peaks that rise from 2,000 to 4,000feet (600 to 1,200m) above their bases. The Black Hills are the location of Black Elk Peak (7,242ft or 2,207m above sea level), the highest point in South <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> also the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Two billion-year-old Precambrian formations, the oldest rocks in the state, form the central core of the Black Hills. Formations from the Paleozoic Era form the outer ring of the Black Hills; these were created between roughly 540 and 250million years ago. This area features rocks such as limestone, which were deposited here when the area formed the shoreline of an ancient inland sea.|$|E

5|$|Treaties between European {{settlers}} and the <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands {{and on to}} smaller reservations. In 1861, residents of Mankato formed the Knights of the Forest, with a goal of eliminating all Indians from Minnesota. As conditions deteriorated for the Dakota, tensions rose, leading to the Dakota War of 1862. The result of the six-week war was the execution of 38 <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> the exile {{of most of the}} rest of the Dakota to the Crow Creek Reservation in Dakota Territory. As many as 800 white settlers died during the war.|$|E

5|$|A growing {{population}} and political concerns (admitting two states meant having four new senators for the Republican Party) caused Dakota Territory {{to be divided}} in half and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations formally admitting South <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> North Dakota to the union on November 2, 1889.

5|$|Also in {{the state}} are the shorter Interstates 190, a spur into central Rapid City, and 229, a loop around {{southern}} and eastern Sioux Falls.

South <b>Dakota</b> <b>and</b> Montana are the only states sharing a land border which is not traversed by a paved road.|$|E
5|$|On 10March 1953, No.30 Transport Unit re-formed as No.36 (Transport) Squadron, {{which had}} disbanded the {{previous}} day at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales.
