5|$|Construction on {{the second}} {{platform}}, an island platform connected via a pedestrian overpass, began in January 2014 with the closure of Mukilteo Lane near the station.

The $11 million project, designed by AECOM and HNTB in 2012, was originally scheduled to be completed in 2015. Delays in construction, including state approval of the new elevators, pushed back the completion date to April 2016. As part of the STart program, a percentage of construction funds went towards installing art made by Whidbey Island resident Linda Beaumont at the station.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{some other}} places visited on Mars with landers (Viking and Pathfinder), {{nearly all the}} rocks near Phoenix are small. For {{about as far as}} the camera can see, the land is flat, but shaped into polygons between 2â€“3 meters in {{diameter}} and are bounded by troughs that are 20cm to 50cm deep. These shapes are due to ice in the soil <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracting</b> due to major temperature changes. The microscope showed that the soil on top of the polygons is composed of flat particles (probably a type of clay) and rounded particles. Also, unlike other places visited on Mars, the site has no ripples or dunes.O at the Phoenix Landing Site. 2009. Science:325. p58-61 Ice is present a few inches below the surface {{in the middle of the}} polygons, and along its edges, the ice is at least 8inches deep. When the ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere it slowly sublimates. Some dust devils were observed.|$|E
500|$|The {{first level}} of the Pont du Gard adjoins a road bridge that was added in the 18th century. The water conduit or specus, which is about [...] high and [...] wide, is carried {{at the top of}} the third level. The upper levels of the bridge are {{slightly}} curved in the upstream direction. It was long believed that the engineers had designed it this way deliberately to strengthen the bridge's structure against the flow of water, like a dam wall. However, a microtopographic survey carried out in 1989 showed that the bend is caused by the stone <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracting</b> by about [...] a day under the heat of the sun.

500|$|The common {{starling}} is {{a highly}} gregarious species, especially in autumn and winter. Although flock size is highly variable, huge, noisy flocks - murmurations - may form near roosts. These dense concentrations of birds {{are thought to be}} a defence against attacks by birds of prey such as peregrine falcons or Eurasian sparrowhawks. Flocks form a tight sphere-like formation in flight, frequently <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracting</b> and changing shape, seemingly without any sort of leader. Each common starling changes its course and speed {{as a result of the}} movement of its closest neighbours. Very large roosts, exceptionally up to 1.5million birds, can form in city centres, woodlands or reedbeds, causing problems with their droppings. These may accumulate up to [...] deep, killing trees by their concentration of chemicals. In smaller amounts, the droppings act as a fertiliser, and therefore woodland managers may try to move roosts from one area of a wood to another to benefit from the soil enhancement and avoid large toxic deposits.|$|E
500|$|The text is {{accompanied}} by many full-page miniatures, while smaller painted decorations appear throughout the text in unprecedented quantities. The decoration {{of the book is}} famous for combining intricate detail with bold and energetic compositions. The characteristics of the Insular manuscript initial, as described by Carl Nordenfalk, here reach their most extreme realisation: [...] "the initials ... are conceived as elastic forms <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracting</b> with a pulsating rhythm. The kinetic energy of their contours escapes into freely drawn appendices, a spiral line which in turn generates new curvilinear motifs...". The illustrations feature a broad range of colours, with purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and yellow being the colours most often used. Earlier manuscripts tend toward more narrow palettes: the Book of Durrow, for example, uses only four colours. As is usual with Insular work, there was no use of gold or silver leaf in the manuscript. The pigments for the illustrations, which included red and yellow ochre, green copper pigment (sometimes called verdigris), indigo, and possibly lapis lazuli, would have been imported from the Mediterranean region and, {{in the case of the}} lapis lazuli, from northeast Afghanistan. Though the presence of lapis lazuli has long been considered evidence of the great cost required to create the manuscript, recent examination of the pigments has proven that lapis lazuli was not used.|$|E

2500|$|Poor trimming, shoe selection, or {{inappropriate}} shoe attachment are well-known {{causes of}} lameness, and navicular disease is fairly {{common in the}} modern-day domesticated horse. However, it is also seen in wild horse populations. Those who advocate [...] "barefoot trimming" [...] of domestic horses propose that in nature, a horse's hoof is designed to expand and contract as the horse moves. This <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracting</b> acts as an auxiliary blood pump, and aids the circulation of blood to the lower extremities. When an inflexible metal shoe is improperly attached to the hoof, the hoof can no longer work as designed, and blood flow is inhibited. However, evidence of navicular degeneration {{has been established in}} the fossil record of early horses. Mary Thompson, a vertebrate paleontologist at Idaho Museum of Natural History, has found evidence in many species of early horses and concludes, [...] "The results of this study strongly suggest that manâ€™s intervention (whether by increased usage or improper breeding practices) may not be the sole cause of the syndrome", although she cautions that her results are preliminary.|$|E
2500|$|Jellyfish {{have been}} proven {{to be the most}} energy {{efficient}} swimmers of all animals. They move through the water by radially <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> <b>contracting</b> their bell-shaped bodies to push water behind them. They pause between the contraction and expansion to create two vortex rings. Muscles are used for the contraction of the body, which sheds the first vortex and pushes the animal forward, but the mesoglea is so elastic that the expansion is powered exclusively by relaxing the bell, which releases the energy stored from the contraction. By doing so, the second vortex ring rolls under it and begins to spin faster. This sucks in water which refills the bell and is pushed up against the centre of the body, giving it a secondary and [...] "free" [...] boost forward. The mechanism, called passive energy recapture, only works at low speeds and relatively small body sizes, allowing the animal to travel 30 percent farther on each swimming cycle. Jellyfish achieved a 48 percent lower cost of transport (the amount of food and oxygen consumed, versus energy spent in movement) than other animals in similar studies.|$|E
