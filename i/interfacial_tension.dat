25|$|Emulsifying agent (lecithin) used in {{mayonnaise}} {{are able}} to suspend oil droplets in water because it lowers the <b>interfacial</b> <b>tension</b> γ between oil and water. When emulsifying agent, lecithin, {{is added to the}} oil and water emulsion, they form a layer between the two different liquids, with their hydrophobic tail point toward the non-polar oil droplet, and their hydrophilic end facing the polar water molecules. This reduces the <b>interfacial</b> <b>tension</b> γ because the water molecules are no longer in contact with hydrocarbon molecules. Hence, a large increase of surface area (ΔA) is made possible because energy cost to arrive at the food state is now favorable.|$|E
25|$|The kinetic {{process of}} destabilisation can be rather long (up to several {{months or even}} years for some products) and it is often {{required}} for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of phase inversion or chemical degradation). Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also <b>interfacial</b> <b>tension</b> in the case of non-ionic surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables to simulate real life conditions for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times.|$|E

25|$|Electro-wetting display (EWD) {{is based}} on {{controlling}} {{the shape of a}} confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the <b>interfacial</b> <b>tension</b> between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogels are a {{class of}} {{biomaterials}} that are chemically or physically cross-linked water-soluble polymers. They can be either degradable or non-degradable as determined by their chemistry, but degradable is more desirable whenever possible. There has been great interest in hydrogels for tissue engineering purposes, because they generally possess high biocompatibility, mechanical properties similar to soft tissue, {{and the ability to}} be injected as a liquid that gels. When hydrogels are physically cross-linked they must rely on phase separation for gelation; the phase separation is temperature-dependent and reversible. Some other advantages of hydrogels are that they use only non-toxic aqueous solvents, allow infusion of nutrients and exit of waste products, and allow cells to assemble spontaneously. Hydrogels have low <b>interfacial</b> <b>tension,</b> meaning cells can easily migrate across the tissue-implant boundary. However, with hydrogels it is difficult to form a broad range of mechanical properties or structures with controlled pore size.|$|E
25|$|A {{completely}} new approach of using SIRs for the separation or purification of biotechnological {{products such as}} proteins {{is based on the}} concept of impregnating porous particles with aqueous polymer solutions developed by B. Burghoff. These so-called Tunable Aqueous Polymer-Phase Impregnated Resins (TAPPIR) enhance aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) by applying the SIR technology. During classical aqueous two-phase extraction, biotechnological components such as proteins are extracted from aqueous solutions by using a second aqueous phase. This second aqueous phase contains e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG). On the one hand, a low density difference and low <b>interfacial</b> <b>tension</b> between the two aqueous phases facilitate comparatively fast mass transfer between the phases. On the other hand, PEG appears to stabilize the protein molecules, which results in a comparatively low protein denaturation during the extraction. However, a significant drawback of ATPE is the persistent emulsification, which makes phase separation a challenge. The idea behind TAPPIR is to use the advantages posed by SIRs, namely low extractant loss due to immobilization in the pores and less emulsification than in liquid-liquid extraction. This way, the drawbacks of ATPE could be remedied. The setup would consist of a packed column or a fluidized bed rather than liquid-liquid extraction equipment with additional phase separation steps. Nonetheless, as yet only first feasibility studies are on the way to prove the concept. Adrawback of this method is the non-conitnous working mode. The packed column is run similar as a chromatographic column.|$|E

2500|$|CO2 {{has been}} {{injected}} into declining oil fields {{for more than}} 40 years, to increase oil recovery. [...] This option is attractive because the storage costs are offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered. Typically, 10–15% additional recovery of the original oil in place is possible. Further benefits are the existing infrastructure and the geophysical and geological information about the oil field that {{is available from the}} oil exploration. Another benefit of injecting CO2 into Oil fields is that CO2 is soluble in oil. [...] Dissolving CO2 in oil lowers the viscosity of the oil and reduces its <b>interfacial</b> <b>tension</b> which increases the oils mobility. All oil fields have a geological barrier preventing upward migration of oil. As most oil and gas has been in place for millions to tens of millions of years, depleted oil and gas reservoirs can contain carbon dioxide for millennia. Identified possible problems are the many 'leak' opportunities provided by old oil wells, the need for high injection pressures and acidification which can damage the geological barrier. Other disadvantages of old oil fields are their limited geographic distribution and depths, which require high injection pressures for sequestration. [...] Below a depth of about 1000 m, carbon dioxide is injected as a supercritical fluid, a material with the density of a liquid, but the viscosity and diffusivity of a gas.|$|E

40|$|For centuries physicians, scientists, engineers, mathematicians, {{and many}} others have been asking: 'what are the forces that drive tissues in an embryo to their final {{geometric}} forms?' At the tissue and whole embryo level, a multitude of very different morphogenetic processes, such as gastrulation and neurulation are involved. However, at the cellular level, virtually all of these processes are evidently driven by {{a relatively small number}} of internal structures all of whose forces can be resolved into equivalent <b>interfacial</b> <b>tensions</b> γ. Measuring the cell-level forces that drive specific morphogenetic events remains one of the great unsolved problems of biomechanics. Here I present a novel approach that allows these forces to be estimated from time lapse images. In this approach, the motions of all visible triple junctions formed between trios of cells adjacent to each other in epithelia (2 D cell sheets) are tracked in time-lapse images. An existing cell-based Finite Element (FE) model is then used to calculate the viscous forces needed to deform each cell in the observed way. A recursive least squares technique with variable forgetting factors is then used to estimate the <b>interfacial</b> <b>tensions</b> that would have to be present along each cell-cell interface to provide those forces, along with the attendant pressures in each cell. The algorithm is tested extensively using synthetic data from an FE model. Emphasis is placed on features likely to be encountered in data from live tissues during morphogenesis and wound healing. Those features include algorithm stability and tracking despite input noise, <b>interfacial</b> <b>tensions</b> that could change slowly or suddenly, and complications from imaging small regions of a larger epithelial tissue (the frayed boundary problem). Although the basic algorithm is highly sensitive to input noise due to the ill-conditioned nature of the system of equations that must be solved to obtain the <b>interfacial</b> <b>tensions,</b> methods are introduced to improve the resulting force and pressure estimates. The final algorithm returns very good estimates for <b>interfacial</b> <b>tensions</b> and intracellular cellular pressures when used with synthetic data, and it holds great promise for calculating the forces that remodel live tissue...|$|R
