500|$|I am a {{defeated}} {{and ruined}} war captive, that's it! The former emperor [...] treated me generously, but I betrayed him. In my present defeat, Heaven has vented its fury at me. In the past <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Han law stipulates that executions of men {{be carried out}} in the city marketplace. When we arrive in the capital, I request to Zhaling [...] to atone for my crimes to the former emperor. This is my sincere desire.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Chet Flippo {{wrote in}} a Texas Monthly article {{entitled}} [...] "Mathew, Mark, Luke and Willie: Willie Nelson's latest album {{is more than a}} good country music; it's almost Gospel": [...] "The difference between Nelson's Red Headed Stranger and any current C album, and especially what passes for a soundtrack for Nashville, is astounding. What Nelson has done is simply unclassifiable; it is the only record <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> strikes me as otherworldly. Red Headed Stranger conjures up such strange emotions and works on so many levels that listening to it becomes totally obsessing".|$|E
2500|$|... "If you {{are really}} Princess Ozma of Oz," [...] the Flathead said, [...] "you are one of that band of fairies who, under Queen Lurline, made all Oz a Fairyland. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Lurline left {{one of her own}} fairies to rule Oz, and gave the fairy the name of Ozma." ...|$|E

2500|$|Now, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> this praise, emet weyaṣiv [...] {{was sent}} by the exiles who were driven away from Jerusalem and who were not with Ezra in Babylon, and that Ezra had sent inquiring after them, {{but they did not}} wish to go up , {{replying}} that since they were destined to go off again into exile a second time, and that the Temple would once again be destroyed, why should we then double our anguish? It is best for us that we remain here in our place and to serve God. Now, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> they are the people of Ṭulayṭulah (Toledo) and those who are near to them. However, that they might not be thought of as wicked men and those who are lacking in fidelity, may God forbid, they wrote down for them this magnanimous praise, etc.|$|E
2500|$|The {{danger to}} plants and animals, {{particularly}} from washing or [...] "buddling" [...] {{has been known}} for centuries and the nuisance to the people of Brassington described above was typical of the conflict between farmers and miners. In the 1680s Sir John Gell II gave his opinion during such a dispute. [...] "For buddling ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> miners have been indicted for it, and the freeholders and occupiers of land are much prejudiced by it. It sets the cattle upon the belland, which is destructive to the cattle and horses and often kills them" ...|$|E
2500|$|.....none of the Independents, {{either in}} New England or Holland, neither the Brownists of Amsterdam, did ever give unto any women any publike Ecclesiastick power. In this, our London Independents exceed all their Brethren, who of late begin to give unto women power of debating {{in the face}} of the Congregation, and of {{determining}} Ecclesiastick causes by their suffrages, if Doctor Bastwick be rightly informed. Concerning the power of the Sacraments, Mistris Chidley is permitted to print in defence of the Independent cause, without the reproofe of any of that party, so farre as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard,</b> <b>that</b> not only Pastors but private men out of all office, may lawfully celebrate both the Sacraments.|$|E
60|$|Once, {{long years}} before, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> laugh, when <b>I</b> was a {{prisoner}} in Dingaan's kraal, after the massacre of Retief and his company, and I recognised it again.|$|R
60|$|I shifted my work {{nearer to}} the telephone-table {{so as to}} be ready for the next call. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Vincent Jopp <b>had</b> only been married three times, but you never knew.|$|R

2500|$|Luther {{recalled}} his first speech on sobriety. “My relations, {{you all know}} that I am {{to take care of}} you while going across the big water to another country, and all the time we are to stay there. [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> when anyone joins this show, about the first thing he thinks of is getting drunk. [...] I understand that regulations of the Buffalo Bill show require that no Indian shall be given any liquor. [...] You all know that I do not drink, and I am going to keep you all from it. [...] Don’t think because you may be closely related to me I will shield you, for I will not. [...] I will report to Colonel Cody immediately anyone I find drinking.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Most tellingly, {{hearing the}} Eroica {{inspired}} Berlioz to widen his horizons {{for the first}} time past opera and other vocal works and consider the expressive power of purely instrumental music. Prior to this, he had defaulted to the dominant view of the Parisian music establishment, as typified by Le Sueur: that the symphony was a lesser form of composition that Mozart and Haydn had already taken as far as possible. Berlioz would go on to find instrumental music to be far more penetrating in expression and articulation than vocal setting. [...] "Now that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> terrifying giant Beethoven", he wrote, [...] "I know exactly where my musical art stands; the question is to take it from there and push it further." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "To what end?" [...] {{returned}} the Seneschal, between sorrow and indignation. [...] "Why, {{to the end}} that it might succour you if still in time. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> if not dead already, you {{were in danger of}} your life." ...|$|R
