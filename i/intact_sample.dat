These features show adjustment to a minimum surface energy configuration. Samples with extension microcracks have smaller particles on average, which are more inequant and have a stronger preferred orientation than particles in the <b>intact</b> <b>samples,</b> due to fragmentation by impingement microcracking. Microfaults have still smaller average particle sizes, but more equant and less well orientated angular fragments, formed by sliding and rotation of particles after linkage between extension microcracks. <b>Intact</b> <b>samples</b> have a curved relationship on a log-log plot between cumulative numbers of particles and grain size.

Very strong ESR signals were seen in frozen powders and frozen <b>intact</b> <b>samples</b> of normal cervix and endometrium and in nonmalignant gynecological conditions.

To this end, samples were collected from the 0. 00 - 0. 10 and 0. 10 - 0. 20 m layers of two soils of clayey and very clayey texture. Volumetric rings were used to collect a total of 120 undisturbed soil samples from each soil layer that were divided into two subsets containing 60 units each.

The dehydrations were accomplished at a temperature of 140 {sup 0 }C, and the rehydrations were accomplished at various combinations of temperature and pore pressures so that the wetting fluid was either liquid water, steam or both. The electrical resistivity measurements indicate that for the <b>intact</b> <b>sample,</b> the drying and resaturation took place fairly uniformly throughout the sample. On the other hand, for the fractured sample, the drying and resaturation was spatially quite nonuniform.

The surface-modified anhydrates of CBZ were obtained in a specially designed surface modification apparatus at 60 °C via the adsorption of n-butanol, and powder x-ray diffraction, Fourier-Transformed Infrared spectra, and differential scanning calorimetry were used to determine the crystalline characteristics of the samples. The hydration process of intact and surface-modified CBZ anhydrate at 97 % relative humidity (RH) and 40 ± 1 °C was automatically monitored by using isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC). The dissolution test for surface-modified samples (20 mg) was performed in 900 mL of distilled water at 37 ± 0. 5 °C with stirring by a paddle at 100 rpm as in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia XIII. The heat flow profiles of hydration of intact and surface-modified CBZ anhydrates at 97 % RH by using IMC profiles showed a maximum peak at around 10 hours and 45 hours after 0 and 10 hours of induction, respectively. The result indicated that hydration of CBZ anhydrate was completely inhibited at the initial stage by surface modification of n-butanol and thereafter transformed into dihydrate. The hydration of surface-modified samples followed a 2 -dimensional phase boundary process with an induction period (IP). The IP of intact and surface-modified samples decreased with increase of the reaction temperature, and the hydration rate constant (k) increased with increase of the temperature. The crystal growth rate constants of nuclei of the <b>intact</b> <b>sample</b> were significantly larger than the surface-modified samples at each temperature. The activation energy (E) of nuclei formation and crystal growth process for hydration of surface-modified CBZ anhydrate were evaluated to be 20. 1 and 32. 5 kJ/mol, respectively, from Arrhenius plots, but the Es of intact anhydrate were 56. 3 and 26. 8 kJ/mol, respectively.

It is likely that not only initial closure of favorably oriented cracks but also breaking of partially cemented grains or slipping between grains may occur in the pseudoelastic phase and are already localized on the final rupture plane where the shear stress seems to be concentrate.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{progressive}} shear behaviour and asperity degradation of single rough rock fractures using 2 D numerical simulations and laboratory experiments. The particle flow code (PFC) {{was chosen for}} simulation purposes in this work. The fracture and <b>intact</b> <b>sample</b> are modelled as an assembly of circular disks in PFC 2 D. By performing biaxial test simulations in PFC 2 D, correlations were obtained between micro and macro properties of the <b>intact</b> <b>sample.</b> These results were used later for guidance to establish the micro properties of models corresponding to mortar samples, based on the macro response obtained from the lab experiments. To define a set of micro properties corresponding to fracture particles and investigate their effects on shear behaviour of both planar and rough fractures, a sensitivity analysis of fracture model micro properties including particle size, particle friction coefficient, and contact bond strength were carried out. Several synthetic profiles with triangular and sinusoidal geometries were simulated to study their shear behaviour. A prior knowledge of the shearing response of such simple geometries allowed calibration of the model to be made. The results confirmed the observation of different failure modes, i. e. sliding, asperity cut-off, and degradation, {{as a result of}} increasing the normal stress. The simulation results were compared with lab experiments that were carried out on synthetic samples with constant height elevations along their thickness. This was the closest geometry {{that could be used to}} calibrate 2 D models, and a good agreement was found between the results of the two approaches. The lab shear tests were conducted using a fracture shear cell (FSC). This was a special set up made from modifications on an existing triaxial stress cell. The FSC was capable of applying large shear and normal loads to the sample where the normal load was applied in a constant rate using a pressure cylinder. Both lab experiments and simulations were performed on pseudo-real as well as rock-like fracture specimens. The directionality in shear strength when the sample was sheared in opposite directions along a horizontal plane was also studied.

However, the failure strengths of the <b>intact</b> <b>samples</b> were quite unpredictable. The coefficients of friction ranged between 0. 7 and 0. 9 for all specimens. These data {{can be used in}} conjunction with in situ stress measurements at Yucca Mountain, to evaluate the potential for earthquake activity in the region. 1 ref., 7 figs...|$|R
50|$|The {{analytical}} {{near infrared}} (NIR) region spans the range from approximately 700-2,500 nm. The absorption bands {{seen in this}} spectral range arise from overtones and combination bands of O-H, N-H, C-H and S-H stretching and bending vibrations. Absorption is one to two orders of magnitude smaller in the NIR compared to the MIR; this phenomenon {{eliminates the need for}} extensive sample preparation. Thick and thin samples can be analyzed without any sample preparation, it is possible to acquire NIR chemical images through some packaging materials, and the technique can be used to examine hydrated <b>samples,</b> within limits. <b>Intact</b> <b>samples</b> can be imaged in transmittance or diffuse reflectance.|$|R
