25|$|Poultry housing {{has been}} shown to have adverse effects on the {{respiratory}} <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers,</b> ranging from a cough to chronic bronchitis. Workers are exposed to concentrated airborne particulate matter (PM) and endotoxins (a harmful waste product of bacteria). In a conventional hen house a conveyor belt beneath the cages removes the manure. In a cage-free aviary system the manure coats the ground, resulting in the build-up of dust and bacteria over time. Eggs are often laid on the ground or under cages in the aviary housing, causing workers to come close to the floor and force dust and bacteria into the air, which they then inhale during egg collection.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difference}} of the APF for air purifying negative pressure full-facepiece masks are not large. The difference between PAPR with helmets a few more. But measurements {{showed that the}} real effectiveness of RPD (at the workplace conditions) {{is strongly dependent on}} the conditions of their use, not only from the design, and this partly explains the difference in APF values. The APF for negative pressure half mask respirators are twofold. But this difference cannot be considered separately from recommendations for use of respirators. The use of half-face masks in the US is limited to 10 PEL for the [...] "worst case" [...] - work in the polluted atmosphere of 8 hours per day, 40 hours a week. But British experts took into account large experience of the use of negative pressure air purifying RPDs, and they concluded that to achieve continuous wear respirator 8 hours a day is impossible (because of the negative impact on the <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers).</b> For this reason, [...] they recommend to the employer to give the job to the workers so that they work in the polluted atmosphere not during entire shift, but only a part of the shift. The remaining time the employee needs to work in a non-polluted atmosphere (without the respirator). The fact that the employee is in a non-polluted atmosphere some part of working time provide additional protection of his health, and therefore, the requirements to the efficiency of the respirator may be less stringent.|$|E

40|$|Background: Zambian Health Workers Retention Scheme (ZHWRS) {{commenced}} in 2003. The schemes' original aim was {{to retain}} and recruit Zambian doctors in rural and remote districts. The aim of the ZHWRS subsequently expanded to also include other health workers, in either rural or urban areas. The scheme was formulated to address, in part, the drastic shortage <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers.</b> Objectives: To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the ZHWRS in achieving its aim. Methods: The data on the number <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> recruited by the ZHWRS and the spatial distribution of them was reviewed. A survey <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> was undertaken to elicit their views of their working conditions, their job satisfaction and the effectiveness of retention schemes in retaining or increasing the numbers of and overall satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers.</b> Results: The ZHWRS has not been successful in recruiting sufficient numbers <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> to reverse the shortage problem or even to meet the modest targets of the scheme itself. However, these improvements do not decrease the likelihood <b>of</b> Department <b>of</b> <b>Health</b> (DoH) <b>workers</b> leaving their rural based positions. Conclusions: The ZHWRS has not fully met either its original or revised aims. The drastic shortage <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>workers</b> in Zambia continues. ...|$|R
