50|$|Enraged, Liu {{attacks the}} master with a broadsword, but the Master uses qigong {{to protect himself}} from the blade. Xu infiltrates the house through a hatch and, from {{underneath}} the floor, weakens the Master's defense during the fight by piercing his heel with an acupuncture needle. The Master incapacitates Xu and proceeds to overpower Liu. Before the Master can kill Liu, Xu attacks the Master with another acupuncture needle to the neck. The Master fatally wounds Xu, but the needles act as a lightning rod and <b>earthing</b> <b>wire,</b> and the Master is killed by a bolt of lightning. With his dying breath, Xu announces the case closed. Liu returns to his home, where he lives a normal life.|$|E
40|$|Overhead <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> {{breakage}} accident {{may occur}} frequently, which can seriously affect the reliable {{operation of the}} power grid. The main reason of the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> breakage is the contact resistance inside the clamp as short-circuit current flows through it. To understand the mechanism of the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> breakage, this paper conducts the theoretical study on the skin effect and contact resistance of the wire suspension string with winding preformed armor rods. The temperature rise experiments using of the new and old <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> suspension string are performed to verify the theoretical analysis. The {{results show that the}} hotspots locate in the fracture of the preformed armor rods and the inside the clamp when short-circuit current flows through the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> suspension string. The reason could be the increase of the contact resistances in these two locations due to rust of the suspension string. Comparing with the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> suspension string without wrapping preformed armor rods, the number of hotspots in the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> may increase and accordingly the possibility of <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> breakage can increase...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} surge {{phenomena}} on hv and vhv three-phase transmission lines with <b>earth</b> <b>wire.</b> The impact of lightning stroke into the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> {{and its influence}} on parallel phase conductors is investigated. The model of the transmission line is created by network with distributed parameters and concurs on our previous paper. In this paper are derived basic equations respecting not only inductive and capacitive coupling among phase conductors but they involve the coupling phase conductors to the <b>earth</b> <b>wire,</b> as well. Problem is solved numerically in the time domain. Some examples illustrating the propagation of surge wave caused by lightning stroke are solved here...|$|R

2500|$|RCDs operate by {{measuring}} the current balance between two conductors using a differential current transformer. [...] This measures the difference between current flowing through the live conductor and that returning through the neutral conductor. [...] If these do not sum to zero, there is a leakage of current to somewhere else (to earth/ground or to another circuit), and the device will open its contacts. Operation {{does not require a}} fault current to return through the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> in the installation; the trip will operate just as well if the return path is through plumbing, contact with the ground or any other current path. Automatic disconnection and a measure of shock protection is therefore still provided even if the <b>earth</b> <b>wiring</b> of the installation is damaged or incomplete.|$|R

50|$|The {{cause of}} the {{blackout}} was {{traced back to the}} Otahuhu sub-station, the city's main transmission switching station. A corroded shackle connecting the Otahuhu to Penrose 220 kV line's <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> had dislodged in 90 km/h winds, letting the <b>earth</b> <b>wire</b> fall across the 220 kV line and the 110 kV busbar below it, tripping both the line and three sections of the busbar, disconnecting lines to Mount Roskill, Penrose and Pakuranga. The trip also disconnected Otahuhu B and Southdown power stations from the national grid. The trip left only one line, the now-dismantled Arapuni to Pakuranga 110 kV line, supplying Pakuranga, Penrose, and the central city. Eight seconds after the failure, this line tripped from overloading, leaving Penrose, Pakuranga, and central city substations without power, as well as parts of Otahuhu and Mount Roskill substations.|$|R

50|$|In this article, when {{comparing}} different wiring methods or systems {{the focus is}} on the number of wires connecting the switches to each other. Sometimes an additional wire is present in each cable to carry an unswitched neutral or hot wire which passes through the switch mounting box, but is not normally connected to the switch.

40|$|Single-phase {{positive}} sequence modelling {{is often used}} in power systems when power flows and short circuit analysis are assessed. Of course, the use of single-phase {{positive sequence}} modelling assumes purely three-phase configurations and perfectly symmetrical ones so that single-phase modelling considers that all the phase conductors behave in the same way. When considering the physical reality of power networks, this assumption can be questionable and the behaviors of all the system conductors including the passive ones (<b>earth</b> <b>wires</b> for overhead lines, metallic screens and armours for cables and enclosures for gas insulated lines) is completely unknown. Therefore, the present multiconductor cell analysis (MCA) becomes necessary, since it allows one to achieve great precision results on the regimes of both phase conductors and passive conductors. MCA offers a powerful tool in order to validate (or less) approximated and simplified computation methods. In particular, for single and double circuit overhead lines (OHLs), the current phasors induced in the <b>earth</b> <b>wires</b> and the ground return current alongside the line can be directly computed by MCA in steady state and faulty regimes. It is worth noting that, for faulty regimes, MCA allows also evaluating the approximation degree and validity field of screening factors k...|$|R

50|$|The {{installation}} {{process for}} wrapped cables involves passing a drum of cable {{around and around}} the host conductor as the carrying device moves across the span.

However, a radio controlled power unit using batteries or a petrol engine is normally required when the host conductor is on a high voltage transmission line.
