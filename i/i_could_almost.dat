His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E

500|$|Charles Darwin's {{studies at}} the University of Cambridge {{included}} two other texts by Paley, and in his final exams in January 1831 he did well in questions on these texts. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired [...] "a burning zeal" [...] to research natural history. After the Beagle voyage he began development of his theory of natural selection, and in 1838 opened a notebook listing [...] "books to be read", including [...] "Paley's Nat. Theology". In 1859, on completing On the Origin of Species, he told a friend [...] "I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> formerly have said it by heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jakala commended the art because [...] "Tsugihara helps {{distinguish}} characters {{by giving}} everyone distinctive looks." [...] Further, he appreciated how the detailing on body language and facial expressions, saying, [...] "In one scene, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> feel {{the intensity of}} Sakuragi's gaze coming off the page." [...] RAC's commenator also asserted there are [...] "lots of careful shots of people's faces to show their reactions", and deemed Tsugihara's art very suitable to the series, calling it [...] "a solid, straight-forward style" [...] and comparing it to storyboards for a television show or a film.|$|E
2500|$|Dwaine Stevenson as [...] "Sammael"/Michael: The {{most feared}} and {{faithful}} Fallen, Michael seeks {{control of the}} city to challenge what he calls a lack of freedom in the followers of the Light. Stevenson was attracted to the character's difficulties, finding the role confronting and challenging. He describes playing the role as [...] "a very intimidating process and a lonely one. Each day I turned up to set, and began getting dressed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> feel the character laughing at me saying, ‘Well, let’s see what you get today.’" [...] One critic summarised his impression of the character as [...] "Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails wearing ping-pong balls as contact lenses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Orville Prescott wrote, [...] "Consider {{the case}} of Loren Eiseley, author of The Immense Journey, who can sit on a {{mountain}} slope beside a prairie-dog town and imagine himself back in {{the dawn of the}} Age of mammals eighty million years ago: [...] 'There by a tree root <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> make him out, that shabby little Paleocene rat, eternal tramp and world wanderer, father of all mankind.' ... his prose is often lyrically beautiful, something that considerable reading in the works of anthropologists had not led me to expect. ... The subjects discussed here include the human ancestral tree, water and its significance to life, the mysteries of cellular life, 'the secret and remote abysses' of the sea, the riddle of why human beings alone among living creatures have brains capable of abstract thought and are far superior to their mere needs for survival, the reasons why Dr. Eiseley is convinced that there are no men or man-like animals on other planets, ...".|$|E

2500|$|Residence {{requirements}} kept Darwin in Cambridge till June. He {{resumed his}} beetle collecting, took career advice from Henslow, and read William Paley's Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity which {{set out to}} refute David Hume's argument that [...] "design" [...] by a Creator was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. Paley saw a rational proof of God's existence in the complexity and perfect adaptation to needs of living beings exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world, while attacking the evolutionary ideas of Erasmus Darwin as coinciding with atheistic schemes and lacking evidence. Paley's benevolent God acted in nature though uniform and universal laws, not arbitrary miracles or changes of laws, and this use of secondary laws provided a theodicy explaining the problem of evil by separating nature from direct divine action. This convinced Charles and encouraged his interest in science. He later wrote [...] "I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> formerly have said it by heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Japanese {{military}} {{offensive against}} the Philippines, President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur {{to evacuate the}} islands. MacArthur reluctantly left, promising to send reinforcements that never came. In his autobiography, MacArthur recalled {{one of his last}} memories on leaving the Philippines was of Bunker:"On the dock I could see the men staring at me. I had lost 25 pounds living on the same diet as the soldiers, and I must have looked gaunt and ghastly standing there in my old war-stained clothes - no bemedaled commander of inspiring presence. ... Through the shattered ruins, my eyes sought 'Topside,' where the deep roar of heavy guns still growled defiance, with their red blasts tearing the growing darkness asunder. Up there, in command, was my classmate, Paul Bunker. Forty years had passed since Bunker had twice been selected by Walter Camp for the All American team. I could shut my eyes and see again that blond head racing, tearing, plunging - 210 pounds of irresistible power. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> hear Quarterback Charley Daly's shrill voice barking, 'Bunker back.' He and many others up there were old, old friends, bound by ties of deepest friendship." ...|$|E
2500|$|After doing {{particularly}} {{well in his}} final exam questions on Paleys' books, Darwin read Paley's Natural Theology which set out to refute David Hume's argument that the teleological argument for [...] "design" [...] by a Creator was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. Paley saw a rational proof of God's existence in the complexity and perfect adaptation to needs of living beings exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world, while attacking the evolutionary ideas of Erasmus Darwin as coinciding with atheistic schemes and lacking evidence. Paley's benevolent God acted in nature through uniform and universal laws, not arbitrary miracles or changes of laws, and this use of secondary laws provided a theodicy explaining the problem of evil by separating nature from direct divine action, drawing directly on the ideas of Thomas Malthus. For Paley, a Malthusian [...] "system of natural hostilities" [...] of animals living on prey was strictly connected to the surplus of births keeping the world appropriately stocked as circumstances changed, and poverty showed {{that the world was}} in a [...] "state of probation... calculated for the production, exercise, and improvement of moral qualities, with a view to a future state", even where such divine purpose was not obvious. This convinced Charles and encouraged his interest in science. He later wrote [...] "I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> formerly have said it by heart." ...|$|E

"But, Mrs. Yorke, if I take {{a little}} baby into my arms--any poor woman's infant, for instance--I feel that I love that {{helpless}} thing quite peculiarly, though I am not its mother. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do <b>almost</b> anything for it willingly, if it were delivered over entirely to my care--if it were quite dependent on me." ...|$|R
60|$|They all answered, yes. I {{had little}} to tell them, but I was bound by my own proposal.

5000|$|Haynes was {{considered}} to be among the greatest ballhandlers who ever lived. Wilt Chamberlain once said, [...] "What he did was something that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never do, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do <b>almost</b> everything on the basketball court." [...] His game influenced players such as Bob Cousy, Pete Maravich, and Fred [...] "Curly" [...] Neal. He has been described {{as one of the best}} basketball players never to compete in the NBA.|$|R
2500|$|The {{show was}} almost universally {{critically}} panned. [...] Matt Roush {{wrote in his}} USA Today review that Curry [...] "gives it his maul", and that the show's leads seemed [...] "lost in the TV equivalent of summer stock". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly went one step further, likening it to a variation of The Odd Couple that possessed [...] "neither romantic spark nor crisp verbal byplay". [...] The Los Angeles Daily News claimed {{it was the worst}} new show of the season, and that if you tuned in to the show at 8:30, you would [...] "probably be watching something else by 8:38". TeeVee's Peter Ko wrote a lengthy review (which itself got some publicity nine years later) in which he heavily bashed Curry, then he went on to state, [...] "I have stood in a freezer full of dead people at the morgue. I have seen a man's scalp pulled back over his nose. I've even seen 35 minutes of Ellen DeGeneres's Mr. Wrong. But I can now honestly say that until Steve Carell's turn in the premiere of Over the Top, I have never known true horror." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales, on the other hand, was substantially kinder than most critics, saying [...] "the show seemed merely okay at first encounter," [...] but after seeing the season's other new shows, [...] "Over the Top is looking better and better. [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> kiss it right on the lips." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The days soon arrived when, on forced marches {{after the}} enemy, all {{discharges}} of firearms {{except at the}} enemy were strictly prohibited under severe penalty. [...] Being out on the right flank one day, just {{out of sight of}} the troops, I came upon a beautiful covey of grouse. [...] They were so tame <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> knock them over with rocks, but while the contact thus established made me increasingly anxious for grouse for dinner that night, I could not hit them. [...] So finally, in spite of those orders and with growing appetite, I shot two of them and quickly secreted the evidence of my disobedience by rolling them up in the rain coat I carried on my saddle. [...] The right wing of the command was wildly excited by the shots. [...] The skirmishers thrown out on that side soon discovered my lonely presence and hustled me to Colonel Chambers with the news that no Indians were visible. [...] He very sternly asked. [...] ‘Mr. Strahorn, did you do that firing?" [...] Upon my answering, [...] "Yes sir," [...] he still more gruffly asked, [...] "At Indians, or what?" [...] "Not at Indians, Colonel, but at grouse," [...] I answered. [...] "I was so hungry for grouse that I just couldn’t help it, so I’m ready to pay the penalty. [...] What is it?’ [...] Be it remembered that I was in the Colonel’s mess, and he replied quietly on the side, ‘Well, it will make a damn sight of difference whether you got a grouse.’" ...|$|E
