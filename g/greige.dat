5000|$|Inspired by Joseph Beuys's Honey Pump (1977), Marc Kreisel envisioned Al's Bar as a [...] "money pump" [...] for {{circulating}} {{money around}} its community of artists.

50|$|Textile {{bleaching}} {{is one of}} {{the stages}} in the manufacture of textiles. All raw textile materials, when they are in natural form, are known as 'greige' material (pronounced grey-sh). This <b>greige</b> material will have its natural color, odor and impurities that are not suitable for clothing materials. Not only the natural impurities will remain on the <b>greige</b> material but also the add-ons that were made during its cultivation, growth and manufacture in the form of pesticides, fungicides, worm killers, sizes, lubricants, etc. The removal of these natural coloring matters and add-ons during the previous state of manufacturing is called scouring and bleaching.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} Dark Signer-like figures (called Shadow Drones in the dub) who are {{recruited}} {{and controlled by}} Roman's spiders. They only have access to Dark Tuner and Dark Synchro Monsters. When these Shadow Drones are defeated, their Mark of the Shadows and Deck disappear, and they lose their memories of being possessed. According to Goodwin, a true Dark Signer cannot be returned to normal, because they have already died. In addition, their duels end with the losing duelist being killed (in the dub, the loser {{is sent to the}} Netherworld). When a true Dark Signer is defeated, all the souls that were used for summoning their Earthbound Immortal are freed (this also seems to apply to non-Dark Signers who were defeated in Shadow Duels). After Goodwin and the King of the Netherworld are defeated, Goodwin and Roman pass on to the afterlife while Carly, Misty, and Devack are revived with no memory of their time as Dark Signers.

The Golden Age of the historical Tallinn was a period {{from the middle of}} the 15th century to the beginning of the 16th century. The economical prosperity of the Hanseatic times made it possible to create wonderful creations of architecture and art. The vane Old Thomas was established above the town hall in 1530 (Current vane is its exact copy, the initial vane is in the town hall’s basement and the vane from the year 1996 is in the city museum (Linnamuuseum)). Heinrich Hartmann who was from a well-known molder family, prepared a bell for the town hall at the end of the 16th century. In the 17th century the town hall got a new spire that was made by master-builder <b>Greiger</b> Graff.The sharp Gothic spire was replaced with a current spire in a Late-Renessaince style in 1627-1629. “It can be said by the bricks with one sign, that several of the facade works, the repairs of the tower’s console and gable, the installation of new decorative gargoyles and the works of the interior, were done in the same time or at least solidly,” Teddy Böckler said. “Apparently, the partitions were built in the grand hall between the pillars and the bulkhead at the height of the consoles, between the years 1630 and 1650. The fireplaces were built to heat these small rooms. Formerly, there were no rain deflectors that would reach the ground. The dragon-headed gargoyles from stone or iron were on the eaves instead of these. They had to lead the water away from the building. The copper smith Daniel Pöppel hammered dragon-headed gargoyles from the copper-plates simultaneously with finishing the tower. [...] Now they are in the town hall because of their beauty.|$|R

50|$|Mercerization is a {{treatment}} for cotton fabric and thread that gives fabric or yarns a lustrous appearance and strengthens them. The process is applied to cellulosic materials like cotton or hemp. A further possibility is mercerizing during which the fabric is treated with sodium hydroxide solution to cause swelling of the fibres. This results in improved lustre, strength and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or shrinkage will take place. Mercerizing can take place directly on <b>greige</b> cloth, or after bleaching.|$|E

It was observed that mechanically cleaned <b>greige</b> cotton nonwovens exhibit certain fluid handling properties {{that are similar to}} polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets, {{partly as a result of}} the residual wax content. Subsequently, the surface polarity, swelling, and moisture uptake of 100 % <b>greige</b> cotton and 50 : 50 blends of <b>greige</b> cotton and polypropylene hydroentangled nonwovens were studied in comparison with the performance of a commercially available 100 % polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets.

40|$|<b>Greige</b> cotton is {{an intact}} plant fiber. The cuticle and {{primary cell wall}} near the outer surface of the cotton fiber {{contains}} pectin, peroxidases, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and trace metals, which are associated with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) generation during cotton fiber development. Traditionally, the processing of cotton into gauze involves scouring and bleaching processes that remove the components in the cuticle and primary cell wall. The use of unbleached, <b>greige</b> cotton fibers in dressings, has been relatively unexplored. We have recently determined that <b>greige</b> cotton can generate low levels of H 2 O 2 (5 – 50 micromolar).

Both brown and white cotton varieties were examined in this study. Brown cotton was found to have a relatively higher hydrogen peroxide generation and demonstrated different capacities for H 2 O 2 generation, varying from 1 to 35 micromolar. The H 2 O 2 generation capacities of white and brown nonwoven <b>greige</b> cottons were also examined at different process stages with varying chronology and source parameters, from field to nonwoven fiber.
