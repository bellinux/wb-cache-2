Its value reflects both the importance of the ice edge location in general and the difficulty of accurately locating the ice edge with remotely sensed data.

40|$|Introduction Since m/s "SOYA" {{had reached}} the ice edge on Dec. 27, 1959 at 65 ° 152 ̆ 7 S, 48 ° 352 ̆ 7 E, the {{officers}} on watch carried out continuous visual ice observations, {{under the supervision of}} the navigating officer, until the ship left the ice off Riiser-Larsen Peninsula on Feb. 21, 1960. The items of observation were nearly identical with those of the previous three expeditions. As the ship was not bound with drift ice, several surveying cruises were performed between 33 °E and 50 °E and eleven oceanographic stations were set up in the region. Miscellaneous observations other than general, for instance, observations on the drift of ice field and icebergs, were also made on occasion. 1. Some comments on ice terminology and recording form Several terms were supplemented to the WMO ice terminology mainly from Russian source. Terms were rearranged and compiled in "A glossary of ice terminology to be used in JARE". An example of supplemented terms is secondary slush, which is a combined conception of melting sludge in Baltic ice code and ledyanaya podushka in Russian terminology. Observed items were nearly identical with those required by the U. S. Hydrographic Office 2 ̆ 7 s reporting form. Obtained results were compiled in ice charts. Notations used in charts were also similar to those of the U. S. Hydrographic Office. However, the following changes were made both in observed items and in chart notations in order to describe encountered ice conditions more adequately: a) The size of predominant floes was recorded by nearest meters as the index of mechanical decaying. The item "puddling" seems to be insufficient to describe the dacaying state of Antarctic drift ice which decays mechanically before puddles have developed on it. Another index of mechanical decaying such as whether floes have angular or smooth outlines should have been recorded. b) Inter-ice melting sludge was excluded from the first group in the item "concentration by size" and its existence was indicated by a prefix Sl. Though it is difficult to distinguish between ice cakes and melting sludge from the air, the ship observer must distinguish them because the latter behaves quite differently from the former during the compression or the dispersion of an ice field. Melting sludge, if exists, usually covers inter-ice area completely. The compression (or dispersion) of the ice field, not causing <b>hummocking</b> (or formation of open water), only changes the thickness of sludge. The latter, which has important effects on the navigability, should have been recorded at least qualitatively. 2. General ice observations 2 a) Note on observation practice. Separate measurements of snowdepth and ice thickness were difficult because the boundary was not clear to identify whether it is porous ice or firnized snow. For convenience 2 ̆ 7 sake, the upper layer easily separable by turning over floes was regarded as snow. In this sense, most floes were covered by snow 0. 3 - 0. 5 m thick. Estimation of the age of floes was also difficult. The age of little hummocked floes was estimated by their thickness, as usually done. But, this method seemed inadequate for summer ice, for level ice less than 1 m thick often had two planktonrich brown thin layers. 2 b) Ice conditions along ice edges and 2 c) Those in ice field. Main results are shown in Figs. 1 - 10. Along edges, ice cakes were predominant and inter-ice area was usually covered by melting sludge. If the edge was under the dispersing effect of wind, there appeared along it a narrow region of a small ice concentration composed only of brashes (no melting sludge). Newly developed ice fields composed of small pancake ice were only seen after the middle of February. On Jan. 21 giant clusters of floebergs were seen at 45 ° 302 ̆ 7 E on the edge. Vast and big floes encountered in the region south of 67 ° 202 ̆ 7 S during the first penetration of the ship into ice area were probably fragments of the shore ice. The heights of reliefs on them were more than 3 m, but the fraction of hummocked area was rather small (2 / 10 - 3 / 10). 2 d) The shore ice off the western part of the Prince Olav Coast and the lead off the edge of the shose ice. Although the width of the lead on 40 °E meridian had narrowed from several kilometers on Jan. 3 to several hundred meters on Jan. 15 and finally the lead disappeared on Feb. 4, the position of the edge did not change during the observation period (Jan. 3 -Feb. 10). The constant position of the edge must have some relations with the bottom relief (the sea suddenly deepens northward from about 300 m to 1000 m at several kilometers north of the edge). Along the edge there was a hummocked narrow zone (2 - 3 km wide). South of the zone there was another a little wider zone (less than 20 km wide) where sasturgi running NEN-WSW were developed. Farther south the surface was flat. Puddles were developed little even in the beginning of February. 3. Miscellaneous observations 3 a) Icebergs. The first iceberg was seen at 53 ° 092 ̆ 7 S, 32 ° 172 ̆ 7 E on Dec. 23, 1959 and the last at 54 ° 002 ̆ 7 S, 25 ° 102 ̆ 7 E on Feb. 26, 1960. The largest iceberg which was observed off Cape Ann was supposed to be identical with the vast iceberg observed by Russian ice breaker "LENA" at 65 ° 402 ̆ 7 S, 88 ° 142 ̆ 7 E on Feb. 16, 1957. 3 b) Drift of icebergs. Only the drifts in the lead were analyzed showing the existence of a current of about 0. 3 knot there (Table 1). 3 c) Drift of ice field.

We use scaled analog models to study <b>hummock</b> formation and explore their importance in understanding landslide kinematics and dynamics. The models {{are designed to}} replicate large-scale volcanic collapses but are relevant also to non-volcanic settings. We characterize <b>hummocks</b> {{in terms of their}} evolution, spatial distribution, and internal structure from slide initiation to final arrest. <b>Hummocks</b> initially form by extensional faulting as a landslide begins to move. During motion, individual large blocks develop and spread, creating an initial distribution, with small <b>hummocks</b> at the landslide front and larger ones at the back. As the mass spreads, <b>hummocks</b> can get wider but may decrease in height, break up, or merge to form bigger and long anticlinal <b>hummocks</b> when confined. <b>Hummock</b> size depends on their position in the initial mass, modified by subsequent breakup or coalescence. A <b>hummock</b> has normal faults that flatten into low-angle detachments and merge with a basal shear zone. In areas of transverse movement within a landslide, elongate <b>hummocks</b> develop between strike-slip flower structures. All the model structures are consistent with field observations and suggest a general brittle-slide emplacement for most landslide avalanches.

40|$|On raised bogs, the {{distribution}} of Sphagnum species is determined by their distance to the water table, but occasionally species are able to survive outside their niche. Hollow species that persist in <b>hummock</b> vegetation are assumed {{to profit from the}} higher water content of the surrounding <b>hummock</b> species, although the mechanism responsible is unclear. In this study, we elucidated the role of lateral <b>hummock</b> water transport (LHWT) and precipitation on the water content of hollow species occurring in <b>hummocks.</b> This was tested using a full factorial field transplantation experiment with cores of Sphagnum cuspidatum in a high and a low <b>hummock.</b> Treatments included direct precipitation (present or absent) and LHWT (present or absent). Fresh weights of the cores were measured at regular time intervals. Our results show a relatively large effect of precipitation on the water content in both the high and low <b>hummock,</b> whereas LHWT only seemed to be an important source of water in the high <b>hummock,</b> which was relatively dry. Furthermore, LHWT played an important role only after large precipitation events, suggesting that lateral water transport is indirectly affected by rain. This study shows that precipitation alone can explain the persistence of hollow species in high <b>hummocks,</b> whereas it was less important for hollow species in low <b>hummocks.</b> Our data suggest that survival and potential expansion of hollow species in higher <b>hummocks</b> is strongly depending on the intensity and frequency of rain events.

A belt-transect 2 m wide and 114 m long was established on a south-west facing slope of a small knoll, where well developed earth <b>hummocks</b> were recognized. The belt-transect was sectioned in 2 m × 2 m successive quadrats. For each quadrat, cover degree of individual species and total vegetation was assessed and recorded. After earth <b>hummocks</b> were categorized conveniently into three types according to a degree of being covered by vegetation, the number of earth <b>hummocks</b> in each quadrat was counted for each type. A topographical crosssection along the belt-transect was surveyed, and vegetation and earth <b>hummock</b> characteristics were correlated with topographical position. Well developed earth <b>hummocks</b> were recognized mainly {{at the base of}} a leeward slope of the knoll where snow possibly drifted and stayed long enough to protect vegetation and earth <b>hummocks</b> from strong wind, especially in winter.

The impact of earth <b>hummocks</b> on subsurface drainage was studied at three hillslope plots during the snow-free periods of 1993 and 1994 at a small hummock-covered Arctic tundra watershed (Siksik Creek) in north-western Canada. Subsurface drainage occurs preferentially through the unfrozen saturated layer of the inter-hummock area, owing to its relatively high permeability and connected nature. The inter-hummock area is composed of primary channels, oriented in the downslope direction, and secondary channels, obstructed from conducting water directly downslope. Because of their very low hydraulic conductivity, earth <b>hummocks</b> obstruct hillslope drainage.
