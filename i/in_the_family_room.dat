60|$|From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in {{his closet}} was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the {{presence}} of his father <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>room.</b> Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking {{the back of her head}} against the head-board of the bed.|$|E

60|$|She paused, {{appeared}} to meditate, and turned towards me. Her head was still inclining on my bosom, and she gazed upwards at my face, as fondly {{as she did}} in that tender meeting we held just after my return home, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>room.</b> There was sufficient strength to enable her to raise her pallid but not emaciated hand to my face, even while she passed it over my cheeks, once more parting the curls on my temples, and playing with my hair, with infantile fondness.|$|E
6000|$|She went to {{her room}} and wrote a letter. It was very long, and very {{carefully}} written; and when she read it over, she tore it into small pieces.

60|$|If Mrs. Gaylord had dimly {{imagined}} {{that she should}} see something more of him, having him so near at hand, she really saw less: there was no weather, by day or night, in which he could not go to his office, now. He went no more than his wife into the village society; {{she might have been}} glad now and then of a little glimpse of the world, but she never said so, and her social life had ceased, like her religious life. Their house was richly furnished according to the local taste of the time; the parlor had a Brussels carpet, and heavy chairs of mahogany and hair-cloth; Marcia had a piano there, and since she had come home from school they had made company, as Mrs. Gaylord called it, two or three times for her; but they had held aloof from the festivity, the Squire in his office, and Mrs. Gaylord <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>room</b> where they now sat in unwonted companionship.|$|E

6000|$|Now {{from the}} very {{earliest}} phase the infant stands {{in need of a}} succession of interesting things. At first these are mere vague sense impressions, but in a month or so there is a distinct looking at objects; presently follows reaching and clutching, and soon the little creature is urgent for fresh things to see, handle, hear, fresh experiences of all sorts, fresh combinations of things already known. The newborn mind is soon as hungry as the body. And if a healthy well- fed child cries, it is probably by reason of this unsatisfied hunger, it lacks an interest, it is bored, that dismal vacant suffering that punishes the failure of living things to live fully and completely. As Mr. Charles Booth has pointed out in his Life and Labour of the People, it is probable that in this respect the children of the relatively poor are least at a disadvantage. The very poor infant passes its life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>room,</b> there is a going and coming, and interesting activity of domestic work on the part of its mother, the preparation of meals, the intermittent presence of the father, the whole gamut of its mother's unsophisticated temper. It is carried into crowded and eventful streets at all hours. It participates in pothouse soirées and assists at the business of shopping. It may not lead a very hygienic life, but it does not lead a dull one. Contrast with its lot that of the lonely child of some woman of fashion, leading its beautifully non-bacterial life in a carefully secluded nursery under the control of a virtuous, punctual, invariable, conscientious rather than emotional nurse. The poor little soul wails as often for events as the slum baby does for nourishment. Into its grey nursery there rushes every day, or every other day, a breathless, preoccupied, excessively dressed, cleverish, many-sided, fundamentally silly, and universally incapable woman, vociferates a little conventional affection, slaps a kiss or so upon her offspring, and goes off again to collect that daily meed of admiration and cheap envy which is the gusto of her world. After that gushing, rustling, incomprehensible passage, the child relapses into the boring care of its bored hireling for another day. The nurse writes her letters, mends her clothes, reads and thinks of the natural interests of her own life, and the child is [...] "good" [...] just in proportion {{to the extent to which}} it doesn't [...] "worry." ...|$|E
