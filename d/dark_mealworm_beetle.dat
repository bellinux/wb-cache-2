40|$|The {{immunocompetence}} handicap hypothesis postulates that secondary sexual {{traits are}} honest signals of mate quality because the hormones (e. g. testosterone) {{needed to develop}} secondary sexual traits have immunosuppressive effects. The best support for predictions arising from the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis so far comes from studies of insects, although they lack male-specific hormones such as testosterone. In our previous studies, we found that female <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> prefer pheromones of immunocompetent males. Here, we tested how juvenile hormone (JH) affects male investment in secondary sexual characteristics and immune functions in the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor. We injected male <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> with JH (type III) and found that injection increased the attractiveness of male pheromones but simultaneously suppressed immune functions (phenoloxidase activity and encapsulation). Our results suggest that JH, which {{is involved in the}} control of reproduction and morphogenesis, also plays {{a central role in the}} regulation of a trade-off between the immune system and sexual advertisement in insects. Thus, the results reflect a general mechanism by which the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis may work in insects...|$|R

The eggs and larva must be kept at a {{temperatures}} of 75 to 80 F. It {{is important that the}} worms have sufficient ventilation. The mealworms must be kept on a proper bedding of wheat middling and things such as maize, cornmeal, which provide nutrients. Mealworms feed on dead insects and organic matter. Farmers often add fruits and vegetables to provide moisture and make the larva more plump for consumption. Mealworms are consumed by humans baked, fried, or fresh.

Here, I test for the occurrence of such an adaptive transgenerational phenotypic plasticity in the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor.

40|$|A cDNA of alpha alpha-trehalase (EC 3. 2. 1. 28) from a cDNA {{library of}} male bean-shaped {{accessory}} gland of the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor, has been isolated by the homology screening approach. Sequence {{analysis of the}} cDNA (1830 bp) revealed that the cDNA encoded a protein of 555 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 64457. The deduced amino acid sequence had significant similarities to rabbit small intestine and Escherichia coli trehalases. Northern blotting and semi-quantitative PCR analyses revealed that a trehalase transcript with about 2. 0 kb was abundant in bean-shaped accessory glands. In the glands, the amount of trehalase transcript increased from 1 to 2 days after adult ecdysis. These tissue- and stage-specific gene expressions of trehalase corresponded to the tissue- and stage-specificity of trehalase activity...|$|R
40|$|During copulation, male insects pass {{accessory}} gland {{components to}} the female with the spermatophore. These gifts can affect female reproductive behaviour, ovulation and oviposition. Here, we show that female <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles,</b> Tenebrio molitor, mated with males infected with metacestodes of the rat tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta, produced significantly more offspring than those mated with uninfected males. There is a significant positive relationship between parasite intensity in the male and reproductive output in the female. Infection results in {{a significant increase in}} bean-shaped accessory gland (BAG) size. We suggest that infected males pass superior nuptial gifts to females and discuss the confounding effects of infection in male and female beetles upon overall fitness costs of infection for the host and the likelihood that the parasite is manipulating host investment in reproduction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Immune {{defenses}} of insects show either broad reactions or specificity and durability of induced protection against attacking parasites and pathogens. In this study, we tested whether encapsulation response against nylon monofilament increases between two attempts of activation of immune system in <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetles</b> Tenebrio molitor, and whether previous exposure to nylon monofilament may also increase protection against an entomopathogenic fungus. We found that survival of beetles subjected to immune activation by nylon implant and subsequent fungal exposure {{a week later}} {{was significantly higher than}} survival of beetles which had been subjected to fungal infection only. This result suggests that previous immune activation by the nylon implant may be considered as broad spectrum “immune priming ” which helps to fight not only the same intruder but also other parasites.

The satellite DNA {{is shown to}} be present in all of the chromosomes by in situ hybridization. 18 dimers of the repeat unit were cloned and sequenced. The consensus sequence is 142 nt long and lacks any internal repeat structure. Monomers of the sequence are very similar, showing on average a 2 % divergence from the calculated consensus. Variant nucleotides are scattered randomly throughout the sequence although some variants are more common than others. Neighboring repeat units are no more alike than randomly chosen ones. The results suggest that some mechanism, perhaps gene conversion, is acting to maintain the homogeneity of the satellite DNA despite its abundance and distribution on all of the chromosomes...|$|R

Behavioral tests were repeated in Eppendorf test tubes where we also measured resting metabolic rate (RMR). Results show that the response latency to a threatening/startling stimulus, and the total {{time spent in the}} state of tonic immobility, correlated across the tests. The behavioral responses were repeatable and RMR covaried phenotypically with personality: we found a negative correlation between response latency time and time spent immobile, a positive correlation between response latency and RMR, and a negative correlation between RMR and total time spent immobile. These correlations were also similar across trials performed in the Eppendorf test tubes and the plastic containers...|$|R

The low temperatures experienced by Cucujus clavipes can be survived through their deliberate dehydration in conjunction with the antifreeze proteins. This concentrates the antifreezes several fold. The hemolymph of the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> Tenebrio molitor contains several antifreeze proteins.

This is the first peptide characterized from this South-African cone snail and it has only 11 amino acid residues, SCSCKRNFLCC*, with the rare cysteine framework XVI and a monoisotopic mass of 1257. 6 Da. Two peptides were synthesized with two possible conformations: globular (pc 16 a_ 1) and ribbon (pc 16 a_ 2). pc 16 a_ 1 co-eluted with the native peptide, which indicates a disulfide connectivity I–III, II–IV. The structure of pc 16 a_ 1 was determined by NMR. Both synthetic peptides were used to elucidate the biological activity.

40|$|A primary {{infection}} by a parasite may indicate {{a higher risk}} of being reinfected in the near future (since infection may indicate that enemies are becoming more abundant). Acquired immunity does not exist in invertebrates {{despite the fact that they}} also face increased risks of reinfection following primary exposure. However, when subjected to immune insult, insects can produce immune responses that persist for long enough to provide prophylaxis. Because these immune responses are costly, persistence must be maintained through a selective advantage. We tested for the possibility that these long-lasting immune responses provided increased resistance to later infections by experimentally mimicking a primary immune insult (pre-challenge) in larvae of the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor, with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prior to early or late exposure to spores of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. We found that pre-challenged larvae produced a long-lasting antimicrobial response, which provided a survival benefit when the larvae were exposed to fungal infection. These results suggest that the observed response is functionally "adaptive"...|$|R

C-banding reveals heterochromatin in pericentromeric regions of all chromosomes of both species; however heterochromatic blocks of L. decemlineata are significantly smaller in size. Digestion of L. decemlineata genomic DNA with 12 restriction enzymes reveals presence of bands characteristic for repetitive DNA, but again in a significantly lower amount than those found in genomic DNA of T. molitor. While T. molitor exhibits complete correspondence of restriction enzyme effects on naked DNA and mitotic chromosomes, L. decemlineata mitotic chromosomes are resistant to the digestion with restriction enzymes. The results show that two species have similar organization of heterochromatin on chromosomes but differ significantly in its amount. In addition, difference in accessibility to in situ restriction enzyme digestion indicates specificity of heterochromatin structure in the two species...|$|R
40|$|If {{there are}} costs {{involved}} with the maintenance of pathogen resistance, then higher investment in this trait is expected when the risk of pathogenesis is high. One {{situation in which the}} risk of pathogenesis is elevated is at increased conspecific density. This paper reports the results of a study of density-dependent polyphenism in pathogen resistance and immune function in the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> Tenebrio molitor. Beetles reared at high larval densities showed lower mortality when exposed to a generalist entomopathogenic fungus and a higher degree of cuticular melanization than those reared solitarily. The degree of cuticular melanization was a strong indicator of resistance, with darker beetles being more resistant than lighter ones regardless of rearing density. No differences were found between rearing densities in the levels of phenoloxidase, an enzyme key to the insect immune response. The results show that pathogen resistance is phenotypically plastic in T. molitor, suggesting that the maintenance of this trait is costly...|$|R
40|$|There {{are well}} {{documented}} costs of mating in insects but little evidence for underlying mechanisms. Here, we provide experimental {{evidence for a}} hormone-based mechanism that reduces immunity {{as a result of}} mating. We examined the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> Tenebrio molitor and show that (i) mating reduces a major humoral immune effector-system (phenoloxidase) in both sexes, and (ii) that this down-regulation is mediated by juvenile hormone. Because both juvenile hormone and phenoloxidase have highly conserved functions across all insects, the identified mechanism is similarly likely to be highly conserved. The positive physiological function of mating-induced juvenile hormone secretion is gamete and accessory gland production: we propose that its negative effects on immune function are the consequence of physiological antagonism. Therefore, we have identified a physiological tradeoff between mating and immunity. Our results suggest that increasing mating success can result in increasing periods of immune suppression, which in turn implies that reproductively successful individuals may be more vulnerable to infection by, and the negative fitness effects of, pathogens...|$|R

5000|$|Though not all freeze-avoidant insects produce polyols, all hibernating insects produce thermal {{hysteresis}} factors (THFs). For example, the haemolymph of the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> Tenebrio molitor {{contains a}} family of such proteins. A seasonal photoperiodic timing mechanism is responsible for increasing the antifreeze protein levels with concentrations reaching their highest in the winter. In the pyrochroid beetle, Dendroides canadensis, a short photoperiod of 8 hours light and 16 hours of darkness, results in {{the highest levels of}} THFs, which corresponds with the shortening of daylight hours associated with winter. These antifreeze proteins are thought to stabilize SCPs by binding directly to the surface structures of the ice crystals themselves, diminishing crystal size and growth. [...] Therefore, instead of acting to change the biochemistry of the bodily fluids as seen with cryoprotectants, THFs act directly with the ice crystals by adsorbing to the developing crystals to inhibit their growth and reduce the chance of lethal freezing occurring.|$|R
40|$|Males of many insect species, {{including}} beetles, {{choose their}} mates {{according to their}} reproductive status. However, {{the ways in which}} male beetles evaluate female reproductive status have received little attention. We tested the existence of male mate choice in the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor, by observing mating and courtship behaviour of males given simultaneous access to pairs of females differing in their reproductive status: (1) mature versus immature; (2) virgin versus previously mated; (3) familiar (mated with the experimental male) versus unfamiliar (mated with a different male). Males courted and mated preferentially with mature and virgin females. To determine whether chemical cues played a role in these discriminations, we exposed males to filter paper squares bearing chemical cues from different types of females: (1) virgin versus mated; (2) mature versus immature. Males were significantly more attracted to those squares bearing chemical cues from virgin and mature females, suggesting that males can assess female reproductive status on the basis of chemical cues alone. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|At {{present the}} {{biological}} control as a pest control technology {{is becoming more}} desirable. Biological formulations on basis of entomopathogenic nematodes {{are one of the}} effective means for the protection of agricultural and forest plants from harmful insects. Nowadays, the use of entomopathogenic nematodes as biological control agents is a key component in IPM system. The foraging strategies of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) vary between species. This variation is consistent with use of different foraging strategies between ambush, cruise and intermediate to find their host insects. In order to ambush prey, some species of EPNs nictate, or raise their bodies of the soil surface so they are better poised to attach passing insects, other species adopt a cruising strategy and rarely nictate. Some species adopt an intermediate strategy between ambush and cruise. We compared in laboratory the foraging strategies of the entomopathogenic nematode species: Steinernema carpocapsae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and the recently described species Steinernema tbilisiensis and assessed their virulence against <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor L.

Mealworms were shown to readily consume the freeze-dried C. necator cells and excrete the PHA granules in the form of whitish feces. Further purification using water, detergent and heat resulted in almost 100 % pure PHA granules. Comparison with chloroform extraction showed no signs of reduction in the molecular weight and dispersion of the PHA molecules. Scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements revealed that the biologically recovered PHA granules retained their native spherical morphology.

40|$|Immune {{systems are}} thought to be costly to {{maintain}} and express in a variety of taxa. Evidence for this comes from observations that mechanisms which deal with pathogenic challenge are often extremely variable and are induced in the presence of an immune challenge, rather than being constitutively active. This thesis presents work aimed at testing predictions arising from these ideas, using the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> T. molilor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) as a model system. Assays were developed which reflected three specific aspects of immunity (haemocyte count, phenoloxidase levels and resistance to a generalist fungal pathogen), thereby allowing aspects of immune function to be quantified. It was shown that the level of fungal resistance differed in beetles reared gregariously (higher resistance) and solitarily (lower resistance). Conspecifics are a source of disease (Freeland 1983), so {{this is an example of}} immune defences being induced in situations with a higher risk of pathogenesis (density dependent prophylaxis).

40|$|International audienceIn many {{vertebrates}} and invertebrates, offspring whose {{mothers have}} been exposed to pathogens can exhibit increased levels of immune activity and/or increased survival to infection. Such phenomena, called “Trans-generational immune priming” (TGIP) are expected to provide immune protection to the offspring. As the offspring and their mother may share the same environment, and consequently similar microbial threats, we expect the immune molecules present in the progeny to be specific to the microbes that immune challenged the mother. We provide evidence in the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> Tenebrio molitor that the antimicrobial activity found in the eggs is only active against Gram-positive bacteria, even when females were exposed to Gram-negative bacteria or fungi. Fungi were weak inducers of TGIP while we obtained similar levels of anti-Gram-positive activity using different bacteria for the maternal challenge. Furthermore, we have identified an antibacterial peptide from the defensin family, the tenecin 1, which spectrum of activity is exclusively directed toward Gram-positive bacteria as potential contributor to this antimicrobial activity.
