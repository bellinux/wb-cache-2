5|$|Sweet Tooth {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley– she a well-read but uncritical lover of literature, <b>he</b> <b>a</b> highly accomplished writer and literary scholar– have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing {{what appears to be a}} straight first-person narrative, only to distort this perception at the very end.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Edward and the barons {{remained}} high, and the earls {{opposed to}} the King kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311. By now Edward had become estranged from his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who held the earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester, Lincoln, Salisbury and Derby, with an income of around £11,000 a year from his lands, almost double that of the next wealthiest baron. Backed by the earls of Arundel, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, Lancaster led a powerful faction in England, {{but he was not}} personally interested in practical administration, nor was <b>he</b> <b>a</b> particularly imaginative or effective politician.|$|E

Dioghenide's supporters, editors of the newspaper Naționalul, consequently pressured Stere to indicate who Șărcăleanu was ("We wish to know him, does he wear sidelocks or is <b>he</b> <b>a</b> Judaisized Romanian?"). Similar calls were voiced by Vieața, who alleged that Stere himself was a Russian Jew.|$|E
25|$|Historian Martin H. Folly {{argues that}} Bevin was not {{automatically}} pro-American. Instead {{he pushed his}} embassy in Washington to project a view of Britain that neutralized American criticisms. He felt Britain's problems were in part caused by American irresponsibility. He was frustrated with American attitudes. His strategy was to bring Washington around to support Britain's policies, arguing Britain had earned American support and ought to compensate it for its sacrifices against the Nazis. Bevin was not coldly pragmatic, says Folly, nor was he uncritically pro-American; nor was <b>he</b> <b>a</b> puppet manipulated by the British Foreign Office.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Medwin's legacy {{tends to}} raise more {{questions}} than answers. Was <b>he</b> <b>a</b> chancer who lived beyond his means and ruined his father and wife? He tended to fall out with former associates including Shelley's widow and Trelawney. His writings on Byron and Shelley are often imprecise. Shelley's fame grew throughout the 19th century and his legacy became an obsession for Medwin as for others in the Pisan circle. Medwin was opportunistic and disregarded the feelings of many former friends, but he remains {{the main source of}} information on Shelley's childhood. His Conversations of Lord Byron is now seen generally as vivid and essentially a true picture of the man.|$|E

He blamed Gai Lan and Dai Yuan for Sun Yi's murder {{but was unable to}} exert control over the military forces in the commandery. Gai Lan and Dai Yuan became worried because Sun He, who had no blood relations with Sun Yi, was already so upset over Sun Yi's death. They believed that they would be in deeper trouble if Sun Quan (Sun Yi's brother) personally came to Danyang to pursue the matter, so they murdered Sun He as well. They then sent a messenger to Liu Fu, the Inspector (刺史) of Yang Province, and expressed their willingness to defect to Liu's side.|$|E
25|$|All early biographers of Rapolionis {{stated that}} he was a Franciscan monk in Vilnius before his {{conversion}} to Lutheranism possibly around 1525. He was an educated man and earned a living as a private tutor to the nobility. It is believed that Rapolionis gained support from Jonas Stanislovas Bilevičius, a Samogitian nobleman, and prepared a group of students for studies at the University of Kraków, the only university in region at that time. He and his five students enrolled into the university on August 3, 1528. It is likely that Abraomas Kulvietis who matriculated on July 6 also belonged to the group. Rapolionis entered his name as Stanislovas, son of Jurgis of Raseiniai, Diocese of Samogitia (Stanislaus Georgy de Rozeny dioecesis Smodiensis) possibly to obscure his identity as <b>he,</b> <b>a</b> former monk, was joining a Catholic university.

25|$|He {{took his}} journalistic career further when <b>he</b> <b>a</b> new daily, Prezentul ("The Now") and, in 1908, the weekly Cuvinte Libere ("Free Words"). Prezentul {{was engaged in}} polemics with Furnica, the satirical magazine. The latter hosted rhyming jokes about Streitman's {{supposed}} sensationalism. Streitman's coworkers and employees were Rudolf Uhrinowsky, ridiculed by Furnica for his unusual surname, poet Victor Eftimiu, and (Eftimiu noted) Adrien Le Corbeau, already famous as a habitual plagiarist. Joining them as literary contributors were three young poets, all of them representing the Romanian Symbolist movement: Mihail Cruceanu, Al. T. Stamatiad, and Eugeniu Sperantia. According to Eftimiu, Prezentul was a struggling business, occupying an unheated room on Macca Arcade, with Streitman often missing out on payments for his staff. In March 1910, Streitman's entire mobile property was confiscated by court order, and auctioned off to pay off his debt to an R. Goldemberg.|$|E
