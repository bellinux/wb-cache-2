40|$|Using {{data from}} the <b>Eurobarometers,</b> the {{association}} between the occupations of spouses is studied for eight EU countries at several points in time. Most of the association {{is due to a}} tendency towards occupational similarity between the spouses. The strength of this tendency differs somewhat between countries and decreases by about 16 per cent between 1975 and 1989, indicating that the social structure of the countries has become more open in this period. By comparing the changes in occupational homogamy of successive birth cohorts over time, we find that when the spouses belonging to a certain birth cohort grow older, their degree of occupational similarity decreases. This suggests that even within existing marriages spouses tend to become less alike between 1975 and 1989...|$|R

40|$|Hitherto, forty-one {{national}} referendums {{have been}} conducted on European integration in over twenty countries. While {{it is clear that}} this process has not led to a widely shared common identity, this paper explores the hypothesis that national referendums on European issues do in fact contribute to the emergence of a European identity. I will propose three mechanisms by which this is likely to happen. Firstly, although referendums and especially the debate preceding them may sharpen the divide between Europhiles and Euroskeptics, they bear the potential to bring into the public sphere awareness of European issues and therefore to spark a learning process. Secondly, the debates triggered by referendums give rise to the emergence of a European public sphere, even in member-states which do not conduct referendums. Thirdly, they can contribute to narrowing the gap between political elites and ordinary citizens, thereby reducing the democratic deficit. In addition to the burgeoning literature on the topic, which however focuses on the relationship between referendums and support for European integration, <b>Eurobarometers</b> provide substantive and quantitative data on the issues –namely European referendums and identities– raised in this paper. The study will focus on the twenty-seven referendums of the post-Treaty of Maastricht era. The discussion of the concept of European identity opens the essay. In the following sections, I present briefly the political and historical context in regard to referendums upon which I attempt to demonstrate the three specific mechanisms (learning process, European public sphere, and reduction of the democratic deficit) in the emergence of a European identity, using <b>Eurobarometers</b> data which show the evolution of national and European identification before and after the organization of the referendums. The conclusion discusses the findings and explores other elements that matter in constructing a European identity. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The end of the article shows the progress in knowledge these surveys have allowed to make. They are essential for clear and effective comparison between societies which till now was only based on monographic approaches.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between political knowledge and trust in the EU among the Romanian citizens between 2002 and 2009.

The statistical analysis reveals that the more citizens know about the EU, the more they trust it. Such a result gains supplementary relevance in the context of decreasing support. Two other general results are relevant for the Romanian case. First, although the level of political knowledge increases as the accession gets closer, it continues to be quite low. Second, the Romanian citizens constantly overestimate their knowledge about the EU...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} number of European governments have decided to hold referendums on European issues. Whether it is the Treaty of Nice, participation in EMU, the European Constitution or the Treaty of Lisbon, whether the referendum is legally required (e. g. Ireland) or government induced (e. g. France), the number of European referendums has increased. This increase has been accompanied, more often than not, by negative outcomes. Starting with the Danish rejection of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) in 1992, there has been an increase in negative outcomes in European referendums. These negative outcomes, along with fall in public support (see <b>Eurobarometers)</b> and the rise of Eurosceptic parties across Europe have brought public opinion to the centre of the political and academic debate, casting doubts about the resilience of the citizens’ “permissive consensus”. Whether it has become a “constraining dissensus” or not, the fact remains that there is a gap between Europe and its citizens {{and it seems to be}} widening. Several rationales have been put forward to explain the European referendums’ outcomes, mainly focusing on each country at a time. Within this debate, this paper aims to provide a holistic approach to voting in European referendums by exploring voting behaviour in five countries (Spain, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Ireland). First, this paper will explore the motivations behind citizens’ negative or positive voting. Secondly, it will look into the relation between citizens’ levels of information and voting behaviour in European referendums. For this purpose, there will be a qualitative analysis of the post-referendum <b>Eurobarometers</b> surveys, of the referendums in Spain, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg on the European Constitution and Ireland on the Treaty of Lisbon. The argument put forward will be that information levels play a crucial role in influencing the voting behaviour of European citizens, in that it is associated both with abstention and negative voting...|$|R

This article shows how the EU also shapes citizens' attitudes towards their domestic political institutions. Using survey data from the Candidate Countries and Standard <b>Eurobarometers</b> (2002 – 06), we show that political trust in national institutions in Central Europe {{is the effect of}} trust in the EU and of the expectations projected onto the evolution of the national economies. Such determinants got stronger after EU accession, thus supporting our central argument, according to which we witness a third phase in the formation of attitudes towards institutions in post-communist Europe. Keeping to these lines, our study sheds new light on the patterns and origins of political trust formation, showing that a transfer of legitimacy is possible not only from a national to a supranational level, but also in the reverse direction...|$|R

The paper hypothesizes that the visibility and the traceability of public policy (Pierson, 1993) are key to the explanation of their feedback effects on citizens’ preferences for the national, European and regional level respectively. Methodologically, the paper relies on comparative data on six European countries (France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) and several policy sectors.

The development of support for market reforms is analysed over time and countries. Moreover, in a number of panel regressions, individual and macroeconomic determinants of support for reforms are studied. Apart from the influence of individual characteristics (age, gender, education, income), the only significant and robust aggregate effect is that those countries that are able to keep inflation low get more support for market reforms. Small government budget deficits may also help to strengthen support.

40|$|In {{this study}} we show that, in the {{aftermath}} of the economic crisis, Romanians remain among the most enthusiastic citizens of the European Union, in what concerns trust in the European institutions, projections for the future, the image of the EU and general attitudes toward the union. Relying on data provided by <b>eurobarometers</b> since the Romanian integration, we argue that the reasons for this peculiar position of Romanians within the EU is largely due to how people evaluate the economic and political performance of their own country: from evaluations of the economy to trust in national institutions, Romanians are very pessimistic about how their country handles the present situation and about perspectives for the future. In this context, they turn to the European Union as to a Savior, who represents their hope and promise for a better future, for economic prosperity and security. This is the reason why, more than five years after the beginning of the financial crisis, Romanians are still among the most optimistic citizens of Europe...|$|R

We also use data from a number of <b>Eurobarometers</b> (2004 - 2007) as well as the 2005 Work Orientation module International Social Survey Programme to look at the attitudes of residents of these countries. Eastern Europeans report that they are unhappy with their lives and the country they live in, they are dissatisfied with their jobs, and they would experience difficulties finding a good new job or keeping their existing job. Relatively high proportions express a desire to move abroad. Eastern Europeans' expectations for the future of their domestic economies and their personal situations remain low, but have improved since 2004. There has been some deterioration in the availability of jobs in the UK as the economy moves into recession. However, the UK is an attractive place for Eastern Europeans to live and work. We argue that rather than dissipate, flows of Eastern European workers to the UK could remain strong well into the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{departure}} point of many discussions on European identity {{is the idea}} that a political community needs a common set of values and references to ensure its coherence, to guide his actions and to endow these with legitimacy and meaning.

That is why we will try to identify those values which brought the European countries together almost 60 years ago.

40|$|One of {{the last}} major {{political}} change in the History of Europe is without any doubt {{the construction of the}} European Union. Since the EU is conceived as a political system similar to nation states, the question whether or not European citizens legitimise this new political order by their approval and loyalty has been of major concern. If, nowadays, normative theories on European legitimacy and citizens’ attitudes towards European integration are a well-established subject, few sociological studies have been published that seek to bring a “bottom-up” perspective on this matter. Nevertheless, the question of the legitimacy of political authority has been for long now of central concern in classical political sociology. This paper aims to describe and understand the structure and evolution of European legitimacy in interaction with the national legitimacies by tracing the factors that shape people’s attitudes towards European integration in three countries : France, Belgium and Great-Britain, these countries having a relatively long experience of EU membership. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to reach a few general conclusions and hypothesis regarding ‘legitimacy in the specific context of the European Union’.
