2500|$|The {{initiative}} for establishing a major industry for lumber Nordenfjells was therefore both {{based on the}} desire for proximity {{as well as the}} desire for the forest owners themselves to own the mill. Plans were therefore gradually articulated within the Norwegian Forest Owners Association and its chapters. Various proposals were made, including expanding Folla Bruk, or building new mills either in Namdalen or Helgeland. Formal talks were initiated at a meeting held between the regional forest owners associations on 14 June 1958, initially discussing the possibilities of establishing a mill in Stjørdal. Central in the initiative was Ivar Aavatsmark and Anders B. Werp. This led to the establishment of the Forest Owners <b>Industrial</b> <b>Committee</b> Nordenfjelds on 8 December. An important preliminary work was the calculation that Central Norway had a chronic overproduction of [...] of lumber annually, which needed to be allocated to new industry.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Henry White, {{secretary}} of the United Garment Workers of America {{and a member of}} the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Committee</b> of the National Civic Federation, speaking of the National Civic Federation soon after its inception, said: [...] "To fall into one another's arms, to avow friendship, to express regret at the injury which has been done, would not alter the facts of the situation. Workingmen will continue to demand more pay, and the employer will naturally oppose them. The readiness and ability of the workmen to fight will, as usual, largely determine the amount of their wages or their share in the product. [...] . But when it comes to dividing the proceeds, there is the rub. We can also agree that the larger the product through the employment of labor-saving methods the better, as there will be more to be divided, but again the question of the division. [...] . A Conciliation Committee, having the confidence of the community, and composed of men possessing practical knowledge of industrial affairs, can therefore aid in mitigating this antagonism, in preventing avoidable conflicts, in bringing about a truce; I use the word 'truce' because understandings can only be temporary." ...|$|E
