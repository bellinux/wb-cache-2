40|$|The main {{result of}} this paper is the following: Any {{language}} in ESPACE that is bounded truthtable reducible <b>in</b> polynomial <b>time</b> <b>to</b> a set with very high space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity must be bounded truth-table reducible <b>in</b> polynomial <b>time</b> <b>to</b> a sparse set. Introduction The subject {{of this paper is}} the class of languages that are bounded reducible <b>in</b> polynomial <b>time</b> <b>to</b> languages with essentially maximal information content. Specifically, it is shown that any language recognizable in exponential space (denoted ESPACE) that is bounded truth-table reducible <b>in</b> polynomial <b>time</b> <b>to</b> a set with very high space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity must be bounded truth-table reducible <b>in</b> polynomial <b>time</b> <b>to</b> a sparse set. Using a recent result of Ogiwara and Watanabe, this implies that no language with very high space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity can be P btt -hard for NP, unless P=NP; similar results are given for other classes. Languages with very high space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity are v [...] ...|$|R
