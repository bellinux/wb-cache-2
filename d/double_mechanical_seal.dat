40|$|The {{successful}} {{fabrication of}} a miniature Wankel compressor relies on its seal performance. The {{factors that influence}} the seal of a miniature Wankel compressor mainly include axial <b>double</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>seal</b> and apex seals. Axial mechanical seal depends on machining precision on the end face. In the compression cavity, the springs for seal flake on the Wankel rotor put pressure on cylinder,which generates the desired amount of pressing force. When springs fails,high-pressure cavity and low-pressure cavity will be connected. Spring performance will directly affect the efficiency of a Wankel compressor. In this paper,we aim to introduce kinematic analysis of apex seals and force analysis of springs in a miniature Wankel compressor...|$|E

Future plant capacity requirements of the hydrocracker unit at a United Kingdom site required a 25 percent increase in capacity and a three to 10 percent increase in differential pressure of the charge pump duty.

40|$|Lecturepg. 63 Since {{the early}} 1970 s, the {{environmental}} protection has {{become more and more}} important when designing industrial plants and, today, this question is always first in any public discussion. Thus, the engineering profession ought to face the problems of environmental protection, and offer solutions in order to key pollution to a bare minimum. In this regard, attention should also be paid to environmental laws which are becoming increasingly restrictive with regard to leakage. Examples are the aggravated injunctions by government rules in West Germany and California, concerning the design pumps, respectively, of the shaft seals when transporting hydrocarbons, especially for fluorine chloride hydrocarbon liquids, as methylene chloride trichloroethylene and perchlorethylene. In view of environmental pollution, the weakest link of centrifugal pumps is the shaft <b>sealing,</b> because <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> always have some level of leakage. The average leakage rate of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>seal</b> is 3. 0 to 8. 0 cm?/h. This value may seem very low at first. However, considering the big chemical processing plants having thousands of pumps in operation, the atmosphere penetration leakage rate grows remarkably. Problems are caused by formation of dangerous explosive mixtures and those problems increase when toxic or bad smelling gases and vapors penetrate and endanger maintenance personnel. In order to avoid evaporation of the fluid film between the <b>mechanical</b> <b>seal</b> faces, additional cooling is required when handling products with a vapor pressure above the atmosphere pressure at operating temperature. When handling products which recrystallize in the atmosphere, a suitable quench connection must be provided. Such auxiliary seal devices should be provided with additional fittings and checking equipment. The affected liquid must be refined and treated. Past efforts have been made for improving the performance of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> and meeting these requirements. An example of this is the <b>double</b> acting <b>mechanical</b> <b>seal</b> of ?tandem design? and of ?back-to-back-design? with the relevant auxiliary equipment. But, it appears that <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> in conventional industrial pumps have nearly reached their developmental limits for increased reliability and lower leakage.

40|$|LectureThe use of CO 2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) {{has been}} around since the early 70 ?s and was {{developed}} to enable oil extraction from declining fields. The process involves injecting CO 2 from either natural or man-made sources into the ground to free up trapped crude oil that would otherwise not be possible to obtain. This process significantly improves the lifetime production of oil from mature fields. Moving the CO 2 from one field to another is accomplished through a series of pipelines and pumps using centrifugal technology. In the early days of this process, pumps were <b>sealed</b> using <b>double</b> pressurized <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals.</b> This particular sealing arrangement was selected because of the very poor lubricating qualities of CO 2, the desire for high reliability, and the lack of capability to seal this fluid in the liquid state using a single seal. The downside to this arrangement was the cost and complexity. This paper will focus on new technology that allows for contacting seal faces with minimal seal face temperature rise, minimal wear, and leakage almost an order of magnitude less than non-contacting gas seal technology. Details of the design, testing and successful field application of a contacting type liquid seal using engineered seal face micro features in a CO 2 pipeline application are presented...|$|R

Two of the largest providers of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> in the world provided reference lists showing that this application was pushing the tip speed limits for existing liquid end face <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals.</b> A vendor was selected and the seals were purchased. The first run of the seals on the test stand seemed successful, until the disassembly of the unit revealed the faces were severely overheated and heat checked. The face design was changed and the second test was successful. A major concern was to maintain a low seal leakage rate, so this was measured and was within the specified range. However, the third test resulted in a catastrophic failure of the rotating faces and collateral damage to the entire seal cartridge. Detailed investigation of the failure revealed several interesting problem areas. All of these were addressed in a new design which was implemented, built, and shipped in only one week!

Abnormal operating conditions in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> will degrade machine performance, increase operating cost and may cause unexpected sudden failures which are dangerous in both engineering and safety terms. Hence {{it is necessary to}} investigate the tribological behaviour of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> operating based on nonlinear coupling between fluid and surface dynamics, in order to develop more advanced diagnostic technologies to improve the reliability of such machines operating with <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals.</b> Different condition monitoring techniques have been studied to evaluate the lubrication state and severity of contact between the mating faces in <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals.</b> However, some of them are not cost effective others are not practical in industrial applications. Acoustic emission (AE) has been proved to be a sensitive indicator of lubrication conditions and changes in the lubricant properties, however the application of technique for identification of lubrication regimes in <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> has not been reported yet. Moreover, previous studies give relatively little information to acoustic emission condition monitoring of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals,</b> nor has comprehensive fault detection been implemented for a particular case. In addition, a review on previous works reveals the lack of comprehensive mathematical models to explain the relationship between AE energy and tribological characteristics of the mating faces under healthy and faulty conditions. In this research, the tribological behaviour of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> is investigated using acoustic emission measurements to pave a way for fault detection at early stage. Three common seal failures i. e. dry running, spring fault, and defective seal are studied in this thesis. The main objective is to extract AE features that can explain the tribological behaviour of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> under both healthy and faulty conditions. To achieve this, a purpose-built test rig was employed for collecting AE signals from the <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals.</b> Then, the collected data was processed using time domain, frequency domain and time frequency domain analysis methods which are of the most common techniques used for monitoring in AE applications. Based on results the main frequency band that can present the tribological behaviour of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> was detected. Also it has been proved that AE features in time domain and frequency domain can be effectively applied to indicate the lubrication condition of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> as well as early fault detection. Moreover, mathematical models were developed to establish a relationship between AE root mean square (RMS) value of AE signals and working parameters of seals (rotational speed, load and number of asperities in contact) under different lubrication regimes. A good agreement was achieved between measured and predicted signals that gives a good evidence of the effectiveness of proposed models. Especially in case of leakage {{that is one of the}} main situations indicating the seal failure, a significant difference was observed between the predicted signal for healthy case and the measured signal under faulty conditions. Therefore, it can be deduced that the AE measurement system and signal processing developed in this work has a promising potential to be used to diagnose and monitor the <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> online. Finally, the conclusions and achievements are given based on the entirety of this research work, and online monitoring incorporating with AE features and mathematical models developed in this thesis are suggested as the main works for further research...|$|R
