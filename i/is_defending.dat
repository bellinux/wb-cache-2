5|$|Three {{days after}} D-Day, Miller {{receives}} orders to find Ryan {{and bring him}} back from the front. He assembles six men from his company—T/Sgt. Mike Horvath, Privates First Class Richard Reiben and Adrian Caparzo, Privates Stanley Mellish and Danny Jackson, medic Irwin Wade—plus T/5 Timothy Upham, a cartographer and interpreter borrowed from another unit. They move out to Neuville, where they meet a squad from the 101st Airborne Division, where Caparzo is killed by a German sniper. They locate a Private James Ryan, but quickly learn he is not their man. They eventually encounter a friend of James Ryan, who tells them that he <b>is</b> <b>defending</b> an important bridge {{in the town of}} Ramelle.|$|E
5|$|Kate {{is upset}} about Sawyer not wanting {{her to come}} back to the beach with him to rescue Sayid, Jin and Bernard. Jack tells her it is because Sawyer was trying to protect her. When she asks why Jack <b>is</b> <b>defending</b> Sawyer, Jack informs Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) that it is because he loves her. Kate also {{witnessed}} a kiss between him and Juliet. Ben and Alex intercept Jack's group; Ben informs Jack that Naomi is not who she says she is, and making contact with her boat will be disastrous for everyone. Ben orders the shooting of Sayid, Jin, and Bernard, and when Jack hears three shots, he attacks Ben and punches him in the face repeatedly. Unknown to Jack, the shots were fired into the sand, following earlier orders from Ben. Rousseau meets her sixteen-year-old daughter Alex, who was kidnapped by the Others shortly after her birth, and they tie Ben up. The trek party, now able to get a signal, arrives at the radio tower. Rousseau disables her distress signal, freeing the frequency for Naomi. However, Naomi is knifed in the back by Locke, who threatens to kill Jack if he calls Naomi's boat. Locke cannot bring himself to kill Jack, who communicates with George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on Naomi's boat. Minkowski tells the survivors they will be sending rescue.|$|E

25|$|Serpents are {{connected}} with vengefulness and vindictiveness. This connection depends {{in part on}} the experience that venomous snakes often deliver deadly defensive bites without giving prior notice or warning to their unwitting victims. Although a snake <b>is</b> <b>defending</b> itself from the encroachment of its victim into the snake's immediate vicinity, the unannounced and deadly strike may seem unduly vengeful when measured against the unwitting victim's perceived lack of blameworthiness.|$|E

Cardona {{is represented by the}} Yale Law School Legal Services Clinic.

25|$|Many of {{the current}} systems have three {{different}} formations in each third, defending, middle, and attacking. The goal is to outnumber the other team {{in all parts of}} the field but to not completely wear out all the players on the team using it before the full ninety minutes are up. So the one single number is confusing as it may not actually look like a 4–2–1–3 when a team <b>is</b> <b>defending</b> or trying to gain possession. In a positive attack it may look exactly like a 4–2–1–3.|$|E

500|$|José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, {{also known}} as [...] "Dr. Francia", Karaí-Guasú ("Great Lord" [...] in Guaraní), or [...] "the Supreme", is the book's titular {{character}} and also undoubtedly its main focus. Most {{of the book is}} dedicated to his dictates to his secretary, Patiño. The Supreme is a domineering man, frequently belittling his closest confidant. He is also an infirm man, as the book is set a short time before his death on September 20, 1840. Roa Bastos's portrayal of him walks the line between praise and condemnation. While other authors of dictator novels clearly present their dictators as villains, Roa Bastos makes it unclear as to whether he <b>is</b> <b>defending</b> him or not. As Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria writes, the Supreme is [...] "constant [...] about writing. [...] {{stems from the fact that}} he has found and used the power implicit in language itself. The Supreme defines power as being able to do through others what we are unable to do ourselves: language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of power." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{system uses}} a {{multi-function}} Doppler radar, {{which can be}} turned on and off by the tank commander. [...] In conjunction with radar input, a digital computer scans an arc around the tank for threats, and evaluates which [...] of the tank's 26 quick-action projectiles it will release to intercept the incoming threat. [...] In selecting the projectile to use for defeating the threat, the ballistic computer employs the information processed by the radar, including information such as flight parameters and velocity. [...] The computer has a reaction time of 0.05 seconds and protects the tank over a 300-degree arc, everywhere but the rear side of the turret. The system engages targets within [...] of the vehicle it <b>is</b> <b>defending,</b> and the ammunition detonates at around [...] from the threat. [...] It will engage any threat approaching the tank between the velocities of [...] and , and can detect false targets, such as outgoing projectiles, birds and small caliber bullets. [...] Arena works {{during the day and}} night, and the lack of electromagnetic interference allows the system to be used by multiple vehicles as a team.

2500|$|Defending {{against the}} person who has the disc is a central part of the {{defensive}} strategy (colloquially [...] "marking").

If the disc has not been thrown when the defending player reaches 10, it is turned over to the other team. [...] "Stall" [...] can be only be called after the defender has actually counted the 10 seconds [...] There can only be one player defending in a 3-meter radius around {{the person who}} has the disk unless that player <b>is</b> <b>defending</b> against another offensive player.

Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu led their troops towards Nan Commandery and were separated from Cao Ren's forces by the river. Liu Bei told Zhou Yu, [...] "Cao Ren <b>is</b> <b>defending</b> Jiangling and he has much supplies in the city. He poses a big threat to us. I'll send Zhang Yide with 1,000 men to accompany you, while you despatch 2,000 troops to follow me.
