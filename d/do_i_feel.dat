500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V.

[...] He ultimately gave the episode a C-. TV Squad writer Joel Keller wrote that while [...] "the episode did have its funny moments", [...] "overall, you can just feel that the show has changed in a very fundamental way". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix criticized the writers for still not finding Deangelo's character out commenting that [...] "the fact that the writers so clearly {{had no idea what to}} do with Ferrell doesn't fill me with confidence for whatever guest stars turn up in the final episodes – nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> especially great right now about the idea of an outside character coming in as the permanent new regional manager." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's artwork is a computer-generated {{collage of}} images and text created by Stanley Donwood and Yorke, the latter {{credited}} under the pseudonym [...] "The White Chocolate Farm". Yorke commissioned Donwood {{to work on a}} visual diary alongside the recording sessions. Yorke explained, [...] "If I'm shown some kind of visual representation of the music, only then <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> confident. Up until that point, I'm a bit of a whirlwind." [...] The blue-and-white palette was, according to Donwood, the result of [...] "trying to make something the color of bleached bone." [...] The image of two stick figures shaking hands appears in the booklet and on the compact disc itself. Yorke explained the image as emblematic of exploitation: [...] "Someone's being sold something they don't really want, and someone's being friendly because they're trying to sell something. That's what it means to me." [...] Explaining the artwork's themes, Yorke said, [...] "It's quite sad, and quite funny as well. All the artwork and so on... It was all the things that I hadn't said in the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Nutter joined Conference National side Lincoln City on a free {{transfer}} in July 2011. Signing a two-year deal with Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "I {{think it will}} benefit {{me to have a}} fresh start, play in front of new people and show what I can <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> I'm better than this level but I've got to show that and we have to show that as a team". His Lincoln debut came on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match as Lincoln twice squandered a lead to draw 2–2 with Southport at Haig Avenue. He scored his first goal for the club in November 2011, netting Lincoln's third with a shot from outside the area in a 3–0 home win over Ebbsfleet United. Nutter would add to his goal tally once more during the campaign when he scored a 20-yard free-kick in an important 2–0 win against relegation rivals Newport County on 24 March 2012. Nutter played in all 51 of Lincoln's matches during the season, with the club struggling to adapt during their first season back in non-league, finishing just above the relegation places.|$|E
