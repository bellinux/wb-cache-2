5000|$|Jonatan Söderström, {{also known}} by his {{internet}} pseudonym Cactus, is a Swedish video game developer {{best known as}} co-designer and programmer of Hotline Miami (2012) and Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number (2015).

When asked about his game design style in an interview, Söderström replied [...] "Variation can be good, but so can consistency. When I make games I try to keep them unified and to the point, so I don't drift off too far. It's {{also one of the}} reasons most of my games are so short, when I feel like <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the game in a new direction I usually explore that new direction in a separate game instead". This further explains Söderström's unusually high output of concentrated games, most of which were developed within a span of two years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{series was}} {{developed}} in early 2012 by screenwriter, Suzette Doctolero (the writer behind such epic series as Encantadia, Etheria and Amaya) and under the supervisions of historians: Dr. Vic Villan of the University of the Philippines Diliman (who was also the consultant for Amaya) and Dr. Rolando Borrinaga; and GMA Entertainment TV creative heads, Jake Tordesillas and Jun Lana. The idea for series was conceived during the time Doctolero did her research on Amaya. According to her, the series {{is a combination of}} Philippine history and Filipino mythology. The show's staged in pre-colonial to Spanish colonial period setting (1565-1663). Regarding the title [...] "Indio" [...] -which was a label intended to be a badge of imposed by the Spanish on the natives— Doctolero stated that [...] "It is the first word that comes into our minds when we talk about Spanish colonization here the Philippines. It mirrors every Filipino. With this series, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> this label into something dignified and a source of pride." [...] GMA Network assigned Dondon Santos to helm the series. Santos is a former resident director of ABS-CBN and Indio is his very first project for GMA Network after he transferred and inked a contract with them.|$|E

5000|$|The video {{takes place}} in Venice, Italy, in {{familiar}} places such as Piazza San Marco, or the Grand Canal, and it begins with Paula who walks and recalls her past memories, and as she is reminded her story, ponders her desolation, and pain, in the present, trying to forget her break-up. Paula use mimicry when she tries to express her deep emotions, and finds a relief when she sees the pigeons fly through the sky. She sings: The storm is in my eyes, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back time/ We were kids and we loved each other so much, I remember when we hugged. In this phrase she reveals that her love was from her childhood, and the pain {{all the more so}} dreadful for her soul. Later, she meditates and gets used to this sweet pain, and as she sings in a gondola, she tries to understand what was wrong in their relationship; next to a fountain sheltered, the ladylove prays to the God with all of her heart to turn back time, to live again with this lover that change her life forever. The next scene follows Paula walking and touching the old columns, singing, and thinking that some day, her love, will come back. The ultimate scene is the most emblematic, Paula hide her face with a carnival mask, afraid from her lover revenge, but again, she sing full of pain: [...] "Every second is a torture/ And the same are the days that are coming / All I Want are us again". Marius Moga ends the song in the backing-vocals, and Paula screaming forever and for always her pain, the final scene encountering the gondolier with his boat and some shirts, idea that call to mind Paula's loneliness.|$|E
5000|$|BROCK: <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> now {{specifically}} to solidarity with Africa. And were you involved in solidarity activity {{with the growing}} anti-colonial movement in Africa, that sort of emerged after World War II in the late '40s and then sort of reached sort of a pinnacle in the '50s and '60s? Were you involved in any of that anti-colonial activity?MITCHELL: Actually, in the '40s, no. The most I knew about Africa in the '40s, I guess, was {{the existence of the}} ANC. But no, I really didn't know much about it. But in the '50s, in the late '40s, in the '50s, already there was tremendous concern on the left in the United States, but particularly in the Communist Party. Not all the left agreed in terms of the importance of Africa. And I began to read a lot. But also, there was Alphaeus Hunton, whom I had come to know, and his interest, and his knowledge about Africa was—really showed deep. And it was at that time that Ghana {{was in the process of}} receiving its—or winning, not receiving, its independence. And Du Bois was already interested in what was going to happen there. The interesting thing about it, at that time, was the Freedom newspaper—Paul Robeson and Louis Burnham, and Du Bois was kind of part of it, but they were mainly the activists there. And that was where there was a tremendous bringing together of the struggles in Africa and those for liberation in the United States, of African Americans. So that was when I really began to see the importance of it.And then in, I think it was 1957, I came to New York for a meeting, and I heard about a big demonstration that was going to be held in Washington, DC, and it was in support of the movements in Africa for liberation. And the speaker was Tom Mboya. And it was really interesting because we came back and the song that we were all—it was kind of a protest song when we were marching sometimes. It's [...] "I want to be a Mau Mau just like Jomo Kenyatta," [...] and it was kind of a more militant aspect of the youth movement and the peace movement and bringing it together. Because it wasn't taking place all over in the peace movement, or the youth movement, and we kind of saw the importance of that.And then, of course, what was happening in Kenya at the time—and I hadn't thought about it until right now, and that is all of the blame for the terrible violence and how awful, people were being hatcheted to death, and so on, is the same as they're projecting what's going on in Iraq, with the beheadings and so on. All the blame, now, is on the people who are conducting this kind of terror, and not the people who brought earlier all the terror up on these people, in terms of just forbidding them any humanity whatsoever. So I really had not thought about that until now.So, but that was kind of the beginning. And then, in 1960, when I went to London, one of the first people I went to meet with—well, I saw Claudia Jones, whom I had met earlier here in New York. Claudia was a member of the leading committees of the Communist Party and had been deported to London. So I went to visit her, and she took me to visit Yusuf Dadoo, who is an Indian member of the Communist Party and had been a member of the Indian Congress of South Africa. But by then he was a leader of the Communist Party and a leader in ANC, and at one point, I think the editor of the African Communist, which is a quarterly magazine that still comes out. And I remember being so impressed about his knowledge and his understanding of what actually was happening in Africa, and why South Africa was so important.And immediately after that, I began to hear more and understand more a phrase that Henry Winston, who's the chairman of the Communist Party, used. He would say that Israel was the northern end opening of American imperialism, and South Africa was the southern opening for imperialism in South Africa—in the world. And I kind of would put that together with what I had learned from Dadoo, and it was so very—not just moving, I mean, it explained so much to me that as a teenager, I could not understand. I'm not even sure teenagers do today, that Africans did not all come from—either come from princesses and princes or they were slaves. I mean, there were workers, there were people who were farmers. They were people. And they fought for their freedom from day one. But we seem to see it only as a bunch of people who need help, and not that they have been of assistance to the whole world development, and that a lot of the wealth in the world has come from that, from those workers.So to me, Africa opened its doors, to me, more as part of the movement and solidarity with us as we were with them. And I kind of always saw that as an equal thing, because I would learn so much from it.|$|E
