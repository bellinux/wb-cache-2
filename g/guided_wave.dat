[...] A common example is gravity waves along the surface of liquids, such as ocean waves. [...] Gravity waves can also occur within liquids, at the interface between two fluids with different densities. [...] Elastic surface waves can travel along the surface of solids, such as Rayleigh or Love waves. [...] Electromagnetic waves can also propagate as [...] "surface waves" [...] in {{that they can be}} guided along a refractive index gradient or along an interface between two media having different dielectric constants. In radio transmission, a ground wave is a <b>guided</b> <b>wave</b> that propagates close {{to the surface of the}} Earth.|$|E
