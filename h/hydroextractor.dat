5000|$|Hydroextractors are {{machines}} {{which are}} used in textile processing industry. These are mainly centrifuges. The wet material {{is placed in the}} extractor, which has a wall of perforated metal, generally stainless steel. the internal drum rotates at high speed thus throwing out the water contained in it. The use of <b>hydroextractor</b> significantly reduces the energy required to dry any material. Hydro Extractors usually work on centrifugal force creating a high Gravitational force enhancing water extraction.Hence the water is separated and the product is obtained in a dry form ...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} development of legislation {{designed to prevent}} the pollution of surface waters resulting from the industrial discharge of insect resist agents necessitates the development of zero pollution application technology. The insect resist treatment of wool carpet yarn hanks with permethrin based agents in a modified centrifugal <b>hydroextractor</b> is described. The distribution of insect resist agent adsorbed by the rotating load is {{discussed in terms of}} the influence of the emulsification system used to disperse permethrin into the aqueous treatment liquor. Macroemulsion based systems are shown to produce an unlevel treatment {{as a result of their}} preferential adsorption at the face of the yarn load, while microemulsion based systems are shown to result in an even distribution of permethrin throughout the load. The attainable effective yarn to liquor ratio and permethrin load in the spent liquor from the proposed system are shown to compare favourably with those obtainable in conventional and alternative low volume insect resist treatment systems...|$|E
