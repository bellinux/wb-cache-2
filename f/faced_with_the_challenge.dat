Tami is the new guidance counselor at East Dillon, where she is <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of a particularly difficult student named Epyck. Landry is departing for Rice University, and Tim Riggins has three more months in jail. Becky experiences turmoil in her living situation and moves in with Billy and Mindy and develops a family of her own with them, while also developing a closer relationship with Luke. With Vince leading the Lions, along with Luke Cafferty, new recruit Hastings Ruckle, {{and the rest of}} the team standing strong behind him, Eric Taylor has strong hopes for the team to go to state. But as Vince's past comes back to haunt him, it seems that the team will have to deal with struggles off the field, as well as on. Vince's troubles also cause his relationship with Jess to take a hit. Julie's college experience is nothing like she imagined, and after she experiences a difficult situation involving her history TA, she is forced to take a good look at what she wants. Buddy Garrity becomes a father again when Buddy Jr., who developed problems in California, is sent back to Dillon to get help from his father. He's pleased when his son becomes a Lions football player.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{beginning}} {{development of}} Crash Nitro Kart, Vicarious Visions {{chief executive officer}} and chief creative officer Karthik Bala noted that Crash's physical appearance had been inconsistent since his debut in 1996 and decided to [...] "explore the original vision of the character" [...] {{in an attempt to}} bring him back to his roots. Charles Zembillas and Joe Pearson were tracked down and enlisted for guidance during development of the game and were <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of evolving the character and the franchise visually while retaining their [...] "cartoon-like charm". To redesign Crash and the other mainstay characters of the series for Crash Nitro Kart, the Vicarious Visions team reviewed a number of original development sketches from Zembillas's archives and then redesigned the main characters by incorporating details from the concept art and adding girth to the characters; Crash's appearance in the game, compared to the previous two games, sports a slightly larger nose, fuller eyebrows, and a far more textured body. Zembillas noted that [...] "Crash is slimmer and more appealing now. There's also more emphasis on his eyes, {{and you can see the}} craftiness in his personality. That's Crash to me, and he's alive again in Nitro Kart".|$|E
500|$|Because so {{much was}} changed in AM2R {{compared}} to the original Metroid II, with color, a larger screen, [...] "less claustrophobic" [...] caves and new gameplay controls, Guasti was <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of recreating the original's feeling of danger within a more modern style: the original Metroid II featured [...] "tight-quarters combat", while AM2R greater amount of screen space and mobility meant that the Metroids' behavior had to be changed. They were made more agile and aggressive, with the intent that players would have to use all tools available to them to defeat them. The scale of the rooms throughout the game world also had to be changed, with some landmarks being redesigned to make better use of the larger screen; some, however, were kept similar in size to their Metroid II counterparts. While the game's first areas were made colorful and accurate to their counterparts in Metroid II, later areas were expanded and introduced new elements, featuring progressively darker caves, tighter passages, and Metroids found in more dangerous locations. This, along with increasingly darker and menacing music, was to recreate the feeling of Metroid II, which Guasti described as [...] "being lost in a dark, mysterious cave without knowing what's ahead". The added log system was designed to deliver narrative in a non-intrusive way.|$|E
