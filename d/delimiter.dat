5|$|An {{optional}} query, {{separated from}} the preceding part by a question mark (?), containing a query string of non-hierarchical data. Its syntax is not well defined, but by convention is most often a sequence of attribute–value pairs separated by a <b>delimiter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Note that to {{successfully}} separate the file names from the timestamps, the <b>delimiter</b> {{between them is}} a tab character. This is invisible on screen and can be lost when diffs are copy/pasted from console/terminal screens.|$|E
25|$|XML is {{a profile}} of an ISO {{standard}} SGML, and most of XML comes from SGML unchanged. From SGML comes the separation of logical and physical structures (elements and entities), the availability of grammar-based validation (DTDs), the separation of data and metadata (elements and attributes), mixed content, the separation of processing from representation (processing instructions), and the default angle-bracket syntax. Removed were the SGML declaration (XML has a fixed <b>delimiter</b> set and adopts Unicode as the document character set).|$|E
50|$|Bracket <b>delimiters</b> (also called block <b>delimiters,</b> region <b>delimiters</b> or {{balanced}} <b>delimiters)</b> mark {{both the}} start and end of a region of text.|$|R

25|$|Syntax {{highlighting}} {{also helps}} programmers find errors in their program. For example, most editors highlight string literals {{in a different}} color. Consequently, spotting a missing <b>delimiter</b> is much easier because of the contrasting color of the text. Brace matching is another important feature with many popular editors. This makes it simple {{to see if a}} brace has been left out or locate the match of the brace the cursor is on by highlighting the pair in a different color.|$|E
25|$|The FAT {{file system}} {{itself does not}} impose any limits on the depth of a {{subdirectory}} tree {{for as long as}} there are free clusters available to allocate the subdirectories, however, the internal Current Directory Structure (CDS) under MS-DOS/PCDOS limits the absolute path of a directory to 66 characters (including the drive letter, but excluding the NUL byte <b>delimiter),</b> thereby limiting the maximum supported depth of subdirectories to 32, whatever occurs earlier. Concurrent DOS, MultiuserDOS and DRDOS3.31 to 6.0 (up to including the 1992-11 updates) do not store absolute paths to working directories internally and therefore do not show this limitation. The same applies to Atari GEMDOS, but the Atari Desktop does not support more than 8 sub-directory levels. Most applications aware of this extension support paths up to at least 127bytes. FlexOS, 4680OS and 4690OS support a length of up to 127bytes as well, allowing depths down to 60 levels. PalmDOS, DRDOS6.0 (since BDOS7.1) and higher, NovellDOS, and OpenDOS sport a MS-DOS-compatible CDS and therefore have the same length limits as MS-DOS/PCDOS.|$|E

ML/I is a general purpose macro language which provides for the user specification of the argument <b>delimiters</b> of a macro, where each macro may have several possible patterns of <b>delimiters.</b> Other language features include nested and recursive macro calls and definitions, macro-time assignment and conditional statements, an extensive macrotime environment, the specification of a possibly variable number of <b>delimiters</b> for each macro, and a method of defining multi-atom macro names and <b>delimiters...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Miklós Locsmándi {{did some}} {{computer-based}} {{research on the}} text in the mid-1990s. He confirmed the published findings of Gyürk, adding several others. Although with no strong arguments, he claimed the symbol [...] "i" [...] to be a sentence <b>delimiter</b> (but also the symbol of 11 (eleven), and possibly also a place value <b>delimiter</b> in numbers). He studied the diacriticals of the symbols (mostly dots), but found no peculiar system in their usage. As he could see no traces of case endings (which are typically characteristic to the Hungarian language), he assumed that the text was probably in a language different from Hungarian. He could not prove that the codex is not a hoax; however, seeing the regularities of the text, he rejected that it be pure gibberish.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] stream I/O {{manipulator}} allows inserting and extracting strings with embedded spaces, {{by placing}} <b>delimiters</b> (defaulting to double-quotes) on output and stripping them on input, and escaping any embedded <b>delimiters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Using <b>delimiters</b> incurs some {{overhead}} {{in locating}} them {{every time they}} are processed (unlike fixed-width formatting), which may have performance implications. However, use of character <b>delimiters</b> (especially commas) is also a crude form of data compression which may assist overall performance by reducing data volumes — especially for data transmission purposes. Use of character <b>delimiters</b> which include a length component (Declarative notation) is comparatively rare but vastly reduces the overhead associated with locating the extent of each field.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, {{the symbol}} dx {{was taken to}} {{represent}} an infinitesimally [...] "small piece" [...] of the independent variable x to be multiplied by the integrand and summed up in an infinite sense. While this notion is still heuristically useful, later mathematicians have deemed infinitesimal quantities to be untenable {{from the standpoint of}} the real number system. In introductory calculus, the expression dx is therefore not assigned an independent meaning; instead, it is viewed as part of the symbol for integration and serves as its <b>delimiter</b> on the right side of the expression being integrated.|$|E
2500|$|Ideas that {{developed}} during discussion that are novel in XML included the algorithm for encoding detection and the encoding header, the processing instruction target, the xml:space attribute, {{and the new}} close <b>delimiter</b> for empty-element tags. The notion of well-formedness as opposed to validity (which enables parsing without a schema) was first formalized in XML, although it had been implemented successfully in the Electronic Book Technology [...] "Dynatext" [...] software; the software from the University of Waterloo New Oxford English Dictionary Project; the RISP LISP SGML text processor at Uniscope, Tokyo; the US Army Missile Command IADS hypertext system; Mentor Graphics Context; Interleaf and Xerox Publishing System.|$|E
2500|$|In SGML, XML, and HTML, the {{ampersand}} is used {{to introduce}} an SGML entity. The HTML and XML encoding for the ampersand character is the entity [...] "&amp;". This can create a problem known as <b>delimiter</b> collision when converting text {{into one of these}} markup languages. For instance, when putting URLs or other material containing ampersands into XML format files such as RSS files the & must be replaced with &amp; or they are considered not well formed, and computers will be unable to read the files correctly. SGML derived the use from IBM Generalized Markup Language, which was one of many IBM-mainframe languages to use the ampersand to signal a text substitution, eventually going back to System/360 macro assembly language.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple quoting is {{particularly}} useful with regular expressions that contain usual <b>delimiters</b> such as quotes, as this avoids needing to escape them.

50|$|A <b>delimiter</b> is a {{sequence}} {{of one or more}} characters used to specify the boundary between separate, independent regions in plain text or other data streams. An example of a <b>delimiter</b> is the comma character, which acts as a field <b>delimiter</b> in {{a sequence}} of comma-separated values. Another example of a <b>delimiter</b> is the time gap used to separate letters and words in the transmission of Morse code.|$|E

5000|$|A common {{application}} {{convention is}} to use a new line <b>delimiter</b> to separate or terminate records, commonly CR,CRLF or LF.
