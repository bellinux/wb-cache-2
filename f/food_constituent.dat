There is insufficient evidence to support any one fruit/vegetable or <b>food</b> <b>constituent</b> with a reduction of cancer occurrence. Fruits and vegetables have a wide range of nutrients and phytochemicals, thus to achieve optimal nutrient levels a variety is recommended. Some types of cancer signifies that not all types of cancers are diet related and thus not all types of cancer can be reduced by a dietary change. The statement “may help” eliminates consumer confusion that diet is the only factors in reducing risk of some types of cancers.

Non-digestible carbohydrates including FOS are resistant to hydrolysis and absorption in the small intestine and do not contribute to post-prandial glycaemia. This opinion applies to non-digestible carbohydrates (e. g. non-starch polysaccharides, resistant oligosaccharides and resistant starch) which should replace sugars in foods or beverages in order to obtain the claimed effect.

The Panel considers that a reduction of post-prandial glycaemic responses might be a beneficial physiological effect. In weighing the evidence, the Panel took into account that consumption of non-digestible carbohydrates results in reduced post-prandial blood glucose (and insulinaemic) responses compared with the consumption of sugars on a weight-by-weight basis owing to the non-digestibility in the small intestine and to a decrease in the amount of available carbohydrates, and that the consumption of foods/drinks in which non-digestible carbohydrates replaced sugars induced lower post-prandial glycaemic and insulinaemic responses than sugar-containing foods/drinks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Control of mycotoxins is {{the need}} of the hour, since their {{occurrence}} in foods and feeds is continuously posing threats to both health and economics all over the world. Besides the post-harvest preventive measures, {{it is important that}} suitable detoxifi-cation methods must be developed for inactivating or removing mycotoxins from the conta-minated commodities, as the toxins are also produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiti-cus even during pre-harvest stages of crop production. Several physical and chemical detoxification methods developed so far have been critically discussed in different reviews for their advantages and limitations based on certain adopted strategies and specific criteria. Understanding of mechanisms of mycotoxins detoxification by physical, chemical and microbiological methods will enable establishment of combined treatment procedures to effectively decontaminate, contaminated foods and feeds.

Although we are just {{at the very beginning}} of understanding the microbiota concept, we already know that the composition of the microbiota has a profound impact on human health.

40|$|Although limited, {{observations}} from cell culture, animal, and epidemiological studies support {{the presence of}} anti-cancer properties in citrus peel and the primary bioactive <b>food</b> <b>constituent,</b> d-limonene. Early evidence from animal models suggests that when ingested, d-limonene exhibits {{a wide spectrum of}} biologic activity including chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive effects. In some of these early models, an analog of d-limonene, perillyl alcohol, demonstrated a more potent effect than d-limonene itself. Yet, when perillyl alcohol advanced to clinical trials, several trials were ended early due to doselimiting toxicities. Alternatively, oral d-limonene administration in humans is well tolerated even at high doses supporting its investigation as a potential bioactive for cancer prevention. Though the exact mechanisms of action of d-limonene are unclear, immune modulation and antiproliferative effects are commonly reported.
