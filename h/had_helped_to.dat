Agrippa <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> secure Claudius' accession after the assassination of Caligula, and was appointed king of Judea. Tiberius' father, who had been imprisoned by Caligula, was released on Claudius' orders, and his younger brother Marcus became first husband to Agrippa's daughter Berenice.|$|E
5|$|Kingsley and Jane {{married in}} 1965 after meeting {{two years earlier}} at the Cheltenham Literary Festival, which she <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> organize. In 1947 she had left her first husband, Peter Scott, {{with whom she had}} a daughter, and in 1963 {{divorced}} her second, Jim Douglas-Henry. Kingsley was still married to his first wife, Hilly Bardwell, when he and Jane began an affair.|$|E

5|$|On October 4, 2011, Dylan's label, Egyptian Records, {{released}} {{an album of}} previously unheard Hank Williams songs, The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams. Dylan <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> curate this project, in which songs unfinished when Williams died in 1953 were completed and recorded {{by a variety of}} artists, including Dylan himself, his son Jakob Dylan, Levon Helm, Norah Jones, Jack White, and others.|$|E
5|$|After leaving MIT, Kotok {{joined the}} {{computer}} manufacturer DEC, {{where he worked}} for over 30 years. He was the chief architect of the PDP-10 family of computers, and created the company's Internet Business Group, responsible for several forms of Web-based technology.

5|$|Before {{the first}} {{gramophone}} disc recordings of The Rite were issued in 1929, Stravinsky <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> produce a pianola {{version of the}} work for the Aeolian Company. He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the French player piano company Pleyel, with whom he signed a contract in 1923 under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium. The Pleyel version of The Rite of Spring was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson recorded the work in this form in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1949, Nixon {{embarked}} on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California, where he was less well known, to see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran. With many of his closest advisers urging him to do so, Nixon decided in early October to seek the Senate seat. He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon's first congressional race.|$|E
5|$|In vain, the King urged Conservative leaders Arthur Balfour and Lord Lansdowne to {{pass the}} Budget, which Lord Esher had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> broker {{agreements}} between the two Houses over Irish disestablishment in 1869 and the Third Reform Act in 1884. On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) {{as a reward for}} doing so.|$|E

5|$|Molyneux's {{celestial}} globe was virtually {{a copy of}} Gerardus Mercator's globe of 1551, which itself {{was based on a}} globe of 1537 by Gemma Frisius that Mercator <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> construct. To the constellations featured on Mercator's globe, Molyneux added the Southern Cross and Southern Triangle, though somewhat to the west of their true positions. His source appears to have been Andrea Corsali's diagram of the Antarctic sky published in 1550.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{resigned}} from Parliament in 1903 {{to become one}} of the inaugural justices of the High Court of Australia, which he <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> create. He had a reputation as a liberal and independent-minded justice who occasionally voted with the progressives on industrial matters after 1906. He was also the first president of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration from 1905 to 1907, and he continued to serve on the High Court until his early death in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The {{charge that}} Christian Science came from Quimby, not divine revelation, stemmed {{in part from}} Eddy's use of Quimby's {{manuscript}} (right) when teaching Sally Wentworth and others in 1868â€“1870. Eddy said she <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> fix Quimby's unpublished work, and now stood accused of having copied her own corrections. Against this, Lyman P. Powell, one of Eddy's biographers, wrote in 1907 that Quimby's son held an almost identical copy, in Quimby's wife's handwriting, of the Quimby manuscript that Eddy had used when teaching Sally Wentworth. It was dated February 1862, eight months before Eddy met Quimby.|$|E

5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> create. The reputations {{of those who had}} testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, and the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully find that a child killer (Tom Noonan) who Mulder <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> apprehend several years earlier had claimed more victims than he had confessed to; and in the resulting investigation, learn that the killer is now claiming to have killed Mulder's sister Samantha.|$|E
5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> develop nuclear reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E

5|$|As {{the first}} {{settlers}} of the municipality, the Islanders {{and their descendants}} were designated hidalgos. The established settlers resented the Islanders for their new titles and exclusive privileges within the city government. The newcomers {{did not know how}} to handle horses, rendering them useless in mounted warfare against the Apaches. Unlike the established settlers, who relied on ranching, the Islanders were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage and the need for closer economic ties <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> alleviate some of the infighting, and the original settlers were given permission to serve as magistrates and council members.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the notorious}} laxity of the South Vietnamese {{military}} {{when it came}} to security precautions and the uncanny ability of communist agents to uncover operational information, the planning phase lasted only a few weeks and was divided between the American and Vietnamese high commands. At the lower levels, it was limited to the intelligence and operational staffs of ARVN's I Corps, under Lieutenant General HoÃ ng XuÃ¢n LÃ£m, who was to command the operation, and the XXIV Corps, headed by General Sutherland. When LÃ£m was finally briefed by MACV and the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff in Saigon, his chief of operations was forbidden to attend the meeting, even though he <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> write the very plan under discussion. At this meeting, LÃ£m's operational area was restricted to a corridor no wider than 15 miles on either side of Route 9 and a penetration no deeper than Tchepone.|$|E
5|$|Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan Hance (Jeremy Roberts), {{a serial}} killer Black <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> {{apprehend}} twenty years before. Hance was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked up during his tours of duty. Black {{was one of a}} number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who responded to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location â€” however, the tip was called in by Hance himself and the raid became an ambush. Three agents were killed, and Black was cornered by Hance, who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the young Black was able to overpower and arrest him.|$|E
