5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{was cast}} on this by Robert Dickson in 1878, when <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out that, while {{relatively}} high-status goods {{were found in}} some of the graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, {{there was a lack of}} weapons. He also talked of the apparent presence of female skeletons. Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long-Cist cemetery, including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with osteoarthritis, who apparently died of tuberculosis. In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a supine, east-west orientation.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E

5|$|Mountbatten {{used his}} {{influence}} with the princes {{to push them}} towards accession. He declared that the British Government would not grant dominion status {{to any of the}} princely states, nor would it accept them into the British Commonwealth, which meant that the states would sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the Indian subcontinent was one economic entity, and that the states would suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of communal violence and communist movements.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He {{explained}} why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> out that because Beck was a public figure he had to prove a legal standard referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{initially}} expected to work {{only through the}} Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} space probe taking one last picture of Earth. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> out that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, {{but it could have been}} meaningful nevertheless as a perspective on our place in the universe.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E
5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out {{similarities and differences between}} the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that this might have been a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|At their nominating {{convention}} in Louisville on May 11, 1887, Kentucky Republicans nominated Bradley for Governor of Kentucky to oppose Democrat Simon B. Buckner, a former Confederate general. In his acceptance speech, Bradley implored Kentuckians {{to realize that}} the Civil War was over and to discontinue their practice of electing ex-Confederate Democrats to public office. His platform included proposals for education, implementing of a high protective tariff, and developing the state's resources. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> out that, though Kentucky contained more coal than Pennsylvania, the state bought half of its coal from that state. A similar situation existed with regard to lumber. He was also critical of excessive spending during the preceding Democratic administrations. Among his cited examples of extravagance were the creation of a state bureau of agriculture and {{the construction of a new}} state penitentiary. Democratic mismanagement of the state's affairs had resulted in able, young Kentuckians leaving the state to seek their fortunes because of a lack of opportunity at home, Bradley lamented.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out that accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or {{near the end of}} a student's degree requirements), whether there is enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{highlighted}} what {{he perceived}} as scenes in Red Rackham's Treasure which reflected common themes in The Adventures of Tintin. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> {{out that in}} being a stowaway aboard the ship, Calculus {{was one of many}} stowaways in the series, and that the treasure represented the theme of jewels and precious stones which also cropped up in The Broken Ear, Tintin in the Congo, and The Castafiore Emerald. He noted Tintin's misreading of the parchments and stated this was {{one of a number of}} calculation mistakes that the character makes in the series. He suggested that a scene in which the shark submarine pushes between Haddock's buttocks was a form of sexual innuendo referencing anal sex, highlighting similar innuendo in The Broken Ear and The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E
5|$|Myers made {{passenger}} balloons for the St. Louis Fair in 1904. He was {{the superintendent}} of the Aeronautic Concourse of the St. Louis World's Fair. He {{was one of the}} managers in charge of a purse of $200,000 prize money for various balloon tournaments and races. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> out that building airships was very expensive and took knowledge of advanced balloon techniques that basically nobody in America had. Myers used as an example, to win the $20,000 prize of the Aero Club the French balloonist Alberto Santos-Dumont spent more than that amount in six airships he entered into the tournament to win. Myers himself had an over abundance of ideas for balloons, but was short on cash to make many of them a reality even though he had the necessary balloon knowledge. The newspapers printed that Myers was making a balloon capable of holding 75,000 to 100,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|On 10 December 1936, Álvarez put the Republic's {{case to the}} League of Nations, further {{demanding}} that the League condemn Italy's and Germany's decision to recognise the Nationalists. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> {{to the risk of}} the Spanish war spreading, and suggested that the Non-Intervention Committee was ineffective. This charge was denied by Lord Cranborne and Édouard Viénot, the British and French representatives respectively, who appealed to the League to endorse the mediation plan. The League condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended mediation. It then closed discussion on Spain, leaving it to the Committee. The mediation plan, however, was soon dropped. Britain and France continued to consider, and put forward, plans to prevent foreign volunteers, outside of the Committee.|$|E
5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E
5|$|Peter Adamson offered {{several more}} {{possible}} lines of criticism. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> out that Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach {{to prove the}} necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof of the necessary existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, {{by saying that the}} universe could just happen to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E
