5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{is known}} from the lowland forests of Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, {{and can be found}} in June. Mushrooms grow in large numbers close together, and <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> dead leaves of Sasa (grass bamboo) which have fallen.|$|E
5|$|On {{the orders}} of Manuel I of Portugal, four vessels {{under the command of}} {{navigator}} Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, continuing to the eastern coast of Africa to Malindi to sail across the Indian Ocean to Calicut. The wealth of the Indies was now open for the Europeans to explore; the Portuguese Empire was one of the early European empires to <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> spice trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{blades of}} the new {{sporophyte}} <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> one or two initial blades by splitting. A tear forms {{in the middle of}} the blade at its base, which then continues along the entire length of the blade until it is split in two.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2010 census, 43% of Singapore's Chinese {{population}} declared themselves Buddhist (declining from 53.6% in 2000), 20.1% Christian (<b>growing</b> <b>from</b> 16.5% in 2000), 14.4% Taoist (<b>growing</b> <b>from</b> 10.8% in 2000), and 21.8% non-religious (<b>growing</b> <b>from</b> 18.6% in 2000). Chinese {{comprise the}} vast majority in these four groups due to their dominance in Singapore.|$|R

5|$|While {{exploring}} the planet, Samus encounters Metroids and destroys them, slowly decreasing the planet's Metroid population. During her mission, she notices the mutations that each creature exhibits: the Metroids <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> small jellyfish-like creatures into large, hovering, lizard-like beasts. After destroying {{most of the}} planet's Metroids, Samus encounters and battles the Queen Metroid. Killing it, Samus proceeds {{to return to her}} gunship through the planet's tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species that}} have been {{observed}} foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-plumed honeyeater (L.penicillatus), white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris niger), New Holland honeyeater (P.novaehollandiae), noisy friarbird (Philemon corniculatus), noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European honey bee and ants. The swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) eats new shoots that <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> lignotubers after bushfire.|$|E
5|$|Even with Nashville {{no longer}} a {{connecting}} hub for a major airline, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, the number of passengers using BNA is expected to <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> 13 million to over 20 million by 2035. The MNAA leadership has a stated goal of adding more nonstop destinations, increasing cargo service, and adding more international flights. To accommodate the projected growth and aid with landing new nonstop flights, the Metro Nashville Airport Authority has announced a $1.2 billion renovation of the airport dubbed as BNA Vision. It {{is expected to be}} completed by 2023.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} <b>grows</b> <b>from</b> {{the apex}} of the pseudobulb, and differs from most sympodial orchids in that one pseudobulb will sometimes produce inflorescences for several years. This, combined with the habit of new pseudobulbs <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> the apices of old ones, creates the impression that there are inflorescences <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> the middle of the stem. The inflorescence can be solitary, successive, racemose or paniculate.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}}s of many small Texas towns had even greater population increases when oil discoveries brought prospectors, investors, field laborers, and businessmen. Between 1920 and 1922, {{the town of}} Breckenridge in rural North Texas <b>grew</b> <b>from</b> about 1,500 people to nearly 30,000. Between 1925 and 1929, the town of Odessa in the Permian Basin <b>grew</b> <b>from</b> 750 to 5,000. Between 1924 and 1925, the town of Wortham in northern Texas <b>grew</b> <b>from</b> 1,000 to about 30,000. The town of Kilgore in eastern Texas <b>grew</b> <b>from</b> about 500 to 12,000 between 1930 and 1936 following {{the discovery of the}} East Texas field.|$|R
5000|$|The word cormous {{is used to}} {{describe}} plants <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> corms, in analogy {{to the use of}} the terms [...] "tuberous" [...] and [...] "bulbous" [...] {{to describe}} plants <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> tubers and bulbs.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to making secretory proteins, the rough ER makes membranes that grows in place from {{the addition of}} proteins and phospholipids. As polypeptides intended to be membrane proteins <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER membrane itself and are kept there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER also produces its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids. The ER membrane expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow trees, {{and it is}} for this that the species is named. However, particular species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include beech and alder taxa. The mushrooms <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> the ground, often among mosses or detritus. I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, the species {{is a part of the}} section Marginatae. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|T. oreades has a swollen woody base largely {{under the}} soil {{known as a}} lignotuber, which stores energy and {{nutrients}} {{as a resource for}} rapid growth after a bushfire. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire. When they do, the plant community becomes a more open sclerophyll woodland until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> the lignotuber, which survives bushfire {{as the rest of the}} plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} steamboats on western rivers in the U.S. <b>grew</b> <b>from</b> 187 in 1830 to 735 in 1860. Total {{registered}} tonnage of steam vessels for the U.S. <b>grew</b> <b>from</b> 63,052 in 1830 to 770,641 in 1860.|$|R

5|$|The Red Sox chose Ruffing to {{be their}} Opening Day {{starting}} pitcher for the 1929 season. During the 1929 season, he again led the AL in losses, with 22, and earned runs, with 135. He won only nine games. Ruffing often had difficulty pitching more than five innings in a game. Someone in the Red Sox organization suggested to Ruffing that he should try to gain weight by drinking beer, which saw him <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> 185pounds (84kg) to 240 pounds (110kg).|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} ADF {{personnel}} {{has changed over}} the last 20 years. During the 1990s the strength of the ADF was reduced from around 70,000 to 50,000 permanent personnel as a result of budget cuts and the commercialisation of some elements of the military. The ADF began to <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> 2000 after the defence white paper released that year called for an expansion to the military's strength, though the size of the military decreased between the 2003–04 to 2005–06 financial due to problems with attracting further recruits. By 2009–10 the ADF was above its budgeted size, leading to reductions until 2014–15. The ADF has not met its recruitment targets over the period since the 1995–96 financial year.|$|E
5|$|The two lions have a male mane, {{patterned}} with dense, short lines; the manes continue beneath the body. Distinctly patterned tufts of hair <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> the lion's ears {{and on their}} shoulders, emanating from a central disk-shaped whorl. They lie prone, their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, but {{with a degree of}} artistic liberty in their form, e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, and both have their mouths closed.|$|E

5000|$|Stacks {{are often}} visualized <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> {{the bottom up}} (like {{real-world}} stacks). They may also be visualized <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> left to right, so that [...] "topmost" [...] becomes [...] "rightmost", or even <b>growing</b> <b>from</b> top to bottom. The important feature is that {{the bottom of the}} stack is in a fixed position. The illustration in this section {{is an example of a}} top-to-bottom growth visualization: the top (28) is the stack [...] "bottom", since the stack [...] "top" [...] is where items are pushed or popped from.|$|R
5|$|The typical {{cultivated}} Cucurbita {{species has}} five-lobed or palmately divided leaves with long petioles, with the leaves alternately arranged on the stem. The stems in some species are angular. All of the above-ground parts may be hairy with {{various types of}} trichomes, which are often hardened and sharp. Spring-like tendrils <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> each node and are branching in some species. C.argyrosperma has ovate-cordate (egg-shaped to heart-shaped) leaves. The shape of C.pepo leaves varies widely. C.moschata plants can have light or dense pubescence. C.ficifolia leaves are slightly angular and have light pubescence. The leaves of all four of these species {{may or may not}} have white spots.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{asserts that}} all wild trees <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> seed or from roots. He {{mentions}} that the philosophers spoke of spontaneous generation, as when Anaxagoras claims the air contains {{the seeds of}} every plant, whereas Diogenes believed plants arose when water mixed with earth. In places like Crete, Theophrastus writes that native plants spring up if the ground is simply disturbed, and that wild trees are generally more vigorous than cultivated ones, give fruit later, and like cold and hilly terrain. He asserts that trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when grown on the plain.|$|E
5|$|Two-year-old bushes {{are usually}} planted but strong one-year-old stock {{can also be}} used. Planting {{certified}} stock avoids the risk of introducing viruses. On a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6ft) or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of 1.2 metres (4ft) and row separations of 2.5 metres (8ft) or more. In the UK, young bushes are generally planted deeper than their initial growing level to encourage new stems to <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> the base.|$|E
50|$|R. pandanifolia can be {{described}} as an erect tree or shrub. It <b>grows</b> <b>from</b> 2 to 12 m in height. While it usually <b>grows</b> <b>from</b> just one stem, it can sometimes be branched. This branching occurs in the lowland subspecies as well as in damaged alpine plants.|$|R

5|$|Flower {{development}} {{begins when}} the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem {{capable of producing}} stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs {{at the end of}} the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
5|$|Research {{published}} by Bloomberg New Energy Finance in February 2016 predicts that as battery prices continue to fall, light-duty electric vehicles without government subsidies {{will be as}} affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by the mid-2020s. As a result, the study forecasts that annual sales of electric vehicles will hit 41 million by 2040, representing 35% of new light duty vehicle sales. In another scenario the study considers that if new carsharing services are successful, together with the adoption of autonomous cars, they could boost electric-vehicle market share to 50% of new car saless by 2040. On the other hand, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in its 2015 World Oil Outlook projected that the market share of battery electric cars and fuel cell cars will remain below 1% in 2040, while the share of hybrid electric cars is projected to <b>grow</b> <b>from</b> 1% in 2013 to 14% in 2040.|$|E
