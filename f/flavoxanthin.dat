50|$|The petals and pollen of Calendula officinalis contain triterpenoid esters and the {{carotenoids}} <b>flavoxanthin</b> and auroxanthin (antioxidants and {{the source}} of the yellow-orange coloration). The leaves and stems contain other carotenoids, mostly lutein (80%), zeaxanthin (5%), and beta-carotene. Plant extracts are also widely used by cosmetics, presumably due to presence of compounds such as saponins, resins, and essential oils.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flavoxanthin</b> is {{a natural}} {{xanthophyll}} pigment with a golden-yellow color found in small quantities {{in a variety of}} plants. As a food additive it used under the E number E161a as a food coloring although it is not approved for use in the EU or USA. It is listed as food additive 161a in Australia and New Zealand where it is approved for usage as an ingredient in food products.|$|E
5000|$|The {{group of}} {{xanthophylls}} includes (among many other compounds) lutein, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, <b>flavoxanthin,</b> and α- and β-cryptoxanthin. The latter compound {{is the only}} known xanthophyll to contain a beta-ionone ring, and thus β-cryptoxanthin is the only xanthophyll that is known to possess pro-vitamin A activity for mammals. Even then, it is a vitamin only for plant-eating mammals that possess the enzyme to make retinal from carotenoids that contain beta-ionone (some carnivores lack this enzyme). In species other than mammals, certain xanthophylls may be converted to hydroxylated retinal-analogues that function directly in vision. For example, {{with the exception of}} certain flies, most insects use the xanthophyll derived R-isomer of 3-hydroxyretinal for visual activities, which means that β-cryptoxanthin and other xanthophylls (such as lutein and zeaxanthin) may function as forms of visual [...] "vitamin A" [...] for them, while carotenes (such as beta carotene) do not.|$|E
40|$|The {{pigments}} {{of seven}} local Cucurbita varieties were determined. In the fruits only carotenoids with alfa- and beta-iononic structure were identified: hydrocarbon carotenoids (alfa- and beta-carotene), xanthophylls (cryptoxanthin, aloxanthin, mutatoxanthin, auroxanthin, violaxanthin, neoxanthin). Quantitatively, the main carotenoid pigments are beta-caroten and zeaxanthin, <b>flavoxanthin</b> and violaxanthin. There are {{differences among the}} varieties of C. maxima, both quantitatively and qualitatively, due to genetic and/or environmental influences...|$|E
40|$|Carotenoids in {{grapes of}} three Port {{winemaking}} cultivars were investigated. Extracts were obtained with n-hexane/diethyl ether mixtures (0 / 100; 20 / 80; 50 / 50; 100 / 0) and analyzed by normal and reversed phase HPLC-DAD. Selection and identification of peaks {{were based on}} spectroscopic characteristics - ìmax, (%III/II) and k¢ values, leading to 28 probable carotenoids. Using pure standards, {{it was possible to}} identify seven compounds previously described (neochrome, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, <b>flavoxanthin,</b> zeaxanthin, lutein, and â-carotene), one more type of neochrome reported here, for the first time, and in addition, two geometrical isomers of lutein and â-carotene were tentatively described. The remaining 17 need to be further identified. High polarity solvent mixtures lead to qualitatively richer chromatograms. Reversed-phase separations allowed the detection of <b>flavoxanthin</b> and the possible geometrical isomer(s) of â-carotene. Under normal phase, zeaxanthin was detected, and neochromes were better separated from neoxanthin. Extraction with 50 / 50 n-hexane/diethyl ether mixtures and reversed-phase conditions was the best combination for analysis of the carotenoids, known as precursors of compounds with high aroma impact in wines...|$|E
40|$|Calendula officinalis, {{known as}} Pot Marigold or English Marigold, is {{a plant in}} the Calendula genus. Calendula officinalis {{is used for the}} {{treatment}} of skin disorders and pain, and as a bactericide, antiseptic and anti-inflammatory. The petals and pollen contain triterpenoid esters (an antiinflammatory) and the carotenoids <b>flavoxanthin</b> and auroxanthin (antioxidants, and the source of the yellow-orange coloration). The leaves and stems contain other carotenoids, mostly lutein (80 %) and zeaxanthin (5 %), and beta-carotene. Plant extracts are also widely used by cosmetics, presumably due to presence of compounds such as saponins, resins and essential oils...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of cartenoids in nineteen species of lichens from Kenya (Equatorial Africa) was studied by column and thinlayer chromatography. This investigations revealed the {{presence of}} the following carotenoids: neurosporene, α-carotene, β-carotene, rubixanthin, α-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, 3 '-epilutein, torularhodin, diatoxanthin, neoxanthin, echinenone, 3 '-hydroxyechinenone, canthaxanthin, α-doradexanthin, astaxanthin, β-carotene epoxide, antheraxanthin, lutein epoxide, violaxanthin, mutatoxanthin, <b>flavoxanthin,</b> capsochrome, β-apo- 8 '-carotenal, β-apo- 10 '-carotenal and apo- 12 '-violaxanthal. Five of these, torularhodin, 3 '-hydroxyechinenone, capsochrome, β-apo- 8 '-carotenal and β-apo- 10 '-carotenal, are reported for the first time from lichens. The total carotenoid content of the material ranged from 15. 88 (Pyxine cocoes) to 135. 44 µg g- 1 dry weight (Telaschistes chrysophthalmus) ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 This study first {{investigated}} the developmental {{changes in the}} volatile composition and carotenoids of Pinot noir grapes. Grape berries were sampled every week from pea size to harvest during the 2011 and 2012 season. Carotenoids and organic acids were analyzed by HPLC. Volatile compounds were extracted from crushed berries using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and C₁₃-norisoprenoids potentials were analyzed by HS-SPME-GC-MS after acid hydrolysis. Malic acid accumulated before véraison and decreased dramatically during ripening. Carotenoids and chlorophylls decreased during entire developmental period although some of carotenoids showed a short accumulation stage before véraison. Pinot noir grapes had a more complex volatile compound composition pre-véraison than post-véraison, which may due to the decreasing of monoterpenes during ripening. C 6 -aldehydes significantly increased in concentration after véraison. C 6 -alcohols accumulated around véraison and decreased during ripening. Benzyl and phenylethyl alcohols increased before véraison, reached the highest amount two weeks after véraison and slightly decreased towards harvest. The concentration of volatile phenols reached the highest amount at véraison, decreased in about one week, then stayed relatively stable through maturity. Free-form C₁₃-norisoprenoids was low, but higher after acid hydrolysis, indicating the dominance of C₁₃-norisoprenoids precursors. Total C₁₃-norisoprenoids increased after véraison, corresponding to carotenoid breaking down. The analysis of grape composition in this study demonstrated a quantitative means of assessing the relationships between vineyard management practices and grape-derived secondary metabolites, {{some of which are}} important wine aroma and flavor components. Effect of cluster zone leaf removal management on grape composition were further investigated. Three cluster zone leaf removal management, including 0 % leaf removal (Control), 50 % leaf removal and 100 % leaf removal of the cluster zone were studied in commercial vineyards from 2010 to 2012. Grape samples were harvested every year and analyzed for total soluble solids (TSS), organic acids, phenolics and carotenoids. Leaf removal had no impact on grape TSS, citric and tartaric acids but lowered malic acid in year 2012. Leaf removal increased quercetin glycoside content in grape berry in three years, and increased anthocyanin content in year 2010 and 2012. For carotenoids, leaf removal decreased <b>flavoxanthin</b> content in the grape berry and decreased β-carotene in 2012. It is evident that more sun exposure as a result of leaf removal increases degradation of carotenoids, and could potentially increase concentration of norisoprenoids in grapes...|$|E
