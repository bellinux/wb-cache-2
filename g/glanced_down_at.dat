60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her high-necked {{gown and}} avoided Helen's anxious eyes.|$|E
60|$|Hunter {{laughed as}} he <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his hard brown hands and dusty attire.|$|E
60|$|George <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his soaked clothes. It {{had been}} a nice suit once.|$|E
60|$|Sarah {{shook her}} head regretfully, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her muslin gown.|$|R
60|$|When Jason said this, {{the king}} gave a quick startled <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his feet.|$|R
60|$|Gerald {{listened with}} quick impatience. He kept <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Birkin, as if looking for {{something}} from the other man.|$|R
60|$|Furley <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his incongruous attire {{and seemed}} {{for a moment}} ill at ease.|$|E
60|$|Ralph <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his shoes, and {{saw that}} they were decidedly in need of {{brushing}} up.|$|E
60|$|He {{took his}} eyes off the road and <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her curiously. His smile was self-confident, exultant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will she?" [...] said James, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the solid}} boots, which the short bicycle skirt rather obtrusively exposed to view.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{woman is}} here," [...] replied the chief gravely, casting a brief <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the {{wrinkled}} old visage that nestled upon his breast--"my mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come! I reckon that squeezin' hands ain't {{no part of}} your {{contract}} with Sandy?" [...] she said, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her own. [...] "Well, so you're goin'?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{he merely}} <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the cigar {{for a moment}} and then {{conveyed}} it to his lips.|$|E
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him, startled. He was sitting, {{with his}} legs crossed, {{looking up at her}} intently.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his {{unfinished}} breakfast. He had {{the air of}} one who is {{a little}} bored.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{suddenly}} she fell mute, and <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her face, I read {{in an instant}} the thing she had thought to do. It {{was one of those}} moments when one sees.|$|R
6000|$|As {{he got up}} {{dripping}} from the cold bath, he felt for the moment exhilarated. He rubbed himself smooth. <b>Glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> himself, he thought: 'I look young. I look as young as twenty-six.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{one of the}} {{unpleasant}} things of the country," [...] responded Paul, with a little laugh. [...] "But how came you in it?" [...] with a <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the spurs on the man's boots.|$|R
60|$|After a while Ida {{lifted his}} right hand gently, and <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the {{battered}} knuckles and broken nails.|$|E
60|$|She broke off, and <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the big liner with cream-colored funnel {{that was}} slowly {{swinging}} across the stream.|$|E
60|$|After pronouncing {{these words}} with immense assurance, he <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, {{and at once}} fell a prey to distress, incertitude, and fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "All will be right, dear," [...] said she, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the fluffy yellow {{curls and}} tiny ear. [...] "There {{is still much}} to be done, but I think we may venture to order the trousseau." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if you had"--he went on more hesitatingly, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his travel-torn and frayed garments--"anything like a coat, or {{any other}} clothing? It would {{disguise}} me also, you see, and put 'em off the track." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{after a short}} pause--"Will {{you burn}} the village for vengeance?" [...] asked the Malay with a quick <b>glance</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the dead Lascar who, {{on his face and}} with {{stretched}} arms, seemed to cling desperately to that earth of which he had known so little.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his horse's quivering sides. Back {{as far as}} {{one could}} see there was that regular line of hoof marks.|$|E
60|$|She {{laid the}} extreme {{tips of her}} fingers upon his coat sleeve. He <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them for a moment. Her {{reluctance}} was evident.|$|E
60|$|Courthorne <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the deerskin {{jacket and}} {{smiled as he}} {{straightened}} himself into a caricature of Winston's mounted attitude. It was done cleverly.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Chris {{spread his}} shapely legs before the fire, and <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> kindly <b>at</b> Nelly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} it is quite fair to these gentlemen whose names have been so long upon our list," [...] said Mr. Lumsden, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his open ledger. [...] "But the {{coincidence}} is so striking that I feel we must really give you the refusal of it." ...|$|R
60|$|MINNIE (flaring up). What life? Don't {{worry about}} me, Mrs. Pindar,--I get twenty five {{dollars a week}} at the Shale Works making barb wire to trip up the Huns with,--enough to get nice clothes--(she <b>glances</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her dress) and buy good food, {{and have a good time}} on the side.|$|R
60|$|Laura hesitated, puzzled. Just {{then the}} Professor came cantering {{in with a}} bundle of grass in his hand. He <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the Chinaman.|$|E
60|$|Maxwell next <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the negro}} pitifully, his {{forehead}} contracted {{and his lips}} firmly set, but he nodded abruptly when Dane spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|Barbison <b>glanced</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his {{dilapidated}} attire. [...] "Can I go ashore this way? I'll {{ask you a}} favor. Let me {{stay until}} it's dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't! That's {{the kind}} of thing some of Gerald's smart friends say, and it makes one want to slap them! Besides," [...] she added naively, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her curtailed skirt, [...] "I'm by no means so young as I appear to be. The fact is, I'm not allowed to grow up yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|Breathing hard, {{he looked}} them over one by one. [...] "You're a pretty bunch of citizens," [...] he said, with cutting contempt. [...] "You {{ought to be}} shot--every man jack of you!" [...] Then <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the wounded gambler at his feet, he added: [...] "Some of you better take this whelp to a doctor. He needs help." ...|$|R
5000|$|There's {{something}} incredible {{about running}} around this world in first-person, <b>glancing</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Trevor's hands, now {{your hands and}} seeing the tattoos, the dirt under his nails ... And then with a click you're in third person and there's your character again in front of youâ€”it's a whole other new experience. Aaron Garbut, Rockstar art director, IGN, 5 November 2014 ...|$|R
