5|$|Ann (Rashida Jones), who is {{preparing}} for her first date with Mark (Paul Schneider), worriedly asks Leslie (Amy Poehler) if she has any reservations, since Leslie previously had feelings for him. Leslie insists she is fine. Later, Leslie and Tom (Aziz Ansari) visit a community garden in the Pawnee pit, where they <b>find</b> <b>what</b> appears to be marijuana.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{meets with}} a Ferengi vessel whose captain, DaiMon Bok, {{requests}} {{a meeting with}} Captain Picard. Picard meanwhile is suffering from persistent headaches and seeks the help of Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden). She scans Picard, but can not <b>find</b> <b>what</b> is causing them. Meanwhile, on the bridge, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) reports that a second vessel is approaching. Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) identifies it as a Federation Constellation-class starship.|$|E
5|$|Later, between 2009 and 2011, {{another team}} of astronomers {{observed}} WASP-13b and WASP-21b to <b>find</b> <b>what</b> caused some Hot Jupiters to have anomalously high radii. The RISE photometric {{camera on the}} Liverpool Telescope was used to detect further transits. Two partial transits and two full transits were observed during this period, although the quality of both full transits was slightly compromised because of passing cloud cover. The collected observations, along with the JGT observations {{that were used to}} confirm the planet, were scaled to filter out errors such as background noise. The data was then used to re-define WASP-13b's parameters, including its age, mass, radius, and density. The study also noted that a limb darkening effect was present, a characteristic that may affect future atmospheric studies of the planet.|$|E

5|$|During {{his initial}} {{research}} into cyberculture, Idol ordered Beyond Cyberpunk! from Gareth Branwyn. The HyperCard stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the Cyberpunk album {{as a special}} edition digipak feature. Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid {{for the job of}} producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by Jaime Levy at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of Electronic Hollywood, one of the first magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for the job of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn, she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs – which were not yet compiled into CD format – for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to <b>find</b> <b>what</b> he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only concern was that the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.|$|E
25|$|At {{night in}} her bayside mansion, wheelchair-bound Countess Federica (Isa Miranda) is {{attacked}} and strangled {{to death by}} her husband Filippo Donati (Giovanni Nuvoletti). Moments later, Filippo himself is attacked and brutally stabbed to death by an assailant, and his corpse is then dragged to the bay. Upon investigation, the police <b>find</b> <b>what</b> {{they believe to be}} a suicide note written by the Countess, but Donati's murder goes undiscovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{public library}} {{was one of}} the most {{important}} points of access for interviewees, along with the internet and bookstores. Interviewees often relied heavily on online library catalogs as safe, anonymous searches to explore lesbian fiction. Participants often did not <b>find</b> <b>what</b> they were looking for in online catalogs, but were not surprised by the lack of materials. Rothbauer suggests making materials more visible, and also improving the scope and currency of library holdings to reach these users.|$|E

25|$|The upper {{panel in}} the image at right shows a ball in {{circular}} motion on a banked curve. The curve is banked at an angle θ from the horizontal, and {{the surface of the}} road is considered to be slippery. The objective is to <b>find</b> <b>what</b> angle the bank must have so the ball does not slide off the road. Intuition tells us that, on a flat curve with no banking at all, the ball will simply slide off the road; while with a very steep banking, the ball will slide to the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.|$|E
25|$|At the Great Library, Ebling Mis works {{continuously}} {{until his}} health fatally deteriorates. As Mis lies dying, he tells Toran, Bayta, and Magnifico {{that he knows}} where the Second Foundation is. But just before he can reveal the Second Foundation's location, however, Bayta kills him. Bayta had realized, shortly before, that Magnifico was actually the Mule, who had used his powers in every planet they had previously visited. In the same way, he had forced Mis to continue working and <b>find</b> <b>what</b> the Mule was looking for. Bayta had killed Mis {{to prevent him from}} revealing the Second Foundation's whereabouts to the Mule.|$|E

25|$|Windsor {{has often}} been the place where many metro Detroiters <b>find</b> <b>what</b> is {{forbidden}} in the United States. With a minimum legal drinking age of 21 in Michigan and 19 in Ontario, a number of 19 and 20-year-old Americans frequent Windsor's bars. The city also became a gambling attraction with Caesars Windsor's opening in 1994, five years before casinos opened in Detroit. One can also purchase Cuban cigars, Cuban rum, less-costly prescription drugs, absinthe, certain imported foods, and other items not available in the United States. In addition, some same-sex couples from the United States chose to marry in Windsor prior to 2015, when same-sex marriage was legalized in all 50 U.S. states.|$|E
25|$|It is {{revealed}} that Blair and Chuck {{made a pact}} to stay apart {{from each other in}} order to allow them to accomplish things in their careers before getting back together for good.

Meanwhile, Mallory goes into the sinkhole to investigate, but finds herself unable to breathe and surrounded by the small snake-like dragons. They manage {{to get her out}} and put three of the creatures in a jar. They figure that the creatures produce methane, which makes the air around them unbreathable, and realize that these were the creatures that the giants ate in order to breathe fire (which they originally believed to be salamanders).|$|E

25|$|He {{began his}} career as a bone surgeon at New York Cancer Hospital (which later became part of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center); however, he became more {{interested}} in cancer treatment when one of his early patients, Elizabeth Dashiell, died from bone cancer. While going through hospital records, Coley found a sarcoma case study of one patient named Fred Stein, whose tumor disappeared following a high fever from erysipelas infection, now known as Streptococcus pyogenes. This sparked Coley's interest and drove him to <b>find</b> <b>what</b> few examples of similar cancer treatment had been previously recorded. He discovered that other medical pioneers including Robert Koch, Louis Pasteur, and Emil von Behring, had recorded observations of erysipelas infection coinciding with cancer regression.|$|E
25|$|The Frenchman {{returned}} to his companions and related his interview. A party of five, consisting of four gentlemen and a captain, was next sent over to <b>find</b> <b>what</b> terms they could get from Menéndez, who received them as before, with his soldiers still in ambush, and himself attended by only ten persons. After he had convinced them of the capture of Fort Caroline by showing them some of the spoil he had taken, and some prisoners he had spared, the spokesman of the company asked for a ship and sailors with which to return to France. Menéndez replied that he would willingly have given them one had they been Catholics, and had he any vessels left; but that his own ships had sailed with artillery for Fort San Mateo and with the captured women and children for Santo Domingo, and a third was retained to carry dispatches to Spain.|$|E

25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and <b>find</b> <b>what</b> lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

We all {{want to be in the}} right and never in the wrong. Once we <b>find</b> <b>what</b> we desire we find that it wasn't what we imagined it to be. So Kierkegaard says to leave it all to God.|$|E
