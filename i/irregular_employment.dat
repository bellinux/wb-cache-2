40|$|The growing {{importance}} of cyberspace to modern society, and its increasing {{use as an}} arena for dispute, is becoming a national security concern for governments and armed forces globally. The special characteristics of cyberspace, such as its asymmetric nature, the lack of attribution, the low cost of entry, the legal ambiguity, and its role as an efficient medium for protest, crime, espionage and military aggression, makes it an attractive domain for nation-states as well as nonstate actors in cyber conflict. This paper studies the various non-state actors who coexist in cyberspace, examines their motives and incitements, and analyzes how and when their objectives coincide with those of nation-states.

40|$|Includes bibliographyNational {{levels of}} {{unemployment}} in Trinidad and Tobago have remained consistently high since the 1980 s, {{because of the}} economic recession, subsequent structural adjustment arrangements and the diminution of traditional labour-intensive activities such as estate agriculture. Groups which had been dependent upon casual employment that was available in pre-recession times have been experiencing chronic unemployment. Combining extremely <b>irregular</b> casual <b>employment</b> with activity in the informal sector, they occupy a marginal and precarious position in the labour market. This study examines {{the way in which the}} characteristics and strategies of job-seekers differ in mainstream and in peripheral areas of the labour market. In analysis of the qualitative data, based on 45 in-depth interviews, Ragin's qualitative comparative procedures were used. This method of analysing qualitative data permitted scrutiny of different individuals' combinations of characteristics, and identification of those job search strategy components that led either to finding employment or to suffering long-term unemployment. The chronically unemployed showed a consistent lack of up-to-date knowledge of the labour market, whereas those who were successful in finding employment did have this type of information, through 'weak ties' based on family and previously established labour market links. The success in finding employment by individuals who lacked advanced secondary schooling and vocational training could be associated with their 'ties of merit' acquired from employment experience and a work record in the formal sector. The data suggest that while affiliation with the formal economy could strengthen an individual's position in the labour market, association with the informal sector did not seem to give any later advantages in finding employment...|$|R

40|$|The {{undeclared}} work {{is an ancient}} and complex phenomenon, that is widespread throughout all over the Country and in every product sector. It {{is one of the}} most challenging issues that Italy is facing in recent years, because it has a significant impact on the labour market and the welfare system. This essay aims to analyze the {{undeclared work}} starting from the difficulties of identifying and clearly defining the phenomenon: there are a lot of shades of <b>irregular</b> <b>employment</b> and this is even more evident in a comparative perspective between the various member States of the European Union. Furthermore, it is useful to look at the causes and the consequences through an overview of the empirical data. The second part of this article focuses on the essential activity of the National Labour Inspectorate in the light of its centenary history and the recent changes introduced by the Legislative Decree no. 149 / 2015, implementing the so-called Jobs Act. In particular, some considerations are devoted to the main tools to fight the undeclared work: the maxi sanction for “black work” and the suspension of the business activity. Is the Italian sanctioning system enough to counter this dangerous phenomenon? In order to achieve tangible results, the harmonization between direct and indirect measures could have an important impact, because it is necessary not only to fight against the <b>irregular</b> <b>employment,</b> but to ensure the right to work regularly.

30|$|As we have {{established}} from the descriptive analysis, different labor market statuses {{in the base}} year have very different probabilities of alignment. The worst alignment is {{for those who were}} unemployed in the base year, most of whom did not report that they were unemployed at that time in the retrospective data. The next worst alignment is for all the non-wage statuses (employer, self-employed, and unpaid family worker). The probability of misalignment is even higher for women in these categories than for men. This result is due to the difficulty in measuring these employment states for women, since they generally do not consider such work to be <b>employment.</b> <b>Irregular</b> wage work, as discussed above, also has poor alignment, because of the shifting nature of such a status and the difficulty in detecting when such shifts occur. Formal and informal private wage work also have a higher probability of misalignment relative to public sector work, again, more so for women than for men. Being out of the labor force is a base state that results in more misalignment for men and no misalignment for women. This difference is because it is a rare state for adult males and the most predominant state for women.|$|R
40|$|Ireland’s rapid {{economic}} growth from the mid- 1990 ’s combined with the opening up of the Eastern European labour market, led to Ireland moving from being a country of net outward migration to becoming one of net inward migration at a speed that was unprecedented. This created a major challenge to the Irish trade union movement which was already operating {{in a context of}} the erosion of traditional forms of employment and employment relations and a declining membership. This thesis will explain the impact of migration to Ireland on trade union policies, rhetoric, attitudes and organisational approaches. It foregrounds the influence of the trade union movement on the migration policy environment and investigates the trade union response to labour migration in terms of changing forms of employment relations as a result of outsourcing, the increasing presence of labour market intermediaries and the growth of the informal sector and <b>irregular</b> forms of <b>employment.</b> The thesis is situated {{in the context of the}} international debates around the economic, political and social modalities of trade union action. The Irish case will, in its turn, illuminate those debates and posit a new and emerging model of unionism based on a particular combination of modalities. The primary contribution of this thesis is to the trade union revitalisation debate. A comparative diachronic methodology illuminates the role that the key tipping points of the two major industrial disputes at Gama and Irish Ferries played in that debate and in the subsequent reconfiguring of capital, labour and state relations. I posit, in conclusion, that the emerging Irish model of union organising is a distinct variant on the international organising model, based primarily on the organisation of migrant labour and internal union dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the underground economy and financial deepening. Entrepreneurs can only access external finance by disclosing credible information in formal documentation. This may be impossible for many informal producers, who lack proper accounting records. Similarly, irregular workers may have difficulty borrowing to finance consumption and house purchases. Using panel data on local credit markets in Italy, we find that the share of <b>irregular</b> <b>employment</b> has a strong negative impact on outstanding credit to the private sector. According to our estimates, a shift of 1 per cent of employees from regular to irregular work corresponds to a decline of 1 - 2 percentage points of GDP in the volume of business lending and of 0. 3 percentage points in outstanding credit to households. By contrast, the feedback effects of financial deepening {{on the size of the}} informal sector are weak and statistically not significant. Applying a difference-in-difference approach that exploits the exogenous variation induced by the regularization programme for immigrant workers launched in 2002, we also find that irregular labour has a negative effect on banksÂ’ decisions to enter local credit markets. <b>irregular</b> <b>employment,</b> bank lending, school drop-out, entry, branching, regularisation program...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the {{discrimination}} of migrant workers based on gender as they emerge in the complex reality of the Italian regional labour markets. Recent studies show that while in the Northern regions migrants are concentrated in the industry and services sector (classic ‘Continental model’), in the Southern regions they work mainly in the agricultural sector or provide domestic work and family care services with less stable and thus more <b>irregular</b> forms of <b>employment</b> (‘Mediterranean model’). The micro data used has been taken from two separate sample surveys that have been analysed using specific statistical techniques. On {{the basis of the}} Labour Force Survey of 2006, we examine the labour market performance of resident migrants in comparison with that of the Italian population. In particular, we consider differences in labour market access, activity rates, employment and unemployment rates, employment status and sectors of the economy in the four Italian macro-regions (North-West, North-East, Centre and South). As will be shown, gender {{plays an important role in}} distinguishing the labour market behaviour of migrants in comparison with that of the Italian population. In the second part of the chapter, we examine the employment status of migrants coming from LDCs and CE countries distinguishing between regular and irregular migrants. In this context, we rely on the use of per capita data of the survey ‘SUD’ 2005, funded by Ministry of Labour and Social Policies and conducted by the ISMU Foundation. This survey includes information on migrants living and working in Italy without taking into account the legal status of migrants, that is whether they are regular or irregular migrants. We analyse the determining factors of migrants’ employment to show how gender and the peculiar characteristics of the region of residence strongly impact upon the possibility of becoming employed and the nature of employment, as well as other socio-demographic factors such as age, education, country of origin and duration of stay in Italy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explains}} {{the structure of}} the temporary or <b>irregular</b> form of <b>employment</b> in South Korea. In Korea, the size of the irregular workers as a percentage of labor force increased from 43. 4 % to 52. 7 % from 1996 to 2005. Both the sheer absolute size and the rapid rate of growth are evidence for the dominance of this form of employment in Korea. However, irregular workers are generally kept deprived of health insurance, unemployment insurance, overtime payments, retirement allowances, and any kind of bonuses. Largely, irregular Korean workers are subject to job insecurity and meager pay rates. While there is the institution of a social security system in place for the irregular workers in Korea, due to the lenient law enforcement of social security obligations, firms find it cost effective to evade giving these benefits and hence employ more and more from the irregular segment of the labor force. Almost 70 % of all irregular workers are females who are employed as part-timers, on-call workers, and day laborers, through temporary agencies, subcontracting companies, and independent contractors. Over time, the powerful dominant enterprises have successfully managed to maintain low wage payments to irregular female workers relative to male workers. Persistence of the wage differentials between male and female irregular workers highlights the cost advantage of hiring female workers and the temporal exit of more male workers from the irregular labor force. There are institutions of labor unions for workers in Korea which are significantly represented by the male workers. The female union membership went down from 36. 7 % in 1980 to 21. 1 % in 2003 whereas that of the male union members increased from 63. 3 % to 78. 9 % in the same period. The lenient laws and cursory light enforcement of regulations by the government and gender discrimination in the trade unions have {{led to the development of}} non-governmental organizations (NGOs) of women worker activists undertaking the lead role in support of irregular worker movements such as the Korean Women Workers’ Association United (KWWAU).

The chaebol have an important role in controlling the irregular labor force. The supportive policies regarding the <b>employment</b> of the <b>irregular</b> workers are for the most parts weaved around the interests and benefits of the chaebols. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} socio-demographic {{characteristics}} {{and the labor}} market history of casual workers that have been temporarily employed for some time using a temporary work booklet (ensuring favorable tax treatment for casual workers and their employers). By investigating that, {{as well as the}} involvement of these casual workers in the hidden economy, the authors try to explore the contradictory impacts of this special tax treatment of temporary employment. After explaining the sampling method and depicting some main characteristics of the sample, the paper describes the links between labor market vulnerability, temporary employment and hiding or underreporting of labor income. For those employed with the temporary work booklet black or grey employment is an ordinary phenomenon, visibly present in everyday life. As the actual administrative rules concerning the use of the booklet in case of temporary employment provide ample opportunities for unreporting or underreporting of employment periods and income at a relatively low risk of detection and punishment, in some cases employers try to convert normal employment status into temporary employment thus taking advantage of the booklet in order to reduce their tax payments. Thus paradoxically the booklet, conceived as a policy tool for reducing hidden employment may even foster the underreporting of income. However, although abusing the booklet is not rare, our results (though not convincing enough statistically) may indicate that using the booklet to at least partially regularize former hidden employment is more widespread. In some cases where the booklet is abused during a probation period, employment may also be regularized later. Our results indicate that the relationship between educational attainment or income and involvement in unreported work and/or underreporting of income is ambiguous and non-linear in this 6 segment of the labor market. Masking labor income as entrepreneurial income from subcontracting can be mostly found amongst workers above a certain level of educational attainment; it is also more common amongst middle income employees, while it is atypical for low and high earners. On the other hand, unreported direct cash payments to employees are more frequent amongst low and high earners, while occur relatively rarely in the middle income range. Our results suggest that experiencing unemployment spells directly (by the employee) or indirectly (by family members) promote the acceptance of <b>irregular</b> forms of <b>employment</b> entailing some form of tax evasion, and may lead to more frequent involvement in such forms of employment...|$|R
