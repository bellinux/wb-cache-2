The cast iron railings with their plant motifs and iron palm leaves that form the gates to the house are other ways that Gaudí incorporated nature into his work. Plants that had to be destroyed for the construction of the building, such as the marigolds or the palm trees, were incorporated into the details of the building. Casa Milá, popularly known as La Pedrera, is another example of Gaudí modern architecture whose design based on the ocean with its curved edges and seaweed motifs is another example of nature serving as his inspiration.|$|R

The north-eastern entrance consists of a pair of imposing gateposts and the view from this access point sweeps across the entire northern {{section of the}} park. The eastern perimeter of this section is a terraced walkway known as the Broadwalk with adjacent, banked bedded planting. A central path from the Broadwalk splits a large grassed area almost neatly in half and leads to a lake and two child's play areas. A path circles the perimeter of the lake and seating is placed at the fringe of the lake at various points. To the south of the lake are three bowling greens and to the north are tennis courts.

40|$|Intercropping of {{companion}} plants (CPs) that release distinct volatile compounds with horticultural crops {{has been}} proposed to improve pest management. Although CP extracts or essential oils {{have been reported to}} be efficient in disturbing the settling of insects such as aphids, the effect of using actual CPs remains relatively unknown. Our aim was to screen odorous CP species for their effect on the performance of green peach aphid,Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae), when released on adjacent pepper plants. Intercropping was tested in growth chambers using potted plants to avoid root interactions and homogenise the abiotic environment of CPs. Our results indicated that eight CP species—rosemary, African marigold, <b>French</b> <b>marigold,</b> geranium, lavender, basil, chives, and pot marigold—affected aphid performance by reducing the reproductive performance and/or settlement of females. Rosemary followed by African and <b>French</b> <b>marigold</b> was associated with the largest reduction in adult female and nymph number. Chemical analyses indicated that rosemary and <b>French</b> <b>marigold</b> emit specific volatiles. In contrast, four CP species (false yellowhead, thyme, savoury, and peppermint) were not associated with a significant change in aphid performance and emitted a lower diversity of volatiles. This screening of CPs under controlled conditions may be considered as a first step towards the identification of volatiles emitted by actual plants that can affect aphid performance and help the choice of CPs to optimise intercropping strategies...|$|E

40|$|The {{flowers of}} <b>French</b> <b>marigold</b> (Tagetes patula L.) {{are widely used}} in folk medicine, in {{particular}} for treating inflammation-related disorders. However, cellular mechanisms of this activity demand further investigation. In the present work, we studied the potential of T. patula compounds to alleviate the oxidative stress in hydrogen peroxide-challenged human lymphoblastoid Jurkat T-cells. Crude extracts of marigold flowers and purified fractions containing flavonoids patuletin, quercetagetin, and quercetin and their derivatives, {{as well as the}} carotenoid lutein, were brought in contact with Jurkat cells challenged with 25 or 50 [*]μM H 2 O 2. Hydrogen peroxide caused oxidative stress in the cells, manifested as generation of superoxide and peroxyl radicals, reduced viability, arrested cell cycle, and enhanced apoptosis. The stress was alleviated by marigold ingredients that demonstrated high radical-scavenging capacity and enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes involved in neutralization of reactive oxygen species. Flavonoid fraction rich in quercetin and quercetagetin showed the highest cytoprotective activity, while patuletin in high dose exerted a cytotoxic effect associated with its anticancer potential. T. patula compounds enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) in Jurkat cells. Both direct radical-scavenging capacity and stimulation of protective cellular mechanisms can underlay the anti-inflammatory properties of marigold flowers...|$|E

This {{study was conducted to}} optimize the extraction process through the biomonitoring of flavonoids, using a statistical mixture simplex-centroid design, to evaluate the effect of the solvents water, ethanol and acetone, as well as mixtures of these solvents, assessed by the total flavonoid content. The extracts were tested for dry residue, radical scavenging activity, chromatographic profile, and larvicidal activity. The acetone extract had the highest total flavonoid content, 25. 13 ± 1. 02 % (4. 07 %); and the best radical scavenging activity, with IC 50 of 15. 74 &# 956;g/ml ± 1. 09 (6. 92 %), but with lower dry residue, 6. 62 ± 1. 33 % (20. 10 %). The water extracts showed higher levels of dry residue, but lower total flavonoid content and radical scavenging activity than the acetone extract. The positive correlation between the total flavonoid content and radical scavenging activity of the extracts showed that flavonoids contribute significantly to the antioxidant capacity.

The material used in the study was peat substrate of 5. 5 – 6. 0 pH into which plants were planted and then inoculated with different doses of the EM biofertilizer (1 : 10, 1 : 50, 1 : 100). Samples of the substrate on which experimental plants were cultivated were collected during the following three phases: the phase of seedling planting, the phase of vegetative growth and the phase of flowering. The scope of investigations comprised determination of the activity of dehydrogenases, urease and acid phosphatase activity by the spectrophotometric method. In addition, the following plant morphological analyses were performed: plant height, shoot number and length, number of buds and inflorescences, and leaf greenness index (SPAD). It was found that the phase of plant development was proved to be the main determinant of the activity of the enzymes under study. The EM biofertilizer had positive effect on the acid phosphatase activity. However, the preparation did not have stimulating effect on the activity of urease or dehydrogenases.

40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} to examine whether strip-tilled cover cropping followed by living mulch practice could suppress root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) and enhance beneficial nematodes and other soil mesofauna, while suppressing weeds throughout two vegetable cropping seasons. Sunn hemp (SH), Crotalaria juncea, and <b>French</b> <b>marigold</b> (MG), Tagetes patula, were grown for three months, strip-tilled, and bitter melon (Momordica charantia) seedlings were transplanted into the tilled strips; the experiment was conducted twice (Season I and II). Strip-tilled cover cropping with SH prolonged M. incognita suppression in Season I but not in Season II where suppression was counteracted with enhanced crop growth. Sunn hemp also consistently enhanced bacterivorous and fungivorous nematode population densities prior to cash crop planting, prolonged enhancement of the Enrichment Index {{towards the end of}} both cash crop cycles, and increased numbers of soil mesoarthropods. Strip-tilled cover cropping of SH followed by clipping of the living mulch as surface mulch also reduced broadleaf weed populations up to 3 to 4 weeks after cash crop planting. However, SH failed to reduce soil disturbance as indicated by the Structure Index. Marigold suppressed M. incognita efficiently when planted immediately following a M. incognita-susceptible crop, but did not enhance beneficial soil mesofauna including free-living nematodes and soil mesoarthropods.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of accompanying plants as well as bark mulching, common for green areas, on the growth, flowering and decorative values of scarlet sage Salvia splendens Sellow ex Roem. et Schult. The field experiment included two cultivars of sage: ‘Red Torreador’ and ‘Luna’; two species of accompanying plants: <b>French</b> <b>marigold</b> – Tagetes patula nana L. ‘Petit Gold’ and flossflower – Ageratum houstonianum Mill.; as well as pine bark mulching. The control group was a monoculture of scarlet sage, without mulching. Pine bark mulching had a beneficial influence on almost all growth and flowering characteristics of scarlet sage. The plants growing on mulched soil were higher, had more leaves and branches as well as their inflorescences were longer and had more whorls than the plants growing without mulching. S. splendens growing with other species had fewer leaves and fewer branches. Its side stems and lateral inflorescences were shorter. The accompanying species also limited the mass of scarlet sage. The vicinity of marigold and flossflower had no influence on the height of S. splendens plants, the number of whorls and flowers within inflorescences. The growth of scarlet sage was largely modified by weather conditions; the plants grew best between June 20 th and July 18 th, with the best decorative effect achieved in July.

It also allows high yield, good quality, and economic productivity to be achieved. The aim of the present study, conducted in the years 2003 – 2004 in Mydlniki near Kraków, was to determine the effect of intercropping carrot Nardin F 1 with <b>French</b> <b>marigold</b> (Tagetes patula nana L.) 'Kolombina' and pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) 'Promyk' on carrot yield, its quality, and the occurrence of pests. On average in both years of the study, intercropping did not reduce total or marketable carrot yield. In 2003 intercropping contributed to a significant increase in marketable yield compared with yield from sole cropping. In 2004 the dry matter content was higher in the roots of carrots grown with pot marigold. The treatments intercropped with both French and pot marigold were characterized by an increased content of sugars in carrot roots and in 2004 year – of carotenoids. Intercropping had a significant effect on the number of roots damaged by the carrot rust fly, Psila rosae, (the best in this respect was the combination with Tagetes) and by nematodes (the best in this respect was the combination with Calendula).

However, in olfactometer experiments where T. basalis was allowed to choose between flowering and non-flowering plants, only buckwheat floral scent was attractive. Headspace analyses of the odour emitted by the four plant species revealed very distinct profiles with little overlap in compounds. Buckwheat floral scent was characterized by an unpleasant smell for the human nose due to the presence of short-chain carboxylic acids. Headspace extracts of buckwheat flowers and a blend of six buckwheat plant volatiles consisting of butanoic, 2 -methylbutanoic, 3 -methylbutanoic and pentanoic acids, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate and α-farnesene were significantly attractive in olfactometer bioassays.

This has an impact on organic tomatoes, which are mainly grown in soil. ‘Rutgers’ tomato plants grown in commercial potting substrate amended with VC improved shoot DW, root DW, leaf area, and the shoot:root ratio (Bachman and Metzger 2008). In that study, similar positive effects were also observed for ‘Queen Sophia’ <b>French</b> <b>marigold</b> (Tagetes patula L.), ‘California Wonder’ bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), and ‘Imperial’ cornflower (Centaurea cyanus L.). Commercially produced VCs made from the action of Eisenia fetida on cattle manure, food wastes and paper wastes improved the germination of petunia (Petunia sp. var. Dreams Neon Rose F 1) seed (Arancon et al. 2008). Composted spent mushroom substrate, when added to peat in a 3 : 1 ratio, improved ‘Muchamiel’ tomato, pepper and courgette (Cucurbita pepo L.) seed germination (Medina et al. 2009). Secondary metabolites (tannin and iridoids) of three bulbous ornamental plants (Eucomis autumnalis, Tulbaghia ludwigiana and Tulbaghia violacea) were enhanced when VC leachate was added to the stressed plants (Aremu et al. 2014). The use of vermicasts decreased the amount of potentially toxic heavy metals (Cr, Zn, Ni) in lettuce but did not affect chl content when mixed in a 2 : 8 ratio with green waste feedstock (Ali et al. 2007). In this study, the effect of choice of substrate on changes in seed germination, secondary metabolite production and the levels of heavy metals in the hydroponic medium or in plant tissues were not assessed.|$|E

Understanding these interactions is critically important in Habitat Management and in a broader view in Conservation Biological Control. Suitable flower species must enhance the survival and fecundity of natural enemies but in addition {{they also need to}} be highly attractive and thus frequently visited. To date few examples exist that have considered both criteria. In this study we tested the effects of the flowering plants alyssum (Lobularia maritima), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), <b>French</b> <b>marigold</b> (Tagetes patula) and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) on the fecundity and olfactory attractiveness of the egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis, which is an important biological control agent of the stink bug Nezara viridula. Our results showed that access to buckwheat and basil flowers increased the number of parasitoid offspring. However, in olfactometer experiments where T. basalis was allowed to choose between flowering and non-flowering plants, only buckwheat floral scent was attractive. Headspace analyses of the odour emitted by the four plant species revealed very distinct VOC profiles with little overlap in compounds. Buckwheat floral scent was characterised by the presence of short-chain carboxylic acids. Headspace extracts of buckwheat flowers and a reconstituted blend of their major components were significantly attractive when tested in the olfactometer. Furthermore, electrophysiological experiments showed that two main compounds, 3 -methylbutanoic acid and 2 -methylbutanoic acid, elicited consistent responses in the antennae of T. basalis. Integrating chemo-ecological methods into conservation biological control allowed us to identify a potential resource plant and attractive compounds for field studies...|$|E
