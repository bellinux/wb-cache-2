25|$|Coach Class: Coach Class is the {{standard}} class of service on all Amtrak trains except the Acela Express. Seats in coach recline and feature a fold-down tray table, <b>foot</b> <b>rest,</b> individual reading light, and power outlet. Coach cars on long-distance trains are configured with fewer seats per car so that passengers have additional legroom and seats are equipped with leg rests.|$|E
25|$|Business Class: Business Class seating {{is offered}} on the Acela Express, Northeast Regional, many short-haul {{corridor}} trains and some long-distance trains. Business Class {{is located in}} a dedicated car or section of the train. While the specific features vary by route, many include extra legroom and complimentary non-alcoholic drinks. Seats in business class recline, are typically appointed in leather and feature a fold-down tray table, <b>foot</b> <b>rest,</b> individual reading light, power outlet.

25|$|A {{kneeling}} chair adds {{an additional}} body part, the knees, {{to support the}} weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of {{the weight of the}} occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or <b>foot</b> <b>rest</b> the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body. A hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported {{in the back of the}} seat, padding there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding that is the same density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees.|$|E
25|$|Premium Economy, is Air France's premium economy {{product for}} long haul flights, which became {{available}} on the Boeing 777-200ER, 777-300ER, Airbus A340-300 and Airbus A330-200 in late 2009 and early 2010, and on the A380-800 in late 2010 and early 2011. It is a dedicated cabin section with a 2-4-2 (2-3-2 on the long haul Airbus fleet and 3-3-3 for Alize on the 777-300 serving Indian Ocean and Caribbean routes) configuration with 38″ pitch (36″ for long haul Alize seats), 123° reclining fixed shell seats, including an adjustable headrest, a 10.4″ touchscreen, personal reading lamp, universal power ports, and an adjustable leg rest (40% more space, compared to Voyageur seats; the seats are 20% wider and offer 20% more legroom). There are 38 seats on the Airbus A380, 32 on the Boeing 777-300ER, 24 on the Boeing 777-200 and 21 on the Airbus A340-300 & A330-200 (between the Business and Economy cabin; behind Business on the A380 upper deck). Passengers receive double baggage allowance, priority airport services, lounge access, and extra frequent flier mileage. On board, business class amenities include Sennheiser noise-cancelling headphones, an amenity kit (featuring socks, eye mask, toothbrush & toothpaste, and earplugs), improved blankets, and an enhanced meal service with second hot meal, candies, and ice-cream all served with real glass and metal cutlery. A new improved Premium Economy seat using the same shell will be introduced from June 2014 on the Boeing 777 aircraft, featuring better cushioning and improved <b>foot</b> <b>rest,</b> adding comfort to the passenger.|$|E

40|$|Expansive {{soils are}} highly {{susceptible}} to volumetric changes leading to rapid {{loss in the}} bearing capacity of footings resting on them. Among several techniques available to treat expansive soils, lime or fly ash stabilization gained prominence {{during the past few}} decades due to its abundance and adaptability. Chemical stabilization is widely used to treat expansive soils as it develops base exchange and cementation processes between clay particles. When expansive soils are treated with chemicals, it is essential to obtain the load-settlement response of <b>footing</b> <b>resting</b> on stabilized ground. In this study, Finite Element Analysis is performed using the commercial software, PLAXIS 2 D, to obtain the load-settlement response of a strip <b>footing</b> <b>resting</b> on untreated and treated expansive soil.
