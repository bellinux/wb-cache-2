50|$|Adenosine {{diphosphate}} (ADP) is a platelet agonist. When it {{is added}} to saline-diluted whole blood in the test cuvette, it stimulates the ADP receptors on platelets, activating the platelets. The activation of the platelets leads to shape change and degranulation, and the released content of the granules further activates the platelets. Activation also induces a conformational change in the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) receptor, giving it high affinity for fibrinogen. Binding of fibrinogen to GPIIb/IIIa receptors leads to platelet-to-platelet bridges and results in platelet aggregation. Antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel and prasugrel irreversibly inhibit the ADP receptor P2Y12, leading to a decreased ADP-induced platelet aggregation.

Aims: This review assesses the evidence for therapeutic value of <b>eptifibatide</b> as a Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitor in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Evidence review: Several large, randomized controlled trials show that <b>eptifibatide</b> as adjunctive therapy to standard care in patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of death or myocardial infarction. Data are limited regarding the use of <b>eptifibatide</b> in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that <b>eptifibatide</b> is associated with a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio relative to standard care. According to US cost-effectiveness analysis about 70 % of the acquisition costs of <b>eptifibatide</b> are offset by the reduced medical resource consumption during the first year. <b>Eptifibatide</b> was well tolerated in most of the trials. Bleeding is the most commonly reported adverse event, with most major bleeding episodes occurring at the vascular access site.

Therefore, effective platelet inhibition is vital during and after percutaneous coronary intervention. <b>Eptifibatide</b> is an intravenous antiplatelet agent that blocks the final common pathway of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation by binding to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of platelets. In clinical studies, <b>eptifibatide</b> was associated with a significant reduction of mortality, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, recent trials conducted in the era of dual antiplatelet therapy and newer anticoagulants failed to demonstrate similar results. The previously seen favorable benefit of <b>eptifibatide</b> was mainly offset by the increased risk of bleeding. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend its use as an adjunct in high-risk patients who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with traditional anticoagulants (heparin or enoxaparin), who are not otherwise at high risk of bleeding. In patients receiving bivalirudin (a newer safer anticoagulant), routine use of <b>eptifibatide</b> is discouraged except in select situations (eg, angiographic complications). Although older pharmacoeconomic studies favor <b>eptifibatide,</b> in the current era of P 2 Y 12 inhibitors and newer safer anticoagulants, the increased costs associated with bleeding make the routine use of <b>eptifibatide</b> an economically nonviable option. The cost-effectiveness of <b>eptifibatide</b> with the use of strategies that decrease the bleeding risk (eg, transradial access) is unknown.

GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibition during coronary interventions has been associated with excess VAS complications. If other predictors of VAS complications could be identified, they might be manipulated to reduce complications. Methods. A total of 4, 010 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary revascularization (PTCR) were randomized into one of three bolus/ 20 - to 24 -h infusion arms: placebo bolus/placebo infusion; 135 -μg/kg body weight <b>eptifibatide</b> bolus/ 0. 5 -μg/kg per min <b>eptifibatide</b> infusion; or 135 -μg/kg <b>eptifibatide</b> bolus/ 0. 75 -μg/kg per min <b>eptifibatide</b> infusion. Heparin during the procedure was weight adjusted and stopped 4 h before sheaths were removed. Logistic regression modeling was used to identify independent predictors of VAS complications. Results. VAS complications were more common in patients treated with <b>eptifibatide</b> (9. 9 % vs. 5. 9 % placebo-treated patients, p < 0. 001). Multivariate analysis identified <b>eptifibatide</b> therapy (p < 0. 0001), advanced age (p = 0. 0001), longer time to sheath removal (p = 0. 0002), stent placement (with intense post-stent anticoagulation) (p = 0. 0004), female gender (p = 0. 0006), PTCR within 24 h of thrombolytic therapy (p = 0. 002), larger heparin doses during PTCR (p = 0. 009), major coronary dissection (p = 0. 03) and placement of a venous sheath (p = 0. 04) as independent predictors of VAS complications.

BACKGROUNDThe glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonists abciximab, tirofiban and <b>eptifibatide</b> differ in chemical structure, binding site and pharmacokinetics. METHODSSixty patients undergoing coronary stenting {{were randomly assigned to}} abciximab (bolus 0. 25 mg/kg body weight, infusion 10 μg per min for 12 h), tirofiban (bolus 10 μg/kg, infusion 0. 15 μg/kg per min for 72 h) or <b>eptifibatide</b> (bolus 180 μg/kg, infusion 2 μg/kg per min for 72 h). We took serial blood samples to analyze platelet function by using flow cytometry, turbidimetric aggregometry and the rapid platelet-function assay (RPFA). RESULTSAs assessed by RPFA, platelet aggregation after 2 h of infusion was reduced to 5. 9 ± 7. 8 % (mean ± SD) of baseline by abciximab, to 5. 0 ± 5. 4 % by tirofiban and to 7. 8 ± 7. 1 % by <b>eptifibatide</b> (p = 0. 42). Turbidimetric aggregometry with adenosine diphosphate stimulation yielded similar results, whereas percent inhibition of platelet aggregation after thrombin receptor stimulation was 45. 8 ± 16. 8 % with abciximab, 51. 3 ± 17. 6 % with tirofiban and 52. 9 ± 14. 8 % with <b>eptifibatide</b> (p = 0. 37).

Abciximab binds aIIbb 3 on platelets and avb 3 on HUVECs with similar affinity, whereas <b>eptifibatide</b> and tirofiban are thought to be highly specific for aIIbb 3. The conclusion that <b>eptifibatide</b> does not bind vascular avb 3 integrins may be premature, however, because recent studies have demonstrated that the affinity of avb 3 for various ligands, including antagonists, is subject to modulation. Methods and Results—Abciximab and 7 E 3, the anti–b 3 integrin monoclonal antibody from which abciximab was derived, bound avb 3 on HASMCs in a specific and saturable manner and with an affinity similar to binding to aIIbb 3 on platelets. 7 E 3 and <b>eptifibatide</b> inhibited avb 3 -mediated attachment of HASMCs to thrombospondin (TSP) and prothrombin but had no effect on avb 5 - or b 1 -mediated HASMC attachment to vitronectin-, collagen-, or fibronectin-coated or noncoated tissue culture plates. The inhibitory effect of <b>eptifibatide</b> was similar in magnitude and not additive to that of 7 E 3. <b>Eptifibatide</b> and 7 E 3 inhibited avb 3 -mediated attachment of HUVECs. Tirofiban had only nonspecific effects on HASMC attachment to extracellular matrix proteins. In cell proliferation assays, <b>eptifibatide</b> inhibited avb 3 -mediated responses to soluble TSP by HASMCs and b 3 integrin–expressing HEK cells. Conclusions—Eptifibatide and 7 E 3, but not tirofiban, specifically inhibit avb 3 -mediated binding of human smooth muscl...|$|E
