40|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>deep-sea</b> hydrothermal vent <b>fauna,</b> kilometers {{deep in the}} oceans, is a great achievement of 20 th-century marine biology. The deep-sea hydrothermal food web does not directly depend on the sun energy. Vent communities rely primarily on trophic associations between chemoautotrophic bacteria and consumers. A small number of endemic taxa are adapted to this highly toxic environment distributed along ridge crests. Where they appeared and how they dispersed is among the important questions ecologists must answer. Here, by statistical analysis of the most comprehensive data base ever assembled about <b>deep-sea</b> hydrothermal <b>fauna,</b> we delineate six major hydrothermal provinces in the World Ocean, then we identify five significant dispersal flows between adjacent provinces and derive a hypothesis about the center from which that fauna has dispersed to the oceanic ridges of the world.

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{possible}} antiquity of the spectacularly diverse modern <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fauna</b> has been debated {{since the beginning}} of deep-sea research in the mid-nineteenth century. Recent hypotheses, based on biogeographic patterns and molecular clock estimates, support a latest Mesozoic or early Cenozoic date for the origin of key groups of the present <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fauna</b> (echinoids, octopods). This relatively young age is consistent with hypotheses that argue for extensive extinction during Jurassic and Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs) and the mid-Cenozoic cooling of deep-water masses, implying repeated re-colonization by immigration of taxa from shallow-water habitats. Here we report on a well-preserved echinoderm assemblage from deep-sea (1000 – 1500 m paleodepth) sediments of the NE-Atlantic of Early Cretaceous age (114 Ma). The assemblage is strikingly similar to that of extant bathyal echinoderm communities in composition, including families and genera found exclusively in modern deep-sea habitats. A number of taxa found in the assemblage have no fossil record at shelf depths postdating the assemblage, which precludes the possibility of deep-sea recolonization from shallow habitats following episodic extinction at least for those groups. Our discovery provides the first key fossil evidence that {{a significant part of the}} modern <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fauna</b> is considerably older than previously assumed.

40|$|Understanding how {{environmental}} forcing {{has generated}} and maintained large-scale patterns of biodiversity {{is a key}} goal of evolutionary research and critical to predicting the impacts of global climate change. We suggest that the initiation of the global thermohaline circulation provided a mechanism for the radiation of Southern Ocean fauna into the deep sea. We test this hypothesis using a relaxed phylogenetic approach to coestimate phylogeny and divergence times for a lineage of octopuses with Antarctic and deep-sea representatives. We show that the deep-sea lineage had their evolutionary origins in Antarctica, and estimate that this lineage diverged around 33 million years ago (Ma) and subsequently radiated at 15 Ma.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years a {{striking}} pattern of diversification {{has been documented}} in the fossil record of benthic marine invertebrates. Higher taxa (orders) tend to originate onshore, diversify offshore, and retreat into deep-water environments. Previous studies attribute this macroevolutionary pattern {{to a variety of}} causes, foremost among them the role of nearshore disturbance in providing opportunities for the evolution of novel forms accorded ordinal rank. Our analysis of the post-Paleozoic record of ordinal first appearances indicates that the onshore preference of ordinal origination occurred only in the Mesozoic prior to the Turonian stage of the Cretaceous, a period characterized by relatively frequent anoxic/dysoxic bottom conditions in deeper marine environments. Later, in the Cretaceous and Cenozoic, ordinal origination of benthic organisms did not occur exclusively, or even preferentially, in onshore environments. This change in environmental pattern of ordinal origination roughly correlates with Late Cretaceous: (i) decline in anoxia/dysoxia in offshore benthic environments; (ii) extinction of faunas associated with dysoxic conditions; (iii) increase in bioturbation with the expansion of deep burrowing forms into offshore environments; and (iv) offshore expansion of bryozoan diversity. We also advance a separate argument that the Cenomanian/Turonian and latest Paleocene global events eliminated much of the deep-water benthos.

While some species of deep-sea fishes appear to be exclusively found in the GoM, {{a large portion of}} the <b>deep-sea</b> fish <b>fauna</b> is represented by species found in other basins. However, genetic methods have begun to unravel some of this traditional taxonomy, and have revealed unanticipated diversity and endemism in the deep-pelagic of the GoM. This is in the form of cryptic species, those that are closely related and morphologically similar to described taxa, but for which genetic data has identified as being novel lineages. One example is Chauliodus sloani or Sloane’s viperfish, a mesopelagic predatory fish found throughout the earth’s deep-pelagic waters. Our genetic surveys of viperfish samples using the mitochondrial barcoding gene COI has revealed two deeply divergent viperfish linages co-existing in the GoM, one apparently endemic to the GoM. These fishes live in sympatry, with no obvious ecological or morphological differences separating them. Nonetheless, there is over 11 % pairwise sequence divergence between the two lineages, and species delimitation methods have identified them as two independently evolving lineages. Looking towards the future, we plan to perform further morphological and genetic work to better tease apart the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the generation of this novel biodiversity and the maintenance of species boundaries in the deep-sea.

40|$|Shallow marine benthic {{communities}} around Antarctica show {{high levels of}} endemism, gigantism, slow growth, longevity and late maturity, as well as adaptive radiations that have generated considerable biodiversity in some taxa 1. The deeper parts of the Southern Ocean exhibit some unique environmental features, including a very deep continental shelf 2 and a weakly stratified water column, and are the source {{for much of the}} deep water in the world ocean. These features suggest that <b>deep-sea</b> <b>faunas</b> around the Antarctic may be related both to adjacent shelf communities and to those in other oceans. Unlike shallow-water Antarctic benthic communities, however, little is known about life in this vast deep-sea region 2, 3. Here, we report new data from recent sampling expeditions in the deep Weddell Sea and adjacent areas (748 – 6, 348 m water depth) that reveal high levels of new biodiversity; for example, 674 isopods species, of which 585 were new to science. Bathymetric and biogeographic trends varied between taxa. In groups such as the isopods and polychaetes, slope assemblages included species that have invaded from the shelf. In other taxa, the shelf and slope assemblages were more distinct. Abyssal faunas tended to have stronger links to other oceans, particularly the Atlantic, but mainly in taxa with good dispersal capabilities, such as the Foraminifera. The isopods, ostracods and nematodes, which are poor dispersers, include many species currently known only from the Southern Ocean. Our findings challenge suggestions that deep-sea diversity is depressed in the Southern Ocean and provide a basis for exploring the evolutionary significance of the varied biogeographic patterns observed in this remote environment. <br/...|$|R
40|$|During the Paleocene, the {{plankton}} community recovered its diversity after {{a severe}} diversity loss at the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary. In general, changes in Paleocene <b>deep-sea</b> ostracode <b>fauna</b> are poorly understood. It {{is still unclear}} how <b>deep-sea</b> ostracode <b>fauna</b> changed during compelling {{events such as the}} K/Pg boundary (66. 04 Ma) and the Latest Danian Event (LDE: ~ 62. 18 Ma), a transient Paleocene warming event. In this report, we describe a study on the latest Cretaceous-late Paleocene ostracodes from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U 1407, off Newfoundland, in the northwestern Atlantic. Thirty-four ostracode taxa were obtained from 202 discrete samples that were discretely collected from the interval between 66. 3 and 57. 3 Ma. Near the K/Pg boundary, 8 % (2 of 24) of the Maastrichtian taxa became extinct. The extinction rate is estimated to be at most 0. 12 E MSY- 1, which is in the same range as the background-level extinction rate. Comparing the extinction rates between different ocean basins, the ostracode extinction at the K/Pg boundary displays striking geographical heterogeneity. Between the Maastrichtian and Danian, the ostracode fauna change from a biofacies dominated by shallow bathyal taxa to one dominated by deep bathyal taxa. During the LDE, ostracode fauna display an increase in their benthic ostracode accumulation rates and taxonomic diversity as well as an increase in the relative abundance of Krithe crassicaudata simultaneously with a decline in carbonate content. A similar change is commonly documented in fauna from the northeastern Atlantic during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 56. 0 Ma).

40|$|Hypotheses {{on the age}} and {{possible}} antiquity of the modern <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fauna</b> put forward to date almost all agree {{on the assumption that}} the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fauna</b> is largely the result of colonisation from shallow-water environments. Here, the fossil record of the Ophiacanthidae, a modern deep-sea brittle star family with extensive fossil occurrences at shelf depths, is systematically traced against a calibrated phylogeny. Several lines of evidence suggest that the Ophiacanthidae originated and greatly diversified in the deep sea, with most extant clades having diverged by the end of the Triassic at the latest. During the Jurassic, the family temporarily invaded shelf environments, attaining relative abundances and diversities comparable to those found in coeval and modern deep-sea settings, and gradually declined in abundance subsequently, to become largely restricted to the deep-sea again. The pattern of temporary expansion to shelf environments suggested here underpins the potential of deep-sea environments to contribute significantly to shallow-water biodiversity; an aspect that has mostly been neglected so far. It is speculated that the large-scale ophiacanthid invasion of shelf environments around the Triassic- Jurassic boundary was initiated by a change from thermohaline to halothermal circulation, attenuating the thermal stratifi cation of the water column and thus providing opportunities for enhanced vertical migration of marine taxa...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} record of live (stained) deep-sea benthic foraminifera in the 850 m deep silled Hardangerfjord, the second deepest fjord in Western Norway. Estimates of organic carbon flux (not, vert, similar 2. 5 g Cm? 2 y? 1) show that the fjord-values are {{comparable}} to similar depths on the continental slope. Accordingly, although these first samples only provide relative abundance data, the low proportion of live to dead individuals in the top cm of the sediment suggests a low foraminifera biomass. Another similarity with the deep sea is that the abiotic environment of the deep basins is stable even though the deepest basins are isolated from the open deep sea by the continental shelf and sills in the outer parts of the fjord suggesting that the deep-sea species are introduced as propagules during deep-water renewals. There is evidence {{of an increase in}} dissolution of fragile calcareous tests (e. g., Nonionella iridea) especially in the innermost part of Hardangerfjord since the 1960 s and this has led to a relative increase in dead agglutinated assemblages. The presence of larger forms with tests > 1 mm provides substrata for the attachment of smaller forms and therefore an increase in species diversity. Indeed, the diversity is comparable both to that of the open deep sea and that of reported macrofauna from the same sites, reflecting similar ecological status. Holtedahl (1965) suggested that there may be some down-slope transport of sediment into the deep basins with the deposition of turbidites. Despite some evidence of transport, no major recent disturbance due to turbidite deposition seems to have occurred and hence Hardangerfjord presents a unique environment with elements of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>faunas</b> in a land-locked setting...|$|R

Hemolymph acid- base parameters were monitored over 24 h of exposure to seawater equilibrated with ~ 1 % CO 2 (seawater PCO 2 ~ 6 torr or 0. 8 kPa, pH 7. 1), and compared with those of the shallow-living Dungeness crab Cancer magister. Short-term hypercapnia-induced acidosis in the hemolymph of Chionoecetes tanneri was almost uncompensated, with a net 24 h pH reduction of 0. 32 units and a net bicarbonate accumulation of only 3 mM. Under simultaneous hypercapnia and hypoxia, short-term extracellular acidosis in Chionoecetes tanneri was completely uncompensated. In contrast, Cancer magister fully recovered its hemolymph pH over 24 h of hypercapnic exposure by net accumulation of 12 mM bicarbonate from the surrounding medium. The data support the hypothesis that deep-sea animals, which are adapted to a stable environment and exhibit reduced metabolic rates, lack the short-term acid-base regulatory capacity to cope with the acute hypercapnic stress that would accompany large-scale CO 2 sequestration.

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this work}} was to improve {{understanding}} about the mode, geography and tempo of diversification in deep-sea organisms, using a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of the heterobranch gastropod genus Scaphander. Location Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific (IWP) oceans. Methods Two mitochondrial gene markers (COI and 16 S) and one nuclear ribosomal gene (28 S) from six Atlantic species of Scaphander, and four IWP species were used to generate a multilocus phylogenetic hypothesis using uncorrelated relaxed-clock Bayesian methods implemented in beast and calibrated with the first occurrence of Scaphander in the fossil record (58. 7 – 55. 8 Ma). Results Two main clades were supported: clade A, with sister relationships between species and subclades from the Atlantic and IWP; and clade B, with two western Atlantic sister species. Our estimates indicate that the two earliest divergences in clade A occurred between the middle Eocene and late Miocene {{and the most recent}} speciation occurred within the middle Miocene to Pleistocene. The divergence between the two western Atlantic species in clade B was estimated at late Oligocene–Pliocene. Main conclusions The prevailing mode of speciation in Scaphander was allopatric, but one possible case of sympatric speciation was detected between two western Atlantic species. Sister relationships between IWP and Atlantic lineages suggest the occurrence both of vicariance events caused by the closure of the Tethyan Seaway and of dispersal between the two ocean basins, probably around South Africa during episodic disruptions of the deep-sea regional current system caused by glacial–interglacial cycles. Cladogenetic estimates do not support comparatively older diversification of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>faunas,</b> but corroborate the hypothesis of a pulse of diversification centred in the Oligocene and Miocene epochs. Amphi-Atlantic species were found to occur at deeper depths (bathyal–abyssal) and we hypothesize that trans-Atlantic connectivity is maintained by dispersal between neighbouring reproductive populations inhabiting the abyssal sea floor and by dispersal across the shelf and slope of Arctic and sub-Arctic regions...|$|R
