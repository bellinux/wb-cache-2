However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers also left post-9/11-related graffiti at the site, which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience.|$|E

40|$|In the {{theoretical}} {{part of my}} diploma, I present the topic of natural disasters and floods as well as describe an example of floods {{in the town of}} Železniki. Further on I tackle the theory of perceiving danger and give a special stress to the mechanisms that make people react in a certain way during and after a natural disaster. I also address the importance of psychosocial aid in times of catastrophes, the role of social aid networks, and the concept of empowerment or regaining strength. In the empirical part of the work, I conduct research on various experiences people have had in the times of floods in Železniki – what was their reaction to the natural disaster like and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> receiving help after such weather mayhem. Here I was interested in the viewpoint of an individual as well as into the reaction of the entire local community. The results have shown that the people who took part in research address more key aspects in a case of a flooding – perception of danger, retreat from it, lack of information about their close relatives' safety and fear for them. While describing how they experienced the catastrophe, people usually point out shock, anxiety, concern for their close relatives' safety, material and financial worries. When comparing elders' viewpoint on natural disasters to that of the younger population, the latter seem to characterize changes and adjustments less traumatic, ensuring them to move on more quickly. The people affected were very happy with the help they received, and there were also some of signs of solidarity and connectedness in the community. In the times of rebuilding, however, these qualities started to dissipate. ...|$|R

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{interest}} in meditation research has recently dramatically increased and theoretical papers {{about the need for}} new phenomenological approaches have been written, so far quantitative methodologies capturing the effects of meditation on brain, behavior and wellbeing have dominated. But <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> really <b>feel</b> to engage in different kinds of meditation practice? To explore this question we used Elicitation Interviews (EI) as qualitative method to compare the differential nature of different meditation techniques {{in the context of a}} multi-method longitudinal mental training study: The ReSource Project. More specifically, 20 subjects gave EI on the following three types of meditation: (1) attention to breath, (2) observation of thought, (3) loving kindness. Preliminary qualitative analysis of 24 of these 60 interviews indicates clear differences concerning different aspects of first-personal experiences: (1) activates bodily sensations around the respiratory system, (2) in/around the head, and (3) in the chest. In (1) and (2), the temperature sensations are described as neutral, while (3) is accompanied with the sensation of warmth. These qualitative analyses are supplemented by computer-based quantitative analyses of the transcripts using LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, Pennebaker et al., 2001), providing evidence for differential mechanisms underlying the meditation technique – e. g. participants spontaneously use more vocabulary coded as social, communicative and optimistic in their EI during (3). These rich first-person data will be further used to inform third-person data collected with an exhaustive battery of tasks in the ReSource study to move towards neurophenomenological accounts of meditation...|$|R
40|$|What is a {{law review}} article? <b>Does</b> America know? <b>How</b> might we help America in this regard? Here, we {{approach}} the first question on the bias: As we have found, {{a growing body of}} learning and empirical evidence shows that genres are not merely forms, but forms that anticipate their substance. In this Article, then, we try to capture this action by undertaking the first and only comprehensive “performative study” of the genre of the law review article. Drawing upon methodological advances and new learning far beyond anything thought previously possible, we investigate “the law review article” qua genre. What is <b>it?</b> What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>do?</b> What are its implications? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> make you <b>feel?</b> By teasing out the infrastructural determinations section by section, we demonstrate rigorously that there is both far more (and far less) going on than meets the eye. In what is the first instance {{in the history of the}} United States (and perhaps the world) we enact in each section of the law review article (e. g., Part I, Part II) whatever that section is ideally supposed to accomplish. This is what we mean by “performative study. ” Using this approach, the reader can experience first-hand what the law review article does to him or her IRL. In a more conventional vein, it is hoped that this Article will be useful to junior legal scholars, young scholars’ workshops, elite law school boot camps, faculty evaluation committees, associate deans for research, law review editors, and law school deans everywhere. The Article closes with a call for improvements to the law review genre, cooperative federalism, daylight savings time, and the nature of the universe generally. The Article is addressed not merely to the Court, but to the President, to Congress, and, of course, to “We the People. ” Perhaps more than anything, we call for further sustained study of “the law review effect. ” A sequel, entitled “Dissertation Disease,” is currently contemplated in order to undertake a similar study of the University Press Monograph...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The broad aim {{of the study was}} to define the constituents of quality of life in older age. The research questions were twofold: <b>how</b> <b>do</b> older people define and prioritise quality of life, and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> they <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> can be improved? While the aim of the exploratory part of the research presented here was to obtain people's values and perceptions of quality of life, it was also hypothesised that, while quality of life is recognised to be an individual, subjective concept, a common core of values could be elicited to enable suggestions to be made on how to improve it. Identification of these values would also enable the identification of pertinent domains for inclusion in measures of quality of life. This study represented a unique multidisciplinary collaboration between investigators with backgrounds in sociology, psychology, social gerontology, transport planning and clinical epidemiology, with collective pooling of expertise and research grant resources (with the consent of the funding bodies). This led to the development of a multidisciplinary quality of life questionnaire. Following the fielding of the questionnaire, 80 respondents were selected for an in-depth interview to probe factors further affecting quality of life. A year after the baseline survey, 38 interviewees had experienced changes, and were re-interviewed to see how these changes had affected their quality of life. This qualitative data collection includes the baseline and follow-up interviews described above, but not the initial quality of life questionnaire. Main Topics : Topics covered include life history, family and siblings, educational background, childhood, adolescence, wartime experiences (World War II), marriage, children and family life, grandchildren, happiness and life satisfaction, quality of life issues, retirement and associated issues, income, home, convenience of appliances and mobility, travel, local area and neighbourhood, social participation, friends, leisure time activities, hobbies, social support, health and well-being, control and coping, outlook, happiness, attitudes to old age...|$|R
