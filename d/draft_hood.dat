40|$|A common {{industrial}} ventilation and pollution problem results when a thermally buoyant polluted plume of air must be exhausted {{away from a}} work area to allow achievement of air pollution standards. Generally, a close fitting canopy hood {{is one of the}} most effective means of exhaust containment; however, physical restrictions or the operation itself often prevent such an arrangement, and a hood located to the side of the operation is required. This arrangement requires the exhaust to bend and contain the vertically rising plume with a horizontal sweep of exhaust air across the surface of the operation. A review of available literature revealed a lack of the necessary theory and data needed to design a side <b>draft</b> <b>hood</b> based on plume dynamics. The purpose of this study, then, is to develop the theory relating the side <b>draft</b> <b>hood</b> size and required exhaust volume to the hot source characteristics and to test the theory in the laboratory...|$|E

The task of the paper is to help with finding the new ways of collecting and disposing aerosol pollution and to reduce the quantity of equipment and service costs. The article also discusses pollution formation and sorts and performance of side <b>draft</b> and slot <b>hoods</b> for vapour capture.

40|$|The Hood River Production Program (HRPP) is a Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) funded program {{initiated}} as a {{mitigation measure}} for Columbia River hydrosystem effects on anadromous fish. The HRPP {{began in the}} early 1990 s with the release of spring Chinook and winter steelhead smolts into the basin. Prior to implementation, co-managers, including the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife <b>drafted</b> the <b>Hood</b> River Production Master Plan (O'Toole and ODFW 1991 a; O'Toole and ODFW 1991 b) and the Pelton Ladder Master Plan (Smith and CTWSR 1991). Both documents were completed in 1991 and subsequently approved by the Council in 1992 and authorized through a BPA-led Environmental Impact Statement in 1996. In 2003, a 10 -year programmatic review was conducted for BPA-funded programs in the Hood River (Underwood et al. 2003). The primary objective of the HRPP Review (Review) was to determine if program goals were being met, and if modifications to program activities would be necessary in order to meet or revise program goals. In 2003, an agreement was signed between PacifiCorp and resource managers to remove the Powerdale Dam (RM 10) and associated adult trapping facility by 2010. The HRPP program has been dependant on the adult trap to collect broodstock for the hatchery programs; therefore, upon the dam's removal, some sort of replacement for the trap would be needed to continue the HRPP. At the same time the Hood River Subbasin Plan (Coccoli 2004) was being written and prompted the co-managers to considered future direction of the program. This included revising the numerical adult fish objectives based on the assimilated data and output from several models run on the Hood River system. In response to the Review as well as the Subbasin Plan, and intensive monitoring and evaluation of the current program, the HRPP co-managers determined the spring Chinook program was not achieving the HRPP's defined smolt-to-adult (SAR) survival rate guidelines. The observed low SAR was due to precocity, straying, and incidence of BKD in the spring Chinook program; which ultimately led to the program's inability to achieve the subbasin's overly optimistic biological fish objectives. The summer steelhead hatchery program was not providing the fishery or population benefits anticipated and will be discontinued. The winter steelhead program was performing as planned and no changes are foreseen. This updated Master Plan addresses the several proposed changes to the existing HRPP, which are described...|$|R
40|$|A `user {{tracer gas}} test` was {{performed}} on laboratory hoods, with a human subject {{standing in front of}} the hood, to assess hood containment ability. The relationship of face velocity and cross <b>draft</b> variables to <b>hood</b> containment ability is investigated. The ability of these variables and other tests, such as smoke challenges or tracer gas tests performed with a manikin at the hood, to predict the results of the user tracer gas test is evaluated. All of the laboratory hoods tested in this study were identical bench top bypass hoods with horizontally sliding sashes. A face velocity traverse, cross draft measurements, a pitot traverse to measure exhaust flow, a smoke test, a manikin tracer gas test, and a user tracer gas test were performed on each hood in several different sash positions. Based on the data collected, face velocity, its distribution and variability, and the magnitude of cross drafts relative to face velocity are important variables in determining hood leakage. `Unblocked` vortices, formed such that no physical barrier exists between the vortex and room air or a person in front of the hood, are identified as important sites of leakage. For the hoods evaluated in this study, unblocked vortices were observed along the beveled side edges. The data support the hypothesis that in the presence of a person {{standing in front of the}} hood, leakage is more likely to occur if unblocked vortices are formed than if all vortices are blocked. Evidence suggests that cross drafts are more likely to cause leakage when flowing in a direction that may cause separated flow along a beveled edge of the hood and thereby augment the unblocked vortices along the edge. Results indicate that smoke tests, manikin tracer gas tests, and average face velocity all serve as useful monitoring techniques. Face velocity measurements and smoke tests, which are easy and inexpensive, may provide information which is as valuable as traditional manikin tracer gas tests...|$|R
