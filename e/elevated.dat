5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, <b>elevated</b> IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, <b>elevated</b> IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is <b>elevated</b> in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests that}} may {{assist in the}} {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism, especially if no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (<b>elevated</b> in hemochromatosis), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often <b>elevated</b> in sarcoidosis), and human chorionic gonadotropin (often <b>elevated</b> in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing may be performed.|$|E

5|$|About 40% of {{the subway}} system runs on surface or <b>elevated</b> tracks, {{including}} steel or cast iron <b>elevated</b> structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, open cuts and surface routes. All of these construction methods are completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian crossings, and most crossings of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions.

5|$|As part of Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, {{between the}} city and the BRT, a three-track <b>elevated</b> railway was built above the Culver Line from the Fifth Avenue <b>Elevated</b> {{southeast}} and south to Coney Island. At Ninth Avenue, the <b>elevated</b> replacements for the Culver Line and West End Line met, with access from both lines to the Fifth Avenue <b>Elevated</b> and Fourth Avenue Subway to the northwest. At 3:00a.m. on March 16, 1919, the first portion of the new <b>elevated</b> structure opened from Ninth Avenue southeast and south to Kings Highway. Except for the omission of a station at 15th Avenue, all of the station locations from the surface line were preserved as <b>elevated</b> stations. The Culver Line was operated as a branch of the Fifth Avenue <b>Elevated,</b> with a free transfer at Ninth Avenue to the West End Line into the Fourth Avenue Subway. An extension to Avenue X was opened at noon on May 10, 1919. The line, the last of the four to Coney Island, was completed on May 1, 1920, at which time the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was forced to cut the fare from ten to five cents. This construction tied into the existing lower level of the BMT Brighton Line east of West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium. Some Culver Line (5) trains began using the Fourth Avenue Subway to the Nassau Street Loop in Lower Manhattan when that line opened on May 30, 1931; the Fifth Avenue <b>Elevated</b> was closed on May 31, 1940, in conjunction with the unification of the transit system under city operations. Trolleys continued to use the surface tracks on McDonald Avenue until October 30, 1956.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{unification}} of the three subway companies that comprised the New York City Subway in 1940, <b>elevated</b> lines were being shut down {{all over the city}} and replaced by subways. The northern half of the Second Avenue <b>Elevated,</b> serving the Upper East Side and East Harlem, closed on June 11, 1940; the southern half, running through Lower Manhattan, East Midtown and across the Queensborough Bridge to Queens, closed on June 13, 1942. The demolition of the Second Avenue <b>elevated</b> caused overcrowding on the Astoria and Flushing Lines in Queens, which no longer had direct service to Manhattan's far East Side. Because of the <b>elevated</b> line's closure, as well as a corresponding increase in the East Side's population, the need for a Second Avenue subway increased.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an <b>elevated</b> line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an <b>elevated</b> Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue <b>Elevated</b> was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an <b>elevated</b> of the same length.|$|E
