5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E

25|$|All babies imitate {{with their}} hands the {{movements}} that they see. Typical gestures for example are raising arms to be lifted up, or grabbing/reaching to indicate wanting a bottle; these are used referentially. In addition, infants who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a sign language begin to make gestures that are distinct from all other hand movements and gestures.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} opinion that having {{completed}} military service carries a symbolic {{value to the}} majority of Turks.

25|$|Manual {{babbling}} is structurally {{identical to}} vocal babbling in its development. Just as hearing and/or speaking infants babble with their mouths, infants who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a sign language babble with their hands. If a hearing infant has deaf and/or mute parents or parents who otherwise use a sign language, {{he or she}} will still imitate the signs that they see their parents displaying. This is evidence that manual babbling is possible in both hearing and deaf infants, and in both speaking and mute infants.|$|E

Sasha arrives, and a gunfight ensues; Sasha manages to save Eve after taking a bullet.

25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{malnutrition}} is {{the biggest}} contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases. Six million children die of hunger every year. Underweight births and intrauterine growth restrictions cause 2.2 million child deaths a year. Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of vitamin A or zinc, for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition {{in the first two}} years is irreversible. Malnourished children <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.|$|E

25|$|Immigrant {{children}}—defined {{as those}} {{children under age}} eighteen who are either foreign-born or U.S.-born to immigrant parents—now account for one-fourth of the nation’s 75 million children. By 2050 they are projected to make up one-third of more than 100 million U.S. children. This highlights that children of immigrants in mixed status families are growing in the United States. Therefore, it is of high importance to understand their experiences {{in this country and}} the impact that a mixed status has on the children growing up in these families facing unique needs and challenges. Mixed immigrant families’ rights are being violated. When there is family separation through immigration practices, children in mixed status household are denied the right to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> their families. They are dehumanized, based on status of their parents.|$|E
25|$|Born in the East End at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Lou lived in Walford all her life. She {{was born into a}} large working-class East End family, the youngest of seven siblings, and grew up with a strong sense of community spirit. In the 1930s, {{she fell in love with}} a local boy, Albert Beale (Gary Olson), and gave birth to his daughter, Maggie (Olivia Stanley), but had her adopted because she was born out of wedlock. By 1936, Lou and Albert had married and in 1938 moved to 45 Albert Square. They had six more children: Harry (Aaron Mason), Ronnie (Chase Marks), Dora, Kenny (Michael Attwell), and twins Pete (Peter Dean) and Pauline (Wendy Richard). Albert died in 1965, and Lou remained in the same house with Pauline and her husband, Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher). Lou regularly intervened in her family's affairs, especially when she disapproved of Pete's relationship with Kathy Hills (Gillian Taylforth) because he had previously divorced his first wife, Pat (Pam St Clement), and she had banished her son Kenny to New Zealand in the 1960s for having an affair with Pat. Lou then watched her grandchildren Michelle (Susan Tully), Mark (David Scarboro/Todd Carty) and Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> <b>with</b> Pauline, Pete, Arthur and Kathy looking after her in her old age. In one episode she claims she was one of seven children, one boy and six girls, and on Christmas Day 1987, she states she is from a family of eight, five boys and three girls.|$|E
500|$|Hannah Booth, {{writing in}} The Guardian, {{explains}} that Marimekko's founder, Armi Ratia, [...] "recruited Maija Isola, {{the first and}} most important of many young female designers, to create original prints". She describes Isola as unconventional, leaving her daughter Kristina [...] "to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> her grandmother so she could travel the world to find inspiration for her textiles". Booth quotes Finnish novelist Kaari Utrio as saying Isola was [...] "a dangerously original character"; she [...] "belonged to a trailblazing generation" [...] which enabled young women to move freely into the arts.|$|E

Akira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family, with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased, leaving Kurosawa to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> three sisters and a brother.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{economist}} and biographer Robert Skidelsky, Keynes's parents were loving and attentive. They {{remained in the}} same house throughout their lives, where the children were always welcome to return. Keynes would receive considerable support from his father, including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of Great Depression in 1929. Keynes's mother made her children's interests her own, and according to Skidelsky, [...] "because she could <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> her children, they never outgrew home".|$|E
500|$|To Marianne Hirsch, Spiegelman's life is [...] "dominated by {{memories}} {{that are not}} his own". [...] His work is one not of memory but of postmemory—a term she coined after encountering Maus. [...] This describes {{the relation of the}} children of survivors with the survivors themselves. [...] While these children have not had their parents' experiences, they <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> their parents' memories—the memory of another's memory—until the stories become so powerful that for these children they become memories in their own right. [...] The children's proximity creates a [...] "deep personal connection" [...] with the memory, though separated from it by [...] "generational distance".|$|E
