EXIST {{will consist of}} multiple wide-field hard X-ray coded-aperture telescopes. The current design of the EXIST mission employs two types of telescope systems: high energy telescopes (HETs) using CZT detectors, and low energy telescopes (LETs) using Si detectors. With ProtoEXIST, we will develop and demonstrate the technologies required for the EXIST HETs. As part of our development efforts, we also present recent laboratory measurements of the spectral response and efficiency variation of imaging CZT detectors on a fine scale (~ 0. 5 mm). The preliminary results confirm the need for multi-pixel readouts and small inter-pixel gaps to achieve uniform spectral response and high detection efficiency across detectors.

40|$|The primary {{scientific}} {{mission of}} the Black <b>Hole</b> <b>Finder</b> Probe (BHFP), part of the NASA Beyond Einstein program, is to survey the local Universe for black holes {{over a wide range}} of mass and accretion rate. One approach to such a survey is a hard X-ray coded-aperture imaging mission operating in the 10 - 600 keV energy band, a spectral range that is considered to be especially useful in the detection of black hole sources. The development of new inorganic scintillator materials provides improved performance (for example, with regards to energy resolution and timing) that is well suited to the BHFP science requirements. Detection planes formed with these materials coupled with a new generation of readout devices represent a major advancement in the performance capabilities of scintillator-based gamma cameras.

40|$|We report {{progress}} {{in the study of}} thick CZT strip detectors for 3 -d imaging and spectroscopy and discuss two approaches to device design. We present the spectroscopic, imaging, detection efficiency and response uniformity performance of prototype devices. Unlike double-sided strip detectors, these devices feature both row and column contacts implemented on the anode surface. This electron-only approach circumvents problems associated with poor hole transport in CZT that normally limit the thickness and energy range of double-sided strip detectors. These devices can achieve similar performance to pixel detectors. The work includes laboratory and simulation studies aimed at developing compact, efficient, detector modules for 0. 05 to 1 MeV gamma radiation measurements. The low channel count strip detector approach can significantly reduce the complexity and power requirements of the readout electronics.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{progress}} {{in the study of}} thick single-sided charge-sharing cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) strip detector modules designed to perform gammaray spectroscopy and 3 -D imaging. We report on continuing laboratory and simulation measurements of prototype detectors with 11 × 11 unit cells (15 × 15 × 7. 5 mm 3). We report preliminary measurements of the 3 -D spatial resolution. Our studies are aimed at developing compact, efficient, detector modules for 0. 05 to 1 MeV gamma measurements while minimizing the number and complexity of the electronic readout channels.

40|$|Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) unification, {{which implies}} {{a large number}} of {{obscured}} AGN, can explain the optical, infrared and X-ray content of deep multiwavelength surveys. Here, we show that the same model also successfully explains the spectral shape and intensity of the X-ray background. The simplest possible unified model assumes a constant ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN, independent of redshift or luminosity. With almost no free parameters, the predicted X-ray background agrees remarkably well with observations. Both the observed properties of deep AGN samples and the X-ray background {{can be explained by the}} same model without invoking different evolution for obscured and unobscured AGN. Recent observational evidence shows that the ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN may depend on luminosity. An AGN unification model that allows for such a dependence also fits the X-ray background spectrum, and the predicted numbers counts in the 2 - 10 keV X-ray band are in good agreement with observations. We present predictions for the source counts in hard X-rays (10 - 100 keV), which indicate that future missions like the Black <b>Hole</b> <b>Finder</b> will observe thousands of heavily obscured AGN.

40|$|EXIST {{is being}} studied as the Black <b>Hole</b> <b>Finder</b> Probe, {{one of the}} 3 Einstein Probe {{missions}} under NASA's Beyond Einstein program. The major science goals for EXIST include highly sensitive full-sky hard X-ray survey in a very wide energy band of 5 - 600 keV. The scientific requirements of wide energy band (10 - 600 keV for the High Energy Telescope considered for EXIST) and large field of view (approximately 130 deg x 60 deg in the current design, incorporating an array of 18 contiguous very large area coded aperture telescopes) presents significant imaging challenges. The requirement of achieving high imaging sensitivity puts stringent limits on the uniformity and knowledge of systematics for the detector plane. In order to accomplish the ambitious scientific requirements of EXIST, {{it is necessary to}} implement many novel techniques. Here we present the initial results of our extensive Monte-Carlo simulations of coded mask imaging for EXIST to estimate the performance degradation due to various factors affecting the imaging such as the non-ideal detector plane and bright partially coded sources.

40|$|The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is an {{extremely}} capable and efficient black <b>hole</b> <b>finder.</b> We present a simple mid-infrared color criterion, W 1 – W 2 ≥ 0. 8 (i. e., [3. 4]–[4. 6] ≥ 0. 8, Vega), which identifies 61. 9 ± 5. 4 active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates per deg^ 2 {{to a depth of}} W 2 ~ 15. 0. This implies a much larger census of luminous AGNs than found by typical wide-area surveys, attributable to the fact that mid-infrared selection identifies both unobscured (type 1) and obscured (type 2) AGNs. Optical and soft X-ray surveys alone are highly biased toward only unobscured AGNs, while this simple WISE selection likely identifies even heavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs. Using deep, public data in the COSMOS field, we explore the properties of WISE-selected AGN candidates. At the mid-infrared depth considered, 160 μJy at 4. 6 μm, this simple criterion identifies 78 % of Spitzer mid-infrared AGN candidates according to the criteria of Stern et al. and the reliability is 95 %.

40|$|The synergy of GLAST and the {{proposed}} EXIST mission as the Black <b>Hole</b> <b>Finder</b> Probe in the Beyond Einstein Program is remarkable. With its full-sky per orbit hard X-ray imaging (3 - 600 keV) and "nuFnu" sensitivity comparable to GLAST, EXIST could measure variability and spectra of Blazars in the hard X-ray synchrotron component simultaneous with GLAST (~ 10 - 100 GeV) measures of the inverse Compton component, thereby uniquely constraining intrinsic source spectra and allowing measured high energy spectral breaks to measure the cosmic diffuse extra-galactic background light (EBL) by determining the intervening diffuse IR photon field required to yield the observed break from photon-photon absorption. Such studies also constrain the physics of jets (and parameters and indeed the validity of SSC models) and {{the origin of the}} > 100 MeV gamma-ray diffuse background likely arising from Blazars and jet-dominated sources.

The Energetic X-ray Timing Survey Telescope (EXIST) mission {{concept is}} under study as the Black <b>Hole</b> <b>Finder</b> Probe (BHFP), {{one of the}} three Einstein Probe {{missions}} in the Beyond Einstein Program in the current NASA Strategic Plan.

The proposed angular resolution of 5 arcmin, temporal resolution of 10 microsec, energy resolution of 1 - 4 keV over the broad band, and duty cycle of 0. 2 - 0. 5 for continuous coverage of any source provide an unprecedented phase space for timing and spectral studies of black holes –from stellar to supermassive, as well as neutron stars and accreting white dwarfs. The large sky coverage allows intrinsically rare events to be studied. One particularly exciting example is the possible detection of tidal disruption of stars near quiescent AGN.

40|$|We report our {{progress}} {{on the development of}} pixellated imaging CZT detector arrays for our first-generation balloon-borne wide-field hard X-ray (20 - 600 keV) telescope, ProtoEXIST 1. Our ProtoEXIST program is a pathfinder for the High Energy Telescope (HET) on the Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey telescope (EXIST), a proposed implementation of the Black <b>Hole</b> <b>Finder</b> Probe. ProtoEXIST 1 consists of four independent coded-aperture telescopes with close-tiled (~ 0. 4 mm gaps) CZT detectors that preserve their 2. 5 mm pixel pitch. Multiple shielding/field-of-view configurations are planned to identify optimal geometry for the HET in EXIST. The primary technical challenge in ProtoEXIST is the development of large area, close-tiled modules of imaging CZT detectors (1000 cm 2 for ProtoEXIST 1), with all readout and control systems for the ASIC readout vertically stacked. We describe the overall telescope configuration of ProtoEXIST 1 and review the current development status of the CZT detectors, from individual detector crystal units (DCUs) to a full detector module (DM). We have built the first units of each component for the detector plane and have completed a few Rev 2 DCUs (2 x 2 cm 2), which are under a series of tests. Bare DCUs (pre-crystal bonding) show high, uniform ASIC yield (~ 70 %) and ~ 30 % reduction in electronics noise compared to the Rev 1 equivalent. A Rev 1 DCU already achieved ~ 1. 2 % FWHM at 662 keV, and preliminary analysis of the initial radiation tests on a Rev 2 DCU shows ~ 4 keV FWHM at 60 keV (vs. 4. 7 keV for Rev 1).

40|$|EXIST is {{a mission}} {{designed}} {{to find and}} study black holes (BHs) {{over a wide range}} of environments and masses, including: 1) BHs accreting from binary companions or dense molecular clouds throughout our Galaxy and the Local Group, 2) supermassive black holes (SMBHs) lying dormant in galaxies that reveal their existence by disrupting passing stars, and 3) SMBHs that are hidden from our view at lower energies due to obscuration by the gas that they accrete. 4) the birth of stellar mass BHs which is accompanied by long cosmic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which are seen several times a day and may be associated with the earliest stars to form in the Universe. EXIST will provide an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity and angular resolution as well as greater spectral resolution and bandwidth compared with earlier hard X-ray survey telescopes. With an onboard optical-infra red (IR) telescope, EXIST will measure the spectra and redshifts of GRBs and their utility as cosmological probes of the highest z universe and epoch of reionization. The mission would retain its primary goal of being the Black <b>Hole</b> <b>Finder</b> Probe in the Beyond Einstein Program. However, the new design for EXIST proposed to be studied here represents a significant advance from its previous incarnation as presented to BEPAC. The mission is now less than half the total mass, would be launched on the smallest EELV available (Atlas V- 401) for a Medium Class mission, and most importantly includes a two-telescope complement that is ideally suited for the study of both obscured and very distant BHs. EXIST retains its very wide field hard X-ray imaging High Energy Telescope (HET) as the primary instrument, now with improved angular and spectral resolution, and in a more compact payload that allows occasional rapid slews for immediate optical/IR imaging and spectra of GRBs and AGN as well as enhanced hard X-ray spectra and timing with pointed observations. The mission would conduct a 2 year full sky survey in scanning mode, interrupted for several orbits per day by GRB follow-ups, followed by a combined pointing-scanning mission phase for optical/IR spectroscopy and redshifts for the large AGN sample found in the survey as well as GRBs and LSST transients. A Team of university, NASA, and industry investigators will conduct the study to determine the full sensitivity and capabilities of this new configuration for EXIST. It will build on the extensive studies of the prior design for the mission and the HET and will incorporate the optical/IR telescope (hereafter IRT) now fully developed by our ITT partner for the NextView Commercial Remote Sensing mission (early 2008 launch) with a focal plane to be developed at GSFC based in part on JWST/NIRSPEC designs. No new technology is needed for either the IRT or HET instruments. The study will pay close attention to full mission cost and present a design for the Decadal Survey Workshop to ensure this even more capable EXIST mission is once again part of the next Decadal Survey...|$|E
