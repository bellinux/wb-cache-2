2500|$|Many {{schools on}} all {{education}} levels offer service-learning programs, which {{allow students to}} serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit. According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to Where's the Learning in Service-Learning? by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, Jr.,"...we promote more wide-spread adoption of service-learning in higher education because {{we see it as}} a powerful means of preparing students to become more caring and responsible parents and citizens and of helping colleges and universities to make good on their pledge to 'serve society.'" [...] When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, [...] "Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs." [...] Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds {{by the fact that it}} [...] "...fosters student development by capturing student interest..." [...] While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown. Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs, According to Eyler and Giles,"These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> service-learning on students." [...] They describe their experience with students involved in service-learning in this way: [...] "Students like service-learning. When we sit down with a group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that believe that what they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction." ...|$|E

The fifth section explores whether worker bargaining power has become weaker, allowing for low unemployment and only modest wage pressure, because of worker job anxiety, the decline in union membership, or increased competitive pressures. <b>The</b> final section <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tightest labor market in a generation on poverty. Our main findings are that changes in the age structure of the labor force, the growth of the male prison population, and, more speculatively, the rise of the temporary help sector, are the main labor market forces behind the low unemployment rate in the late 1990 s...|$|R
