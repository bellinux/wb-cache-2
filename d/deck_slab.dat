2500|$|Key Bridge {{underwent}} a major inspection in 2011. [...] Officials {{were concerned that}} the chemical agents used to bond the tensioned cables running through the concrete road deck were corroding the concrete. The architectural engineering firm of Johnson, Mirmiran & Thompson (JMT) was hired to inspect the bridge. JMT discovered that the <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> was ready to fail, and there was extensive corrosive deterioration of {{the underside of the}} concrete deck. Cracks were also found in some of the abutments, arches and spandrel arches, concrete deck, and piers. The sonic echo/impulse response method was used to identify areas within the concrete where cables had disintegrated or where corrosion had created voids. JMT restored some deteriorated portions of the deck. The bridge was rated [...] "structurally deficient" [...] after these tests.|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{non-corrosive}} nature, high strength and light weight, fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) are being widely used as reinforcement in concrete bridges, {{especially those in}} harsh environments. The current design methods of concrete <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> in most bridge design codes assume a flexural behavior under traffic wheel loads. The load carrying capacities of concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs,</b> however, are greatly enhanced due to the arching action effect developed by lateral restraints. This study {{presents the results of}} a non-linear finite element (FE) investigation that predicts the performance of FRP reinforced concrete (RC) <b>deck</b> <b>slabs.</b> The FE investigation is divided into two main parts: a calibration study and a parametric study. In the calibration study, the validity and accuracy of the FE model were verified against experimental test results of concrete slabs reinforced with glass and carbon FRP bars. In the parametric study, the effect of some key parameters influencing the performance of FRP-RC <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> bars was investigated.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a synthesis of}} the design provisions of the second edition of the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) for fibre-reinforced structures. New design provisions for applications {{not covered by the}} first edition of the CHBDC and the rationale for those that remain unchanged from the first edition are given. Among the new design provisions are those for glass-fibre-reinforced polymer as both primary reinforcement and ten-dons in concrete; and for the rehabilitation of concrete and timber structures with externally bonded fibre-reinforced-polymer (FRP) systems or near-surface-mounted reinforcement. The provisions for fibre-reinforced concrete <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> in the first edition have been reorganized in the second edition to explicitly include <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> of both cast-in-place and precast construction and are now referred to as externally restrained <b>deck</b> <b>slabs,</b> whereas <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> containing in-ternal FRP reinforcement are referred to as internally restrained <b>deck</b> <b>slabs.</b> Resistance factors in the second edition have been recast from those in the first edition and depend on the condition of use, with a further distinction made be-tween factory- and field-produced FRP. In the second edition, the deformability requirements for FRP-reinforced and FRP-prestressed concrete beams and slabs of the first edition have been split into three subclauses covering the design for deformability, minimum flexural resistance, and crack-control reinforcement. The effect of sustained loads on the strength of FRPs is accounted for in the second edition by limits on stresses in FRP at the serviceability limit state. Key words: beams, bridges, concrete, decks, fibre-reinforced-polymer reinfo~cement, fibre-reinforced-polymer sheets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental test and a numerical analysis to investigate structural behaviour of concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with glass fibre-reinforced (GFRP) bars under static patch loads. A series of one-third scaled bridge deck models of concrete slabs supported by longitudinal steel beams were conducted and tested in the laboratory with varying structural parameters, including steel supporting sizes, reinforcement percentages, reinforcing materials, concrete compressive strengths and model storage duration. The presence of longitudinal steel beams and unloaded area of concrete <b>slabs</b> cause loaded <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> to be restrained against lateral expansion. As a result, a compressive membrane thrust is developed. The experimental results were presented in cracking pattern, deflection, strain in concrete and reinforcement, loading capacity and failure mode. It was found that compressive membrane action (CMA) inside the slabs had a beneficial influence on loading capacities and service behaviours. Thereafter, a nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) was conducted.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} behaviour of thin {{reinforced concrete}} structures, such as slabs, can {{be governed by}} the punching due to point loads. This premature brittle failure mode can occur in bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs,</b> often subjected to severe conditions of loads concentrated in small areas, and characterised by a reduced thickness. In this kind of structures a proper punching reinforcement is not applicable, even if the local and global behaviour can be improved {{by the addition of}} short fibres. The adoption of fibre reinforced concrete (FRC), indeed, can increase the punching shear resistance as well as the absorption energy capacity.

40|$|A {{reinforced}} concrete pier structure, built in 1971, had evidently developed severe chloride-induced corrosion damage due to exposure to marine environment. Inspection conducted in 2006 revealed severe vertical cracking in the piles and extensive horizontal cracking and delamination {{of the cover}} concrete at the crosshead soffits. Previous ARRB data had shown that the 22 mm and 32 mm reinforcement bars had lost 1. 5 mm by 2000 due to chloride-induced corrosion. Based on the then prevailing corrosion rate, an additional 0. 4 mm was estimated to have been lost between 2000 and 2006.

The <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> and beams were far less affected by chloride-induced corrosion. The design load capacity of the pier was originally for 7 tonne (single axle) and 10 tonne (double axle) vehicles. Calculations based on the observed deterioration showed that the load rating of the piles, beams and <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> remain unchanged (despite the deterioration), but the crossheads were found to be severely deficient in shear capacity due to loss of stirrups. Based on the AS 5100 requirements, the load rating needed to be reduced to 3. 6 tonnes and 5. 2 tonnes for single and double axle vehicles, respectively.

40|$|There {{is growing}} use of FRP {{composite}} {{materials in the}} civil infrastructure for rehabilitation of deficient bridge components including <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> and girders. However assessment {{of the effectiveness of}} rehabilitation over time and monitoring the progression of damage or change in load paths at systems level, caused by FRP strengthening of the components, has not been undertaken to date. Investigation was first carried out at "component level" on both unstrengthened and field-rehabilitated slab specimens cut out from a major highway bridge. The slabs were tested to failure and the progression of damage was characterized through instrumentation and NDE. The test data on the failure modes and capacity loads were compared to the available analytical models and design guidelines. The test capacity was also correlated to the bridge deck capacity based on local-global modeling. Research at the "systems level" was then undertaken, in which a three- girder two-span bridge deck system was tested to simulate behavior under field loading in which the <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> are found to be susceptible to punching shear type failures and the longitudinal girders are usually found to be deficient in terms of shear demand. The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate damage progression in the FRP composite strengthened <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> and the longitudinal girders under simulated truck load and to study the changes in the overall response of structure at systems level caused by strengthening of individual components that might cause other components to reach their critical limit states under the higher load demands which can be resisted by the strengthened components. NDE techniques, including IR thermography and forced vibration based dynamic modal tests, were evaluated as means to quantify the damage localization and progression under simulated field loading as well as to quantitatively monitor, at systems level, changes in the response of the components caused by subsequent modifications of the structure through sequential FRP strengthening. The test data on the failure modes, capacity loads and specimen behavior were compared to both analytical and numerical models.
