2500|$|On {{the night}} of 23 April 1975, Ham {{received}} a phone call from the United States, telling him that all his money had disappeared. Later that night he met Tom Evans and they went to The White Hart Pub in Surrey together, where Ham drank ten whiskies. Evans drove him home at three o'clock on the morning of 24 April 1975. Ham hanged himself in his garage studio in Woking later that morning. His suicide note—addressed to his girlfriend, Anne Herriot, and her son, Blair—blamed Polley for much of his despair and inability to cope with his <b>disappointments</b> <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> The note read: [...] "Anne, I love you. Blair, I love you. I will not be allowed to love and trust everybody. This is better. Pete. P.S. Stan Polley is a soulless bastard. I will take him with me". Ham had shown growing signs of mental illness over the past months, with Gibbins remembering Ham burning cigarettes on his hands and arms. He was cremated at the Morriston Crematorium, Swansea; his ashes were spread in the memorial gardens. Ham's daughter, Petera, was born one month after his death. [...] In May, Warner Bros terminated its contract with Badfinger, and Badfinger dissolved. [...] Around that time, Apple also deleted all of Badfinger's albums from its catalogue.|$|E

5000|$|For all this, Martin {{is portrayed}} as an {{extremely}} likable and caring individual. He is usually enthusiastic about making new friends, and although he may {{find it difficult to}} express his feelings to his sons, he clearly loves them both, remaining proud of and devoted to them, and bitterly resenting any implication that this might not be the case. When Niles goes to a costume party as Martin and is asked to name his biggest <b>disappointment</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> Niles' response (<b>in</b> character and slightly inebriated) turns this into a speech of his distaste for his and Frasier's pretentiousness, snobbery, and lack of athleticism before finally saying [...] "if I had to choose my two biggest disappointments". Martin quickly cuts him off, angered at being portrayed [...] "as a drunken judgmental jackass", and tells Niles that, while he and Frasier were not what he was expecting, he has always been proud of them.|$|R

50|$|As the Vedrenne-Barker seasons {{closed with}} the Royal Court, new {{opportunities}} opened with the Duke of York's Theatre in 1910.

His works represented realism, like Courbet’s, and he wasn’t afraid to represent all matters of life, including the lives of humble people.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} of [...] "Can't Stand the Pain" [...] was {{directed}} by Vladimir Andonov and Dimitar Karakashev, shot by Jean Trendafilov, {{and it was the}} first video to be presented on cinema in Bulgaria. The basic conception of the clip is about the <b>disappointments</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> caused by higher expectations in childhood. The idea is presented by a little girl with her toys, metaphorically describing desires and situations, which have their real life equivalents in the video, but with different, unexpected and disappointing denouements.|$|E

This failure may have been caused in part by his producing a small statue of the Virgin and placing it before him on the table during the interview for the fellowship.|$|R

50|$|After Leg 7, Michael and Kevin {{were the}} fifth team {{eliminated}} and {{were sent to}} the villa. After the other teams went snorkeling during the day, Katie and Rachel continued to state that they wanted an all-female team (specifically Brook and Claire) to be eliminated next, as they still were upset {{that they would not be}} the first all-female team to win; the two girls were disappointed when they saw Michael and Kevin arrive. Kevin stated his disappointment at their elimination because of an hour-long penalty, while Michael joked that he was glad to finally be done with the stresses of racing. While alone, Kevin continued to say he wished they had not been eliminated so they could have potentially gone to Asia (specifically China where they would have had had a linguistic advantage), but Michael told him to just drop the issue. The next day, the eliminated teams visited Punta Sur, where Katie and Rachel spoke with Michael and Kevin about their elimination. Michael told the group that none of them should dwell on losing the race, and that it should be a learning experience on how to accept even the biggest <b>disappointments</b> <b>in</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

40|$|In an {{interview}} {{after receiving the}} Akutagawa prize in 1991, Ogawa Yoko says that she is interested in writing characters who are frustrated {{in the pursuit of}} perfection through food. She tells the interviewer that she is intrigued by the idea of flawlessness and that is linked with the consumption of food. Certainly food is front and center in her novel Sugartime (1994), but it has an even more complicated role in her 1991 novella Pregnancy Calendar. In this paper, I will explore the young female protagonists’ relationships with food and how they use this relationship to define themselves against others and society at large. For both Kaori, the narrator, and the unnamed narrator in Pregnancy Diary, food serves to protect them from the <b>disappointments</b> <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> such as breaking up with a boyfriend. Yet for the unnamed narrator, food is a weapon against others. These two novels are told {{in the form of the}} diary narrated in the first person by the young female character. I will explore how these characters chronicle their food obsessions in diaries...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Alex Haley's novel Queen. In this study the writer reveals the {{endurance}} of Queen who was a mulatto living {{in the era of}} slavery in the United States. In enduring such bad situation in the bondage Queen showed a way that made her able to survive. The way which the writer regards as a technique to survive is called a non violent technique. Queen's understanding of the technique did not lead her into enormosity against the whites, on the contrary. Queen was convinced that the way to solve the problem was only that the black could undergo the suppression without physical revenge. If there was any protest against injustices, it should be a peaceful protest. In this study, the writer wants to reveal Queen's endurance by using the survival technique as a tool to keep herself survive, and her reasons in choosing this way. Besides, the writer also wants to analyze her outcomes. The writer uses the theory of the nature of slavery to emphasize the bad condition of the slaves during the slavery period. Aside from that, she also uses the theory of African American survival technique in Afro American literature to equip with a background knowledge about African American survival techniques. The writer finds out that Queen chose a way to survive, by non violent protest because she wanted to avoid violence. Queen also made the Christian faith as the basic for her life's principle and to face <b>disappointments</b> <b>in</b> <b>life</b> during the bondage. To overcome all her burdens and problems about racism, she used non violent protest as her action. To fight for equality of rights she also used non violent protest and she devoted herself to Christian principles in her life. Queen also had a good result or outcome by using her survival technique. Queen with her non violent protest, fighting for rights and by letting Christian wisdom lead her life's direction, could endure and bear the suffering. From the analysis above the writer concludes that Afro Americans had their own tool or way to keep surviving in a racist world. Survival technique is really needed for the black people to anticipate the bad condition of racism in order to endure suffering, hardship and difficulties...|$|E
