500|$|In November 2010, Fox {{announced}} that Fringe was being moved to Friday nights {{as a part}} of the network's midseason overhaul, to air after the fourth season of their reality series Kitchen Nightmares. The move meant that Fringe would be airing against Supernatural, a show with a similar science fiction genre, though this competition did not begin until Fringes third Friday episode [...] "Concentrate and Ask Again". Fox's popular reality series American Idol took Fringes timeslot, as it was shifted a day later to Wednesdays and Thursdays. Executive producer J.H. Wyman stated in an interview that they were excited and believed Friday nights are [...] "open territory that can be conquered... we can actually deliver like The X-Files did. ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> agree it's a good opportunity". Wyman elaborated that the show's high DVR numbers proved that though fans were watching the show, they did not want to do so on Thursdays. Co-executive producer Jeff Pinkner felt that if the show [...] "can build a fan base on and carve out some territory on Friday night, we can be there for years".|$|E
500|$|James Guthrie, {{recommended}} by previous Floyd collaborator Alan Parsons, arrived {{early in the}} production process. He replaced engineer Brian Humphries, emotionally drained by his five years with the band. [...] Guthrie {{was hired as a}} co-producer, but was initially unaware of Ezrin's role: [...] "I saw myself as a hot young producer...When we arrived, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> felt we'd been booked to do the same job." [...] The early sessions at Britannia Row were emotionally charged, as Ezrin, Guthrie and Waters each had strong ideas about the direction the album would take. Relations within the band were at a low ebb, and Ezrin's role expanded to that of an intermediary between Waters {{and the rest of the}} band. [...] As Britannia Row was initially regarded as inadequate for The Wall the band upgraded much of its equipment, and by March another set of demos were complete. However, their former relationship with NWG placed them at risk of bankruptcy, and they were advised to leave the UK by no later than 6April 1979, for a minimum of one year. As non-residents they would pay no UK taxes during that time, and within a month all four members and their families had left. Waters moved to Switzerland, Mason to France, and Gilmour and Wright to the Greek Islands. Some equipment from Britannia Row was relocated in Super Bear Studios near Nice. [...] Gilmour and Wright were each familiar with the studio and enjoyed its atmosphere, having recorded there during the production of their solo albums. While Wright and Mason lived at the studio, Waters and Gilmour stayed in nearby houses. Mason later moved into Waters's villa near Vence, while Ezrin stayed in Nice.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, Hansard {{indicated}} that they were no longer a romantic couple. He said, [...] "Of course, we fell into each other's arms. It was a very necessary part of our friendship but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> concluded that that wasn't what we really wanted to do. So we're not together now. We are just really good friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a risk. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>both</b> need courage, {{but if you}} {{are willing}} I need not hesitate. I will try to make a good farmer's wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was wrong}} of me," [...] she said, flushing. [...] "I'm afraid {{he was not}} the only one to be blamed; <b>we</b> were <b>both</b> foolish in those days, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have <b>both</b> learned a lesson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I do {{not exactly}} understand, Adams," [...] he {{added in a}} loud voice, seeing that Orme had turned again, [...] "and what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should <b>both</b> like to know, is your exact object in making these proposals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; I {{think we}} are pretty well agreed on the point that she had best go home. People make {{mistakes}} sometimes, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> made a mistake when we got married. Anyhow, we have both agreed that {{it is best to}} part for a time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; no. I {{wish the}} title could have passed over my head, Silverbridge, {{and gone to}} you at once. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> should have been suited better. But there are things which one should not consider. Even in this place I may perhaps do something. Shall you attack us very bitterly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have hoped}} so, dear Miss Todd"--he {{had taken a}} moment to consider, and {{thought that he had}} better drop the Sarah {{altogether}} for the present. [...] "In myself, I can safely say that it has been so. With you, I feel that I am happy, and at my ease. Your modes of thought and way of life are all such as I admire and approve,"--Miss Todd again bowed--"and--and--what I mean is, that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> live very much after the same fashion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Carroll answered, with {{a desperate}} attempt to treat the matter humorously. [...] "But <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> had a hand in the thing. My partner favored me with his views; I {{disclaim}} some of the responsibility." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so, George, though I do {{not know}} why it should be so, for the more blessings one has the more reason for love and {{gratitude}} to the giver. However, dear, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have <b>both</b> reason to be grateful now, have we not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] Sarah {{acknowledged}} with emphasis. [...] "He {{has developed}} gifts of which I {{had not the}} slightest apprehension. Of course, Josephine would scratch me if I ventured upon {{such a thing as}} comparison,-so I'll be content with saying that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are <b>both</b> very happy women." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will be enough. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> {{know the}} {{position}} of every reef to within a hundred yards, so we will shape our course for Guernsey. If we happen to hit it off, we can hold on to St. Helier, but if when we {{think we ought to}} be within sight of Guernsey we see nothing of it, we must lie to again, till the storm has blown itself out or the clouds lift. It would never do to go groping our way along with such currents as run among the islands. Put the last reef in the trysail before you hoist it. I think you had better get the foresail down altogether, and run up the spitfire jib." ...|$|E
60|$|Accordingly we hauled up {{the boat}} by the {{tow-rope}} till {{it was right}} under {{the stern of the}} dhow, and Job bundled into her with all the grace of a falling sack of potatoes. Then we returned {{and sat down on the}} deck again, and smoked and talked in little gusts and jerks. The night was so lovely, and our brains were so full of suppressed excitement of one sort and another, that we did not feel inclined to turn in. For nearly an hour we sat thus, and then, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> dozed off. At least I have a faint recollection of Leo sleepily explaining that the head was not a bad place to hit a buffalo, if you could catch him exactly between the horns, or send your bullet down his throat, or some nonsense of the sort.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} it is," [...] he told his friend, [...] "I'm not much over forty, but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. My sister shows the same tendency. We like {{everything}} to be exactly in its accustomed place; we like things to happen exactly at their appointed times; we like everything to be usual, orderly, punctual, methodical, to a hair's breadth, to a minute. It distresses and upsets us {{if it is not}} so. For instance, to take a very trifling matter, a thrush has built its nest year after year in the catkin-tree on the lawn; this year, for no obvious reason, it is building in the ivy on the garden wall. We have said very little about it, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> feel that the change is unnecessary, and just a little irritating." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At times, {{knowing that}} if we stopped another moment in these rooms we should scream, we would steal softly out and rush downstairs, and, {{shutting}} ourselves out of hearing in a cellar underneath the yard, laugh till we reeled against the dirty walls. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were <b>both</b> getting a little mad.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bribed! No, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> you'll be bribed; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should <b>both</b> keep {{ourselves}} absolutely {{free from}} all {{chance of being}} talked to on the subject, except before each other and before witnesses. I would not drink brandy-and-water at the Blue Dragon, before this report be written, even if my brother were there.' ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Angela and I {{exchanged}} glances. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> should <b>both</b> {{have laughed}} {{but for the}} tears which we had seen in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|I {{changed the}} conversation. After all I {{was a fool}} to have blundered into it. We talked of other and lighter things. I exerted myself {{to shake off the}} {{depression}} against which I had been struggling all the morning. By degrees <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> forgot some part of our troubles. We walked home across the sandhills, climbing gradually higher and higher, until we reached the cliffs. On all sides of us the coming change in the seasons seemed to be vigorously asserting itself. The plovers were crying over the freshly-turned ploughed fields, a whole world of wild birds and insects seemed to have imparted a sense of movement and life to what only a few days ago had been a land of desolation, a country silent and winterbound. Colour was asserting itself in all manner of places--in the green of the sprouting grass, the shimmer of the sun upon the sea-stained sands, in the silvery blue of the Braster creeks. Lady Angela drew a long breath of content as we paused for a moment at the summit of the cliffs.|$|E
60|$|With Beatrice Normandy's {{connivance}} {{she managed}} to get away {{for the better part}} of the day, and we spent a long morning in argument in the Botanical Gardens--that obvious solitude--and afterwards we lunched upon ham and ginger beer at a little open-air restaurant near the Broad Walk and talked on until nearly four. We were so young that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> felt, beneath our very real and vivid emotions, a gratifying sense of romantic resourcefulness in this prolonged discussion. There is something ridiculously petty and imitative about youth, something too, naïvely noble and adventurous. I can never determine if older people are less generous and imaginative or merely less absurd. I still recall the autumnal melancholy of that queer, neglected-looking place, in which I had never been before, and which I have never revisited--a memory of walking along narrow garden paths beside queer leaf-choked artificial channels of water under yellow-tinted trees, of rustic bridges going nowhere in particular, and of a kind of brickwork ruined castle, greatly decayed and ivy-grown, in which we sat for a long time looking out upon a lawn and a wide gravel path leading to a colossal frontage of conservatory.|$|E
60|$|I {{have left}} Windsor these ten days, and am deep in pills with asafoetida, and a steel bitter drink; and I find my head {{much better than}} it was. I was very much discouraged; for I used to be ill {{for three or four}} days {{together}}, ready to totter as I walked. I take eight pills a day, and have taken, I believe, a hundred and fifty already. The Queen, Lord Treasurer, Lady Masham, and I, were all ill together, but are now all better; only Lady Masham expects every day to lie in at Kensington. There was never such a lump of lies spread about the town together as now. I doubt not but you will have them in Dublin before this comes to you, and all without the least grounds of truth. I have been mightily put backward in something I am writing by my illness, but hope to fetch it up, so as to be ready when the Parliament meets. Lord Treasurer has had an ugly fit of the rheumatism, but is now near quite well. I was playing at one-and-thirty with him and his family t'other night. He gave us all twelvepence apiece to begin with: it put me in mind of Sir William Temple.(2) I asked both him and Lady Masham seriously whether the Queen were at all inclined to a dropsy, and they positively assured me she was not: so did her physician Arbuthnot, who always attends her. Yet these devils have spread that she has holes in her legs, and runs at her navel, and I know not what. Arbuthnot has sent me from Windsor a pretty Discourse upon Lying, and I have ordered the printer to come for it. It is a proposal for publishing a curious piece, called The Art of Political Lying, in two volumes, etc. And then there is an abstract of the first volume, just like those pamphlets which they call The Works of the Learned.(3) Pray get it when it comes out. The Queen has a little of the gout in one of her hands. I believe she will stay a month still at Windsor. Lord Treasurer showed me the kindest letter from her in the world, by which I picked out one secret, that there will be soon made some Knights of the Garter. You know another is fallen by Lord Godolphin's death: he will be buried {{in a day or two}} at Westminster Abbey. I saw Tom Leigh(4) in town once. The Bishop of Clogher has taken his lodging for the winter; they are all well. I hear there are in town abundance of people from Ireland; half a dozen bishops at least. The poor old Bishop of London,(5) at past fourscore, fell down backward going upstairs, and I think broke or cracked his skull; yet is now recovering. The town is as empty as at midsummer; and if I had not occasion for physic, I would be at Windsor still. Did I tell you of Lord Rivers's will? He has left legacies to about twenty paltry old whores by name, and not a farthing to any friend, dependent, or relation: he has left from his only child, Lady Barrymore,(6) her mother's estate, and given the whole to his heir-male, a popish priest, a second cousin, who is now Earl Rivers, and whom he used in his life like a footman. After him it goes to his chief wench and bastard. Lord Treasurer and Lord Chamberlain are executors of this hopeful will. I loved the man, and detest his memory. We hear nothing of peace yet: I believe verily the Dutch are so wilful, because they are told the Queen cannot live. I had poor MD's letter, N.3,(7) at Windsor: but I could not answer it then; poor Pdfr was vely kick(8) then: and, besides, it was a very inconvenient place to send letters from. Oo thought to come home the same day, and stayed a month: that was a sign the place was agreeable.(9) I should love such a sort of jaunt. Is that lad Swanton(10) a little more fixed than he used to be? I think you like the girl very well. She has left off her grave airs, I suppose. I am now told Lord Godolphin was buried last night.--O poo Ppt! lay down oo head aden, fais I...; I always reckon if oo are ill I shall hear it, and therefore hen oo are silent I reckon all is well.(11) I believe I 'scaped the new fever(12) for the same reason that Ppt did, because I am not well; but why should DD 'scape it, pray? She is melthigal, oo know, and ought to have the fever; but I hope it is now too late, and she won't have it at all. Some physicians here talk very melancholy, and think it foreruns the plague, which is actually at Hamburg. I hoped Ppt would have done with her illness; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> have that faculty never to part with a disorder for ever; we are very constant. I have had my giddiness twenty-three years by fits. Will Mrs. Raymond never have done lying-in? He intends to leave beggars enough; for I daresay he has squandered away the best part of his fortune already, and is not out of debt. I had a letter from him lately.|$|E
6000|$|Then Tom {{went forward}} {{with his hands}} down. [...] "Look here, Mitcham, you can't see, and I can hardly stand. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have <b>both</b> done enough. <b>We</b> neither of us can give in, well because--because I am a gentleman, you because you are bigger than I am; so let's shake hands, and say no more about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{one little}} difficulty, Mr. Vanstone, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have <b>both</b> overlooked. Your housekeeper's recent conduct {{inclines}} me {{to fear that}} she will view the approaching change in your life with anything but a friendly eye. Probably you have not thought it necessary yet to inform her of the new tie which you propose to form?" ...|$|R
5000|$|While writing The Champions he {{collaborated with}} artist Bob Hall, who said in 2013, [...] "Bill was a peach — {{very helpful to}} me as I got started the comics {{profession}} ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were <b>both</b> as enthusiastic as we could get about this particular comic, but more because we were working at Marvel than because of the book itself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently, Hansard {{indicated}} that they were no longer a romantic couple. He said, [...] "Of course, we fell into each other's arms.

We are just really good friends." ...|$|E
50|$|Mark Strauss, Davenport, Iowa. This {{question}} is for Ron Paul. Mr. Paul, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> know that the Republican party {{is never going to}} give you the nomination. But I'm hoping that you're crazy like a fox like that and you're using this exposure to propel yourself into an independent run. My {{question is}} for Ron Paul: Mr. Paul, are you going to let America down by not running as an independent? Thank you.|$|E

5000|$|June 9 [...] "One of {{the things}} that we're charged with is keeping America safe and keeping our civil liberties and privacy intact. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have done <b>both</b> in this {{particular}} case." ...|$|R

5000|$|Makoto Kino, {{otherwise}} known as Sailor Jupiter, is arguably one of Amanda C. Miller's most notable roles. A longtime Sailor Moon fan, Miller auditioned for every female part in the series, but became ecstatic when she discovered that she was cast as Sailor Jupiter. Miller cites Sailor Jupiter as her favorite character. On describing the similarities between her and Sailor Jupiter, Miller said, [...] "I’m a lot like Makoto, because we were both the tallest kid in our class. I was, like, 5’7” when I was in fifth grade … I did play hockey on a boys’ team. I played goalie. So, I think that I have the tomboy aspect—and I love green—but also what I love about the character {{is that she was}} very tough but she was also equally as feminine. She was just so ‘I like to ice skate, I like to nerd out over cute boys,’ and I just love that about her. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> share that. Like we’re both feminine, but we’ll also kick your butt." [...] Miller cited actor Harvey Fierstein as an influence to voicing Makoto.|$|E
5000|$|... "Best Friend's Brother" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{contains}} influences of teen pop and dance-pop. The song runs through a dance-oriented beat and features a rougher sound {{than the previous}} single, [...] "Beggin' on Your Knees". The theme of this song is center around exploring emotions and managing friendships. The lyrics are about a girl who has a crush on her best friend's older brother, {{and even though the}} girl wants to pursue a relationship with him, she doesn't want to jeopardize her friendship with her best friend. While being interviewed by Neha Gandhi for Seventeen Magazine, Justice discussed the background story for the song: When I was around 14 years old, in 8th grade, I had this crush on my best friend’s brother. He was two years older than me. It {{was one of those things}} where I would go over her house and we would all play Halo 2 together and go swimming in the pool and stuff. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> had little crushes on each other, but it never went anywhere. If it had, it would have been really weird. I wouldn’t have been willing to risk my friendship for dating her brother. Friendship is always more important.|$|E
5000|$|Gladir went on {{to write}} stories for several Archie Comics titles, {{including}} Archie's Pal Jughead, Reggie and Me, Betty and Me, and, primarily Archie's Girls Betty and Veronica. In Archie's Madhouse (the logo sometimes given as Archie's Mad House) #22 (Oct. 1962), the character Sabrina the Teenage Witch, by Gladir and DeCarlo, debuted in the humor anthology's lead story (the logo then spelled [...] "Teen-Age"). She would eventually {{become one of the}} publisher's major characters, appearing in an animated series and a television sitcom. Gladir recalled in 2007, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> envisioned it as a one-shot and were surprised when fans asked for more. We continued to do Sabrina stories off and on in Mad House until 1969 when we were flabbergasted to hear it was to become an animated series. When it came to naming Sabrina I decided to name her after a woman I recalled from my junior high school days ... who was very active in school affairs, and who assigned a number of us to interview prominent people in the media. In addition, the woman's name had a New England ring to it. Some years later I recalled the woman's name was not Sabrina, but actually Sabra Holbrook.|$|E
6000|$|With the quickness of David at the switch, I {{slipped a}} {{blotting-pad}} over the dedication, and then, [...] "Pray be seated," [...] I said coldly, but she remained standing, {{all in a}} twitter and very much afraid of me, and I know that her hands were pressed together within the muff. Had there been any dignified means of escape, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> would <b>both</b> have taken it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you must}} excuse {{yourself}} {{and he must}} go alone. That will be easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> are <b>both</b> ready for our suppers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must hope so, Tom. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have <b>both</b> done, <b>I</b> won't say our best, but as well {{as could}} be {{expected}} in so rough a life.
