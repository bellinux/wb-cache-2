In this paper, the working principles of two types spark gap switch (Fig. 1) were analyzed. Four aspects of the performance parameter including switching delay, delay jitter, voltage-drop percentage and transmission efficiency of the trigger switches (see Table 1) were researched by test and measurement. Experimental results show that: in normal condition, {{with the increase of}} charging voltage, switching <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> <b>td</b> and <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> jitter for both spark gap switches will decrease.

40|$|The myofascial pain {{syndrome}} (MPS) {{is considered}} the most common musculoskeletal condition. The lumbopelvic pain (LPP) is established {{as one of the}} most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders. Nevertheless, previous research has not yet studied the contractibility changes by tensiomyography between myofascial trigger point (MTrP) types and normal tissue. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the tensiomyography, sonoelastography, and pressure pain threshold (PPT) differences between the palpation area of active and latent MTrPs with regards to control points in the lumbar erector spinae muscles of subjects with LPP. A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed. A convenience sample of 60 points (20 active MTrPs, 20 latent MTrPs, and 20 control points) was registered bilaterally in the lumbar erector spinae muscles from subjects with nonspecific LPP. The palpation order of active MTrPs, latent MTrPs, or control points was randomized for each side. The outcome assessors were blinded to the order or point type. The outcome measurements order for each point was sonoelastography manual strain index, tensiomyography, and PPT, separated by 15 minutes. Five contractile objective parameters were: maximal radial displacement (Dm), contraction time (Tc), sustain <b>time</b> (<b>Ts),</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> (<b>Td),</b> and half-relaxation time (Tr). Tensiomyography parameters did not show any statistically significant difference (P >  0. 05) between active MTrPs, latent MTrPs, and control points. Nevertheless, PPT and sonoelastography showed statistically significant differences (P <  0. 05) between all point types, except for active and latent MTrPs PPT comparison (P =  0. 091). Regarding the active MTrPs, a moderate positive correlation was observed between PPT and Dm (P =  0. 047; τB =  0. 450). Considering the control points, a moderate positive correlation was shown between sonoelastography and Td (P =  0. 044; τB =  0. 328). The tensiomyography contractile properties did not seem to show differences, while the sonoelastography and mechanosensitivity presented a higher stiffness and a lower PPT, respectively, between the palpation area of active and latent MTrPs with regards to control points in the lumbar erector spinae muscles of subjects with LPP. Considering the correlations, further research is needed regarding the muscle contractile properties modifications under MPS treatments, especially Dm in active MTrPs and Td in normal sites.

Ruminal pH and saliva cortisol concentrations were measured at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h postfeeding on d 3 and 17 of each experimental period. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites were measured on d 17. Increasing length of delay in daily feed delivery time resulted in a quadratic response in concentrate DMI (low in T 1 and T 2; P = 0. 002), whereas straw DMI was greatest in T 1 and T 3 (cubic P = 0. 03). Treatments affected the distribution of DMI within the day with a linear decrease observed between 0800 and 1200 h but a linear increase during nighttimes (2000 to 0800 <b>h),</b> whereas <b>T</b> 1 and T 2 had reduced DMI between 1200 and 1600 h (quadratic P = 0. 04). Water consumption (L/d) was not affected but decreased linearly when expressed as liters per kilogram of DMI (P = 0. 01). Meal length was greatest and eating rate slowest in T 1 and T 2 (quadratic P <= 0. 001). Size of the first meal after feed delivery was reduced in T 1 on d 1 (cubic P = 0. 05) and decreased linearly on d 2 (P = 0. 01) after change. Concentrate eating and drinking time (shortest in T 1) and straw eating time (longest in T 1) followed a cubic trend (P = 0. 02).

We find that the anomalous Wtb and tth couplings can enhance the cross sections significantly. We also analyze a few signatures and show that, if these couplings are indeed anomalous, then with enough data, one should be able to observe the production of the Higgs boson in association with single top quark.

40|$|The genome {{structures}} of about 100 interserotypic ts recombinants produced in crosses between human adenovirus type 2 (H 2) and 5 (H 5) temperature-sensitive mutants {{were analyzed by}} cleavage with restriction endonucleases to determine the map coordinates of the following temperature-sensitive mutants: penton base plus fiber-defective <b>H</b> 2 <b>ts</b> 103, - 104, and - 136, assembly-defective <b>H</b> 2 <b>ts</b> 112, fiber-defective <b>H</b> 2 <b>ts</b> 125, hexon-defective <b>H</b> 2 <b>ts</b> 118 and - 121, and DNA-negative <b>H</b> 2 <b>ts</b> 111. <b>H</b> 5 <b>ts</b> 1 (100 K defective), <b>H</b> 5 <b>ts</b> 36 (DNA negative), <b>H</b> 5 <b>ts</b> 125 (mutated in the early 72, 000 -dalton protein), <b>H</b> 5 <b>ts</b> 22 (fiber defective), <b>H</b> 5 <b>ts</b> 58 (IIIa defective), and <b>H</b> 5 <b>ts</b> 18 and - 19 were used {{as one of the}} parents.
