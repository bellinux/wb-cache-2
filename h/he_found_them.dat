5|$|Filming {{began in}} Wilmington, North Carolina on May 23, 2012 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios, with the working title Caged Heat. Cinematographer John Toll opted {{to for the}} first time in his career work with digital cameras, as <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> more {{convenient}} for a visual effects-heavy production. Toll shot the film primarily on the Arri Alexa camera. From June 4 through June 6, 2012, filming took place in Cary, North Carolina at the Epic Games headquarters and SAS Institute, with a large Christmas tree set up on the front lawn. A scene was also shot at the Wilmington International Airport. The Port of Wilmington served as a location for the oil tanker in the climactic battle, along with a soundstage recreation of the dock. The crumbling house itself was filmed in a hydraulic-powered giubo platform that could bend and split into two pieces. All the interior footage had practical effects, including debris and explosions, with computer graphics used only to add exteriors and Iron Man's armor.|$|E
5|$|In August 1941, Panzergruppe Afrika was raised, and {{the newly}} {{promoted}} General der Panzertruppe Rommel was placed in command. The Afrikakorps was handed over to Generalleutnant Ludwig Crüwell. Soon after, Mickl followed the battalions of his regiment to North Africa, arriving there in early September 1941. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> to be under-equipped, having been furnished {{with only a few}} vehicles and only two 37mm anti-tank guns per battalion. He considered that this would be sufficient for an attack on defensive positions, but completely inadequate for mobile operations. On 6 September, his regiment joined the Siege of Tobruk taking up positions at Ras el Mdauuar until the end of October, when it became part of the composite Afrika (Special Purpose) Division and prepared for an attack on the fortress. When a strong British reconnaissance force was reported far to the south, moving west from the Egyptian border at Sidi Omar, Mickl was placed in command of a kampfgruppe which was sent to meet the British. The force consisted of Mickl's regiment, along with the 361st Afrika Regiment and the 605th Panzerjäger Battalion. The Afrika Regiment had only just arrived in theatre, and had no heavy weapons, insufficient ammunition and almost no vehicles.|$|E

60|$|Again, that night, {{as the two}} sat {{before their}} camp fire, Tarzan played with his shining baubles. Werper asked him what they were and where <b>he</b> had <b>found</b> <b>them.</b> The ape-man replied that they were gay-colored stones, with which he purposed {{fashioning}} a necklace, and that <b>he</b> had <b>found</b> <b>them</b> far beneath the sacrificial court of {{the temple of the}} Flaming God.|$|R

When not performing, he would usually have a few dogs waiting for him at home as well.|$|E
25|$|Heine went to England {{to avoid}} what he {{predicted}} would be {{controversy over the}} publication of this work. In London he cashed a cheque from his uncle for £200 (equal to £ today), much to Salomon's chagrin. Heine was unimpressed by the English: <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> commercial and prosaic and still blamed them for the defeat of Napoleon.|$|E

He was appalled to learn that Hadrian had adopted him. Only with reluctance did he move from his mother's house on the Caelian to Hadrian's private home.|$|E
25|$|Governor John Duckworth {{commissioned}} Buchan's expedition. Though undertaken {{for information}} gathering, this expedition ended in violence. Buchan's party encountered several Beothuk near Red Indian Lake. After an initially friendly reception, Buchan left {{two of his}} men behind with the Beothuk. The next day, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> murdered and mutilated. According to the Beothuk Shanawdithit's later account, the marines were killed when one {{refused to give up}} his jacket and both ran away.|$|E
25|$|Rogers began {{wearing his}} famous sneakers when <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> to be quieter than his work shoes {{as he moved}} about behind the set. He was also the voices of King Friday XIII and Queen Sara Saturday (named after his wife), rulers of the neighborhood, as well as X the Owl, Henrietta Pussycat, Daniel Striped Tiger, Lady Elaine Fairchilde, and Larry Horse. The show won a Sylvania Award for best children's show and was briefly {{broadcast}} nationally on NBC.|$|E

25|$|No Water {{tracked down}} Crazy Horse and Black Buffalo Woman in the Slim Buttes area. When <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> in a teepee, he called Crazy Horse's name from outside. When Crazy Horse answered, No Water stuck a pistol into the teepee and aimed for Crazy Horse. Touch the Clouds, Crazy Horse's first cousin {{and son of}} Lone Horn, {{was sitting in the}} teepee nearest the entry. He knocked the pistol upward as No Water fired, {{deflecting}} the bullet to Crazy Horse's upper jaw. No Water left, with Crazy Horse's relatives in hot pursuit. No Water ran his horse until it died and continued on foot until he reached the safety of his own village.|$|E
25|$|The sculptures {{were shipped}} from Italy {{and arrived at}} the Indiana State House on September 1, 1888. When General Benjamin Harrison {{inspected}} the pieces on September 12 of the same year, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> still stored in their original shipping containers. The statues remained in these boxes until their installation, which took place between September 17 and 20 of 1888. As the entire set was intended {{from the beginning of}} the State House building project to be placed within the State House Rotunda, they have remained in their original positions since their installation. History and Liberty are located in the Northwest side of the Rotunda, while Art and Law are located in the Northeast. Justice and Commerce occupy the Southwest side of the Rotunda, and Agriculture and Oratory occupy the Southeast.|$|E
25|$|Almeida sailed with Kemp in late November 1814 from Wilmington, North Carolina, to make {{a cruise}} to the West Indies. On December 1, in the Gulf Stream, the ship chased a convoy of eight British {{merchant}} ships protected by a frigate, which in turn launched {{in pursuit of the}} privateer. At night, the Kemp was able to lose the pursuit and {{on the morning of the}} next day turned on the merchantmen again. At noon on December 3 <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> lined up in battle formation; at 14:00 hours he launched an attack, unleashing his artillery on both sides, then attacking other ships. After an hour and a half, they all had surrendered. The Kemp lacked enough men to operate all the ships so they selected four, and left the rest to continue.|$|E
60|$|Ralph at once set to work, {{and inside}} of five minutes {{he was ready}} to {{accompany}} the two men. <b>He</b> had <b>found</b> <b>them</b> quite agreeable on the trip and never for an instant did he dream of the foul plot that they were expecting to carry out.|$|R

25|$|Alma-Tadema was a perfectionist. He worked assiduously to {{make the}} most of his paintings, often {{repeatedly}} reworking parts of paintings before <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> satisfactory to his own high standards. One humorous story relates that one of his paintings was rejected and instead of keeping it, he gave the canvas to a maid who used it as her table cover. He was sensitive to every detail and architectural line of his paintings, as well as the settings he was depicting. For many of the objects in his paintings, he would depict what was in front of him, using fresh flowers imported from across the continent and even from Africa, rushing to finish the paintings before the flowers died. It was this commitment to veracity that earned him recognition but also caused many of his adversaries to take up arms against his almost encyclopaedic works.|$|E
25|$|MacKenzie took {{a radically}} {{different}} approach and was criticised for producing severely down-market programming. MacKenzie introduced features such as nightly editions of 'Topless Darts' (featuring topless women playing darts on a beach), 'The Weather in Norwegian' (with a young, typically blonde and bikini-clad Scandinavian woman presenting weather forecasts in both English and Norwegian), other weather forecasts featuring dwarfs bouncing on trampolines and stock exchange reports presented by Tiffany, a young female presenter who would strip to her underwear as she read out the latest share prices. A large amount of airtime was given over to tarot card readers and astrologers. L!VE TV's best known character was the News Bunny, a man dressed as a giant rabbit who popped up during news broadcasts to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to the various news stories to indicate whether or not <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> interesting or exciting.|$|E
25|$|On December 13, Shackelford {{was near}} Bean's Station on the Holston River. Longstreet {{decided to go}} back and capture Bean's Station. Three Confederate columns and {{artillery}} approached Bean's Station to catch the Federals in a vise. By 2:00a.m. on December 14, one column was skirmishing with Union pickets. The pickets held out as best they could and warned Shackelford of the Confederate presence. He deployed his force for an assault. Soon, the battle started and continued throughout most of the day. Confederate flanking attacks and other assaults occurred at various times and locations, but the Federals held until Southern reinforcements arrived. By nightfall, the Federals were retiring from Bean's Station through Bean's Gap and on to Blain's Cross Roads. Longstreet set out to attack the Union forces again the next morning, but as he approached them at Blain's Cross Roads, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> well-entrenched. Longstreet withdrew, and the Federals soon left the area.|$|E

500|$|Wayne G. Hammond, a Tolkien scholar, said of {{the first}} two films that <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them</b> to be [...] "travesties as adaptations... {{faithful}} only on a basic level of plot" [...] and that many characters had not been depicted faithfully to their appearance in the novel. Other critics have argued that Tolkien's characters were weakened and misinterpreted by their portrayal in the films.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most French {{armies of}} the Revolutionary period, Moreau's troops in late 1800 enjoyed a well-organized supply service. Though {{the onset of}} winter {{lengthened}} the army sick list, the months-long truce allowed many units to approach their full strength. Many French officers were confident of success. [...] Moreau planned a broad-front advance eastward to the Inn, fighting any enemies as <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>them.</b> He would lead with his left to allow Lecourbe's Right Wing to advance unmolested, since it had a greater distance to cover. Once the French wings closed up to the Inn River, his troops would look for crossing sites.|$|E

Guitarist Graham Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates; James for his playboy lifestyle and Albarn for his control over Blur's musical direction and public image. In February 1996, when Coxon and James were absent for a lip-synced Blur performance broadcast on Italian television, they were replaced by a cardboard cutout and a roadie, respectively. Blur biographer Stuart Maconie later wrote that, at the time, [...] "Blur were sewn together very awkwardly." ...|$|E
