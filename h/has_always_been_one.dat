5|$|During this time, the Flames {{found it}} {{increasingly}} difficult to retain their best players as salaries escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value against the American dollar. Calgary <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the smallest markets in the league (it is currently third-smallest, behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg) and the NHL's small-market Canadian teams found {{it increasingly difficult}} to compete in the new environment. In 1999, for example, the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season. The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season, and the Flames did not want to risk losing him without getting anything in return.|$|E
5|$|Leslie is {{approached}} by scouts looking for potential candidates for elected office, which <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of her dreams. Impressed by {{the memorial service}} and the harvest festival Leslie previously organized, they believe {{she would be a}} good candidate for upcoming city council seats, or possibly the mayoral position. With the expected increased media attention on her personal life, the scouts ask whether Leslie has any secret scandals in her life. She denies any such scandals exist, thus omitting her secret relationship with Ben, and the scouts promise to contact her about preparing an electoral run.|$|E

25|$|When I first {{played for}} South Australia, I did all right. Then I got injured {{right at the}} start of the second season – I broke my nose and cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged my {{shoulder}} as well. I couldn't throw very well. Fielding <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of my main skills and I lost confidence in the fielding. I wasn't getting any runs, I wasn't bowling much in those days, and I wasn't fielding terribly well either. I ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. I still couldn't get runs in South Australia the following season but I'd go to England and get runs. I got dropped from the South Australian team.|$|E

25|$|Bund also {{states that}} nothing {{that had taken}} place in the war {{produced}} more controversy than the way in which Rupert treated Birmingham, and that it was certainly harsh, but by the laws of war as understood on the Continent, in the school in which Rupert had been brought up, there was nothing illegal or improper in it. If the owners of a house allowed firing from that house on the soldiers of the other side, the soldiers fired on were justified in destroying that house. Burning <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the recognised means of destruction. Bund says that if Birmingham had been a Continental town nothing would ever have been heard of it; but because the Continental laws of war were applied to an English town the outcry was terrible.|$|E
25|$|Following its {{purchase}} of WJZY in Charlotte, North Carolina in March 2013, Variety reported that Fox Television Stations was pursuing station acquisitions in San Francisco and Seattle as it desired {{to have a}} larger presence in the markets of NFL teams {{that are part of}} the National Football Conference (such as the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks), the conference to which Fox holds broadcast rights. Fox had for many years wanted to have an owned-and-operated station in the San Francisco Bay Area, which <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the ten largest Nielsen television markets. After Fox Television Stations assumed ownership of charter affiliate WTXF-TV in Philadelphia in 1995, KTVU became the largest Fox station by market size not to be owned by the network. Fox's original parent company News Corporation (which spun off the network to 21st Century Fox in July 2013 as part of the company's separation of its entertainment and publishing assets) made several offers to buy KTVU, but Cox turned down each of News Corporation's proposals (Fox had also reportedly considered purchasing KTVU's CBS-affiliated sister station in Seattle, KIRO-TV, which would have displaced that market's charter Fox affiliate, KCPQ; such a purchase never materialized, although Fox did attempt to buy KCPQ outright before renewing its affiliation contract with that station in July 2014, after it was unsuccessful in pressuring Tribune Broadcasting to sell KCPQ by purchasing and proposing to move its programming to Bellingham, Washington-based KBCB).|$|E

[...] Writing in The National, author Saeed Saeed named it [...] "the most scandalous Madonna track this decade," [...] declaring that [...] "he brooding bass-filled verse gives way to a poptastic chorus that uses hedonistic sound effects harking back to her 1990 'Justify My Love.'" [...] Bradley Stern of MuuMuse also {{found it to be}} [...] "the most shocking moment of sexploitation," [...] declaring: [...] "blasphemy has truly never tasted sweeter." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Andy Gill noted that the song [...] "manages to be sacrilegious and ear-burningly naughty." [...] While reviewing Rebel Heart in Time Out, Nick Levine called it [...] "a brilliantly ridiculous hymn to cunnilingus," [...] where Madonna manages to [...] "alternate between showing off, getting off and taking stock." [...] Amy Pettifer of The Quietus praised the track for being [...] "rich with Nicki vibes, without Nicki actually making a second appearance," [...] claiming: [...] "Sex <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of M's favourite subjects, particularly when it's hand in daring hand with religion; here she performs a kind of erotic baptism while a Moroder-esque bass underscores her sermon.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide called the episode [...] "A thoroughly enjoyable romp through what happens when a bunch of lads go for a Sunday out at the ball game." [...] They enjoyed the guest-stars, writing [...] "both Dolly Parton and, bizarrely, Rupert Murdoch – spice things up nicely", however they were most fond of Fred Willard as Wally Kogen. [...] "A shame he doesn't join our regulars", they wrote. James Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode is [...] "funny," [...] and Ian Jane of DVD Talk found the episode [...] "amusing". The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the third best episode of the show with a sports theme. Phillip Stephenson of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the episode [...] "classic", and Susan Dunne of The Hartford Courant described it as [...] "debauched but hilarious".
