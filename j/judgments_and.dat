40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{gender differences in}} cognitive distortions, moral <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> empathy in children, aged nine to thirteen years. Subsequently, the relationship was investigated of cognitive distortions, moral <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> empathy with externalizing problem behaviour. It was hypothesized {{that the relationship between}} moral <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> antisocial behavior is mediated by cognitive distortions. The study involved a total of 92 participants from two regular elementary schools. First, the results show that there are no gender differences in cognitive distortions, moral <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> empathy. As expected, a positive correlation between cognitive distortions and externalizing problem behaviour, and a negative correlation between moral <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> externalizing problem behaviour was found. However, no relationship was found between empathy and externalizing problem behaviour. Mediation analysis showed that the relationship between moral <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> externalizing problem behaviour was explained by cognitive distortions. The conclusion from this study is that cognitive distortions are an important predictor of externalizing problem behaviour. Perhaps these results can lead to developing a program for children with externalizing problems that reduces the prevalence of cognitive distortions...|$|R

These included concerns about miners' <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> decisionmaking skills under the stress of a mine escape and miners' familiarity with escape procedures. In response, researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) sought to learn how mines are incorporating <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> decisionmaking skills into mine escape training. They took an in-depth look at previous research on <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> decisionmaking in self-rescue and escape training. They also conducted interviews with safety and training personnel from six underground coal operations to understand how mine operators are conducting mandatory quarterly escape training.

40|$|Multicultural {{experience}} {{is considered to}} be beneficial, but it remains a difficult construct to measure. We tested the validity of a new assessment tool, the Multicultural Experiences Questionnaire (MEQ), using an undergraduate sample (N � 164), and examined the relation of multicultural experience to moral <b>judgment,</b> closedmindedness, growth, <b>and</b> fixed mindsets. We expected that greater multicultural experience would be related to lower levels of closed-mindedness and higher levels of moral <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> growth mindsets. Higher MEQ scores were correlated with decreased closed-mindedness <b>and</b> higher moral <b>judgment</b> scores. In regression analyses, controlling for age and sex, higher MEQ scores positively predicted participant scores on postconventional moral <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> growth mindsets, but negatively predicted use of less developed moral <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> fixed mindsets. Overall, these results support the validity of the MEQ and suggest that multicultural experiences are positively linked to measures of moral <b>judgment</b> <b>and</b> growth mindsets...|$|R
