40|$|In this note, {{we provide}} a {{classification}} of Dantzig-Wolfe reformulations for Binary Mixed Integer Programming Problems. We specifically focus on modeling the binary {{conditions in the}} convexification approach to the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. For a general Binary Mixed Integer Programming problem, an extreme point of the overall problem does not necessarily correspond to an extreme point of the subproblem. Therefore, the binary conditions cannot in general be imposed on the new master problem variables but must be imposed on the original binary variables. In some cases, however, {{it is possible to}} impose the binary restrictions directly on the new master problem variables. The issue of imposing binary conditions on the original variables versus the master problem variables has not been discussed systematically for MIP problems in general in the literature and most of the research has been focused on the pure binary case. The classification indicates <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>cases</b> <b>you</b> can, and cannot, impose binary conditions on the new master problem variables.

50|$|MCSs are {{items of}} {{software}} worth noting - they control user sessions and provide {{keeping track of}} user state without having to run per-user processes since a single MCS stack can be shared by many users. Load balancing can also be achieved at the MCS level. For example, saying {{that you want to}} handle 30 users per stack, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>case</b> if <b>you</b> have 31 to 60 users, you have two stacks, 61 to 90 users, three stacks, etc. This gives B5000 machines a great performance advantage in a server since you don't need to start up another user process and thus create a new stack each time a user attaches to the system. Thus you can efficiently service users (whether they require state or not) with MCSs. MCSs also provide the backbone of large-scale transaction processing.|$|R

40|$|The {{harmful effects}} of {{cannabis}} use and possible neuropsychological impairment associated with its use are a contentious topic of debate in both research and public health,as is thefact that cannabis use has been repeatedly {{shown to be a}} risk factor for the development of psychosis. Surprisingly, three different meta-analyses on cognition and cannabis, among schizophrenic patients, found better cognitive performance in patients with a lifetime use of cannabis (Potvin, Joyal, Pelletier, & Stip, 2008; Rabin, Zakzanis, & George, 2011; Yücel et al., 2012). This counterintuitive finding, coupled with the fact that most psychotic patients suffer from cognitive impairment (Reichenberg et al., 2009) {{make it more difficult to}} understand the relationship between these two risk factors. Two different explanations have been advanced for this counterintuitive finding: a) a “premorbid-driven hypothesis” and b) a “neuroprotective-derived hypothesis”. The latter explanation has gained greater support from the evidence that the CBD component has been useful as part of the treatment in several neurological disorders. Cognition has been established as a predictor of real world community functioning in schizophrenia. However, studies on the relationship between cannabis use and neurocognitive functioning <b>in</b> psychosis, <b>which</b> have controlled for the potential bias of premorbid functioning, are rarely represented in this context and often inconclusive. The main objective of the work presented in this Thesis was to explore this association in an epidemiologically-derived case-control study in a sample derivedfrom TheEuropean Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) in order to test the first of these two hypotheses, with the aim of exploring IQ and premorbid conditions and how they are related to cannabis use in patients at their first episode of psychosis (FEP), by comparing those cannabis using patients to non-users and to their respective healthy controls. The final aim of this work was to identify the relationship between IQ, premorbid social and academic adjustment with cannabis use in psychotic patients, compared to healthy controls, in order to be able to explain <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>cases</b> <b>you</b> can expect a better IQ and a better premorbid adjustment and why, by clustering the sample, first according to cannabis use and, secondly, to frequency of cannabis use. I hypothesize the existence of a subgroup of patients with a recreational use of cannabis, who are less cognitively impaired at the onset and less socially withdrawn in the premorbid period than other patients. The final sample of the present study included 1, 895 subjects (834 cases and 1, 061 controls), with complete information about cannabis use (CEQ) and premorbid adjustment (PAS) at least. 1, 739 subjects in total had also complete information on their IQ (derived from WAIS-short version). The study confirmed that patients who used cannabis in their lifetime with a recreational pattern of cannabis use have higher IQ scores and a better and more stable premorbid adjustment than other patients. The study also suggested that the better premorbid social adjustment of patients with cannabis-use might be responsible for the contact with the substance and that cannabis use increased the risk of psychosis in a subgroup of patients with less neurodevelopmental vulnerability. Taken together, these results are able to rule out the alternative explanation of a neuroprotective role of cannabis use on cognition, in favour of the hypothesis of a complex relationship between premorbid predisposition and different pattern of cannabis use in determining this paradoxical result...|$|R
