5000|$|Section 13 {{originally}} set the state's usury limit at 10%; it was amended in {{the early}} 1980s to 5% above the <b>Federal</b> Reserve <b>Discount</b> <b>Rate</b> on 90-day commercial paper (see the latest rates), but falling interest rates and poorly worded provisions made the amended version more onerous than the original.

Also, other language in the amendment applying the usury limit [...] "at {{the time of the}} contract" [...] made floating-rate loans extremely difficult, even though the usury limit was a floating rate. Neither the original nor amended provisions allowed the legislature to make any exceptions to the general usury law, as happened in other states.

40|$|For many years, the <b>Federal</b> Reserve's <b>discount</b> window {{has played}} an {{important}} role in monetary policy. Discount window borrowing helps individual depository institutions manage their reserve accounts in the presence of unexpected deposit and payments flows. Improved reserve management, in turn, helps stabilize the overnight federal funds market by reducing the volatility of short-term interest rates. Moreover, announced changes in the <b>Federal</b> Reserve's <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> have often signaled important shifts in the stance of monetary policy and have frequently been associated with large changes in market interest rates, exchange rates, and asset prices. > In the 1990 s, however, fewer and fewer institutions have relied on the window to meet short-term credit needs. Consequently, the usefulness of the discount window in smoothing reserve imbalances and stabilizing interest rates may have been reduced. In addition, changes in monetary policy operating procedures and the formal announcement of monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve may have reduced the effectiveness of <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> changes in influencing market interest rates and asset prices. > Hakkio and Sellon analyze the changing role of the discount window in monetary policy and examine the case for discount window reform. One alternative to the traditional discount window is a "Lombard-type" lending facility in which depository institutions can borrow more freely than under the current system but at a higher rate. While there appear to be good arguments in favor of modernizing the discount mechanism, a number of conceptual and practical issues must be addressed before implementing a Lombard-type lending facility. An additional consideration, going forward, is the projected reduction in the supply of Treasury debt over the next few years. A shrinking supply of Treasury securities could complicate the use of open market operations in providing reserves to the banking system and require the Federal Reserve to place greater emphasis on the discount window. Consequently, any redesign of the discount window would need to address this issue. Discount window; Discount; Monetary policy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Venture capitalists {{typically}} use <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> in {{the range}} of 30 - 70 percent. During the startup stage of venture-capital financing, <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> between 50 and 70 percent are common. The <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> decreases from the first through fourth stage: from 60 to 30 percent. These rates of return are high compared to historical returns on common stocks or small stocks (12. 1 and 17. 8 percent, respectively). Such high <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> cannot also be explained in the context of any existing asset pricing theory; that is, any reasonable risk-adjusted <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are not consistent with <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> in the order of 30 - 60 percent. The paper provides a rational economic explanation why venture capitalists (VC) use such high <b>discount</b> <b>rates.</b> The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Let the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> of a venture project be 15 percent; this <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> depends on the systematic risk of the cash flows from the project given that the project is successful. Using the procedure, a VC who estimates the probability of eventual success of the project between 60 and 40 percent will impose a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> between 42 and 74 percent. These <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are quite similar to the <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> charged by VC in their startup and first stages. Findings – The high rates of return charged by VC reflect the fact that not all their projects succeed in that they have no net cash-inflows.

40|$|Background: In {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis, <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> {{are used}} in calculating the value of future costs and benefits. However, standard <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> may not accurately describe the decision-making of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). These patients often choose the long-term risks of immunosuppressive therapy over the short-term risks of colectomy, demonstrating very high <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> for future health. In this study we aimed to measure the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in UC patients and identify variables associated with the <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Methods: We surveyed patients with UC and patients who were postcolectomy for UC to measure their valuations of UC and colectomy health states. We used Standard Gamble (SG) and Time-Trade-Off (TTO) methods to assess current and future health state valuations and calculated the <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Results: Participants included 150 subjects with UC and 150 subjects who were postcolectomy for UC. Adjusted <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> varied widely (0 %– 100 %), with an overall median rate of 55. 0 % (interquartile range [IQR] 20. 6 – 100), which {{was significantly higher than}} the standard rate of 5 %.
