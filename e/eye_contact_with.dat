5|$|The {{transport}} is {{intercepted by}} Clu's warship; as a diversion, Quorra allows {{herself to be}} captured by Rinzler, whom Flynn recognizes as Tron, reprogrammed by Clu. Sam reclaims Flynn's disc and rescues Quorra, while Flynn takes control of a Light Fighter on the flight deck. Clu, Rinzler, and several guards pursue the trio in Light Jets. Upon making <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Flynn, Rinzler remembers his past and deliberately collides with Clu's Light Jet, but Clu uses Tron's spare baton to escape while Tron falls into the Sea of Simulation below. Clu confronts the others at the I/O portal, where Flynn reintegrates with his digital duplicate, destroying Clu along with himself. Quorra, having switched discs with Flynn, gives Flynn's disc to Sam and they escape together to the real world. In Flynn's arcade, Sam backs up and deactivates the system. He then finds a waiting Bradley and tells him he plans to retake control of ENCOM, naming Bradley chairman of the board. He departs on his motorcycle with Quorra, and she witnesses her first real sunrise.|$|E

25|$|Bipolar disorder, {{previously}} {{known as}} manic depression, is a mental disorder that causes periods {{of depression and}} periods of elevated mood. The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 3040 percent. Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated.|$|E
25|$|Ana {{goes on a}} {{date with}} Christian, on which he takes her in his helicopter, Charlie Tango, to his apartment. Once there, Christian insists that she sign a {{non-disclosure}} agreement forbidding her from discussing anything they do together, which Ana agrees to sign. He also mentions other paperwork, but first takes her to his playroom full of BDSM toys and gear. There, Christian informs her that the second contract will be one of dominance and submission, {{and there will be no}} romantic relationship, only a sexual one. The contract even forbids Ana from touching Christian or making <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> him. At this point, Christian realises that Ana is a virgin and agrees to take her virginity without making her sign the contract. The two then have sex. The following morning, Ana and Christian again have sex. His mother arrives moments after their sexual encounter and is surprised by the meeting, having previously thought Christian was homosexual, because he was never seen with a woman. Christian later takes Ana out to eat, and he reveals that he lost his virginity at age 15 to one of his mother's friends, Elena Lincoln, and that his previous dominant/submissive relationships failed due to incompatibility. Christian also reveals that in his first dominant/submissive relationship he was the submissive. Christian and Ana plan to meet again, and he takes Ana home, where she discovers several job offers and admits to Kate that she and Christian had sex.|$|E

25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

40|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>contact</b> {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in social interaction. Atypical <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> is a diagnostic and widely reported feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Using continuous flash suppression (CFS), we found that typically devel-oping (TD) adolescents detected faces with a direct gaze faster than faces with an averted gaze, indicating enhanced unconscious processing of <b>eye</b> <b>contact.</b> Critically, adolescents <b>with</b> ASD did not show different durations of perceptual suppression for faces with direct and averted gaze, suggesting that preferential unconscious processing of <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> is absent in this group. In contrast, in a non-CFS control experiment, both adolescents with ASD and TD adolescents detected faces with a direct gaze faster than those with an averted gaze. Another CFS experiment confirmed that unconscious processing of non-social stimuli is intact for adolescents with ASD. These results suggest that atypical processing of <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> in individuals <b>with</b> ASD could be related to a weaker initial, unconscious registration of ey...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{previously}} hypothesised {{that the}} early development of psychopathy {{is associated with a}} failure to attend to the eyes of attachment figures, and we have presented preliminary data from a parent–child ‘love’ scenario in support of this. Here, we confirm the association in a larger sample and test mechanisms of impaired <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> during expressions of love in control and behaviourally disturbed children. Methods: Oppositional defiant disorder children, assessed for callous-unemotional (CU) traits, and controls, were observed in a brief interaction task where the mother was asked to show love to her child. <b>Eye</b> <b>contact</b> and affection were measured for each dyad. Results: As predicted, there were no group differences in affection and <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> expressed by mothers; levels of CU traits predicted low levels of <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> towards their mothers across all groups of children. As expected, low <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> was correlated <b>with</b> psychopathic fearlessness in their fathers, and maternal reports of negative feelings towards the child. Independent observations showed that child’s behaviour largely drives the low <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> associated <b>with</b> CU traits, and low <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> was not associated with independent observations of the quality of attachment-related behaviours in mothers. Conclusions: Impaired <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> is a unique characteristic of children with CU traits; these impairments are largely independent of maternal behaviour, but associated with psychopathic traits in the fathers. These impairments should be tested for functional significance and amenability to change in longitudinal and treatment studies...|$|R
40|$|Lack of <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> {{is one of}} the key {{clinical}} observations in schizophrenia. Sixteen schizophrenic patients and sixteen control subjects participated in our study of eye gazing. Frequencies of <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> of both groups were measured in a role-play test which is closer to a natural environment. Autistic traits of both groups were measured using the Autism Quotient Questionnaire. We hypothesized that patients’ frequencies of <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> were fewer than control subjects. We anticipated that patient group would score high in AQ. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between frequency of <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> and cognitive functioning and symptomatology. Lastly, the study also examined the relationship between frequency of <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> and autistic traits. Result showed that patients’ <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> were significantly fewer than control group. Patients’ overall cognitive functioning was not as good as control group. In addition, schizophrenic patients scored significantly higher than control group in the Autism Quotient Questionnaire; autistic traits were found in schizophrenia patients. There was no relationship between frequency of <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> and cognitive functioning. Nonetheless, negative correlation was found between frequency of <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> and Digital symbol. More <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> was associated <b>with</b> lower Digital symbol score.

40|$|Children with autistic {{disorder}} (AD) display atypical <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> {{and struggle}} <b>with</b> the social imitation of <b>eye</b> <b>contact.</b> Impaired social imitation may {{be indicative of}} disruptions in motor learning processes. The application of specific motor learning principles, such as external feedback, may suggest which variables will result in positive change in <b>eye</b> <b>contact.</b> The study aimed {{to determine the effects}} of knowledge of performance (KP) and knowledge of results (KR) as types of feedback on the frequency and duration of elicited and spontaneous <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> in children <b>with</b> AD. A two-phase multiple-probe, multi-treatment (cross-over), singleparticipant design with a withdrawal component was used. Mixed treatment effects were obtained. Overall effects suggest that KR results in the greatest positive change over a short period of time regarding frequency and duration for both elicited and spontaneous <b>eye</b> <b>contact.</b> This type of feedback seems to be the most effective for spontaneous <b>eye</b> <b>contact.</b> The provision of KP, after elicited and spontaneous <b>eye</b> <b>contact,</b> produced positive effects for duration only. The current Phase 1 evidence suggests that KR (which is goal-directed with fewer additional instructions) may be more beneficial to children with AD. These findings are in accordance with the limb motor learning literature and may therefore support preliminary evidence for disrupted motor learning during <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> imitation in children with AD...|$|R
