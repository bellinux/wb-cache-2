The natural (internal) variability is estimated using 6, 000 -year of pre-industrial control simulations. With the exception of winter, the increases in annual and seasonal q over this region are very unlikely (with less than 1 % chance) due to natural (internal) variability or natural forcing alone. Using several climate models and ensemble means, we demonstrate that the large-scale component (spatial-mean trend) of the anthropogenic forcing is detectable (at 1 % level) in the annual and seasonal trends of q (except winter). However, the smaller-scale component (spatial anomalies about the mean trend) of the anthropogenic signal is detectable only in warm seasons (spring and summer). We further show that the spread of projected trends based on the A 1 B scenario derived from 13 CMIP 3 models encompasses the observed area-averaged trend in q.

40|$|As part of {{the genus}} Rhododendron, azalea {{is well known for}} its {{luxuriant}} flowering. High-quality flowering is essential and {{is considered to be a}} homogeneous bud burst in the <b>forcing</b> <b>greenhouse</b> and a continuous development to fully open flowers at indoor conditions. Growers continuously strive to improve the quality of their products and a simple question arose: “Why do azalea flowers not always open at indoor conditions?” We tried to answer this question by an in-depth physiological approach of the complex flowering process. In a first part, we focused on the effects of altered production processes on flower differentiation and flower bud dormancy. The increased use of plant growth regulators (chlormequat, paclobutrazol) did not affect flower differentiation, but increased the need for cold to break flower bud dormancy. Overall, large genotypic variations were found. In the second part of this research, carbohydrate metabolism and source-sink relationships were investigated. Based on photosynthesis measurements and forcing experiments, we defined the minimal light level needed to force azalea. The reasons for the two main problems with flower quality (non-homogeneous flowering and the arrest of flower development at indoor conditions) have been identified and can be prevented by correct production techniques. First, flower homogeneity is influenced by the amount of cold which plants receive during the dormancy period. Unfulfilled cold requirements will lead to non-homogeneous flowering. Second, the arrest of flower opening at indoor conditions is due to insufficient leaf starch reserves. Forcing plants to flower with the appropriate amount of supplemental light will prevent this problem by building-up reserves before sale...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we assess the role of {{anthropogenic}} <b>forcing</b> (<b>greenhouse</b> gases and sulphate aerosols, GS) in recently observed precipitation trends over the Mediterranean region. We investigate whether the observed precipitation trends (1966 - 2005 and 1979 - 2008) are consistent with what 22 models project as response of precipitation to GS forcing. Significance is estimated using 9, 000 -year control runs derived from the CMIP 3 archive. The results indicate that externally forced changes are detectable in observed precipitation trends in winter, late summer and in autumn. Natural internal climate variability cannot explain these changes. However, the observed trends (derived from 3 sources) are markedly inconsistent with expected changes due to GS forcing. While the influence of GS signal is detectable in winter and early spring, observed changes are several {{times larger than the}} projected response to GS forcing. The most striking inconsistency, however, is the contradiction between projected drying and the observed increase in precipitation in late summer and autumn, irrespective of the data set used. Natural (internal) variability as estimated from the models cannot account for these inconsistencies, which are already present in the large scale circulation patterns (Geopotential height at 500 hPa). The obtained results are robust to the removal of the fingerprint of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The detection of an outright sign mismatch of observed and projected trends in autumn and late summer, leads us to conclude that the recently observed trends can not be used as an illustration of plausible future expected change in the Mediterranean region.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{indicators}} that human activity may change climate conditions {{all around the}} globe through emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, aerosol particles are emitted from various natural and anthropogenic sources. One important source of aerosols arises from biomass burning, particularly in low latitudes where shifting cultivation and land degradation lead to enhanced aerosol burden. In this study the counteracting effects of greenhouse gases and aerosols on African climate are compared using climate model experiments with fully interactive aerosols from different sources. The consideration of aerosol emissions induces a remarkable decrease in short-wave solar irradiation near the surface, especially in winter and autumn in tropical West Africa and the Congo Basin where biomass burning is mainly prevailing. This directly leads to a modification of the surface energy budget with reduced sensible heat fluxes. As a consequence, temperature decreases, compensating the strong warming signal due to enhanced trace gas concentrations. While precipitation in tropical Africa is less sensitive to the greenhouse warming, it tends to decrease, if the effect of aerosols from biomass burning is taken into account. This {{is partly due to}} the local impact of enhanced aerosol burden and partly to modifications of the large-scale monsoon circulation in the lower troposphere, usually lagging behind the season with maximum aerosol emissions. In the model equilibrium experiments, the greenhouse gas impact on temperature stands out from internal variability at various time scales from daily to decadaland the same holds for precipitation under the additional aerosol <b>forcing.</b> <b>Greenhouse</b> gases and aerosols exhibit an opposite effect on daily temperature extremes, resulting in an compensation of the individual responses under the combined forcing.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{confirmation}} {{in the last}} two decades, through instrumental measurements onboard satellites, that the 2 ̆ 7 solar constant 2 ̆ 7 does, as has long been hypothesized, vary. While there is no consensus as to the best method for estimating past variations in solar output, it seems likely that over the last 500 years, the sun has {{played a role in the}} changing climate. However, there is little evidence to suggest that changes in irradiance are having a large impact on the current warming trend. ^ A complementary approach of empirical and model-based analysis is used to determine if the climate effects of an estimated change in solar irradiance were significant in the pre-industrial era and what climate patterns emerge in response to reduced solar forcing at that time. Also investigated is the modification of solar-induced climate patterns by a hitherto underrepresented forcing - changes in Earth 2 ̆ 7 s orbit - and how solar and orbital forcing compare to that of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. Finally a brief analysis of the effects of a Maunder Minimum-like solar irradiance on a climate forced by doubled CO 2 is undertaken. ^ Clear evidence is established herein for the ability of relatively small changes in solar irradiance to impact the global climate. Both at the century scale and at shorter periodicities, the variability of the solar 2 ̆ 7 constant 2 ̆ 7 is influential in defining the global mean climate and more importantly, the regional characterization of that climate. Influencing the preferred mode of decadal variability, such as North Atlantic Oscillation, solar variability alters the mean climate for northern Europe and the North Atlantic region. The global response for temperature is found to be near-linear, while precipitation is more complex. Excitation of important feedbacks, such as sea-ice, plays an important role in determining the resulting pattern of response and ensures that even a much smaller forcing (solar variability) can exert a similar fingerprint to that of a larger <b>forcing</b> (<b>greenhouse</b> gases). Orbital forcing, typically excluded from model experiments for the decadal-to-centennial scale, is found to provide important modification of regional response and may be critical for determining a more accurate 2 ̆ 7 forecast 2 ̆ 7 for future climate. ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding and {{quantifying}} natural climate variability is {{a prerequisite}} to detect and attribute anthropogenic warming and to project future climate change. It is important to extend the evaluation of models used for climate projections through the pre-industrial period when natural variations were pronounced while anthropogenic influence was small. In anticipating future climate change, there are three main sources of uncertainty. 1) We {{do not know the}} future anthropogenic emissions and resulting atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols. 2) The response to greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing differs between various models, simulated regional climate changes being particularly model-dependent. 3) In addition to anthropogenic forcing, climate changes are induced by natural forcing (e. g., volcanoes and variations in solar activity) as well as by unforced internal variability in the climate system. The tools most commonly adopted for projecting future climate are coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). These numerical models provide a comprehensive three-dimensional representation of the climate system, describing the main dynamical and physical processes, their interactions and feedbacks. They can generate regional estimates of climate in response to given changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations. The four main relevant <b>forcing</b> (<b>greenhouse</b> gases, solar variability, volcanism, land-use change) have different time-dependence over long periods, so can be separated more effectively than for the shorter instrumental period. The potential role of solar variations in modulating recent climate has been debated for many decades and recent papers suggest that solar forcing may be less than previously believed. Century-scale solar irradiance variations have been proposed as cause for past climatic changes. However, recently, astronomical evidence has been used to suggest that low-frequency variability of solar irradiance might be very low, possibly restricted to the range of the observed high-frequency variability. We used a climate model to analyze past climatic responses to solar and volcanic forcing; using a solar irradiance history partially based on a recent 10 Be findings from Antarctica. Our results suggest that, while solar irradiance changes and volcanism were the dominant forcing in preindustrial times, their combined role has been changing over the past century. Although these natural forcing factors could be responsible for some modification of the decadal structure over the 20 th century, they only played a minor role in the most recent warming. Therefore, the 20 th century warming is not a reflection of a rebound from the last Little Ice Age cool period, but it is largely caused by anthropogenic forcing. A small role of solar forcing for late 20 th century climate change is additionally supported by the absence of a trend in the satellite-based irradiance record covering the past 30 years. In conclusion, our model results indicate that the range of Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions and natural forcing histories (cosmogenic isotope record as a proxy for solar forcing, and volcanic forcing) constrain the natural contribution to 20 th century warming to be + 0. 2 °C. Anthropogenic forcing must account for the difference between the small natural forcing and the observed warming in the late 20 th centur...|$|E

40|$|Human {{society has}} well defined {{metabolic}} processes {{that can be}} characterized and quantified {{in the same way}} that an ecosystem’s metabolism can be defined and understood [Fischer-Kowalski, 1998. ] The study of “industrial metabolism” is now a well-established topic, forming a key component of the emerging field of industrial ecology [Ayres and Simmonis, 1994; Fischer-Kowalski and Hüttler, 1998]. The fact that the metabolism of cities can be analyzed in a manner similar to that used for ecosystems or industries has long been recognized [Wolman, 1965. ] However, the increasingly rapid pace of urbanization and the emergence of megacities, particularly in the developing world, lends increased urgency to the study of “urban metabolism. ” A recent review by Decker et al. [2000] surveys energy and materials flow though the world’s twenty-five largest metropolitan areas. In 1995 these cities had populations estimated to range between 6. 6 and 26. 8 million people; all are expected to exceed 10 million by 2010. 	Urban metabolism, driven by the consumption of energy and materials, cannot take place without respiration. Both combustion based energy sources and the human and animal populations of cities consume atmospheric oxygen and expire carbon dioxide as well as a range of other trace gases and small particles. While the detail content of these urban emissions are generally not well known, there is no doubt that they are large and varied [Decker et al., 2000. ] There is growing recognition that airborne emissions from major urban and industrial areas influence both air quality and climate change on scales ranging from regional up to continental and global. Urban/industrial emissions from the developed world, and increasingly from the megacities of the developing world change the chemical content of the downwind troposphere in a number of fundamental ways. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), CO and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) drive the formation of photochemical smog and its associated oxidants, degrading air quality and threatening both human and ecosystem health. On a larger scale, these same emissions drive the production of ozone (a powerful greenhouse gas) in the free troposphere, contributing significantly to global warming. Urban and industrial areas are also large sources of the major directly <b>forcing</b> <b>greenhouse</b> gases, including CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O and halocarbons. Nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions are also processed to strong acids by atmospheric photochemistry on regional to continental scales, driving acid deposition to sensitive ecosystems. Direct urban/industrial emission of carbonaceous aerosols is compounded by the emission of copious amounts of secondary aerosol precursors, including: NOx, VOCs, SO 2, and NH 3. The resulting mix of primary (directly emitted) and secondary aerosols is now recognized to play an important role in the climate of the Northern Hemisphere. 	What is less widely recognized is the poor state of our knowledge of the magnitudes, and spatial and temporal distributions, of gaseous and aerosol pollutants from urban/industrial areas. While most cities in the developed world do have a few continuous fixed site monitoring stations measuring point concentrations of regulated air pollutants; these measurements very poorly constrain the patterns of pollutant measurements from the urban area as a whole. Most cities in the developing world lack even these relatively sparse routine measurements. Air quality agencies in the developed world have assembled urban/industrial emissions inventories for some key pollutants, most notably NOx, CO, some VOCs, SO 2, and some primary aerosols such as soot and particulate lead. However, far too often these emission inventories are based on engineering estimates rather than measured emissions. In addition, they often miss or poorly quantify smaller fixed sources, mobile sources (motor vehicles, trains, boats, aircraft) and area sources like landfills. Emissions inventories in developing countries, where they exist, are often based on dubious extrapolations of those used for cities in the developed world. 	This sad state of affairs is a serious problem. First, it is difficult to predict the impact of poorly defined emissions and pollutant distributions on urban air quality and its impact on citizen’s health and local ecosystem viability. Second, since the atmospheric chemistry which drives processes like ozone or secondary aerosol production is highly nonlinear, the impact of urban/industrial emissions on larger scales cannot be predicted without a relatively accurate and detailed knowledge of the temporal and spatial distributions of their precursors. Since “business as usual” is doing a poor job of specifying the real distributions of urban/ industrial atmospheric pollutants, new tools and techniques need to be developed to more easily and accurately quantify these emissions and allow accurate prediction of their subsequent chemical transformations and transport to larger scales. 	Our NASA Earth Science Enterprise funded Urban Metabolism and Trace Gas Respiration Project is an effort to better understand the distribution and emission patterns of pollutants in urban areas. The project took place between February, 1997 and October, 2001 as an Interdisciplinary Science (IDS) investigation associated with the Earth Observing System (EOS) project. It involved a highly interdisciplinary collaboration between five research teams from the Center for Atmospheric and Environmental Chemistry at Aerodyne Research, Inc. (ARI), the Departments of Chemical Engineering and Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Institute of Earth, Oceans, and Space at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), and the Laboratory for Atmospheric Research at Washington State University (WSU). 	The team included physicists, physical chemists, and environmental engineers expert in atmospheric measurement techniques, chemical and environmental engineers skilled in developing and utilizing models of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and urban planners with a research focus on the development of geographical information systems (GIS) and their innovative use in mapping and intercomparing urban characteristics, including pollutant distributions. Graduate students from MIT, UNH, and WSU were involved in both the measurement and modeling/analyses portions of the project. 	 	Airborne platforms featuring fast response sensors have previously been deployed, with dramatic effect, to measure stratospheric and free tropospheric processes (e. g. Anderson et al., 1989) and even to follow urban emission plumes to quantify downwind pollution evolution [Trainor et al., 1995; Nunnermacker et al., 1998]. Components of our team have also used ground vehicles equipped with fast response trace gas sensors to quantify methane emissions from urban (and rural) components of natural and town gas systems, urban landfills, and sections of towns and cities [Lamb et al., 1995; Mosher et al, 1999; Shorter et al., 1996; 1997]. 	However, mobile fast response sensors had not been used previously to characterize multi-pollutant distributions and source emissions within urban areas. For this project we proposed to develop, deploy and demonstrate better urban atmospheric measurement techniques based on sensitive, accurate, real-time trace gas and particulate sensors onboard a ground mobile platform (a mobile laboratory.) We anticipated that the deployment of real-time (~ 1 s response) sensitive and specific trace pollutant instruments in a mobile laboratory would generate a wealth of data on the distribution of both urban ambient pollutant levels and the distribution and nature of both mobile and stationary (including point and area) emission sources. 	As proposed, we first tested our instrumented mobile laboratory in two field missions in Manchester, NH a compact urban area with a population of ~ 100, 000 well isolated from other urban centers. We then deployed our mobile laboratory in a intensive campaign in Boston, MA at the center of a metropolitan area with ~ 3 million people. These field programs allowed us to learn how to effectively deploy real-time mobile instruments in a major urban area and gain valuable data on pollutant distributions and emission sources. 	Our field measurement tools and strategies are presented in Section 2 of this report and an overview of the urban field measurement data we obtained is presented in Section 3. Since our real-time mobile measurements would generate copious amounts of data, a key programmatic goal was to develop the data reduction and analysis methods that would allow us to learn the most about pollutant distributions and emission sources. Further, since we proposed to develop novel methods of investigating urban gaseous polluant and fine particle emissions and distributions, we planned that analyses and evaluations of our initial field measurements would be used to design better measurement strategies to collect and analyze trace gas and fine particle concentration and flux data. 	In order to analyze experimental strategies and field measurement data the MIT and WSU groups have used state-of-the-art air quality models and developed new model analysis techniques. The WSU team developed a two component approach to model the turbulent atmospheric dynamics over urban landscapes. First, they used the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) state-of-the-art MM 5 model to provide a mesoscale model of the regional wind field and then applied TEMPEST, a 3 -d turbulence model developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) that simulates the actual urban landscape. WSU also developed a capability for predicting the downwind urban pollution footprint by combining MM 5 computed windfields, MCIP, the meteorological processor from EPA’s Models- 3 /CMAQ model to invert the windfields, and the CALPUFF plume dispersion model. MIT used the MM 5 windfields generated by WSU to test urban scale diffusion models by analyzing SF 6 tracer release experiments performed as part of our Boston field campaign. In addition, the MM 5 output was used to input the California Institute of Technology (CIT) air quality model to assist in analyses of the ozone and NOx trace gas distributions measured in Boston. Finally, MIT investigated the use of air quality model inversion techniques to determine how well spatial emissions distributions can be deduced from measured urban pollutant distributions. 	The project also involved the novel use of geographic information systems (GIS) and urban databases to correlate observed trace gas emission fluxes (urban respiration) with urban and industrial activity and consumption factors (urban metabolism). Finally, correlations between measured trace gas emissions and urban/industrial activity/ consumption factors are used to identify parameters accessible to air- and satellite-borne remote sensing systems in order to enable automated estimates of urban and industrial trace gas emissions relevant to global change and regional pollution issues.

Yet its sources are not well quantified, introducing uncertainties in its global budget. We retrieved the global methane distribution by using spaceborne near-infrared absorption spectroscopy. In addition to the expected latitudinal gradient, we detected large-scale patterns of anthropogenic and natural methane emissions.

The study was performed with a model system consisting of the ECHAM 4 atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a slab ocean and thermodynamic sea ice model. The model includes transport of the relevant chemical constituents, a sulfur chemistry model that calculates sulfate production in the gas and aqueous phase, and an aerosol model that accounts for source and sink processes. The aerosol cycle, the hydrological cycle, and the atmospheric dynamics are fully interactive. The climate response to aerosol forcing {{is not just a}} mirror image of the response to <b>greenhouse</b> <b>forcing.</b> This applies to the temperature changes, which are regionally more uniform for <b>greenhouse</b> <b>forcing</b> than for aerosol forcing as is already well known, and, in particular, to the hydrological cycle: the global hydrological sensitivity (Deltaprecip/Deltatemp) to a 1 -K surface temperature change is almost 3 times higher for aerosol <b>forcing</b> than for <b>greenhouse</b> <b>forcing.</b> When both forcings are combined, a global warming is simulated while evaporation and precipitation decrease by about 2 % K- 1, resulting in a negative hydrological sensitivity. A strong dependency of the response to the type of forcing has also been found for the cloud water content and, consequently, for the change in cloud radiative forcing, which is substantially larger in the combined forcing experiment than in either of the individual forcing experiments. Consequently, the global warming for combined forcing is significantly smaller (0. 57 K) than that obtained by adding the individual changes (0. 85 K). Due to feedbacks between temperature changes and the hydrological cycle the simulated aerosol load, applying the same source strength, is considerably lower in a warmer climate (- 17 % K- 1 warming). A consequence of this aerosol-temperature feedback could be that a future increase in greenhouse gases may reduce the aerosol burden even if the source strength would not chang...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{simulated}} future {{change of the}} North Atlantic winter climate influenced by anthropogenic greenhouses gases and sulfate aerosol. Two simulations performed with the climate model ECHAM 4 /OPYC 3 are investigated: a simulation <b>forced</b> by <b>greenhouse</b> gases and a simulation <b>forced</b> by <b>greenhouse</b> gases and sulfate aerosol. Only the direct aerosol effect on the clear-sky radiative fluxes is considered. The sulfate aerosol has {{a significant impact on}} temperature, radiative quantities, precipitation and atmospheric dynamics. Generally, we find a similar, but weaker future climate response if sulfate aerosol is considered additionally. Due to the induced negative top-of-the-atmosphere radiative forcing, the future warming is attenuated. We find no significant future trends in North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index in both simulations. However, the aerosol seems to have a balancing effect on the occurence of extreme NAO events. The simulated correlation patterns of the NAO index with temperature and precipitation, respectively, agree well with observations up to the present. The extent of the regions influenced by the NAO tends to be reduced under strong <b>greenhouse</b> gas <b>forcing.</b> If sulfate is included and the warming is smaller, this tendency is reversed. Also, the future decrease in baroclinicity is smaller due to the aerosols' cooling effect and the poleward shift in track density is partly offset. Our findings imply that in simulations where aerosol cooling is neglected, the magnitude of the future warming over the North Atlantic region is overestimated, and correlation patterns differ from those based on the future simulation including aerosols...|$|R
