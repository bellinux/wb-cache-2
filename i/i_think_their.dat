500|$|Pickens {{prepared}} for this role by observing several of Kersh's real-life counterparts at the FBI's Los Angeles office, where, according to the actor, the most useful thing he learned was {{that most of the}} people at Kersh's level had been with the Bureau for twenty or twenty-five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason. Robert Patrick, who portrayed John Doggett, recognized that his own character and Kersh were [...] "both military men – Air Force, Marines". Kersh was depicted as a United States Navy A-6 Intruder weapons officer during the Vietnam War. Both Patrick and director Kim Manners thought that, as Kersh, Pickens would [...] "come in each week and just nail his stuff" [...] regardless of what else was going on. Similarly, Frank Spotnitz thought that [...] "Robert Patrick and James Pickens really had a chemistry, loved playing scenes together. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> scenes together were some of the finest ones in the last two years of the show." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, Romney {{said that}} the U.S. Supreme Court had made the right {{decision}} in its 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, but that he did not like some of the consequences of it: [...] "I'm not wild about the idea of corporations making political contributions as a concept. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. I wish we {{could find a way to}} get money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, in the midst of the Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll tell you, there have been some—there have been some attacks on me that have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, to tell you the truth … I think this has to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in money going to Super PACs instead, and that it would be better if candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E

60|$|Beaumont and Fletcher are {{the most}} lyrical of our dramatists. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> comedies {{the best part of}} their works, {{although}} there are scenes of very deep tragic interest in some of their plays. I particularly recommend Monsieur Thomas for good pure comic humor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only that I want my supper," [...] said Peter. [...] "Those {{who began}} the story can finish it, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> tongues are nimbler than my own," [...] and he glanced wrathfully at Margaret, who laughed outright, while even the solemn d'Aguilar smiled.|$|E

6000|$|... "Master, I like it not," [...] he said. [...] "Battle-horses {{have gone}} by here, not chapmen's or farmers' nags, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>their</b> breed. I say that we had best turn about if we would not walk into some snare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, unless he's a hermit, we {{are bound}} to meet him, and he's fresh blood anyway. One gets very bored by the banana and coaling men. Still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's <b>their</b> type." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{the only}} good woman the tories have: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> others do them harm, from Lady St Julians down to your friend Lady Firebrace. I wish Lady Deloraine were with us. She keeps their men {{together}} wonderfully; makes her house agreeable; and then her manner--it certainly is perfect; natural, and yet refined." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] the {{watchman}} said. [...] "He {{must have}} been hit like the kick of a horse. All these prisoners {{seem to have been}} struck but once; two of them cannot speak. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> jaws are broken; four of them have broken noses, and another has had all his front teeth knocked out, while the others are nearly as bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true, {{although}} I doubt it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> plan is, {{now they}} are here, to lay low. They'll think they are perfectly safe here. Most likely they'll send {{some kind of a}} letter to dad, and to Mrs Stanhope and Mrs. Laning, asking for money, and then they'll wait for answers. They'll want us to pay a big sum for the release of Dora and Nellie." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{have never}} {{approved}} of the very public manner in which some of our western friends have conducted {{what they call the}} Underground Railroad, but which <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> by <b>their</b> open declarations, has been made most emphatically the upperground railroad.|$|R
6000|$|... "His Majesty underwrites the Scud, brother, and I am {{responsible}} for the lives of my command. These men are better acquainted with Lake Ontario than we can possibly be, and <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>their</b> telling the same tale entitles them to some credit." ...|$|R
2500|$|... these <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{received}} <b>their</b> naming {{from the}} Pelasgians, except Poseidon; but about this god the Hellenes learnt from the Libyans, for no people except the Libyans {{have had the}} name of Poseidon from the first and have paid honour to this god always.|$|R
6000|$|... "Burn it," [...] {{he replied}} eagerly, [...] "feathers and all. They've been dyed, haven't they? more than once, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> present color is their worst. It {{must be very}} uncomfortable to wear, too, with all those pins {{sticking}} out of it. Colored glass they are made of, aren't they? They are not pretty, you know. I'll buy you a hat, if you like, a plain felt or straw, {{with just a few}} flowers. You'll look as nice again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor do I," [...] said Lydia, meditatively. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> dissimilarity {{owes its}} {{emphasis}} to some lurking likeness. Otherwise {{how could he}} have reminded me of her?" [...] Lydia, as she spoke, sat down with a troubled expression, as if trying to unravel her thoughts. [...] "And yet," [...] she added, presently, [...] "my theatrical associations are so complex that--" [...] A long silence ensued, during which Alice, conscious of some unusual stir in her patroness, watched her furtively and wondered what would happen next.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{there she}} died,--in my arms. I will {{not try to}} harass you by telling you what those few days were; how {{absolutely}} he was struck to the ground, how terrible was the grief of the daughter, how the boys were astonished by the feeling of their loss. After a few days they went away. It was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>their</b> father's wish that they should go. And I too was going away,--and had felt, indeed, directly her spirit had parted from her, that I {{was only in the}} way in his house. But I stayed at his request, because he did not wish his daughter to be alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|Stevenson's manner was too {{appropriate}} to his matter for parody: for nobody could reproduce his matter and the vividness of his visualization. When his characters were Scots, Lowlanders or Highlanders, {{it seems to}} me that their style has no rival except in the talk of Sir Walter's countrymen. A minute student who knew Stevenson, has told me that he once suggested [...] "chafts," [...] where Louis had written [...] "cheeks" [...] or [...] "jaws," [...] and that the emendation was accepted, but his Scots always use [...] "the right word," [...] and never (in prose) say [...] "tae" [...] for [...] "to," [...] <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>Theirs</b> is the good Scots.|$|R
5000|$|One local {{resident}} observed, [...] "Ken and Hazel had {{the idea}} that if you made up your mind you were going to make a living from the country, you could do it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>their</b> enterprise really showed that it is possible if you have ingenuity and ambition." ...|$|R
60|$|Far {{out behind}} us {{in a long}} line that curved upward in the distance, to be lost in the haze, strung Hooja's two hundred boats. But one would have been enough to have taken us could it have come alongside. We had drawn some fifty yards ahead of Hooja--there had been times when we were scarce ten yards in advance-and were feeling {{considerably}} safer from capture. Hooja's men, working in relays, were commencing to show the effects of the strain under which they had been forced to work without food or water, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> weakening aided us almost as much as the slight freshening of the wind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only by an error," [...] {{said the}} president. [...] "There was a mistake. It {{was not known}} that they were students. The two who were arrested were smashing {{the windows of the}} car, after it was upset, with their hockey sticks. A squad of police mistook them for rioters. As soon as they were taken to the police station, the mistake was cleared up at once. The chief-of-police telephoned an apology to the university. I believe the league is out again tonight looking for Alderman Schwefeldampf. But the leaders assure me there will be no breach of the peace whatever. As I say, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> idea is to throw him into the reservoir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Henry {{is a fine}} boy, but John is {{very like}} his mama. Henry is the eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second, is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I thought very pretty of her. And {{he is a very}} clever boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will come and stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, {{can you give me a}} bit of string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> father is too rough with them very often." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These people," [...] he admitted, [...] "are full of <b>their</b> extravagances, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{that the}} types you mention are as extinct as the dodo, but I will admit their extravagances, only {{to pass on}} to tell you this. I claim for them that they are the only political party, even with their strange conglomeration of material, which possesses the least spark of spirituality. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>their</b> programme proves it, that they are trying to look beyond the crying needs of the moment, trying to frame laws which will be lasting and just without pandering to capital or factions of any sort. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that when <b>their</b> time comes, they will try at least to govern this country from the loftiest possible standard." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In giving exoneration to the police, {{prosecutors}} and forensic staff, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they show <b>their</b> lack of independence. No officials to be blamed: simply a Maltese shopkeeper." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>their</b> MEAs were a true {{representation}} {{because it}} had to be so teacher directed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> moving forward <b>I</b> will use more picture cues in the instructions and throughout the assignment…I would love to see [my English Language Learners] really show what they know and it’s not fair to them if they can’t because of a language barrier. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this is where I will be making the most adjustment moving forward … For a self-proclaimed ‘not math’ person, I am enjoying this math.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have well earned your rank," [...] {{the prince}} said. [...] "I take some pride to myself in having so soon {{discovered}} that you had good stuff in you. There are some friends of yours here who {{will be glad to}} hear of the honour that has befallen you. The Countess Von Harp and her daughter have been here for the last six weeks. I have seen them several times, and upon each occasion they spoke to me of their gratitude for the services you have rendered them. One of my pages will show you where they are lodging. They are about to proceed to England, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> decision is a wise one, for this country is at present no place for unprotected women." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{conscious}} abhorrence {{and intolerance}} of Folly, of Baseness, Stupidity, Poltroonery {{and all that}} brood of things, dwells deep in some men: still deeper in others an unconscious abhorrence and intolerance, clothed moreover by the beneficent Supreme Powers in what stout appetites, energies, egoisms so-called, are suitable to it;--these latter are your Conquerors, Romans, Normans, Russians, Indo-English; Founders {{of what we call}} Aristocracies. Which indeed have they not the most 'divine right' to found;--being themselves very truly [Greek: Aristoi], Bravest, Best; and conquering generally a confused rabble of Worst, or at lowest, clearly enough, of Worse? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> divine right, tried, with affirmatory verdict, in the greatest Law-Court known to me, was good! A class of men who are dreadfully exclaimed against by Dryasdust; of whom nevertheless beneficent Nature has oftentimes had need; and may, alas, again have need.|$|E
60|$|Certainly he was {{a curious}} sight in those strange surroundings, for they were very strange, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>their</b> {{complete}} simplicity added to the effect. In front of us {{was a kind of}} courtyard with a black floor made of polished ant-heap earth and cow-dung, two-thirds of which at least was practically roofed in by the huge over-hanging mass of rock whereof I have spoken, its arch bending above at a height of not less than sixty or seventy feet from the ground. Into this great, precipice-backed cavity poured the fierce light of the setting sun, turning it and all within it, even the large straw hut in the background, to the deep hue of blood. Seeing the wonderful effect of the sunset in that dark and forbidding place, it occurred to me at once that the old wizard must have chosen this moment to receive us because of its impressiveness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>their</b> enmity and his sorrow, I feel drawn thither; {{but when}} this {{deception}} comes before me, I had rather not {{look in his}} face again. If he petted me <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> he was taking me in again. He has Robert, he has his sister, and I have promised to let Mr. Saville judge. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Mr. Saville would let me go if Robert said I ought.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not for long," [...] {{returned}} Brooks laughingly. [...] "I {{came here}} to look up a mill site, and I've found it. Meantime <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I've opened <b>their</b> eyes." ...|$|R
