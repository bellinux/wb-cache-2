5|$|Disruption of the Commonwealth {{governance}} {{caused by}} the liberum veto was highly significant.

5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in many states, Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century, {{four types}} of {{midshipman}} existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (apprentice officer), and midshipman ordinary. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates who <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, {{some members of the}} original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.|$|E

Between Ashes series, Gilchrist had averaged only 25 with one Test century.|$|E

5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes in the Dublin Journal. However, this edition led to controversy, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had publication rights, under English copyright law, {{to many of}} the works included in Faulkner's edition. The English, in 1735, attempted to pass a law that would allow a copyright holder to prohibit works that may violate their copyright, but this law <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through Parliament.|$|E
