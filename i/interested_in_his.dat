5|$|Brewer was not {{resigned}} by the Maple Leafs {{and released}} {{as a free}} agent on July 1, 2015. He spent the entire summer training in hopes of landing an NHL job but realized by mid-August that he was unlikely to find a team <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> services. He has since quietly retired.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes {{that we know of}} and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order. But he took huge German {{casualties}} elsewhere and he was a servant of the regime. He was not exactly a shining liberal or Social Democrat. Mostly, he was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career.|$|E
5|$|Defining for {{his career}} was the {{invitation}} he got in 1944 from the people of Standaard Boekhandel, a chain of libraries who were also active as publishers. They were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> work and wanted to publish some books. Vandersteen presented them with the first designs for a daily comic strip, but they put that on hold and first ordered four juvenile books from Vandersteen. These were published in 1945 and 1946 in Dutch and French (by Casterman).|$|E

5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, {{disliked the}} Prince of Wales, and took little {{interest}} in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury, and George became heir apparent to the throne. He inherited one of his father's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh. Now more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E
5|$|Christine, now {{pregnant}} and married, awakens on a May bank holiday. Thirteen months later, it is Father's Day and Adam tends to their son Jack (played variously by Joel Little and Dexter Little) in the night. Christine hears the Stranger's voice, but eventually finds Jack with Adam. Christine celebrates her birthday thirteen months later. Ernie no longer recognises Christine, while Adam is more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> colleague Zara (Ellerby). Marion blindfolds Christine {{for a game}} of blind man's buff. Christine hears noises from behind a door and removes her blindfold to step through. Thirteen months later, Adam is packing a case for a family holiday. Ernie has died, and Christine's relationship with Adam is strained.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{attended}} the Georgia Institute of Technology, {{where he played}} for head coach Chan Gailey's Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team from 2004 to 2006. Despite Georgia Tech being <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> playing both football and baseball, Johnson's mother refused to allow Johnson to play both sports after determining that the year-round athletic schedule would be too demanding. In his career at Georgia Tech wearing #21, Johnson made a case for being the greatest Georgia Tech player of all time. Johnson had 178receptions in his career, good for 2,927yards and 28touchdowns. He ranks first in school history in career receiving yards, second in receptions, first in touchdown receptions, and first in career 100-yard receiving games with 13.|$|E

5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club. Her mother was confident her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> daughter's artistic inclinations. In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it led her to want to be a dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of Theoktistos, the regency was at an end; in early 856, Michael proclaimed his {{assumption}} of full imperial power, and in 857 Theodora was forced to retire to the Gastria Monastery. Nevertheless, as Michael was more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pleasures and his continuing affair with Eudokia Ingerina, Bardas now became the de facto regent of the Empire. By ca. 858 {{he was promoted to}} the highest state offices (magistros and chartoularios tou kanikleiou), followed by his promotion to kouropalates—according to Symeon Logothetes, this happened after a failed assassination attempt masterminded by Theodora—and finally, on 22 (or 26) April 862, to Caesar. Petronas also emerged from obscurity at the same time, becoming strategos of the Thracesian Theme and leading a series of successful raids against the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|Few records exist of Thomas Coke's early years, {{although}} {{it is known that}} he was educated in Longford, Derbyshire, before going to a school in Wandsworth run by French refugees. In 1765 he was sent to Eton College, where he was joined by William Windham, a close friend in his later life. Coke was apparently happy at Eton, and was excellent at field sports; on one occasion 70 snipes he had killed were found in his room, and on another he narrowly avoiding being punished for shooting a pheasant in Windsor Park. He was not particularly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> academic studies, {{but by the time he}} left Eton in 1771 Coke had developed a close circle of friends and connections from the landowning class, and practical skills to deal with his future estates. After leaving school he undertook a Grand Tour of Europe, financed by his father and his great-aunt (who offered him £500 not to go to a university, regarding them as dens of vice). Coke visited France and Italy, where he witnessed the marriage of the Young Pretender to Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern; Louise apparently fell in love with Coke, preferring the similarly-aged Englishman to her 52-year-old alcoholic husband.|$|E

5|$|Irvine {{added to}} his tally with home and away goals against Halifax Town, where he {{would go on to}} play the next season, and a strike against Aston Villa that was named as runner-up in a Goal of the Season {{competition}} by television programme Match of the Day. With the forward partnership of Irvine and Kit Napier, Brighton performed better than expected in the 1971–72 season. At the end of the campaign, following a 1–1 draw with Rochdale the team was promoted to the Second Division, after finishing as runners-up behind Aston Villa. Irvine continued to score in a higher division, netting five times in the first eleven matches of the season. However, he was then dropped from the team and never regained his place in the starting line-up. Several clubs became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> services, including West Ham United, a number of American teams, and Scottish side Heart of Midlothian, where Bobby Seith was the manager. Irvine played his last match for Brighton on 18 November 1972, when the team lost 0–1 at home to his former club Burnley.|$|E
5|$|With many clubs <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> services, Pugh {{signed for}} fellow League Two club Shrewsbury Town on 29 May 2007 for a {{compensation}} fee. Shrewsbury manager Gary Peters {{revealed that he}} had already attempted to sign him {{earlier in the season}} as part of a swap deal when striker Glynn Hurst moved to Bury. He made his debut in a 4–0 away win over Lincoln City, setting up Andy Cooke for the third goal with a cross. He suffered an injury in November 2007 and underwent a scan, which was believed to be a cartilage problem. Days after discovering the results of the scan, which revealed he was suffering from acute tendinitis, he returned to training. He scored his first goal for Shrewsbury on his return in a 4–0 home victory over Dagenham & Redbridge, turning in a Marc Tierney cross in the 78th minute before assisting Tierney for Shrewsbury's final goal. He scored a further two goals that season following the arrival of Paul Simpson as manager, and finished 2007–08 with 38 appearances and 4 goals, for a Shrewsbury team that ranked 18th place in League Two.|$|E

25|$|During {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries, or the Age of Enlightenment, neo-classical culture was pervasive.

However a measure of his influence can be found in the diversity of the people <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> works, both among readers and authors.|$|E
