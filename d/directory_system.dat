2500|$|Disk {{formatting}} {{is usually}} {{done by a}} utility program supplied by the computer OS manufacturer; generally, it sets up a file storage <b>directory</b> <b>system</b> on the disk, and initializes its sectors and tracks. Areas of the disk unusable for storage due to flaws can be locked (marked as [...] "bad sectors") so that the operating system does not attempt to use them. This was time consuming so many environments had quick formatting which skipped the error checking process. When floppy disks were often used, disks pre-formatted for popular computers were sold. The unformatted capacity of a floppy disk {{does not include the}} sector and track headings of a formatted disk; the difference in storage between them depends on the drive's application. Floppy disk drive and media manufacturers specify the unformatted capacity (for example, 2 MB for a standard 3½-inch HD floppy). It is implied that this should not be exceeded, since doing so will most likely result in performance problems. DMF was introduced permitting 1.68 MB to fit onto an otherwise standard 3½-inch disk; utilities then appeared allowing disks to be formatted as such.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Directory</b> <b>System</b> Agent (DSA) is {{the element}} of a X.500 {{directory}} service that provides User Agents with access to {{a portion of the}} directory (usually the portion associated with a single Organizational Unit). X.500 is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T). The model and function of a <b>directory</b> <b>system</b> agent are specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.501.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1982 as an {{offshoot}} of Golden Pages, the Israeli phone directory company, which was owned by the Aurec Group headed by Morris Kahn. Together with others at Golden Pages, Kahn developed a billing software program for phone directory companies and with Boaz Dotan established a company called Aurec Information & <b>Directory</b> <b>Systems</b> to market this product.In 1985, Southwestern Bell Corporation acquired a 50 percent ownership share of Aurec Information & <b>Directory</b> <b>Systems,</b> and its name was changed to Amdocs. Within two years, the Aurec Group sold off all its holdings in Amdocs for almost US$1 billion.|$|R
5000|$|Novell and Lotus {{supplied}} {{the two largest}} software <b>directory</b> <b>systems.</b> Each of these companies started with flat account and directory structures, and encountered the support and name-conflict limitations inherent in their flat structures. They adopted the X.500 OU concept into their next-generation software around 1993 - Novell {{with the release of}} Novell Directory Services (subsequently known as eDirectory), and Lotus with the release of the third version of Lotus Notes. Microsoft allegedly used Novell's directory as a blueprint for the first released versions of AD, but this claim appears suspect, given that X.500 served as the [...] "granddaddy" [...] of all <b>directory</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
