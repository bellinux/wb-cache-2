The arms of Rezovski Creek encompass the old buildings of the Bulgarian Base. Its lower course forms Grand Lagoon, and has its mouth at the southwest extremity of Bulgarian Beach used as <b>embarkation</b> <b>place</b> servicing St. Kliment Ohridski Base.|$|E

50|$|On 13 May 1817 Leopoldina {{was married}} to Dom Pedro per procuram (by proxy) in Vienna. At the {{ceremony}} the bridegroom was represented by Leopoldina’s uncle, Archduke Charles. <b>Embarkation</b> took <b>place</b> in Livorno on 13 August 1817 among much celebration, and after an adventure-filled voyage lasting 81 days, Leopoldina arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 5 November and finally met her husband.From a distance Pedro initially appeared to Leopoldina to be a perfect, well-educated gentleman, but the reality was very different. Dom Pedro was a year younger than Leopoldina and sadly rarely measured up to the descriptions given by the matchmakers. His temperament was impulsive and choleric, and his education but modest. Even spoken communication between the young married couple proved difficult, as Pedro spoke very little French and his Portuguese could {{only be described as}} vulgar.|$|R
60|$|The brief Canadian {{summer was}} over; {{they were in}} the month of September. The camp at Montmorency was broken up. The troops were transported to Point Levi, leaving a {{sufficient}} number to man the batteries on the Isle of Orleans. On the fifth and sixth of September the <b>embarkation</b> took <b>place</b> above Point Levi, in transports which had been sent up for the purpose. Montcalm detached De Bougainville with fifteen hundred men to keep along the north shore above the town, watch the movements of the squadron, and prevent a landing. To deceive him, Admiral Holmes moved with the ships of war three leagues beyond the place where the landing was to be attempted. He was to drop down, however, in the night, and protect the landing. Cook, the future discoverer, also, was employed with others to sound the river and place buoys opposite the camp of Montcalm, as if an attack were meditated in that quarter.|$|R
60|$|This, however, was {{far from}} being the state of mind of all in Palos. The <b>embarkation</b> took <b>place</b> {{in the course of the}} {{afternoon}} of the 2d of August, it being the intention of the pilots to carry the vessels that day to a point off the town of Huelvas, where the position was more favorable to making sail than when anchored in front of Palos. The distance was trifling, but it was the commencement of the voyage, and, to many, it was like snapping the cords of life, to make even this brief movement. Columbus, himself, was one of the last to embark, having a letter to send to the court, and other important duties to discharge. At length he quitted the convent, and, accompanied by Luis and the prior, he, too, took his way to the beach. The short journey was silent, for each of the party was deeply plunged in meditation. Never before this hour, did the enterprise seem so perilous and uncertain to the excellent Franciscan. Columbus was carefully recalling the details of his preparations, while Luis was thinking of the maid of Castile, as he was wont to term Mercedes, and of the many weary days that must elapse before he could hope to see her again.|$|R
60|$|Nero and Anicetus {{determined}} {{finally to}} put their plan into execution by inducing Agrippina to embark on board their barge in returning to Antium, when the time should arrive, instead of going back in her own vessel. Their other attempts to induce her to go out upon the water had failed, {{and this was the}} only opportunity that now remained. It was desirable that this <b>embarkation</b> should take <b>place</b> in the night, as the deed which they were contemplating could be more effectually accomplished under the cover of the darkness. Accordingly, on the afternoon of the day on which Agrippina was to return, Nero prepared a banquet for her, and he protracted the festivities and entertainments which attended it until late in the evening, so that it was wholly dark before his mother could take her leave. Anicetus then contrived to have one of the vessels of his fleet run against the galley in which Agrippina had come from Antium, as it lay at anchor near the shore at the place where she had landed. The galley was broken down and disabled by the collision. Anicetus came to Agrippina to report the accident, with a countenance expressive of much concern; but added that the barge which the emperor had prepared for her was at her service, and proposed to substitute that in the place of the one which had been injured. There seemed to be no other alternative, and Agrippina, after taking a very affectionate leave of her son, went gayly, and wholly unconscious of danger, on board the beautiful but treacherous vessel.|$|R

"Of course, rumours {{had reached}} the Prince of this policy of devastation," [...] he was saying, [...] "but his Highness has been {{disposed}} to treat these rumours lightly, unable to see, as indeed are we all, what useful purpose such a policy could finally serve. He does not underrate the talents of milord Wellington as a commander. He does not imagine that he would pursue such operations out of pure wantonness; yet if such operations are indeed being pursued, what can they be but wanton? A moment, Count," [...] he stayed Samoval, {{who was about to}} interrupt. His mind and manner were authoritative. [...] "We know most positively from the Emperor's London agents that the war is unpopular in England; we know that public opinion is being prepared for a British retreat, for the driving of the British into the sea, as must inevitably happen once Monsieur le Prince decides to launch his bolt. Here in the Tagus the British fleet lies ready to embark the troops, and the British Cabinet itself" [...] (he spoke more slowly and emphatically) [...] "expects that <b>embarkation</b> to take <b>place</b> at latest in September, which is just about the time that the French offensive should be at its height and the French troops under the very walls of Lisbon. I admit that by this policy of devastation if, indeed, it be true--added to a stubborn contesting of every foot of ground, the French advance may be retarded. But the process will be costly to Britain in lives and money." ...|$|R
