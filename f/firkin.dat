5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} {{with a background}} in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's <b>Firkin</b> chain pubs.|$|E

[...] "Looking back further it was where we all lived together in the early years, played all those flapper and jug of ale shows, and then got our record deal".

2500|$|When the {{landlord}} feels the beer has settled, {{and they are}} ready to serve it, they will knock a soft spile into the shive {{on the side of the}} cask. The major difference in appearance between a keg and a cask is the shive. A keg does not have a shive on the side. The majority of casks these days are metal, and look similar to a keg, but with the rounded traditional barrel shape (kegs are often straight-sided). Even though there are still some wooden casks around, these are rare; in fact there are more plastic casks around than wooden ones. Plastic casks are increasing in popularity because they are cheaper to buy and lighter to carry. Though they don't last as long, they are also less likely to be stolen as they have no melt-down value. Beer casks come in a number of sizes, but by far the most common in the pub trade are those of 9 gallons (72 pints or roughly 41 litres) which is known as a <b>Firkin</b> and 18 gallons (144 pints or roughly 83 litres) known as a Kilderkin. (N.B.These are imperial gallons, equal to 1.201 US gallons each.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, the {{congregation}} moved permanently {{to the larger}} church on Queen Square, after {{a period in which}} both buildings were used, and Union Chapel was sold and became an Evangelical mission hall—the Glynn Vivian Miners' Mission. [...] It was sponsored by Richard Glynn Vivian, a Welsh industrialist. [...] He was converted to Evangelical Christianity while staying in Brighton after suddenly losing his sight, and devoted {{the rest of his life}} to improving the working and spiritual lives of miners in Britain and elsewhere. [...] The Union Chapel was the base for this work from 1905 until 1927 or 1931, when the Elim Pentecostal Church bought it. [...] It became known as the Elim Free Church or the Elim Tabernacle of the Four Square Gospel, and internal alterations removed almost all the interior fittings from the 1825 reconstruction. [...] In September 1988, the Elim congregation left the building and it was put up for sale again, with the expectation that it would become a restaurant or pub—ending 300 years of religious worship on the site. [...] The building was acquired by the <b>Firkin</b> Brewery, a pub chain established in 1979 which was experiencing significant growth by the early 1990s. [...] They named it the [...] "Font & Firkin", and installed a microbrewery on site.|$|E
2500|$|John Robert O’Connell {{commissioned}} the Cork firm of Egan & Sons {{for work on}} the altar plate and vestments. Craftswomen {{played a significant role}} in the Irish Arts & Crafts movement. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop, formerly in 32 Patrick St. Cork, are inscribed in the lining of the Cloth of Gold. These items are a testament to the significant role played by women in the Irish Arts & Crafts Movement. These fragile items are currently in storage and in need of conservation. Students from the Crawford Municipal Technical Institute, which became the Crawford College of Art & Design, were involved in the exterior carvings. The foundation stone of the chapel was laid on 18 May 1915. James Finbarre McMullen was the architect and John Sisk was the builder. Both were Cork firms. McMullen had a high profile in the city. He had been High Sheriff for the City of Cork in 1907-08. Significant works by McMullen in Cork city include: Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital, Western Rd. (1897); conservation of the <b>Firkin</b> Crane, built in 1855 in the Shandon district of the city (1900); St. Finbarre’s West Total Abstinence Club, Bandon Road. (1900), formerly known as [...] "Lough Rovers" [...] and now as the [...] "Spires" [...] apartment complex and the remodeling Holy Trinity Church, Fr. Mathew Quay (1906–08). In 1996 Sisk & Sons worked as contractors on the O'Rahilly Building project. This complex was built on the site of the former Honan Hostel (1914–91).|$|E

There, it was transferred to horse carts carrying 24 <b>firkins</b> and sent on to the largest butter {{market in the world}} in Cork City. In 1830, these farmers sent 30,000 <b>firkins</b> valued at 52,000, with much of it passing through the Rockchapel mountain path.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} line-up, {{formed in}} May 1999, consisted of Adam Easterbrook, Karl Sabino, Ian Johnsen and Mark Nicholas. They played their first gig in October supporting Guided By Voices at the Bristol Flee & <b>Firkin.</b> Debut single [...] "A Dull Today is Darker Yesterday's Bright Tomorrow" [...] {{was released in}} June 2000 on {{what appeared to be}} a one-sided 7" [...] single, although the silent b-side, included as a bonus track on their first CD album, was later revealed to be a 'cover' of Crass's [...] "The Sound of Free Speech". Another early gig was in New York City [...] followed by shows supporting bands such as Beachwood Sparks, And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead, Cheap Trick and further dates with Guided By Voices. In November 2001 the band released the single [...] "Gadfly Adolescence", which was described by NME as 'a magnificent debut from these shamelessly prog-tinged guitar alchemists, running the gamut of classic English teen anthems from [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] to [...] "All The Young Dudes" [...] to [...] "Eton Rifles" [...] and beyond...a heady mix of ragged riffs, symphonic song structures and heart-tugging lyrics about lazy childhood summers spent [...] "deep in the gloaming".' This song was re-recorded for the group's debut album The Spring Heel Penny Dreadful & Other Tales of Morbid Curiosity, released in May 2003 by the indie label Must Destroy who were at the time finding success with one of their other signings, The Darkness. Opening song [...] "I Are Becoming Instinct" [...] was also released as a single. The album's sequencing was influenced by Guided By Voices' Bee Thousand, The Beatles' The White Album and Faust's The Faust Tapes and was championed by Julian Cope ('The best and most disconcerting psychedelia I’ve heard these past coupla years ... managed to heft several vats of raw Faust in the direction of post-Oasis Beatlemania'), and DJ John Peel who invited them to record a session for his Radio One show. The album also garnered positive reviews in Mojo ('Crunchy, punchy, proggy - and very English ... how lovely to see rock still has a decent vocabulary') ...|$|E
