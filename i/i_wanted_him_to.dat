500|$|Fleming {{decided to}} underplay Bond's character, observing that [...] "Exotic things {{would happen to}} and around him, but {{he would be a}} neutral figure". On another occasion, he {{reinforced}} his point, saying, [...] "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be a blunt instrument".|$|E

Nothing he could say or do {{was going to change}} the way people perceived him because of that moment. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> feel at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E

500|$|The lead {{character}} of Casino Royale is James Bond, {{an agent of}} the Secret Service. Fleming initially named the character James Secretan before he appropriated the name of James Bond, author of the ornithology guide, Birds of the West Indies. Fleming explained to the ornithologist's wife [...] "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born". He further explained that [...] "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be a blunt instrument... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [...] is the dullest name I ever heard." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel centres on the {{exploits}} of James Bond, {{an officer in the}} Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Reserve. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, an expert on Caribbean birds and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, himself a keen birdwatcher, had a copy of Bond's guide, and later told the ornithologist's wife, [...] "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born". In a 1962 interview in The New Yorker, he further explained: [...] "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be a blunt instrument... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [...] is the dullest name I ever heard." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who {{raped and}} murdered Teena. Sarsgaard {{was one of the}} first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his {{character}} to be [...] "likable, sympathetic even", because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter. In an interview with The Independent, Sarsgaard said, [...] "I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I felt like I was just like the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me." [...] Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom Roseanne, as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.|$|E

500|$|Yiddish theatre {{composer}} Herman Yablokoff {{claimed in}} his biography, Memoirs of the Yiddish Stage, that the melody to [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was plagiarized from his song [...] "Shvayg mayn harts" [...] ("Hush My Heart"), {{which he wrote}} for his play Papirosn (1935). When met with a lawsuit in 1951 for the plagiarization, ahbez first proclaimed his innocence, and telephoned Yablokoff to explain that he [...] "had heard the melody as if angels were singing it... in the California mountains. He offered me $10,000 to withdraw the suit. I said that the money was not important, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> admit that the song was geganvet and if he heard angels, they must have bought a copy of my song." [...] Eventually ahbez's lawyers offered to have an out-of-court settlement, offering $25,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to Yablokoff, which he accepted. Freidwald remarked that [...] "it struck no one as ironic that a song with message of love and peace should come to symbolize how cutthroat the pop music business was becoming".|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Sarsgaard earned {{critical}} {{recognition in}} Kimberly Peirce's Boys Don't Cry, {{where he was}} cast as notorious killer John Lotter. The film {{is based on the}} real-life story of Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in 1993 by Lotter and Tom Nissen after they found out that he was a trans man. Boys Don’t Cry received overwhelmingly positive acclaim from critics, and his performance was critically well received. According to The Boston Globe, [...] "Peter [...] Sarsgaard... makes the killer's terrible trajectory not only believable, but grounded in the most mundane clodhopper behavior. He isn't a drooling monster, he's a guy you wouldn't look [...] twice at a bar or a convenience store." [...] A contributor from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote [...] "It's a marvelous performance supported ably by... Sarsgaard as the unpredictable, sociopathic Lotter." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2000 Venice Film Festival. In regards to his character, as how Sarsgaard made him [...] "likeable, sympathetic even" [...] was because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him."

2500|$|Hamlett was {{receptive}} to dissenting {{views about the}} progress of the war, most notably arranging for Lieutenant Colonel John Paul Vann to brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). [...] "Vann had {{a lot to say about}} what was going on in Vietnam, which was completely counter to the reports we were receiving through JCS channels. And they were so different that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> brief the Chiefs." [...] On his own authority, Hamlett scheduled the briefing for July 8, 1963, but it was canceled at the last minute by Army chief of staff Earle G. Wheeler at the behest of JCS chairman Maxwell D. Taylor, whose protégé, General Paul D. Harkins, commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, was producing the optimistic reports that Vann's briefing was intended to contradict.|$|E
2500|$|Prince Rogers Nelson {{was born}} on June 7, 1958 in Minneapolis, to Mattie Della (née Shaw; 1933–2002) and John Lewis Nelson (1916–2001).

Prince's father was a pianist and songwriter, {{and his mother was}} a jazz singer.

2500|$|Diane Sawyer interviewed O'Donnell in a March 14, 2002, {{episode of}} PrimeTime Thursday.

[...] She spoke about the two gay men in Florida who faced having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law wouldn't let them adopt because Florida banned gay or bisexual people from adopting. O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBT activists who cited her repeated references to being enamored of Tom Cruise on The Rosie O'Donnell Show as deceptive. She responded in her act stating, [...] "I said <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> mow my lawn and bring me a lemonade. I never said I wanted to blow him." [...] After leaving her show and coming out, O'Donnell returned to stand-up comedy, and cut her hair. O'Donnell told the press that her haircut was meant to mimic the haircut of former Culture Club backup singer Helen Terry.|$|E
2500|$|With work on Reservoir Dogs completed, Tarantino {{returned}} {{to the notion of}} a trilogy film: [...] "I got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don't: telling three separate stories, having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story." [...] Tarantino explains that the idea [...] "was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you've ever seen when it comes to crime stories— the oldest stories in the book... You know, 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife'— the oldest story about... the guy's gotta go out with the big man's wife and don't touch her. You know, you've seen the story a zillion times." [...] "I'm using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry", he says. [...] "Part of the trick is to take these movie characters, these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life's rules and see how they unravel." [...] In at least one case, boxer Butch Coolidge, Tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic Hollywood crime story: [...] "I wanted him to be basically like Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly [...] <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be a bully and a jerk".|$|E
