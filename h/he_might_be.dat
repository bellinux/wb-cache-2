5|$|Herennianus and Timolaus: the {{two were}} {{mentioned}} in the Augustan History and are not attested in any other source; Herennianus might be a conflation of Hairan and Herodianus while Timolaus is most probably a fabrication, although Dietmar Kienast suggest that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> Vaballathus.|$|E

5|$|During {{his rise}} to power, Richard Nixon {{became known as}} a leading anti-communist. After he became {{president}} in 1969, Nixon saw advantages in improving relations with China and the Soviet Union; he hoped that détente would {{put pressure on the}} North Vietnamese to end the Vietnam War, and <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to manipulate the two main communist powers to the benefit of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In Canada's St. Elias Mountains, {{a frozen}} {{extraterrestrial}} body is discovered by an expedition team. Professor Arlinsky, the team's leader, sends ice core samples containing presumably alien DNA to Mulder. Scully has the samples tested and confirms the DNA's non-terrestrial origin, but is {{attacked by a}} man who steals the samples. Scully learns that her attacker is Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), a Defense Department employee. When she tracks down Kritschgau and holds him at gunpoint, he reveals that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> killed.|$|E

5|$|The novelist Matteo Bandello {{observed}} Leonardo at {{work and}} wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint {{for three or four}} days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> obliged to use the prior as his model.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to bribe his way free of his guards, Rupert was imprisoned in Linz. Lord Craven, also taken in the battle, {{attempted}} to persuade his captors {{to allow him to}} remain with Rupert, but was refused. Rupert's imprisonment was surrounded by religious overtones. His mother was deeply concerned that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> converted from Calvinism to Catholicism; his captors, encouraged by Emperor Ferdinand III, deployed Jesuit priests in an attempt to convert him. The Emperor went further, proffering the option of freedom, a position as an Imperial general and a small principality if Rupert would convert. Rupert refused.|$|E
5|$|By February 1968 Harrison {{decided to}} leave, as Cohen was showing {{no signs of}} abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and {{suggested}} Barry Malzberg to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg from {{his work at the}} Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and thought that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> more amenable than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{case was}} unusual {{as he had}} a fungal infection, Penicillium marneffei, {{which at the time}} had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV {{developed}} into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.|$|E

With all flights canceled due to a snowstorm, Christian and Aaron spend an intimate night in a motel. When Christian awakes, he finds Aaron gone. Aaron's pocket watch, a family heirloom, has been left behind. Christian returns to Los Angeles. In Idaho, Aaron is excommunicated by the church elders, led by his own father, Farron, who is the stake president. Aaron is rejected by his father and scolded by his mother, who tells him {{that he needs to}} pray for forgiveness. When Aaron suggests that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> gay, his mother slaps him. Overwhelmed by despair, Aaron attempts suicide. He is subsequently sent by his parents to a treatment facility to be cured of his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a {{coalition}} of the Despensers' enemies across the Marcher territories. Edward and Hugh the Younger became aware of these plans in March and headed west, hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis. This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May. The Despensers' lands were quickly seized by {{a coalition}} of the Marcher Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances. Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers. Fearing that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the Marcher Lords for their actions.|$|E
5|$|Nixon, as he {{related in}} his address, {{came from a}} family of modest means, and had spent much of his time after law school either in the military, campaigning for office, or serving in Congress. After his {{successful}} 1950 Senate campaign, Nixon's backers continued to raise money to finance his political activities. These contributions went to reimburse him for travel costs, postage for political mailings which he did not have franked, and similar expenses. Such a fund was not illegal at the time, but, because Nixon had made a point of attacking government corruption, it exposed him to charges <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> giving special favors to the contributors.|$|E

5|$|On 23 March 2013, BBC {{released}} a short prequel video to the episode, written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Favre was in contact with the Packers about a possible return to the team. On July 11, 2008, Favre {{sent a letter to the}} Packers asking for his unconditional release to allow him to play for another NFL team. Packers general manager Ted Thompson announced he would not grant Favre an unconditional release and reaffirmed the organization's commitment to Aaron Rodgers as its new quarterback. Complicating matters was Favre's unique contract giving him the leverage to void any potential trade by not reporting to the camp of the team <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> traded to if the Packers elect to go that route.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{member of the}} family, Constantine Gabras, participated in the 976–979 revolt of Bardas Skleros, and was killed in battle in 979.

In 1040, a Michael Gabras {{was one of the}} leaders of a failed aristocratic conspiracy against the Domestic of the Schools Constantine, a brother of Emperor Michael IV (r. 1034–1041).
