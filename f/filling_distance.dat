Penetration distance of the polymer melt into the microstructure depends on several factors as the melt flow rate and the cooling rate in the microfeatures, which depends on the materials and geometric dimensions. In this study, a simplified analytical model was constructed to estimate the <b>filling</b> <b>distance</b> into the cylindrical microchannels. The effects of the mold temperature, injection rate, heat transfer coefficient, and microchannel dimension on the <b>filling</b> <b>distance</b> were investigated. The <b>filling</b> <b>distance</b> decreases dramatically {{with respect to the}} decrease of the channel radius. In molding of plastic components with cylindrical microfeatures as those analyzed in this study, decrease of the part thickness could also increase the <b>filling</b> <b>distance</b> in the microfeatures...|$|E

The {{results indicate that}} the component with non-dendritic and uniformly distributed microstructures can be produced by Rheo-Diecasting (RDC) process (combining Self-inoculation Method (SIM) with High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC)). The isothermal holding time of the slurry has large effect on primary particles, but has little effect on secondary particles. Growth rate of the primary particles in the isothermal holding process conforms to the dynamic equation of Dt 3 − D 03 = Kt. The suitable holding time for rheo-diecasting of A 356 {{aluminum alloy}} is 3 min. During filling process, the nucleation occurs throughout the entire remaining liquid, and nuclei grow stably into globular particles with the limited grain size of 6. 5 μm firstly, then both α 1 and α 2 particles appear unstable growth phenomenon due to the existence of constitutional undercooling. The average particle sizes and shape factors of both α 1 and α 2 are decreasing with the increase of <b>filling</b> <b>distance</b> due to different cooling rate in different positions. The growth rate of the eutectic in RDC is 4 times faster than HPDC, which is mainly due to the limitation of α 2 particles in RDC process.

40|$|A load-enhanced {{methodology}} {{has been}} proposed to enable the in situ detection, localization, and characterization of damage in metallic plate-like structures using Lamb waves. A baseline-free load-differential method using the delay-and-sum imaging algorithm is proposed for defect detection and localization. The term “load-differential” refers to the comparison of recorded ultrasonic signals at various levels of stress. Defect characterization is achieved by incorporating expected scattering information of guided waves interacting with defects into the minimum variance imaging algorithm, and a method for estimating such scattering patterns from the measurements of a sparse transducer array is developed. The estimation method includes signal preprocessing, extracting initial scattering values from baseline subtraction results, and obtaining the complete scattering matrix by applying radial basis function interpolation. The factors that cause estimation errors, such as the shape parameter used to form the basis function and the <b>filling</b> <b>distance</b> used in the interpolation, are discussed. The estimated scattering patterns from sparse array measurements agree reasonably well with laser wavefield data and are further used in the load-enhanced method. The results from fatigue tests show that the load-enhanced method is capable of detecting cracks, providing reasonable estimates of their localizations and orientations, and discriminating them from drilled holes, disbonds, and fastener tightness variations.

The {{results indicate that}} the semisolid slurry of A 356 {{aluminum alloy}} can be prepared by self-inoculation method at 600 °C. Primary α-Al particles with fine and spherical morphologies are uniformly distributed when the isothermal holding time of slurry is 3 min. Liquid phase segregation occurs during rheo-diecasting process of semisolid slurry and the primary particles (α 1) show obvious plastic deformation in the area of high stress and low cooling rate. A small amount of dendrites resulting from the relatively low temperature of the shot chamber at the initial stage of secondary solidification are fragmented as they pass through the in-gate during the mould filling process. The amount of dendrite fragments decreases with the increase of <b>filling</b> <b>distance.</b> During the solidification process of the remaining liquid, the nucleation rate of secondary particles (α 2) increases with the increase of cooling rate, and the content of Si in secondary particles (α 2) are larger than primary particles (α 1). With the increase of cooling rate, the content of Si in secondary particles (α 2) gradually increases. The morphologies of eutectic Si in different parts of die casting are noticeably different.

40|$|To achieve {{reliable}} {{transmission of}} detonation waves to a pulse detonation engine combustor (detonation chamber), the authors propose a pulse detonation engine initiator that uses a cylindrical reflector downstream of a predetonator exit. The detonation wave propagates around the reflector to change the wave shape in three transition stages: from a planar detonation wave in the predetonator to an expanding cylindrical detonation wave, from the cylindrical wave to a planar toroidal detonation wave, and from the toroidal wave to a planar detonation wave in the detonation chamber. The cylindrical wave propagates along a cylindrical path between the reflector and front wall of the detonation chamber, and the toroidal wave propagates along an annular path between the reflector and sidewall of the detonation chamber. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the influence of the gap width L of the annular path on the transition stages from cylindrical to toroidal and from toroidal to planar. A series of experiments that filled the entire test section with the driver gas mixture (stoichiometric hydrogen oxygen mixture) showed that the expanding cylindrical detonation wave was sufficiently strong to survive the rarefaction waves from the corners of the reflector at all of the investigated annular gap widths (5, 10, 15, and 20 mm) and was transmitted to the planar toroidal wave successfully in all cases. When the strength of the cylindrical detonation wave was under a supercritical condition for diffraction at the reflector corner, the necessary <b>filling</b> <b>distance</b> for the driver gas was predicted well by the Whitham theory.

Furthermore, though we will not pursue this here, our multilevel approach is able to represent multiple scales in the data if present.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{observed}} that interpolation based on translates of radial basis functions or non-radial kernels is numerically unstable due to exceedingly large {{condition of the}} kernel matrix. But if stability is assessed in function space without considering special bases, this paper proves that kernel–based interpolation is stable. Provided that the data are not too wildly scattered, the L 2 or L ∞ norms of interpolants can be bounded above by discrete ℓ 2 and ℓ ∞ norms of the data. Furthermore, Lagrange basis functions are uniformly bounded and Lebesgue constants grow at most like the square root {{of the number of}} data points. However, this analysis applies only to kernels of limited smoothness. Numerical examples support our bounds, but also show that the case of infinitely smooth kernels must lead to worse bounds in future work, while the observed Lebesgue constants for kernels with limited smoothness even seem to be independent of the sample size and the <b>fill</b> <b>distance.</b> ...|$|R

According to the extended theorems, we can use more general positive definite kernels to construct the kernel-based estimators to ap-proximate the numerical solutions of the SPDEs. Because a parabolic SPDE driven by Lévy noises can be discretized into serval elliptic SPDEs by the implicit Euler scheme at time. We mainly focus on how to solve a system of elliptic SPDEs driven by various kinds of right-hand-side random noises. The kernel-based approximate solution of the elliptic SPDEs is a linear combination of the positive definite kernel with the differential and boundary operators of the SPDEs centered at the chosen collocation points, and its random coefficients are obtained by solving a system of random linear equations, whose random parts are simulated by the elliptic SPDEs. Moreover, we introduce the error bounds – confident intervals – of the kernel-based approximate solutions of the elliptic (parabolic) SPDEs in terms of <b>fill</b> <b>distances</b> (or possible time distances) in the probability sense.

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the curse of dimensionality, {{frequently}} encountered in Big Data analysis, there was a vast development in the field of linear and nonlinear dimension reduction techniques in recent years. These techniques (sometimes referred to as manifold learning) assume that the scattered input data is lying on a lower dimensional manifold, thus the high dimensionality problem can be overcome by learning the lower dimensionality behavior. However, in real life applications, data is often very noisy. In this work, we propose a method to approximate a d-dimensional C^m+ 1 smooth submanifold of ^n (d << n) based upon noisy scattered data points (i. e., a data cloud). We assume that the data points are located "near" the lower dimensional manifold and suggest a non-linear moving least-squares projection on an approximating d-dimensional manifold. Under some mild assumptions, the resulting approximant is shown to be infinitely smooth and of high approximation order (i. e., O(h^m+ 1), where h is the <b>fill</b> <b>distance</b> and m is the degree of the local polynomial approximation). The method presented here assumes no analytic knowledge of the approximated manifold and the approximation algorithm is linear in the large dimension n. Furthermore, the approximating manifold can serve as a framework to perform operations directly on the high dimensional data in a computationally efficient manner. This way, the preparatory step of dimension reduction, which induces distortions to the data, can be avoided altogether...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that univariate cubic spline interpolation, if {{carried out on}} point sets with <b>fill</b> <b>distance</b> h, converges only like O(h^ 2) in L_ 2 [a,b] for functions in W_ 2 ^ 2 [a,b] if no additional assumptions are made. But superconvergence up to order h^ 4 occurs if more smoothness is assumed and if certain additional boundary conditions are satisfied. This phenomenon was generalized in 1999 to multivariate interpolation in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on domains Ω⊂ R^d for continuous positive definite Fourier-transformable shift-invariant kernels on R^d. But the sufficient condition for superconvergence given in 1999 still needs further analysis, because the interplay between smoothness and boundary conditions is not clear at all. Furthermore, if only additional smoothness is assumed, superconvergence is numerically observed {{in the interior of}} the domain, but without explanation, so far. This paper first generalizes the "improved error bounds" of 1999 by an abstract theory that includes the Aubin-Nitsche trick and the known superconvergence results for univariate polynomial splines. Then the paper analyzes what is behind the sufficient conditions for superconvergence. They split into conditions on smoothness and localization, and these are investigated independently. If sufficient smoothness is present, but no additional localization conditions are assumed, it is proven that superconvergence always occurs in the interior of the domain. If smoothness and localization interact in the kernel-based case on R^d, weak and strong boundary conditions in terms of pseudodifferential operators occur. A special section on Mercer expansions is added, because Mercer eigenfunctions always satisfy the sufficient conditions for superconvergence.
