25|$|The idea of uniting the centrist {{components}} of The Olive Tree coalitions, which were divided in many parties, was discussed {{at least since}} 1996. In the 1996 general election there were actually two centrist lists within the Italian centre-left: the Populars for Prodi, including the Italian People's Party (PPI), Democratic Union (UD), the Italian Republican Party (PRI) and the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP), and that of Italian Renewal (RI), including the Italian Socialists (SI), which later merged into the <b>Italian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Socialists</b> (SDI) in 1998, and the Segni Pact (PS). In 1998 splinters from the centre-right coalition formed the Democratic Union for the Republic (UDR), later transformed into Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR), {{in order to support}} the D'Alema I Cabinet. In 1999 splinters of PPI, UD and other groups formed The Democrats (Dem).|$|E
2500|$|The Rose in the Fist {{was officially}} founded on 25 September 2005, when the Italian Radicals, a libertarian-influenced party, officially {{declared}} {{an alliance with}} the <b>Italian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Socialists</b> (SDI) {{in the form of}} a confederation, with explicit references to the politics of Tony Blair, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and Loris Fortuna, an Italian politician in the 1970s who became famous for his laicist proposals, and is considered the father of the law on divorce. This confederation immediately caused a stir for not having signed the political platform of The Union, being the only centre-left party not to do that; the Rose in the Fist, represented by Emma Bonino in the final platform meeting, in fact protested about insufficient mentions of social issues such as legalisation of civil unions. The Socialists, led by Bobo Craxi, who were the breakaway left wing of the New Italian Socialist Party which emerged the House of Freedoms, was supposed to join the Rose in the Fist confederation, but instead reorganised itself in a single party, which however failed to get over the 2% of national votes. However, Bobo Craxi was able to enter in [...] the Lower House, as he was one of the leading candidates for The Olive Tree in Lombardy.|$|E
