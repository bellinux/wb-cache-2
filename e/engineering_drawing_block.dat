40|$|D. Ed. Currently, the passrate for <b>Engineering</b> <b>Drawing</b> {{presented}} at Technical Colleges is unacceptably low. This study {{is an extension}} of an earlier study done in the same studyfield, by the same writer. A need has thus arisen not only to investigate the problem areas responsible for the high drop-out rate in <b>Engineering</b> <b>Drawing,</b> but also to investigate the possibility of the early identification of the potential riskstudent in <b>Engineering</b> <b>Drawing.</b> In an attempt to address this problein further, the aim of this study therefore is to develop an appropriate measuring instrument which may be used to identify the potential riskstudent in <b>Engineering</b> <b>Drawing.</b> Five Technical Colleges on the Eastrand in the Gauteng Province - catering mainly for black students - were included in the investigation. For the research study the "Trade Aptitude Test Battery" (TRAT), compiled by the Human Sciences Research Counil, was used. The results of this study, clearly showed three-dimensional spatial perception (subtest 16 of the TRAT) as the only factor to be used when identifying the potential riskstudent in <b>Engineering</b> <b>Drawing.</b> Subtest 16 of the TRAT could then be used as an "criterion" to identify the potential riskstudent in <b>Engineering</b> <b>Drawing.</b> Lastly this study showed that to master <b>Engineering</b> <b>Drawing</b> requires a great deal of spatial ability. Lecturers presenting this subject will therefore {{have to take into account}} the recommendations of this study as set out in chapter 9 when enrolling students for <b>Engineering</b> <b>Drawing.</b> Subject specific remedial programmes should be utilized to improve the successrate in Engeneering Drawing of the identified potential riskstudent in <b>Engineering</b> <b>Drawing...</b>|$|R
50|$|For centuries, {{until the}} post-World War II era, all <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> was done {{manually}} by using pencil and pen on paper or other substrate (e.g., vellum, mylar). Since {{the advent of}} computer-aided design (CAD), <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> has been done {{more and more in}} the electronic medium with each passing decade. Today most <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> is done with CAD, but pencil and paper have not entirely disappeared.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> {{and artistic}} drawing are {{both types of}} drawing, and either may be called simply [...] "drawing" [...] when the context is implicit. <b>Engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> shares some traits with artistic drawing in that both create pictures. But whereas the purpose of artistic drawing is to convey emotion or artistic {{sensitivity}} in some way (subjective impressions), the purpose of <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> is to convey information (objective facts). One of the corollaries that follow from this fact is that, whereas anyone can appreciate artistic drawing (even if each viewer has his own unique appreciation), <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> requires some training to understand (like any language); {{but there is also}} a high degree of objective commonality in the interpretation (also like other languages). In fact, <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> has evolved into a language that is more precise and unambiguous than natural languages; in this sense it is closer to a programming language in its communication ability. <b>Engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> uses an extensive set of conventions to convey information very precisely, with very little ambiguity.|$|R

40|$|AUTOCAD for Engineers is {{intended}} as a guide especially for Mechanical Engineers to implement AutoCAD specifically to produce <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing.</b> It covers not only 2 D drawing, but also Solid Modelling. The contents of this book are organised in three main parts which gradually introduce readers to AUTOCAD. The {{first part of the}} book focuses on selected basic commands sufficient to begin AutoCAD drawing. Having mastered the basic commands, {{the second part of the}} book introduces readers to more specific commands needed in producing more sophisticated <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing.</b> The topics that are covered include geometry, orthographic drawing, sectioning drawing, and isometric drawing. Once readers have mastered the basic and specific commands, the final part of the book will guide them through the process of implementing solid modelling in the creation of <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing.</b> AUTOCAD for Engineers can be used as a text book or a reference book for AutoCAD-based <b>Engineering</b> <b>Drawing</b> course and can complement any <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> book...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{extensive}} {{number of}} <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> will be referred for planning {{process and the}} changes will produce a good engineering design {{to meet the demand}} in producing a new model. The advantage in reuse of engineering designs is to allow continuous product development to further improve the quality of product development, thus reduce the development costs. However, to retrieve the existing <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing,</b> it is time consuming, a complex process and are expose to errors. <b>Engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> file searching system will be proposed to solve this problem. It is essential for engineer and designer {{to have some sort of}} medium to enable them to search for drawing in the most effective way.
