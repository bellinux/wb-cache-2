5|$|In 2011, {{as part of}} Sheffield City Council's {{drive to}} become {{self-sufficient}} for energy, construction of a biomass power station began. It is operated by E.ON UK, and was completed in 2014. <b>It</b> <b>generates</b> 30megawatts by burning waste wood, sourced from the United Kingdom, and waste heat is captured to provide a district heating scheme.|$|E
5|$|Orkney has {{significant}} wind and marine energy resources, {{and renewable energy}} has recently come into prominence.

5|$|The {{station is}} the second largest {{coal-fired}} power station in Europe, after Bełchatów Power Station in Poland. It produces around 24 terawatt-hours (TWh) (86.4 petajoules) of electricity annually. Although <b>it</b> <b>generates</b> around 1,500,000tonnes of ash and 22,800,000tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, {{it is the most}} carbon-efficient coal-fired power plant in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Broadcast {{syndication}} {{rights to}} South Park were acquired by Debmar-Mercury and Tribune Entertainment in 2003 and 2004 respectively. Episodes further edited for content began running in syndication on September 19, 2005, and are aired in the United States with the TV-14 rating. 20th Television replaced Tribune as co-distributor in early 2008.

5|$|Europe {{accounted}} for 48% {{of the world}} total wind power generation capacity in 2009. In 2010, Spain became Europe's leading producer of wind energy, achieving 42,976 GWh. Germany held the top spot in Europe in terms of installed capacity, {{with a total of}} 27,215 MW as of 31 December 2010. In 2015 wind power constituted 15.6% of all installed power generation capacity in the EU and <b>it</b> <b>generates</b> around 11.4% of its power.|$|E
5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than <b>it</b> <b>generates.</b> Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{like with}} many of the New Trade Theory models, the results of the Brander Spencer model and the policy {{prescriptions}} <b>it</b> <b>generates</b> are very sensitive to the underlying assumptions {{on the nature of the}} industry in question, the information available to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an action and the likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were already noted by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.|$|E

5|$|Information {{from the}} sense organs is {{collected}} in the brain. There {{it is used to}} determine what actions the organism is to take. The brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment. Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} results, <b>it</b> <b>generates</b> motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.|$|E
5|$|The Cruachan station {{temporarily}} stores {{energy at}} times of low demand, and releases it {{at times of}} high demand, when electricity prices are higher, reducing the maximum power that must be provided by power stations. It {{is also used to}} cope with sudden surges in the demand for electricity, such as at the end of television programmes. Despite the use of some rainwater, Cruachan is not a net generator of electricity: it uses more energy for pumping water and spinning its turbines than <b>it</b> <b>generates.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes piano (also {{known as}} the Fender Rhodes piano or simply Fender Rhodes or Rhodes) is an {{electric}} piano invented by Harold Rhodes, which became particularly popular throughout the 1970s. Like a piano, <b>it</b> <b>generates</b> sound using keys and hammers, but instead of strings, the hammers strike thin metal tines, which are then amplified via an electromagnetic pickup which is plugged into an external keyboard amplifier and speaker.|$|E

5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, <b>it</b> <b>generates</b> thermal {{energy in the}} dense core region through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium. During {{this stage of the}} star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.|$|E
5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. <b>It</b> <b>generates</b> a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, <b>it</b> <b>generates</b> a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E

This strategy was successful on the one hand, because <b>it</b> <b>generated</b> promising new ideas and enthusiasm with regional and private parties. But, <b>it</b> <b>generated</b> a deadlock when {{the budget of the}} asset manager didn’t meet the regional expectations, and the integrative dam was focused on a reinforced dam with a reduced integration of regional additions.|$|R
5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: <b>it</b> <b>generates</b> fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E
