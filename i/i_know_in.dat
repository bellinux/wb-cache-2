It's sometimes a nightmare to work with him in the studio because of the pride he puts into the smallest details. If he's not in the right mood or doesn't find the correct words we get nothing done. At times I've spent days in the studio counting seconds with nothing happening. It's the same way now, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> the end the result will be unique and powerful.|$|E

"The town is populous, tho' not large, {{the streets}} broad, but the {{buildings}} old, and low; however, {{there is good}} company {{and a good deal}} of it; and a man that coveted a retreat in this world might as agreeably spend his time, and as well in Dorchester, as in any town <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> England". – Daniel Defoe, in his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1724–1726).|$|E
500|$|Critics' {{responses}} were mixed: some found the film evocative and powerful, whereas others {{saw it as}} slow and frustrating.

500|$|Later authors {{appreciated}} Hebel's work too. Hermann Hesse once commented, [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> no {{literary history}} do we yet read that Hebel {{was the greatest}} German novelist, as great as Keller and more confident and purer and mightier in effect than Goethe." [...] Theodor W. Adorno lauded his essay Die Juden as [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} German prose plays in defence of the Jews". In Die gerettete Zunge, Geschichte einer Jugend, Elias Canetti described the influence that Hebel's Schatzkästlein had on him: [...] "I never wrote a book, but that I did not secretly aspire to his style, and I began by writing everything in shorthand, the knowledge of which I owe to him alone." [...] Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote, [...] "Hebel's stories are among the most beautiful in the German language", and included the [...] "Schatzkästlein" [...] and [...] "Die Rose" [...] in his Kanon Deutscher Literatur. [...] The first was also listed in the ZEIT-Bibliothek der 100 Bücher.|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics have}} {{emphasised}} {{the importance of}} the religious themes in the poem. Vincent Bucklet stated that the Four Quartets [...] "presuppose certain values as necessary for their very structure as poems yet devote that structure to questioning their meaning and relevance. The whole work is, in fact, the most authentic example <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> modern poetry of a satisfying religio-poetic meditation. We sense throughout it is not merely a building-up of an intricate poetic form on the foundation of experiences already over and done with, but a constant energy, an ever-present activity, of thinking and feeling." [...] In his analysis of approaches regarding apocalypse and religious in British poetry, M H Abrams claimed, [...] "Even after a quarter-century, T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets has not lost its status as a strikingly 'modern' poem; its evolving meditations, however, merely play complex variations upon the design and motifs of Romantic representation of the poets educational progress." ...|$|E
500|$|When the emissaries {{returned}} to Buenos Aires, {{the government was}} worried by the defeats of Rondeau at Sipe Sipe and the political stir generated by José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López. Alvarez Thomas appointed Belgrano to head the army at Rosario, but shortly afterwards Thomas resigned. Pueyrredón became the new Supreme Director. With {{the signing of the}} Santo Tomé pact, the aforementioned army was retired from Rosario. Belgrano was then sent back to take command of the Army of the North, with the strong support of San Martín. [...] "In the case of designating who must replace Rondeau, I am decided for Belgrano; he is the most methodical man of all whom <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> America; he is full of integrity and natural talent. He may not have the military knowledge of a Moreau or a Bonaparte as far as the army is concerned, but I think he is the best we have in South America".|$|E

500|$|Tom Shone, {{writing for}} The Sunday Times, praised the novel for its {{atypical}} qualities for Ellis, [...] "known for his orgies of violence". Shone asks [...] "Why {{is a new}} sequel to Less Than Zero... so moving?", noting the presence of [...] "feelings" [...] in the novel to be starkly different from Ellis' usual style. Touching on its personal qualities, Shone notes [...] "If Lunar Park unspooled the atrocities of American Psycho back to their source, Imperial Bedrooms pulls the thread further and reaches Less Than Zero". The emotive energy {{in the new book}} is traced back to the last pages of Lunar Park as well; fellow writer Jay McInerney observes that [...] "The last few pages of [...] are among the most moving passages <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> recent American fiction ... Bret was coming to terms with his relationship with his father in that book." [...] Vice observes that the [...] "final passages in both Imperial Bedrooms and Lunar Park pack a lot of emotional impact." [...] San Francisco Chronicle hails Imperial Bedrooms as [...] "the very definition of authorly meta: Ellis is either so deeply enmeshed in his own creepy little insular world that he can't write his way out of it, or else he is such a genius that he's created an entire parallel universe that folds and unfolds on itself like some kind of Escher print." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was said}} that they learned that those {{who had gone to}} treat with the King would have been fallen upon by armed men and slain... but that Nicholas Exton, the Mayor of London, having refused to countenance the evil, a deep and wicked plot was spread about and the scandal {{gradually}} uncovered.This event must, then, have occurred [...] "within days" [...] of Exton's election as Mayor. It was important, though, for the King to gain the backing of the City of London, and Exton, on his behalf, attempted to achieve this in October 1387 by requesting, unsuccessfully, that all the craft guilds would take an oath of loyalty to Richard. On the other hand, Knighton's Chronical suggests that although the King attempted to force the City to raise an army for royal use, Exton informed him that the inhabitants [...] "were in the main craftsmen and merchants, with no great military experience" [...] and that the only reason they could ever be raised in arms was to defend the city itself. Nevertheless, the King despatched a warrant for the arrest of the rebel lords, and it was the responsibility of Exton to execute it; however, says Jonathan Sumption, Exton [...] "quailed before such a task [...] resolved that the city had no business executing a warrant of this kind." [...] In December that year he authorised the opening of the city gates to the Lords Appellant (although only [...] "once their victory [...] had become certain"). Indeed, he may have actually greeted the lords outside the city gates and accompanied them back into London. Favent reports that the Duke of Gloucester, a leading Appellant, on hearing Exton's pledges of the city's loyalty, remarked [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> truth that liars tell nothing but lies, nor can anyone prevent them from being told." ...|$|E
2500|$|The murders {{committed}} by the Manson [...] "Family" [...] have been described by social commentators {{as one of the}} defining moments of the 1960s. Joan Didion wrote, [...] "Many people <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969, ended at the exact moment when word of the murders on Cielo Drive traveled like brushfire through the community, and in a sense this is true.

2500|$|Ian Parrott {{wrote in}} his book on Elgar that the [...] "dark saying", and {{possibly}} {{the whole of the}} Enigma, had a biblical source, 1 Corinthians 13:12, which in the Authorised Version reads, [...] "For now we see through a glass, darkly (enigmate in the Latin of the Vulgate); but then face to face: now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> part; but then shall I know even as also I am known." [...] The verse is from St. Paul's essay on love. Elgar was a practising Roman Catholic and on 12 February 1899, eight days before the completion of the Variations, he attended a Mass at which this verse was read.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{undergraduate}} at Yale University, Yeston majored in music theory and composition and minored in literature, particularly French, German, and Japanese. [...] Yeston noted, [...] "I am {{as much a}} lyricist as a composer, and the musical theatre is the only genre <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> which the lyrics {{are as important as}} the music." [...] After graduating from Yale in 1967, Yeston attended Clare College at Cambridge University in England. [...] There he belonged to the Footlights dramatics organization and wrote several classical pieces and a musical version of Alice in Wonderland. [...] Alice was eventually produced at the Long Wharf Theatre in Connecticut in 1971. [...] At Cambridge, he focused his musical goals, moving from classical composition to theatre songwriting. [...] Upon earning his master's degree at Cambridge in 1972, Yeston returned to the United States to accept a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, which included a teaching position at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, the country's oldest traditionally black college. [...] At Lincoln, Yeston taught music, art, philosophy, religion, and western civilization, and introduced a course in the history of black music.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2014, the Las Vegas Sun {{featured}} {{an article}} about the adult industry's possible relocation from Southern California to Las Vegas. According to commentary by AVN magazine's political analyst Mark Kernes, the author of the Sun article, Andrea Domanick, [...] "manages to make a few good points—and snags some quotes from Kink.com CEO Peter Acworth". In the article Acworth is quoted as saying, [...] "Vegas is looking more and more attractive as time goes by... I {{think that a lot of}} companies are doing what we’re doing. They’re setting up satellite offices and getting their feet wet with Vegas as a potential place to shoot. The move is happening, but quietly. They don’t want a target on their back." [...] Acworth had announced several weeks earlier that he was shopping for office/production space in Las Vegas. The article also mentions the ease of production relative to California by stating that Nevada requires film permits only for specific locations and conditions. It states, [...] "Shooting on private property, frequently the choice of porn producers, requires no permit or notification, and the state has no explicit regulations about condom use." [...] The article also quotes a technician with knowledge of the mainstream film industry in Southern California and Nevada. Jim Reid of JR Lighting, one of Nevada's largest production rental companies stated, [...] "A lot of people <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> the mainstream industry started out in the adult industry in California. It’s a very good training ground." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shoemaker also {{addressed}} an AA group in Charlotte, North Carolina, June 17, 1962 saying:To {{set the record}} straight, that there has gotten going in AA, a kind of rumor, that I {{had a lot to}} do with the 12 steps. I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it." [...] Praise be to God for it, and for the life of that fellow and all those who where with him in the beginnings of this incredible movement.|$|E
