We recorded local field potentials from the lateral intraparietal area, frontal eye <b>fields,</b> and <b>lateral</b> prefrontal cortex whilemonkeysmaintained variable numbers of visual stimuli inworkingmemory. Behavior suggested independent processing of stimuli in each hemifield. During stimulus presentation, higher-frequency power (50 – 100 Hz) increased with the number of stimuli (load) in the contralateral hemifield, whereas lower-frequency power (8 – 50 Hz) decreased with the total number of stimuli in both hemifields. During thememory delay, lower-frequency power increasedwith contralateral load. Load effects on higher frequencies during stimulus encoding and lower frequencies during the memory delay were stronger when neural activity also signaled the location of the stimuli. Like power, higher-frequency synchrony increased with load, but beta synchrony (16 – 30 Hz) showed the opposite effect, increasing when power decreased (stimulus presentation) and decreasing when power increased (memory delay).
