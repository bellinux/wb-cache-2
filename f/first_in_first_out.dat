40|$|The aim {{for this}} project has been to develop a low cost USB camera, that uses a general purpose {{microcontroller}} to control the image sensor. The camera {{is intended to be}} used in a general purpose development platform at Optronic AB. The development platform is designed to be used in many various projects and thus the camera also has to be as flexible as possible. The origin of the project is an existing product that needed improvements. The predecessor of this camera employed a Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) to generate the control signals to the image sensor, an IBIS 5 -B- 1300 from Cypress semiconductor. In this design, an EZ-USB FX 2 LP microcontroller, also from Cypress semiconductor, will be responsible for generating the necessary control signals for the image sensor. The microcontroller was chosen mainly because it is a high-speed USB microcontroller and that it has a General Programmable Interface (GPIF). The GPIF excludes the need for any additional logic that interfaces the microcontroller to the image sensor. This reduces the total cost of the camera. The microcontroller also has up to four large endpoint <b>First</b> <b>In</b> - <b>First</b> <b>Out</b> (FIFO) queues. The endpoint FIFOs and the GPIF makes the microcontroller suitable for controlling peripheral devices and handling high speed data transfers. The GPIF of the EZ-USB FX 2 LP microcontroller has never been used to control this kind of image sensor before and therefore the aim of the project is also to examine if the microcontroller is up for the task. In case of success the construction will become more cost effective than its predecessor. The switch from CPLD to microcontroller should not {{have an impact on the}} quality of the images produced, but will reduce the cost and increase the flexibility of the system. Even though only one main component is replaced it is necessary to develop a completely new design, for both hardware and software. Mainly in software since code for a CPLD is written in hardware description language such as VHDL or Verilog, and the code for a microcontroller is written in C. But also the hardware is an entirely new design using only small blocks such as power supply from the old design. The work done and considerations made during development of this camera is treated in detail in this report. To facilitate this work a development kit from Cypress semiconductor have been used (CY 3684). The kit includes a development board that employs the EZ-USB FX 2 LP microcontroller and a software development environment including example code. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
5000|$|A {{batch system}} is the {{simplest}} form of digestion. Biomass {{is added to the}} reactor {{at the start of the}} process in a batch and is sealed for the duration of the process. Batch reactors suffer from odour issues that can be a severe problem when they are emptied. Typically biogas production will be formed with a normal distribution pattern over time. The operator can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work it is typically a cheaper form of digestion. In continuous digestion processes organic matter is constantly added (continuous complete mixed)or added in stages to the reactor (continuous plug flow; <b>first</b> <b>in</b> - <b>first</b> <b>out).</b> Here the end products are constantly or periodically removed, resulting in constant production of biogas. A single or multiple digesters in sequence may be used. Examples of this form of anaerobic digestion include continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), low anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), Expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) and Internal circulation reactors (IC).TemperatureThere are two conventional operational temperature levels for anaerobic digesters, which are determined by the species of methanogens in the digesters:• Mesophilic which takes place optimally around 30-38 °C or at ambient temperatures between 20-45 °C where mesophiles are the primary microorganisms present.• Thermophilic which takes place around 49-57 °C at elevated temperatures up to 70 °C where thermophiles are the primary microorganisms present. There are a greater number of species of mesophiles than thermophiles [...] These bacteria are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are therefore considered to be more stable than thermophilicdigestion systems.As mentioned above, thermophilic digestion systems are considered to be less stable, the energy input is higher, and more energy is removed from the organic matter. However, the increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates and hence faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater sterilization of the end digestate. In countries where legislation, such as the Animal By-Products Regulations in the European Union, requires end products to meet certain levels of reduction in the amount of bacteria in the output material, this may be a benefit.Certain processes shred the waste finely and use a short high temperature and pressure pre-treatment (pasteurization / hygienisation) stage that significantly enhances the gas output of the following standard mesophilic stage. The hygienisation process is also applied in order to reduce the pathogenic micro-organisms in the feedstock. Hygienisation / pasteurization may be achieved by using a Landia BioChop hygienisation unit or similar method of combined heat treatment and solids maceration.A drawback of operating at thermophilic temperatures is that more heat energy input is required to achieve the correct operational temperatures. This increase in energy may not be outweighed by the increase in the outputs of biogas from the systems. It is therefore important to consider an energy balance for these systems. There are three principal products of anaerobic digestion: biogas, digestate and water.|$|R
40|$|Danisco Sugar is {{the main}} sugar {{producer}} in Denmark. The sugar is extracted from sugar beets which are harvested during the beet campaign September [...] December. The refined sugar is stored in huge silos and withdrawn on a regular, but not constant, basis for distribution until the next campaign. Danisco Sugar utilizes several types of silos for the storage of crystalline sugar. They differ in construction material e. g. concrete or steel plate silos, dimension, design {{with or without a}} central tower and isolation. Various methods of filling and emptying are utilized, that is <b>first</b> <b>in</b> - last <b>out,</b> or <b>first</b> <b>in</b> - <b>first</b> <b>out.</b> The silos are equipped with one or more facilities for sugar conditioning. Those includes temperature control of walls, control of the condition of the air space above sugar, ability to blow conditioned air through the bulk sugar etc. A number of problems arise when storing sugar for long periods. Due to distribution of heat and moisture the sugar can `cake' or harden and moist sugar is difficult to empty from the silos. The chemical and microbial stability of the sugar is influenced by the temperature and moisture distribution. On the other hand under very dry conditions there is a risk of dust explosions. The object is to control the temperature and moisture content within a lower and an upper limit. Danisco Development Centre wishes to employ mathematical modelling as a tool for understanding and predicting temperature and moisture distribution in sugar stored in silos. In moisture migration the physical processes which have {{to be taken into account}} are diffusion in the porous bulk sugar, natural convection due to temperature gradients, forced convection due to bulk sugar air conditioning, conditioning of the air above the bulk sugar and migration of moisture through concrete silo walls. The temperature distribution is influenced by seasonal variations, the temperature of the air space above the bulk sugar, remixing processes when filling and emptying silos, air conditioning and others. The following physical properties are assumed of importance when formulating models to describe the formation of temperature and moisture gradients: bulk sugar heat capacity, heat conductivity, density, porosity, tortuosity and sorption isotherms. Most will vary with the sugar quality (that is: crystal size, reducing sugar content and ash content), some with temperature and moisture. Mathematical models for moisture and heat conduction in stored cereal grains have previously been developed. In modelling moisture and heat conduction in sugar our starting point is to use the approach applied in modelling moisture and heat conduction in grain and adopt the model to the case of stored sugar, including the possibility of air conditioning. In our modelling carried out during the week of the Study Group, we used a number of simplifying assumptions, such as air flow through the sugar being dominated by forced, and constant, convection, and having processes happening fast enough, so that local equilibrium holds. (Estimates obtained at the time indicated that the temperature varies very little over the length scale of the sugar grains and their interstices. ...|$|R
