5|$|Although McCool {{also played}} as a {{frontline}} batsman during his career, with a first-class average of 32.85 and 18 centuries, his batting performances during the tour were <b>far</b> <b>below</b> his usual standards, garnering only 306 runs at 20.40 with three half-centuries.

5|$|They were {{designed}} to be lighter in weight than their sister locomotives, the Merchant Navy class, to permit use on {{a wider variety of}} routes, including in the south-west of England and the Kent coast. They were a mixed-traffic design, being equally adept at hauling passenger and freight trains, and were used on all types of services, frequently <b>far</b> <b>below</b> their capabilities. A total of 110locomotives were constructed between 1945 and 1950, named after West Country resorts or Royal Air Force (RAF) and other subjects associated with the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|This {{island is}} {{unlikely}} to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra, easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is capped by hard lava flows, which are much more resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material, in {{a process known as}} palagonitization. On Surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not <b>far</b> <b>below</b> the surface.|$|E
5|$|Against the {{background}} of this unrest, Charles faced bankruptcy in mid-1640. The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances, refused to make any loans to the king, as did foreign powers. In this extremity, in July Charles seized silver bullion worth £130,000 held in trust at the mint in the Tower of London, promising its later return at 8% interest to its owners. In August, after the East India Company refused to grant a loan, Lord Cottington seized the company's stock of pepper and spices and sold it for £60,000 (<b>far</b> <b>below</b> its market value), promising to refund the money with interest later.|$|E

5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (<b>far</b> <b>below,</b> far above {{and in the middle}} of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E
5|$|As {{the summer}} of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 {{remained}} <b>far</b> <b>below</b> Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July.

Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced the price to £259.90 {{but by the end of}} the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.|$|E
5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because of the limitations of climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often <b>far</b> <b>below</b> the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E
