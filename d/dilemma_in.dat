5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this <b>dilemma</b> <b>in</b> various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} to world conscience {{was provided by}} an influential 1968 article by Garrett Hardin that critically analyzed the <b>dilemma</b> <b>in</b> which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of conscience-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation {{of the role of}} conscience in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as sustainability and sustainable development of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under United Nations treaties (see common heritage of humanity). Areas designated common heritage of humanity under international law include the Moon, Outer Space, deep sea bed, Antarctica, the world cultural and natural heritage (see World Heritage Convention) and the human genome. It will be a significant challenge for world conscience that as world oil, coal, mineral, timber, agricultural and water reserves are depleted, there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit common heritage of mankind areas.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 12 in a {{total of}} 80 as Australia were caught on a sticky wicket, Fingleton then made 73 in the second innings of the Second Test in Sydney, one of few Australians to resist as the home side fell to an innings defeat after being forced to follow on. Australia were facing a <b>dilemma</b> <b>in</b> the Third Test in Melbourne. The home team scored 200, Fingleton {{contributing}} 38, before rain caused a sticky wicket and England declared at 9/76. However, Australia still had to bat on the treacherous surface, captain Bradman reshuffled the batting lineup, putting the bowlers in first and Fingleton and himself in at Nos. 6 and 7 to save them for more favourable batting conditions. The bowlers managed to survive {{to the end of the}} day's play and the wicket improved overnight. The pair came together with the score at 5/97 and made a Test record sixth-wicket partnership of 346, with Fingleton making 136. It turned the Test and saw Australia ended at 564. The hosts bowled England out for 323 to win the match by 365 runs and prevent England from taking an unassailable 3–0 lead. Fingleton did not pass 20 in his last three innings of the series, as Australia won the remaining two matches to win the series. Fingleton ended with 398 runs at 44.22 in the Tests, and 631 runs at 33.21 overall.|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{this thesis is about}} CSR dilemmas, {{and the main}} {{objective}} of the study is to research the CSR <b>dilemmas</b> <b>in</b> China based on the analysis of data. The study adopts qualitative research methods and is constructed by qualitatively analyzing 40 data articles. The 40 data articles are the journal articles coming from the Database of Chinese Academic Journals from the year 2005 to 2008. This study is mainly constructed by two phases of literature review. The first phase of literature review presents the theoretical background of my study and the second phase of literature review is focused on analyzing 40 data articles to study the CSR <b>dilemmas</b> <b>in</b> China. The results demonstrate that there are lots of CSR <b>dilemmas</b> existing <b>in</b> China. On the basis of data article analysis, the CSR <b>dilemmas</b> <b>in</b> China can be classified into four categories. They are the dilemmas coming from corporation themselves, the dilemmas coming from government side, the <b>dilemmas</b> rooted <b>in</b> the society and the other kinds of dilemmas. Under each category, there are several themes addressing the specific behavior of CSR <b>dilemmas</b> <b>in</b> China. Furthermore, the result also presents that some CSR <b>dilemmas</b> <b>in</b> China have their corresponding theoretical framework in first phase of literature review of my study, and some CSR <b>dilemmas</b> <b>in</b> China possess typical Chinese characteristics.

5|$|Although the {{exchange}} rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem {{now known as the}} Triffin <b>dilemma,</b> <b>in</b> which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{is still}} in a <b>dilemma</b> <b>in</b> who to choose from between CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) and his high school {{sweetheart}} Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore). Avery decides not to be Jack's date to Cerie's wedding, and that while she is gone, Jack should think about whether or not he wants to be with her. As soon as Avery leaves, Nancy shows up at the 30 Rock building unannounced, and decides to spend the weekend with Jack. Liz tries {{to talk him out of}} going on a date with Nancy, after he asked her for advice. He decides to keep things platonic with Nancy, so that no problem ensues in his decision to choose between them, but Jack ends up sleeping with Nancy. The next morning, Nancy admits that the two spending the night together was a big deal, as Jack was the first man she slept with after her divorce. At Floyd's wedding, Jack tells Nancy about Avery, and as a result, Nancy threatens to leave him forever once the ceremony is over. While Liz gives a reading, Jack texts her to stall, resulting in Liz reading inappropriate scripture recitations at the wedding.|$|E

25|$|While {{the current}} {{central role of}} the dollar does give the US some advantages, such as lower cost of borrowings, it also {{contributes}} to the pressure causing the U.S. to run a current account deficit, due to the Triffin <b>dilemma.</b> <b>In</b> a November 2009 article published in Foreign Affairs magazine, economist C.

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, Léopold III, who had {{surrendered}} {{himself to the}} German army in 1940, was released; however, {{the issue of whether}} he had betrayed his country by surrendering, while most government ministers had escaped to the United Kingdom, presented an important constitutional <b>dilemma.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the Belgian public was concerned that he might be a collaborator with the Nazis. He had met Hitler in Berchtesgaden on November 19, 1940 and had even remarried (to Lilian Baels) during the war. Many Belgians, especially the Socialists, strongly opposed his return to power. He was kept in exile in Switzerland until 1950, while his brother Prince Charles presided as regent.|$|E
25|$|Values such {{as these}} do not give answers {{as to how to}} handle a {{particular}} situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a <b>dilemma</b> <b>in</b> medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members. For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse blood transfusions, considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.|$|E

25|$|In the prisoner's dilemma with {{third party}} punishment, {{two of the}} {{participants}} play a prisoner's <b>dilemma,</b> <b>in</b> which each must choose to either cooperate or defect. The game is set up such that {{regardless of what the}} other player does, it is rational for an income maxizer to always choose to defect, even though both players cooperating yields a higher payoff than both players defecting. A third player observes this exchange, then can pay to punish either player. An income maximizing third parties' rational response would be to not punish, and income maximizing players would choose to defect. A 2004 study demonstrates that a near majority of participants (46%) are willing to pay to punish if one participant defects. If both parties defect, 21% are still willing to punish.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{diagnostic}} <b>dilemma</b> <b>in</b> otherwise normal boys is distinguishing a retractile testis from a testis {{that will not}} descend spontaneously into the scrotum. Retractile testes are more common than truly undescended testes and {{do not need to}} be operated on. In normal males, as the cremaster muscle relaxes or contracts, the testis moves lower or higher ("retracts") in the scrotum. This cremasteric reflex is much more active in infant boys than older men. A retractile testis high in the scrotum can be difficult to distinguish from a position in the lower inguinal canal. Though there are various maneuvers used to do so, such as using a cross-legged position, soaping the examiner's fingers, or examining in a warm bath, the benefit of surgery in these cases can be a matter of clinical judgment.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli {{economy is}} driven by {{industries}} based on electronics, computers and communication technologies, the result of over 50 years of investment in the country’s defence infrastructure. Israeli defence industries have traditionally focused on electronics, avionics and related systems. The development of these systems has given Israeli high-tech industries a qualitative edge in civilian spin-offs in the software, communications and Internet sectors. However, the next waves of high technologies are expected to emanate from other disciplines, including molecular biology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, material sciences and chemistry, in intimate synergy with information and communication technologies. These disciplines {{are rooted in the}} basic research laboratories of universities rather than the defence industries. This poses a <b>dilemma.</b> <b>In</b> the absence of a national policy for universities, let alone for the higher education system as a whole, {{it is not clear how}} these institutions will manage to supply the knowledge, skills and human resources needed for these new science-based industries.|$|E
