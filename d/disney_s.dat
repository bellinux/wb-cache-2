40|$|Considered a {{children}} s picture book classic, J. M. Barrie s Peter Pan script and subsequent versions (including <b>Disney</b> <b>s</b> platinum boxed DVD set) had their origin in Barrie s earlier text entitled Little White Bird. This latter text is now recognised as an autobiographical treatise on paedophilia {{in general and}} Barrie s obsession with one young boy in particular. Literary myth has also suggested that this text appeared in a men s only magazine, which had paedophiliac leanings, as perhaps the first sealed centrefold. With the exception of Rose s 1 brief mention of this publication which fits into her belief that in Pan - murkiness {{is not so much}} hidden underneath as running all along the seams - few analytic readings of Barrie s text deal with the transtextual nature of Peter Pan or how it relates to the concept of evil. Using the principles of Lakoff s - folk theory of language -, this paper argues that because Peter Pan arose in a time and place when Freudian psychology was on the rise, and when Barrie had begun to wrestle with what he perceived to be the social epitome of evil, Peter Pan represents a polyvalent autobiography of liminality, in which the surface plot is underpinned by - where the elements of culture and society are released from their customary configurations and recombined in, bizarre or terrifying ways -. In other words, Barrie 2 ̆ 7 s language use represents - heavy words lightly thrown -, an untapped definition of evil couched in the language of {{a children}} s text...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} the Walt Disney Company in all its {{numerous}} forms - {{what might be called}} the multiple-Disney - is a valuable source for cultural study because it offers an opportunity to trace the evolution of a small American entertainment institution into the powerful site of cultural production it is today. The rise of the company coincides with the rise of America in the 20 th century, and the content of Disney's output and its marketing methods shed light on how the nation's beloved company has consistently trained children to become consumers. Through its varied texts, the corporation s success at projecting itself into the roles of storyteller and historian, educator and entertainer all with profit as the ultimate goal has resulted in a conflation of these roles. For Disney to manage its multiplicity is no easy task, however, because these roles often diverge during the production and distribution of many of the corporation s products. The company s treatment of race and ethnicity, its sexual politics and its capacity as pedagogue are some of the contentious issues for which both the original Walt Disney and the modern Corporate Disney have been praised and criticized by diverse voices. These themes are discussed in the thesis, with the formal analysis concentrating on two semi-historical films, "Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier"(1955) and "Pocahontas" (1995). The corporation s controversial history theme park project of the early 1990 s, <b>Disney</b> <b>s</b> America, is also addressed. Throughout, the company s cultural representations are examined in a socio-economic context, and close readings of these primary sources reveal surprisingly political messages...|$|E

5000|$|Long {{before their}} {{popularity}} {{on network television}} from the 2000s onward, reality competition shows {{in one form or}} another, such as Star Search and American Gladiators, enjoyed popularity in syndication as early as the mid-1980s. Since the now-defunct networks UPN and The WB began offering their affiliates additional nights of prime time programming in the late 1990s, there have been fewer first-run scripted series in syndication, at least, in the U.S.; much as with the closing of windows that provided opportunity for Ziv in the 1950s and various producers in the early 1970s. The more expensive dramatic projects are less attractive to syndicators (particularly when they might be sold, with somewhat less risk, to cable channels); [...] "reality" [...] series such as Cheaters and Maximum Exposure and several dating series began to be more common in the early 2000s. Some of the more low-key programs in this category were designed to appeal to children, such as Beakman's World, <b>Disney's</b> <b>Sing</b> Me A Story with Belle, Animal Rescue and Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures. They were able to get significant clearance because of stricter Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforcement of rules on children's television programming.|$|R
