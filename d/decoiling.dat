5000|$|Kuhn {{began to}} work for his {{doctorate}} by investigating <b>decoiling</b> of a random coiled chain molecule in a flowing viscous solvent. Werner Kuhn suggested him to replace the random coil by a dumbbell-model. Kuhn {{was fascinated by the}} model's simplicity and by its great success in theoretically analyzing a broad variety of experiments in quantitative terms. This experience and his postdoctoral work with Linus Pauling and Niels Bohr, supported this fascination for powerful simple models and was determining for his life's work in research.|$|E

Abstract：A {{steel plate}} with thickness（ 3 ~ 12 ）mm named 30 CrMo（%： 0. 29 ~ 0. 34 C, 0. 17 ~ 0. 37 Si, 0. 40 ~ 0. 70 Mn, ≤ 0. 015 P, ≤ 0. 010 S, ≤ 0. 30 Mo, 0. 80 ~ 1. 10 Cr）was developed by converter melting and hot continuous rolling. Good metallurgical quality, mechanical properties and strip shape are ensured by accurately control of smelting, rolling, coiling and <b>decoiling</b> process. The {{results show that}} 30 CrMo steel has high purity, uniform structure and stable properties, perfect plate shape, and meets requirements of consumer...|$|E

The incidence of reported complications is somewhat similar to that for non-stimulating catheters. However, as many stimulating catheters contain a coiled steel wire for optimal stimulation, they may cause specific complications. Clinical features: In this report, we present two cases of complicated removals of stimulating catheters. During both removals, {{a part of the}} metal wire was left “decoiled” next to the supraclavicular and interscalene plexus, respectively. The strategies used to determine steel wire localization and a description of the successful removal of these steel wires are included in this report. Conclusion: Catheter separation and problems with residual metal wire components of stimulating catheters seem to be a rare but specific problem during removal. Anesthesiologists should strictly avoid catheter shearing during insertion, adhere to the manufacturer’s instructions, and take care during catheter removal. Manufacturers should focus on technical solutions to avoid rare but relevant complications such as catheter tip <b>decoiling</b> and separation of stimulating catheters during removal.

40|$|Polymeric {{multilayer}} {{films are}} self-assembled by alternating electrostatic adsorption of a coloured polyanion and UV-labeled polycations which exhibit polysoap characteristics. Film thicknesses grow linearly with the adsorption cycles, albeit the films grown from salt-free aqueous solutions are very thin. Accordingly, the hydrophobically associating polymers <b>decoil</b> completely upon adsorption. The adsorption process is {{very sensitive to}} short drying or to intermittent storage periods. Also, the films are apparently prone to certain structural rearrangements. Reactive groups contained in the polyelectrolytes can be employed for reactions with low molar mass reagents diffusing in, but the reactivity of internal layers is limited. The reactions take place without disintegration of the films, on the contrary, the smoothness of the films is improved after the chemical reaction...|$|R
40|$|Polyelectrolyte multilayers PEMs {{produced}} by layer by layer LbL self assembly find different applications. Often the PEMs {{are exposed to}} mechanical stress which they have to sustain. A correlation of the mechanical properties of PEM on macroscopic level with the ordering of polyelectrolyte molecules on molecular level is of interest. Our study {{is focused on the}} changes of orientation of the polyelectrolyte molecules when the PEM is under lateral mechanical stress. The PEM was prepared from pyrene PY labeled polystyrene sulfonate PSS PY and poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride PDDA on sheets of polydimethylsiloxane PDMS rubber used as substrates. The LbL dipping technique was used for the formation of PEMs. A special stretching device was constructed which allows the fluorescence of the films under stress to be observed. The change in the fluorescence spectra which can be attributed to a PYordering change from the PEM under stress of up to 10 was monitored. We observed that PEMs undergo a plastic deformation under external mechanical stretching. We conclude that under mechanical stress the polyelectrolyte molecules organized in polyelectrolyte multilayers experience an irreversible transition from the coiled to <b>decoiled</b> stat...|$|R
40|$|The {{functionalization}} of polyelectrolyte multilayers often {{implies the}} use of bulky functional fragments, attached to a standard polyelectrolyte matrix. Despite of the high density of non-charged, often hydrophobic substituents, regular film growth by sequential adsorption proceeds easily when an appropriate polyelectrolyte counter ion is chosen. However, the functional fragments may cluster or aggregate. This complication is particularly evident when using chromophores and fluorophores as bulky pendant groups. Attention has {{to be paid to}} this phenomenon for the design of functional polyelectrolyte films, as aggregation may modify crucially the properties. The use of charged spacer groups does not necessarily suppress the aggregation of functional side groups. Still, clustering and aggregation depend on the detailed system employed, and are not obligatory. In the case of cationic poly(acrylamide) s labeled with naphthalene and pyrene fluorophores, for instance, the polymers form intramolecular hydrophobic associates in solution, as indicated by strong excimer formation. But the polymers can undergo a conformational rearrangement upon adsorption so that they are <b>decoiled</b> in the adsorbed films. Analogous observations are made for polyanions bearing mesogenic biphenyls fragments. In contrast, polycations functionalized with the dye coumarin 343 show little aggregation in solution, but a marked aggregation in the ESA films...|$|R
