A survey of airlines showed that radio communications are mainly role-played by Instructor/Evaluators (I/Es), which increases I/E workload but reduces pilot workload. Opinions gathered from I/Es and the literature indicate that this may lead to inadequate preparation of pilots to handle the complex radio-communications environment encountered in the air.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} employing a proba- bilistic fault detection approach relative {{the performance of a}} deterministic network monitoring method. The approach has its foundation in probabilistic network management, in which performance limits and thresholds are specified in terms of e. g. probabilities or belief values. When combined with adap- tive mechanisms, probabilistic approaches can potentially offer improved controllability, adaptivity and reliability, compared to deterministic monitoring methods. Results from synthetically generated and real network QoS measurements indicate that the probabilistic approach generally can perform at least as good as a deterministic algorithm, with a higher degree of predictable performance and resource-efficiency. Due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, worse performance than expected is sometimes observed. Nevertheless, the results <b>give</b> <b>additional</b> <b>support</b> to some of the practical benefits expected in using probabilistic approaches for network management purposes...|$|E

There were no statistically significant differences between the groups concerning IgM positivity, distribution of IgG subclasses, or lymphoproliferative response to HHV- 6.
