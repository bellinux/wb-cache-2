500|$|Leroux {{stated that}} {{at a very early}} age, she knew she wanted to play for the United States women's {{national}} soccer team. To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy. It {{was probably one of the}} most difficult things I ever had to do, move away from everything that I knew and was comfortable with to something that I had no idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it. Now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> prove myself, and that's what I enjoy, and that's why I did what I did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Madame Nhu exerted {{influence}} with her fiery attitude, often abusing Diệm and Nhu, who bowed to her angry tirades. Madame Nhu was frequently mocked {{by the media}} for her ostentatious flaunting of power, and was sometimes called the [...] "Dragon Lady", as well as [...] "Lucretia Borgia" [...] and [...] "Queen Bee". She once stated [...] "Power is wonderful. Total power is totally wonderful." [...] In Vietnam, Madame Nhu was called the Tiger Lady as dragons are considered lucky and benevolent (mythical) animals in Vietnamese culture that are the wise and kindly friends of humanity whereas the tiger is considered a symbol of ferocity, and many Vietnamese found the term [...] "Dragon Lady" [...] mystifying and insulting. [...] She once {{told a group of}} American congressmen, [...] "I'm not exactly afraid of death. I love power and in the next life <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be even more powerful than I am." [...] U.S. Defense Secretary McNamara noted that [...] "I saw Madame Nhu as bright, forceful, and beautiful, but also diabolical and scheming—a true sorceress." ...|$|E
2500|$|Court {{hearings}} {{began in}} spring 2006. The accused {{maintained that the}} assassination was staged by Chubais himself. In November–December 2006 Karvatko changed his testimony accusing the investigators in undue pressure and threats. He {{said that he was}} abducted by police soon after assassination attempt and tortured. He agreed to slander defendants after his kidnappers threatened to imprison his wife and showed him a forged protocol of the search in his apartment illegal ammunition and narcotics had been found. He provided audio recordings of some of his conversations with militia officers pressuring him, but the judge refused to make an examination of this tape and to file it to the case. Right away after that Karvatko's statement the jury panel was dismissed {{at the request of the}} prosecutor who stated the jury could no longer remain unbiased when they heard how Karvatko's testimony had been obtained. Only the initial of Karvatko's testimonies had been considered valid by court. While the lawyers of the plaintiff insisted that Karvatko was pressured by the suspects and their friends, Tatiana Mironova, mother of another suspect, Ivan Mironov, publicly accused investigators in torturing Karvatko. In December 2006 the court was restarted with the a new jury. As of December 2007, jury had been dismissed again, and hearings continued with the third jury. Pro-Kremlin liberal media pleaded for [...] "tough sentences," [...] to cool [...] "folk avengers" [...] and finally, after three years of imprisonment Kvachkov, Naydenov and Yashin were acquitted by the court on 5 June 2008. After the acquittal of Kvachkov, Chubais made statement saying that he has no doubts that Kvachkov was responsible for the assassination, and that it was Kvachkov who personally tried to shoot him in March 2005. On the other hand, he believes that acquittal of the guilty is better than sentencing of innocent Kvachkov, in retaliation, called the attack on Chubais the [...] "first act of armed resistance in the national liberation war", Around the same time, Kvachkov said [...] "now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> finish what I started", meaning his doctoral thesis, but some media quoted it out of context. Still he maintained that he did not participate in the assassination and that it was staged by Chubais himself to divert attention from his business problems The case returned to court again after the prosecution's appeal. The new trial started on 29 September 2008. The next court session was postponed until 13 October because only 6 out of 500 potential jurors arrived to court on the day the jury selection was scheduled to begin. On 13 October 2008 the case was sent by court back to the prosecution after the judge received Kvachkov's case and Ivan Mironov's case as two separate cases. The judge sent both cases back to the prosecutor so that they could be merged into one case. The trial on a new merged case began on 23 November 2009. On 21 August 2010 the jury found that there was not enough evidence presented in the persecutor case and all the defendants were acquitted again.|$|E
