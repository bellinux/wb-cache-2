5|$|This {{interpretation}} <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> to visualize, {{with little}} danger of ambiguity. It is also useful in higher mathematics; for the rigorous definition it inspires, see Natural numbers below. However, {{it is not}} obvious how one should extend this version of addition to include fractional numbers or negative numbers.|$|E
5|$|A nondeterministic {{algorithm}} {{for determining}} whether a 2-satisfiability instance is not satisfiable, using only a logarithmic amount of writable memory, <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> to describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable v and search (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications leading from v to its negation {{and then back to}} v. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, it is also possible in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.|$|E

5|$|Another {{advantage}} of digital systems over analog {{is that their}} output <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to store in memory, i.e. two voltage states (high and low) <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> to store than a continuous range of states.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested that the area continued to be exploited. It <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> to see why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E
50|$|Acculturation {{that is a}} main {{aspect of}} {{learning}} a language <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> {{in the case of}} second language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to use for learners.|$|R
30|$|Findings from Table  7 {{suggest that}} {{students}} {{agreed that they}} enjoyed using the haptics device for learning and the technology <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> to interact with. On average, the students agreed that they enjoyed learning physics with haptic devices, haptic devices <b>were</b> <b>easy</b> to use and the force feedback <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> to <b>be</b> interpreted. Also, they unanimously disagreed that interacting with haptic devices or interpreting force feedback required a lot of mental effort.|$|R

5|$|CsF is more soluble than sodium {{fluoride}} or potassium fluoride. It {{is available in}} anhydrous form, and if water has been absorbed it <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> to dry by heating at 100°C for two hours in vacuo. CsF reaches a vapor pressure of 1 kilopascal at 825°C, 10 kPa at 999°C, and 100 kPa at 1249°C.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{always being}} found in {{combination}} with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite, cerium <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium. It is the 26th most abundant element, making up 66ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead.|$|E
5|$|Mota {{has three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a circle changeup. The slider is the pitch he usually uses to get outs. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for him, though, and his fastball <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> to hit when thrown over the plate. In the past, he has thrown a splitter and a curveball.|$|E
50|$|It's a small {{library with}} lots of functionality, {{accurately}} documented and thoroughly tested. Good library naming conventions are not rigorously observed {{on the principle that}} common operations should always <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to write and code should always <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to read.|$|R
50|$|Some {{argue that}} the {{explicit}} if/then statement <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to read and that it may compile to more efficient code than the ternary operator, while others argue that concise expressions <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> to read than statements spread over several lines.|$|R
2500|$|As well, rental {{systems for}} non-professionals need to <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> {{to use and}} set up, and they must <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to repair and {{maintain}} for the renting company. From this perspective, speaker cabinets need to have easy-to-access horns, speakers, and crossover circuitry, so that repairs or replacements can be made. [...] Some rental companies often rent powered amplifier-mixers, mixers with onboard effects, and powered subwoofers for use by non-professionals, which <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> {{to set up and}} use.|$|R
5|$|The main {{commercial}} and leisure {{areas of the}} town are located around the north coast, where there <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> access to the pleasure beach. The industrial areas are in the west, beside the wetlands and the River Medway. The Bluetown industrial area and the Port of Sheerness are in the north-western part of the town. The residential districts of Mile Town and Marine Town are in the central and the eastern areas respectively.|$|E
5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E

30|$|We {{could make}} some {{predictions}} about which transitions <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> to obtain and which instead require one to cross {{regions of the}} unfolding where {{the system is not}} bursting. We also clarified why transitions <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> to obtain for hysteresis-loop bursters than for slow-wave ones.|$|R
50|$|The lateral {{tensioner}} has {{the advantage}} that the clutch cover <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to mount but the disadvantage {{that it is more}} difficult to reach nearby the bar. Tensioners through the clutch cover <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> to operate, but the clutch cover is more difficult to attach.|$|R
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> {{to grow and}} ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> to grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter {{to allow for}} new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as yellowing (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advocates of}} E-Prime have not proven that it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> to {{eliminate}} the verb {{to be from the}} English language than it is to eliminate just the is-of-identity and the is-of-predication. It may well <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to do the latter for many people.|$|R
