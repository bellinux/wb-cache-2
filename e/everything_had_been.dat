5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had {{little in the way of}} fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E

25|$|Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo later {{asked the}} POC to reconsider their decision, {{requesting}} instead that popular Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao {{be given the}} honor of carrying the flag. Pacquiao was not a competitor at the games, but had recently won the World Boxing Council lightweight title in a highly publicized fight against David Diaz. POC president Jose Cojuangco agreed with the president's decision, saying having Pacquiao as flag bearer would be a morale booster to the athletes. Though the deadline for changing of the national contingent's composition in the Olympiad has already elapsed, special arrangements were made for Pacquiao to be given accreditation. On July 9, 2008, POC announced that <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> cleared for Pacquiao to be official flag bearer. Miguel Molina, who did not mind yielding the honor to Pacquiao, was instead given the role of flag bearer at the closing ceremony.|$|E

25|$|In July 1991, the Mafia pentito Francesco Marino Mannoia {{claimed that}} Calvi {{had been killed}} because he had lost Mafia funds when Banco Ambrosiano collapsed. According to Mannoia, the killer was Francesco Di Carlo, a mafioso living in London at the time, on the orders of boss Giuseppe Calò and Licio Gelli. When Di Carlo became an {{informer}} in June 1996, he denied he was the killer, but admitted he had been approached by Calò to do the job. However, Di Carlo {{could not be reached}} in time. When he later called Calò, the latter said that <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken care of. According to Di Carlo, the killers were Vaccari and Vincenzo Casillo, who belonged to the Camorra from Naples and were later killed. In 1997, Italian prosecutors in Rome implicated Calò in Calvi's murder, along with Flavio Carboni, a Sardinian businessman with wide-ranging interests. Two other men, Di Carlo and Ernesto Diotallevi, were also alleged {{to be involved in the}} killing.|$|E
25|$|As <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done to {{help the}} passengers, and when nothing else {{could be done to}} save them, Mr Russell and people from all over Kilkee took in {{survivors}} from the disaster for the night. The next morning the extent of the disaster became apparent with bodies and wreckage strewn across the whole beach. As the day wore on it became known that of the 216 aboard, 98 lost their lives and 118 were saved. All day, bodies washed up on the beach and in the end 54 bodies were recovered. Most of the deceased were buried in the nearby Kilfiera graveyard. To help the survivors, a subscription was held with businessmen from all over Ireland and England contributing to it. In the end over £300 was raised, all going to the survivors and to the next of kin of the dead. As Ireland {{was in the middle of}} a famine, many poor people looted the ship, with some going as far as stripping the clothes from the dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{restoration}} of Suur Tõll {{has been an}} enormous task which has included cleaning garbage accumulated in the ship {{over the years and}} finding the missing fittings, including the helm that had been swapped to a steering wheel of a truck during the night before the departure and the large bronze bell of the icebreaker which was found in a military museum in Leningrad. However, not <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stolen — for example, the old German piano was still in the saloon because it was too big to be transported away. While the original piano was destroyed in the First World War, the current musical instrument is from the same manufacturer and dates back to the early 20th century. Despite the limited funding and materials, Suur Tõll was largely restored during the 1990s. In 1997, it was found out that the rivets under the waterline were leaking water and the icebreaker was drydocked at Balti Laevaremonditehas {{for the first time since}} 1986. However, over the years the hull of the old icebreaker had deteriorated even further, flooding the tanks with a mixture of water and black oil. In 2011, the Estonian Maritime Administration requested the Estonian Maritime Museum to draw up a restoration plan to save the vessel. In September 2013, Suur Tõll was closed for renovations which included extensive repairs to the hull in a dry dock. While the icebreaker retained her 1950s post-refit outfit, the saloon was restored to its original 1910s art nouveau style. She was re-opened to visitors in 2014.|$|E

The decision to take five men forward involved recalculations of weights and rations, since <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> based on four-men teams.|$|E
500|$|In January 1981 Tiefenthaeler gave Kujau's {{telephone}} number to Heidemann, telling the journalist {{to ask for}} [...] "Mr Fischer", one of Kujau's aliases. During the subsequent phone call Kujau told Heidemann that there were 27 volumes of Hitler's diaries, the original manuscript of the unpublished third volume of Mein Kampf, an opera by the young Hitler called [...] (Wieland the Blacksmith), numerous letters and unpublished papers, and several of Hitler's paintings—most of which were still in East Germany. Heidemann offered twomillion DMs for the entire collection and guaranteed secrecy until <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> brought over the border. Although the pair did not agree to a deal, they agreed to [...] "the foundations of a deal", according to Harris; Kujau's condition {{was that he would}} only deal directly with Heidemann, something that suited the journalist as a way of keeping other members of Stern away from the story.|$|E

2500|$|A greater problem {{surfaced}} after 1890 {{with the}} establishment of the County Championship because, as described above, this gave rise in 1895 to the concept of first-class cricket and so, for the first time, there was a perceived higher standard based on organisation of games in an official competition. Until then, <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> somewhat ad hoc and [...] "playing standards" [...] was a term applied very liberally, especially with teams containing guest or occasional players in addition to recognised players.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Great Music of the Ainur {{stood as}} {{template}} {{for all of}} history and all of material creation in the Middle-earth cycle (it was first sung before Time, and then the universe was made in its image), there was an aspect of everything in Middle-earth that came of Melkor’s malign influence; <b>everything</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> [...] "corrupted". Tolkien elaborates on this in Morgoth's Ring, drawing an analogy between the One Ring, into which Sauron committed much of his power, and all of Arda—"Morgoth's Ring"—which contains and is corrupted by the residue of Melkor's power until the Remaking of the World.|$|E

Soon afterwards, more and more staffers came forwards with evidence that Hwayoung had been disrespectful to the other members as well as stylists, and had faked how severe her initial injury was in order to get more sympathy. Hwayoung initially tried to deny the rumours, lashing out at the staffers in return, but eventually admitted that the texts were real. After suffering from an intense backlash, including being removed from several television shows, Hwayoung deleted her Instagram account.|$|E
