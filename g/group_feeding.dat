5|$|Although Allosaurus {{may have}} hunted in packs, {{it has been}} argued that Allosaurus and other theropods had largely {{aggressive}} interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among vertebrates in general, and modern diapsid carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and cannibalize intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple Allosaurus individuals at the same site, e.g. in the Cleveland–Lloyd Quarry, are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that Allosaurus individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern <b>group</b> <b>feeding</b> sites of animals like crocodiles and Komodo dragons. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites. There is some evidence for cannibalism in Allosaurus, including Allosaurus shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a shoulder blade, and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites.|$|E

25|$|Crocodiles are {{the most}} social of reptiles. Even though they do not form social groups, many species congregate in certain {{sections}} of rivers, tolerating each other at times of feeding and basking. Most species are not highly territorial, {{with the exception of}} the saltwater crocodile, which is a highly territorial and aggressive species. A mature male will not tolerate any other males at any time of the year. Most other species are more flexible. There is a certain form of hierarchy in crocodiles: the largest and heaviest males are at the top, having access to the best basking site, while females are priority during a <b>group</b> <b>feeding</b> of a big kill or carcass. A good example of the hierarchy in crocodiles would be the case of the Nile crocodile. This species clearly displays all of these behaviours. Studies in this area are not thorough, however, and many species are yet to be studied in greater detail. Mugger crocodiles are also known to show toleration in group feedings and tend to congregate in certain areas. However, males of all species are aggressive towards each other during mating season, to gain access to females.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whale pods off {{southern}} California {{have been}} observed in three different groups: traveling/hunting <b>groups,</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>groups</b> and loafing groups. In traveling/hunting groups, individuals position themselves in chorus lines stretching two miles long, {{with only a few}} whales underneath. Sexual and age-class segregation apparently occurs in these <b>groups.</b> In <b>feeding</b> <b>groups,</b> individuals are very loosely associated, but may move in the same direction. In loafing groups, whales number between 12 and 30 individuals resting. Mating and other behaviors may take place.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are many}} species of birds that use the {{foraging}} practices of the Eciton burchellii {{as a source of}} food. When the ant colony swarms the forest leaf litter, arthropods flee, which are then eaten by the birds, lizards, insects, and even some mammals that attend the raids. [...] However, this source of food can be unpredictable, as the Eciton burchellii colonies' raiding zones are always shifting. It has been shown that the obligate army ant-following antbird Phaenostictus mcleannani uses a network of individuals to locate swarms. Each mated pair of birds holds a single dominance zone that they control, which {{is part of a larger}} non-exclusive feeding zone occupied by other mated pairs. Consequently, a single mated pair may track several colonies a day by drawing on the collective knowledge of this larger network. Departure calls can be used as cues to tell the other mate where the location of the raid is. However, it has been shown that there is little opportunity for kin selection to influence <b>group</b> <b>feeding</b> in the antbirds.|$|E

50|$|The ICH {{may also}} {{not apply to}} all species, as there are {{variations}} in hunting and scavenging behaviors.

Several heron species are also highly territorial and do not allow for conspecific feeding. Some studies of gulls also show that colony members did not follow the knowledgeable gulls. In these cases, gull foraging behavior might be better explained by local transfer of information.|$|E
50|$|Two generations occur per year. The female lays up {{to three}} {{clutches}} of eggs in a season. A clutch contains 60 to 80 light orange eggs, each about 7 to 8 mm wide. The eggs stick together in a frothy mass and the female deposits the mass up to 3 cm deep in the soil. In 3 to 4 weeks, the nymphs emerge and dig to the surface.

50|$|In some species, croaking is {{used for}} {{communication}} aside from attracting mates. For those species that have year-round croaking ability, the croaks {{may serve as a}} low-aggression warning during <b>group</b> <b>feeding,</b> as well as to communicate location in cloudy water. In those species that lack the ability to croak year-round, croaking is usually restricted to males for attracting mates. A disadvantage to the croaking ability is that it allows bottlenose dolphin to easily locate large groups of croaker and drum as they broadcast their position, indicating large amounts of food for the dolphins.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{communal}} {{shelters and}} scent marking, red-footed tortoises also show {{other signs of}} semisocial behavior such as lack of aggression at feeding sites, not protecting territory, and <b>group</b> <b>feeding</b> at fruit falls and carrion (although {{it is not unusual}} for one tortoise to block access or even try to make off with some of the food). Red-footed tortoises often follow each other, usually a smaller one following a larger and quite often males following males, but all combinations are seen. They have also been observed following apparent scent trails laid by an individual a day or two earlier.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} social monitoring and feeding competition on foraging success {{in relation to the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>group</b> size of wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). Social monitoring is visual scanning by group members that assists them in following their own group. Individuals in smaller <b>feeding</b> <b>groups</b> may frequently use social monitoring while foraging, because they have an increased risk of losing their group. Therefore, social monitoring could be a cost for group-foraging animals. We made four predictions: (1) individuals in smaller <b>feeding</b> <b>groups</b> tend to abandon food patches to follow group members; (2) social monitoring frequency is higher in smaller feeding groups; (3) feeding rate decreases with increased social monitoring frequency; and (4) feeding rate initially increases with <b>feeding</b> <b>group</b> size because decreased social monitoring outweighs increased feeding competition, but after the <b>feeding</b> <b>group</b> reaches a certain size, feeding rate declines with increasing <b>feeding</b> <b>group</b> size due to the high costs of feeding competition. These predictions were supported by our results. Thus, the relationship between <b>feeding</b> <b>group</b> size and <b>feeding</b> rate can show three patterns (positive, neutral and negative) in response to the balance between the costs of social monitoring and feeding competition...|$|R

50|$|European hares forage in groups. <b>Group</b> <b>feeding</b> is {{beneficial}} as individuals can {{spend more time}} feeding knowing that other hares are being vigilant. Nevertheless, the distribution of food affects these benefits. When food is well-spaced, all hares are able to access it. When food is clumped together, only dominant hares can access it. In small gatherings, dominants are more successful in defending food, but as more individuals join in, they must spend more time driving off others. The larger the group, the less time dominant individuals have in which to eat. Meanwhile, the subordinates can access the food while the dominants are distracted. As such, when in groups, all individuals fare worse when food is clumped as opposed to when it is widely spaced.|$|E

50|$|Rather than {{rolling on}} their sides to rip off chunks of prey, lemon sharks {{approach}} their victim with speed only to brake suddenly using their pectoral fins upon contact. The animal then jabs forward multiple times until it has a good grasp of its prey in its jaw and proceeds to shake its {{head from side to}} side until it tears off a chunk of flesh. A feeding frenzy, or large swarm of other sharks, then forms as the individuals sense the blood and bodily fluids released from the prey. Sounds of struggling prey also attract groups of sharks, suggesting they use sound detection for predation. <b>Group</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior such as pack hunting or communal scavenging was observed in a study in which pieces of the same stingray were found in the stomachs of several lemon shark individuals that were caught and examined.|$|E
