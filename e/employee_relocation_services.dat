40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{highlight}} an area of contracting that requires Departmental attention to ensure that only reasonable and allowable costs are reimbursed for contractor <b>employee</b> <b>relocation</b> and temporary living costs. The Office of Inspector General issued nine audit reports over the past 5 years that identified almost $ 13. 6 million of unreasonable or unallowable charges by contractors for <b>employee</b> <b>relocation</b> and temporary living costs. The absence of adequate controls to limit reimbursements to reasonable and allowable amounts was primarily caused by either vague contractual provisions or contractual provisions that were {{not consistent with the}} FAR or DEAR. The result has been that contractors were reimbursed for <b>employee</b> <b>relocation</b> and temporary living costs for which they were not entitled. Because of the sizable number of contractor changes in process and anticipated and the related <b>relocation</b> of contractor <b>employees,</b> we believe the issues raised in the audit reports require the attention of the Department`s senior managers...|$|R
