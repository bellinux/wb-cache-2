40|$|The {{isostatic}} residual map better images short wavelength structures {{within the}} upper crust {{that are of}} interest in this study. However, the continued presence of long wavelength anomalies in the isostatic residual map indicates that the region containing the study area is either not in isostatic equilibrium or assumptions used in the determination of the <b>isostatic</b> <b>correction</b> are not entirely valid (e. g. the crust is not responding in an Airy manner with effect elastic thickness Te= 0) or there are density variations in the upper mantle. The long wavelength anomalies seen in the isostatic residual map are negative anomaly to the southeast of the Cover Rocks and positive anomaly to the north and northeast of the Cover Rocks. To effectively eliminate the dominating effect of these anomalies, the isostatic residual anomaly map has been further corrected by the Decompensative correction. Decompensative anomalies are considered to be produced in the main by density inhomogeneities in the upper 15 - 20 km of the crust. The <b>Isostatic</b> <b>correction</b> has eliminated the gravity compensating effect of topography but other long wavelength gravity effects due to features not accounted for in the Airy model remain. The decompensative correction attempts to remove the anomalies associated with sources deeper than the crust. These gravity effects are isolated by upward continuation. Therefore, the isostatic residual anomaly has been upward continued to 40 km so that the resulting field due to sources at or deeper than 40 km can be estimated. The resultant decompensative anomalies can be assumed to be produced mainly by density inhomogeneities in the upper 15 - 20 km of the crust. Therefore the resultant ecompensative map closely correlates with the major geological structures in the Arabian Shield and Cover Rock...|$|E
30|$|So far, the back-stripping {{technique}} has highest accuracy and most application widely {{in the field}} of burial history restoration. So it has got more attention paid by researchers. Back-stripping technique built on the deposition and compaction theory is to strip top strata layer by layer from current stratigraphic column and make underlayers up to surface until all strata have been striped. The back-stripping procedure incorporated <b>isostatic</b> <b>correction</b> (Poprawa et al. 2010). On this process, it needs to take them into consideration that deposition sedimentary compaction, single-layer denudation, continuous multilayer erosion, and other geological events. Finally, the results expected are one serial stratigraphic column mapping to their geological ages. Because of the important role of back-stripping technique {{in the field of}} burial history restoration, many researchers at home and abroad have made study toward this technique.|$|E
40|$|A new error budget {{assessment}} of the global Mean Sea Level (MSL) determined by TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason- 1 altimeter satellites between January 1993 and June 2008 is presented using last altimeter standards. We discuss all potential errors affecting the calculation of the global MSL rate. We also compare altimetry-based sea level with tide gauge measurements over the altimetric period. Applying a statistical approach, this allows us to provide a realistic error budget of the MSL rise measured by satellite altimetry. These new calculations highlight {{a reduction in the}} rate of sea level rise since 2005, by ~ 2 mm/yr. This represents a 60 % reduction compared to the 3. 3 mm/yr sea level rise (glacial <b>isostatic</b> adjustment <b>correction</b> applied) measured between 1993 and 2005. Since November 2005, MSL is accurately measured by a single satellite, Jason- 1. However the error analysis performed here indicates that the recent reduction in MSL rate is real...|$|R
40|$|GRACE {{does not}} measure any ice sheet {{thickness}} but only gravity. Similarly to the computation {{of the global}} mean sea level (GMSL), the computation of the ice sheet thickness, follows {{a large number of}} assumptions. As a result, the actual inaccuracy of the Antarctic ice sheet thickness computation is much larger than any trend proposed. In other words, you can manufacture almost any result you want by using the noisy raw GRACE signal and selected corrections. It is however the further Glacial <b>Isostatic</b> Adjustment (GIA) <b>correction</b> that ultimately produces the reducing Antarctic ice sheet thickness, similarly to the rising Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL). This result is contradicted by other more reliable experimental results as the expanding sea ice extension and the cooling surface air temperature...|$|R
40|$|Submitted to the Arabian Journal of Geosciences. 10 GPS-Gravity {{profiles}} {{were conducted}} to provide sub-surface geometry of two sections of Najd Fault System (NFS) Ruwah and Ar Rika faults, six in the Afif and four in the Al Muwayh area about 500 km and 650 km west of Riyadh respectively. GPS surveys were collected in Differential GPS (DGPS) mode allowing a large area to be covered in limited time. DGPS is utilized for the advantages of accuracy, economy and speed. Output DGPS location coordinates were used in Free-air and Bouguer reductions, terrain corrections were applied using a 3 arc-second digital elevation model, finally <b>isostatic</b> and decompensative <b>corrections</b> were applied. Integration of the resulting decompensative isostatic residual anomalies and aeromagnetic map have mapped the NFS very accurately. Modeling the gravity field crossing the Ruwah fault zone revealed that it is associated with low gravity anomalies probably due to a complex of lower density crushed rocks, and modeled the geometry of the subsurface structure of Ar Rika fault as an inclined fault with reverse movement which would imply a compression component (post-dated the shearing) parallel to {{the plane of the}} cross-section...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{disintegration}} of Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves, {{and the associated}} accelerated discharge and retreat of continental glaciers, has highlighted the necessity of quantifying {{the current rate of}} Antarctic ice mass loss and the regional contributions to future sea-level rise. Observations of present day ice mass change need to be corrected for ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment, a process which must be constrained by geological data. However, there are relatively little geological data on the geometry, volume and melt history of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS) after Termination 1, and during the Holocene so the glacial <b>isostatic</b> <b>correction</b> remains poorly constrained. To address this we provide field constraints on the timing and rate of APIS deglaciation, and changes in relative sea-level (RSL) for the north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula based on geomorphological evidence of former marine limits, and radiocarbon-dated marine-freshwater transitions from a series of isolation basins at different altitudes on Beak Island. Relative sea-level fell from a maximum of c. 15 m above present at c. 8000 cal yr BP, at a rate of 3. 91 mm yr - 1 declining to c. 2. 11 mm yr - 1 between c. 6900 – 2900 cal yr BP, 1. 63 mm yr - 1 between c. 2900 – 1800 cal yr BP, and finally to 0. 29 mm yr - 1 during the last c. 1800 years. The new Beak Island RSL curve improves the spatial coverage of RSL data in the Antarctic. It is in broad agreement with some glacio-isostatic adjustment models applied to this location, and with work undertaken elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula. These geological and RSL constraints from Beak Island imply significant thinning of the north-eastern APIS by the early Holocene. Further, they provide key data for the glacial <b>isostatic</b> <b>correction</b> required by satellite-derived gravity measurements of contemporary ice mass loss, which can be used to better assess the future contribution of the APIS to rising sea-levels...|$|E
40|$|After <b>isostatic</b> <b>correction</b> {{for their}} {{sedimentary}} fill, {{the depths of}} two small oceanic basins in the southern Scotia Sea suggest that both started to open in mid to late Eocene times. Models of the short magnetic anomaly profiles across the basins provide support for these determinations. The location of the basins, adjacent to the present-day Drake Passage marine gateway, and the timing of continental stretching leading up to their opening, during the Ypresian (early Eocene) onset of global cooling, mean that their importance is potentially far greater than their small size implies. Extension {{in the region of}} the two basins would have opened Drake Passage to shallow or intermediate depth oceanic circulation between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans for the first time. This coincided with a reorganisation of vertical mixing patterns in the global ocean, a shift in the site of carbon sequestration from coal swamps and peatlands to ocean sediments, and the onset of a long decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Cenozoic global cooling may therefore have begun {{as a result of the}} shallow opening of Drake Passage...|$|E
40|$|The {{depth to}} the upper surface of an ideal South Pacific oceanic {{lithosphere}} is calculated by applying a well-known thermal subsidence equation to a grid of ocean floor ages that is generated from published isochrons interpreted from magnetic and gravity anomaly data. When these depths are removed from observed bathymetry, a grid of residual bathymetry results, which at long wavelengths {{can be related to}} the presence of seafloor sediments. By employing the concept of an <b>isostatic</b> <b>correction</b> for sedimentary loads, which describes the depth difference between observed bathymetry of a sedimented ocean and the thermal subsidence surface, it is possible to model sediment thickness using the residual bathymetric anomaly. From forward considerations, the calculated sediment thicknesses are assessed to be significant at amplitudes of 5001000 metres and more. Local flexural effects, abyssal hill topography, and seamount volcanism are likely to give rise to much larger uncertainty at short and medium wavelengths. At the West Antarctic margin, sediment volumes estimated in this way are larger than those based on isopachs constructed from seismic data, which might be underestimated by extrapolation into poorly sampled ice-covered waters...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the mass changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), Ice Sheets over Antarctica, and Land glaciers and Ice Caps with a global mascon method that yields monthly mass {{variations}} at 10, 242 mascons. Input for this method are level 2 data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system collected between February 2003 and June 2013 to which a number of corrections are made. With glacial <b>isostatic</b> adjustment (GIA) <b>corrections</b> from an ensemble of models based on different ice histories and rheologic Earth model parameters, we find for Greenland a mass loss of ? 278 ± 19 Gt/yr. Whereas the mass balances for the GrIS appear to be less sensitive to GIA modeling uncertainties, this is not the case with the mass balance of Antarctica. Ice history models for Antarctica were recently improved, and updated historic ice height data sets and GPS time series have been used to generate new GIA models. We investigated the effect of two new GIA models for Antarctica and found ? 92 ± 26 Gt/yr which is half of what is obtained with ICE- 5 G-based GIA models, where the largest GIA model differences occur on East Antarctica. The mass balance of land glaciers and ice caps currently stands at ? 162 ± 10 Gt/yr. With the help of new GIA models for Antarctica, we assess the mass contribution to the mean sea level at 1. 47 ± 0. 09 mm/yr or 532 ± 34 Gt/yr which is roughly half of the global sea level rise signal obtained from tide gauges and satellite altimetry.

40|$|In this study, for {{the first}} time, an attempt is made to close the sea level budget on a {{sub-basin}} scale in terms of trend and amplitude of the annual cycle. We also compare the residual time series after removing the trend, the semiannual and the annual signals. To obtain errors for altimetry and Argo, full variance–covariance matrices are computed using correlation functions and their errors are fully propagated. For altimetry, we apply a geographically dependent intermission bias (Ablain et al., 2015), which leads to differences in trends up to 0. 8 mm yr− 1. Since Argo float measurements are non-homogeneously spaced, steric sea levels are first objectively interpolated onto a grid before averaging. For the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), gravity fields full variance–covariance matrices are used to propagate errors and statistically filter the gravity fields. We use four different filtered gravity field solutions and determine which post-processing strategy is best for budget closure. As a reference, the standard 96 degree Dense Decorrelation Kernel- 5 (DDK 5) -filtered Center for Space Research (CSR) solution is used to compute the mass component (MC). A comparison is made with two anisotropic Wiener- filtered CSR solutions up to degree and order 60 and 96 and a Wiener-filtered 90 degree ITSG solution. Budgets are computed for 10 polygons in the North Atlantic Ocean, defined {{in a way that}} the error on the trend of the MC plus steric sea level remains within 1 mm yr− 1. Using the anisotropic Wiener filter on CSR gravity fields expanded up to spherical harmonic degree 96, it is possible to close the sea level budget in 9 of 10 sub-basins in terms of trend. Wiener-filtered Institute of Theoretical geodesy and Satellite Geodesy (ITSG) and the standard DDK 5 -filtered CSR solutions also close the trend budget if a glacial <b>isostatic</b> adjustment (GIA) <b>correction</b> error of 10 – 20 % is applied; however, the performance of the DDK 5 -filtered solution strongly depends on the orientation of the polygon due to residual striping. In 7 of 10 sub-basins, the budget of the annual cycle is closed, using the DDK 5 -filtered CSR or the Wiener-filtered ITSG solutions. The Wiener-filtered 60 and 96 degree CSR solutions, in combination with Argo, lack amplitude and suffer from what appears to be hydrological leakage in the Amazon and Sahel regions. After reducing the trend, the semiannual and the annual signals, 24 – 53 % of the residual variance in altimetryderived sea level time series is explained by the combination of Argo steric sea levels and the Wiener-filtered ITSG MC. Based on this, we believe that the best overall solution for the MC of the sub-basin-scale budgets is the Wiener-filtered ITSG gravity fields. The interannual variability is primarily a steric signal in the North Atlantic Ocean, so for this the choice of filter and gravity field solution is not really signifi- cant.

We compute the steric sea level using different temperature (and salinity) data sets processed by different groups (SCRIPPS, CLS, IPRC, and NOAA) and first focus on the regional variability in steric and altimetry-based sea level. In addition to El Nino-La Nina signatures, the observed and steric sea level data show clear impact of three successive Indian Ocean Dipoles in 2006, 2007, and 2008 in the Indian Ocean. We next study the spatial trend patterns in ocean mass signal by comparing GRACE observations over the oceans with observed minus steric sea level. While in some regions, reasonably good agreement is observed, discrepancy is noticed in some others due to still large regional trend errors in Argo and GRACE data, {{as well as to}} a possible (unknown) deep ocean contribution. In terms of global mean, interannual variability in altimetry-based minus steric sea level and GRACE-based ocean mass appear significantly correlated. However, large differences are reported when short-term trends are estimated (using both GRACE and Argo data). This prevents us to draw any clear conclusion on the sea level budget over the recent years from the comparison between altimetry-based, steric sea level, and GRACE-based ocean mass trends, nor does it not allow us to constrain the Glacial <b>Isostatic</b> Adjustment <b>correction</b> to apply to GRACE-based ocean mass term using this observational approach...|$|R

Ablain, M. Cazenave, A. Picot, N. 0 TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC PHILADELPHIA MAR GEOD 1 SISea level {{monitoring}} in the Arctic Ocean can provide useful {{information in the}} context of a rapid change of several parts of the Arctic climate system. Satellite altimetry systems are affected by various problems at high latitudes. As a consequence, no precise and reliable mean sea level record is available yet from altimetry products. After identifying some of the issues that affect satellite altimetry in the Arctic Ocean region, we describe the tailored processing that has been applied to along-track mono-mission altimetry data. We generate a new dataset of weekly gridded sea level anomaly fields over the Arctic region for the period spanning from 1993 to 2009 based on multisatellite altimetry missions. We demonstrate the improvements achieved by this new dataset, among which a better data coverage. The grids are used to describe some features of mean sea level variability in the Arctic Ocean both at basin-wide and local scales. The regional trend estimated for the Arctic Ocean mean sea level over all latitudes from 66 degrees N to 82 degrees N is 3. 6 mm/yr with an uncertainty of 1. 3 mm/yr (90 % confidence) and without any glacial <b>isostatic</b> adjustment (GIA) <b>correction</b> applied. The record displays large inter-annual variability, but no strong correlation with climate indices was found. Spatial patterns in sea level trends and variability over the Arctic region are also investigated...|$|R
