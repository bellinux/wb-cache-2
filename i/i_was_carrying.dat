25|$|We {{left the}} town, fleeing this living picture of Sodom, with incessant fear lest the raging {{waters of the}} lake {{overtake}} us, which were at the moment invading {{the main part of}} the town, sweeping away everything they encountered. On the outskirts of the town, I came upon a woman who was so exhausted by her burden of two little children and a bundle of clothing that she could proceed no farther. Moved by pity, I took one of the toddlers from her and carried him, and the little indio who has been wailing while in the arms of his mother, stopped short when I took him into mine and never uttered a sound while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> him a good piece of the way.|$|E
500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've always felt that John missed the lower half and that made me go for the other... But whatever it was, when I was playing Romeo <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{agreeing to}} play at Live 8, he said: [...] "There {{was more than one}} reason, firstly to support the cause. The second one is the energy-consuming and uncomfortable {{relationship}} between Roger and me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> along in my heart. That is why we wanted to perform and to leave the trash behind. Thirdly, I might have regretted it if I declined." [...] On 20 February 2006, Gilmour commented again on Pink Floyd's future when he was interviewed by Billboard.com, stating, [...] "Who knows? I have no plans at all to do that. My plans are to do my concerts and put my solo record out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 'holy trinity' of Best, Law and Charlton {{remained}} {{effective as}} {{ever in the}} 1968–69 campaign. However the club's new recruits were not up to scratch, as United dropped to 11th in the league before Busby announced his retirement. Best later said that [...] "I increasingly {{had the feeling that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> the team at times on the pitch." [...] He scored 22 goals in 55 games, though only he and Denis Law scored more than six league goals. In the Intercontinental Cup, fans and players alike looked forward to seeing United take on Argentine opposition Estudiantes de La Plata over the course of two legs. However Best said [...] "no one tackled harder or dirtier than this Argentinian team" [...] as a 1–0 defeat at the Estadio Camilo Cichero was followed by a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford. In the home tie, Best was kicked and spat on by José Hugo Medina, and both players were sent off after Best reacted with a punch. Despite their poor league form, United managed to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup (they had a relatively easy run in getting past the Republic of Ireland's Waterford United, Belgium's Anderlecht, and Austria's Rapid Wien) where they were knocked out 2–1 on aggregate by A.C. Milan following a 2–0 defeat at the San Siro; Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini was the hero after keeping United to only one goal at Old Trafford.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> a {{beautiful}} alcoholic conflagration around with me. The thing fed {{on its own}} heat and flamed the fiercer. There was no time, in all my waking time, that I didn't want a drink. I began to anticipate the completion of my daily thousand words by taking a drink when only five hundred words were written. It was not long until I prefaced {{the beginning of the}} thousand words with a drink.|$|E

6000|$|... "She is a {{very generous}} creature," [...] I {{observed}} after a time. The man admired by Victor Haldin fixed {{his eyes on the}} ground. I turned away and moved off, apparently unnoticed by him. I nourished no resentment of the moody brusqueness with which he had treated me.

60|$|He {{must have}} known what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> him to see, {{but he did not}} choose to show that he did, and when he gave me his arm and I took him into the pansy salon, there sat my mother with my sister, two or three old friends who had come to congratulate her, and to see M. de Solivet, and Cecile, who {{had not been able to}} persuade herself to send her {{children}} to bed, though she knew not of my audacious enterprises.|$|E
60|$|As we went, {{two things}} happened. The {{first of these}} was that a very large, black rhinoceros, which was {{sleeping}} in some bushes, suddenly got our wind and, after the fashion of these beasts, charged down on us from about fifty yards away. Now <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> a heavy, single-barrelled rifle, for as yet we and our weapons were not parted. On came the rhinoceros, and Komba, small blame to him for he only had a spear, started to run. I cocked the rifle and waited my chance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, sir," [...] said Prosper, {{as soon as}} {{the door}} was shut, [...] "I beg your pardon. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so moved by certain things which have {{occurred}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> much beyond my usual habits." ...|$|R

Dismount, then, O lovely Molinara, unless thou wouldst rather that I should transport thee on horseback {{to the house of}} thy molendinary father, which, if thou sayest the word, I am prompt to do, defying all dangers which may arise to me personally, whether by monk or miller." ...|$|E

He read the introduction to me last night.

6000|$|... “As {{soon as the}} {{treasure}} hunt began I suspected that I was being hoaxed,” continued Giles Borden. “For all I knew, we were alone on the island. We found several huts, {{but they were all}} deserted. We visited a score of caves, but saw nothing that looked like a treasure. Then, one afternoon, Geswick asked me about the extra thousand pounds <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying.</b> I grew suspicious and tried to hide the money between the rocks. The three caught me at it and pounced on the money like a pack of wolves. Then, when I remonstrated, they laughed at me, and told me to keep quiet, {{that they were going to}} run matters to suit themselves.” ...|$|E
