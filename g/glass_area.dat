2500|$|Design {{work began}} in 1971. The rounded shape and large <b>glass</b> <b>area</b> were unusual {{compared}} with the three-box designs of the era. The Pacer's width is equal to full-sized domestic vehicles at the time, and this unique design feature was promoted by AMC as [...] "the first wide small car." [...] The Pacer was the first modern, mass-produced, U.S. automobile design using the cab forward concept.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1967 model year, all of AMC's {{intermediates}} {{took the}} Rambler Rebel name. They {{were of a}} completely new design from the predecessor models. The new Rebels were bigger and rode on a longer [...] wheelbase allowing for more passenger space and cargo capacity. The new styling featured sweeping rooflines with more <b>glass</b> <b>area,</b> {{as well as a}} smooth, rounded [...] "coke-bottle" [...] body design. The Rebel was now available not only in 4-door sedan, 4-door station wagon, and 2-door hardtop versions, but also for 1967 as 2-door sedan (coupé) with a thin B-pillar and flip out rear side windows, as well as a convertible.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, the Hornet GT toured auto {{shows as}} an {{asymmetrical}} styling exercise. The left (or driver's) side featured more <b>glass</b> <b>area</b> and a narrower [...] "C" [...] pillar for better visibility {{in comparison to}} the concept car's different design on its right side. Using different designs on each side is common practice within automobile styling studios, especially when money was tight; however, showing such an example to the public was unusual and AMC was not afraid to measure consumer reaction to new ideas. Other design elements and ideas presented on the Hornet GT show car included sealed glass to allowing hollow doors that could house easily accessible components while freeing up space in the dashboard area, as well as a stronger roof and support pillars for additional crash and rollover protection.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of composite glass-alumina coatings produced by plasma spraying, {{as described in}} Part 1, were numerically characterized with relation to the peculiar microstructure. Finite element meshes were created for the most significant coating typologies, starting from SEM acquired microstructures. The coatings elastic properties and fracture behaviour were characterized {{as a function of}} relevant microstructural features. The results confirm that the coatings are anisotropic, with a lower elastic modulus in the direction perpendicular to the substrate plane (spray direction), because of the lamellar microstructure; increasing the alumina volume fraction increases the elastic modulus value both in the spray and transverse direction. Moreover, it is found that cracks start from large, irregular pores, and propagate easily through the <b>glass</b> <b>areas,</b> but are stopped by alumina. Smaller individual <b>glass</b> <b>areas</b> hinder crack propagation. The post-deposition thermal treatment described in Part I produces tensile residual stresses in the glass and compressive ones in the alumina; thus, the arresting effect of the latter on cracks propagation is greatly enhanced.

2500|$|The 1967 Rambler Rebel by American Motors was {{completely}} new design from its predecessor, the Rambler Classic. Now a larger car riding on a two-inch (50 millimeter) longer [...] wheelbase, the width was also increased by nearly four inches (100 millimeters) to enlarge interior passenger space and cargo capacity. The Rebel {{had as much}} interior space as full-size cars from Ford and GM. The new body design was {{in sharp contrast to}} its predecessor's [...] "straight-edge" [...] design.

However, the design [...] "themes" [...] such the [...] "hop up" [...] fenders became so pervasive across the industry that the all-new 1967 Rebel was criticized because [...] "viewed from any angle, anyone other than an out-and-out car buff would have trouble distinguishing the Rebel from its GM, Ford, and Chrysler Corp. competition." [...] American Motors was staying abreast of the fashion and the Rebel was the first [...] "family car with style that rivaled function." ...|$|E
2500|$|General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler {{persuaded the}} {{government}} {{that it was not}} financially viable to modify existing production cars to comply with the new regulations, and that instead each company would be put to the enormous expense of producing new, safety-compliant vehicles. Accordingly, the government requirements were reduced, which led to the deletion of several safety features from the production Pacer—for example the roll bar over the passenger compartment, and the bump in the roof that accommodated it. The design of the Pacer was strong for a small car, making it solid and heavy with protection features that included strong and massive bumpers, as well as wide B-pillars that factory information bulletins described their [...] "roll bar like characteristics." [...] Even with the Pacer's large <b>glass</b> <b>area,</b> passengers are not near the windows because they all bow out from around the occupants.

2500|$|The 1975 Chevrolet Nova was the most-changed Chevy car {{for that}} model year. [...] "Now it's beautiful," [...] said the {{brochure}} of Nova's all-new sheet metal, [...] "refined {{along the lines}} of elegant European sedans." [...] Chevrolet wisely maintained a visual kinship with the 1968–1974 design, and also retained Nova's efficiently sized 111-inch wheelbase. Front tread grew by an inch and a half, and the front stabilizer bar had a larger diameter. Novas now had standard front disc brakes and steel-belted radial tires. The front suspension and subframe assembly was similar to the one used in the second generation GM F-body cars (the Camaro and Pontiac Firebird), whereas the rear axle and suspension were carried over from the previous generation. Coupes, including the hatchback, had fixed side windows (or optional flip-out windows) and vertical vents on the B-pillar. All Novas now had cut-pile carpeting, formerly installed only in the Custom series. Speedometers had larger, easier-to-read graphics. Windshields offered greater <b>glass</b> <b>area.</b> Front-door armrests were redesigned with integral pull bars.

2500|$|The Chieftain {{line was}} renamed Catalina; Star Chief was {{downgraded}} {{to replace the}} discontinued Super Chief series {{and for the first}} time did not have a two-door hardtop, only a two-door sedan along with a four-door hardtop and four-door sedan, in addition there was no Star Chief wagon. The Bonneville was now the top of the line, coming in three body styles of two-door hardtop, four-door vista and four-door wagon. The Star Chief's four-door [...] "Vista" [...] hardtop was also shared by the Bonneville. Catalina models included a two-door hardtop, two-door sedan, four-door sedan, four-door hardtop vista and two wagons, one a six-passenger and one a nine-passenger wagon. Bonneville and Star Chief were built on a [...] wheelbase with the exception of the Bonneville wagon and all Catalina models and Bonneville wagon that rode on a 122-inch wheelbase. Catalina was also seven inches shorter than Bonneville and Star Chief and weighed one hundred to two hundred pounds less than its long-wheelbase counterparts. All 1959 Pontiac engines were equipped with a 389-cubic-inch engine with horsepower ratings from 215Hp economy engine to a conservative rated 345hp Tri power carbureted engine. All automatics were four-speed Super-Hydra-Matics or, as Hydramatic Division who designed and built them called them, [...] "Controlled coupling HydraMatic". A special note here is that Oldsmobile used this same transmission and called it Jetaway HydraMatic and Cadillac also used this transmission and Cadillac called it 315 or P 315 Hydramatic. A three-speed column-mounted stick shift was standard on all Pontiacs. This coincided with major body styling changes across all models that introduced increased <b>glass</b> <b>area,</b> twin V-shaped fins and lower hood profiles. Because of these changes, Motor Trend magazine picked the entire Pontiac line as 1959 Car of the Year. The '59s have a five-inch (127mm) wider track, Front at 63 7/8" [...] front track and 64.0" [...] rear track because Knudsen noticed the new, wider bodies looked awkward on the carried-over 1958 frames.
