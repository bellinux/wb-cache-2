5|$|On June13, 1974, a {{tropical}} disturbance was <b>identified</b> <b>several</b> hundred {{miles south of}} Mexico. Tracking westward, rapid development ensued the following day and the system was classified {{a tropical}} depression around 12UTC. Shortly thereafter, satellite intensity estimates indicated further strengthening and the storm was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dolores. Development temporarily slowed on June 15 as the structure gradually organized. Enhanced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a band of deep convection wrapped into the storm. A banding eye-feature developed later that day, indicating Dolores to be near hurricane strength.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of Operation Auca began in September 1955. Saint, McCully, Elliot, and fellow missionary Johnny Keenan decided to {{initiate}} contact with the Huaorani and began periodically searching for them by air. By {{the end of the}} month, they had <b>identified</b> <b>several</b> clearings in the jungle. Meanwhile, Elliot learned several phrases {{in the language of the}} Huaorani from Dayuma, a young Huaorani woman who had left her society and become friends with Rachel Saint, a missionary and the sister of Nate Saint. The missionaries hoped that by regularly giving gifts to the Huaorani and attempting to communicate with them in their language, they would be able to win them over as friends.|$|E
5|$|In {{a master}} plan from 2006, Avinor has <b>identified</b> <b>several</b> key {{development}} issues to increase {{the capacity of the}} airport. For Terminal A, the plans call to keep the existing structure, and gradually expand it westwards, eventually passing over the railway on a culvert. Along the area between the railway and the highway, a south pier is planned to be constructed, with the inside facing immediately towards the railway and the outside having aircraft stands. In the short term, this is planned with six stands for regional aircraft, with a single-story building. The remaining stands currently used for regional aircraft will then be converted to international gates. While Avinor states that there is need for an expansion of Terminal B, no concrete solution has been found, {{in part because of the}} lack of space in the area, although this can partially be fixed by removing the general aviation from the area.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy <b>identified</b> <b>several</b> {{instances}} {{in the story}} that he argued linked to wider themes within the Adventures of Tintin. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia, and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy {{was that of the}} blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in King Ottokar's Sceptre as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E
5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also <b>identified</b> <b>several</b> molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E
5|$|Penfold {{returned}} to the FCO in 1987, where he was appointed to {{a position in the}} West Indian and Atlantic Department, which was responsible for the Caribbean and South Atlantic. The department was divided between British Dependent Territories (for which Penfold was responsible) and independent nations. In the years before and during Penfold's tenure, the British dependencies had been the subject of several diplomatic incidents and were causing problems for the British government, to whom the international community looked to resolve problems with its dependent territories. The FCO had struggled to find new governors for the territories since the winding-up of the Colonial Service—which had historically provided most governors and many civil servants—in the 1960s. Thus, Penfold recommended in a policy paper that the Diplomatic Service be considered as a recruiting pool, and that governors be recruited earlier in their career rather than at the end. He also <b>identified</b> <b>several</b> posts which could be used for training potential governors, including the one he occupied and deputy governor posts such as that in Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|Stebbins started {{graduate}} studies at Harvard in 1928, initially working on flowering plant taxonomy and biogeography—particularly {{that of the}} flora of New England—with Merritt Lyndon Fernald. He completed his MA in 1929 and continued to work toward his Ph.D. He became interested in using chromosomes for taxonomic studies, a method that Fernald did not support. Stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on the cytology of plant reproductive processes in the genus Antennaria, with cytologist E. C. Jeffrey as his supervisor and Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice and supervision from geneticist Karl Sax. Sax <b>identified</b> <b>several</b> errors in Stebbins's work and disapproved of his interpretation of results that, while in accordance with Jeffrey's views, were inconsistent {{with the work of}} contemporary geneticists. Jeffrey and Sax argued over Stebbins's dissertation, and the thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} so obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but little research has been done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that <b>identified</b> <b>several</b> additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E
