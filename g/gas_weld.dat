40|$|Metallurgical {{reactions}} during {{arc welding}} are mainly {{influenced by the}} reaction partners (shielding <b>gas,</b> <b>weld</b> metal) and the reaction time (droplet transfer time). The dominant reactions already appear during the droplet state at the electrode tip and can be described by reaction kinetic models. Metallurgical reactions can {{be influenced by the}} welding equipment (power source, wire feed system) by varying the droplet transfer time. Metallurgical ractions can be controlled by the droplet transfer rate. A simple way to measure this nondestuctively is by analyzing the time dependence of welding current and welding voltage of fluctuation in the arc intensity. The measurement of droplet transfer rate should be an additional parameter for quality assurance of arc welding processes. This comprises sensors, process observation and nondestructive testing...|$|E
40|$|The weld {{quality of}} {{tungsten}} inert gas (TIG) welded joint has been investigated to identify the most economical weld parameters that will bring about optimum properties. Response surface methodology {{has been used in}} the optimization of the tungsten inert <b>gas</b> <b>weld</b> of mild steel pipes. Response surface methodology, based on the central composite face centered design was generated for the purpose of optimization of the weld quality. All the process parameters have desirability of 1. Tensile strength response for this solution have a desirability of 0. 910595 and the yield strength of 0. 59. Result showed that minimizing current and voltage an average tensile strength of 535. 452 MPa and yield strength of up to 408. 74 MPa can be achieved, while keeping gas flow rate and electrode diameter within the range of test. It was also deduced that tensile elongation of the TIG weld is not influenced by the process parameters selected {{for the purpose of this}} study...|$|E
40|$|This {{elemental}} space radiator {{heat pipe}} {{is designed to}} operate in the 700 to 875 K temperature range. It consists of a C-C (carbon-carbon) shell made from poly-acrylonitride fibers that are woven in an angle interlock pattern and densified with pitch at high process temperature with integrally woven fins. The fins are 2. 5 cm long and 1 mm thick, and provide an extended radiating surface at the colder condenser section of the heat pipe. The weave pattern features a continuous fiber bath from the inner tube surface to the outside edges of the fins to maximize the thermal conductance, and to thus minimize the temperature drop at the condenser end. The heat pipe and radiator element together are less than one-third the mass of conventional heat pipes of the same heat rejection surface area. To prevent the molten potassium working fluid from eroding the C C heat pipe wall, the shell is lined with a thin-walled, metallic tube liner (Nb- 1 wt. % Zr), which {{is an integral part of}} a hermetic metal subassembly which is furnace-brazed to the inner surface of the C-C tube. The hermetic metal liner subassembly includes end caps and fill tubes fabricated from the same Nb- 1 Zr alloy. A combination of laser and electron beam methods is used to weld the end caps and fill tubes. A tungsten/inert <b>gas</b> <b>weld</b> seals the fill tubes after cleaning and charging the heat pipes with potassium. The external section of this liner, which was formed by a "Uniscan" rolling process, transitions to a larger wall thickness. This section, which protrudes beyond the C-C shell, constitutes the "evaporator" part of the heat pipe, while the section inside the shell constitutes the condenser of the heat pipe (see figure) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research related to the impact of electric arc activation onto drive welding energy and metal weld heating speed. It is con-firmed that activated tungsten inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> and activated metal inert <b>gas</b> <b>welding</b> methods, depending on metal thickness, single pass weldability and chemical composition of activating flux, enable the reduction of welding energy by 2 - 6 times when compared to conventional welding methods. Additionally, the-se procedures create conditions to increase metal weld heating speed up to 1, 500 - 5, 500 °Cs – 1. Steel which can be rapidly heated, allows for a hardened structure to form (with carbon content up to 0. 4 %), together with a released mar-tensitic structure or a mixture of bainitic-martensitic structures.

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop and improve the experimental method and data interpretation for strain measurements using diffraction methods {{to gain a better understanding}} of micromechanical deformation and anisotropy of lattice strain response. Substantial part of the research was devoted to the development of the laboratory high energy X-ray diffractometer (HEXameter) for bulk residual strain evaluation. White beam energy dispersive X-ray diffraction was chosen as the principal diffraction mode due to its extreme efficiency in utilising X-ray flux and its ability to capture large segments of diffraction patterns. The specimens that have been examined were real engineering components, mechanically deformed specimens and thermally treated specimens, ranging from dynamic in-situ measurements to ex-situ materials engineering. For the real engineering components, a wedge coupon from the trailing edge of a Ti 64 wide fan blade and a turbine combustion casing were examined. Among the mechanically deformed specimens that have been measured were shot-peened steel plates, elasto-plastically bent bars of Mg alloy and cold expanded Al disks. Amongst the thermally deformed specimens, laser-formed steel plates, thermal spray coatings, a manual inert <b>gas</b> <b>weld</b> of Al plates, a friction stir weld of Al plates and Ni tubes and a quenched Ni superalloy cylinder used for strain tomography were studied. In-situ loading experiments have also been carried out, such as experiments on pointwise mapping of grain orientation and strain using the 3 DXRD microscope at the ESRF and in-situ loading experiments on titanium alloy, rheo-diecast and high pressure diecast Mg alloy, IN 718 Ni-base superalloy and Al 2024 aluminium alloy. Experimental results from X-Ray diffraction and strain tomography were used to achieve a better understanding of the material properties. Some results were compared with polycrystal Finite Element model predictions. Amongst the most prominent research achievements are the development on the HEXameter laboratory instrument, including: (i) the development of special collimation systems for the detectors and the source tube; (ii) the development of a twin-detector setup (that allows for simultaneous determination of strain in two mutually orthogonal directions); (iii) improved alignment procedures for better performance; and (iv) the adaptation of instrumentation for efficient scanning of both large and small components, that included choosing and adapting translation devices, programming of the translation system and designing sample mounting procedures. In {{this research}} several approaches to data treatment were investigated. Quantitative phase analysis, single peak fitting (using custom Matlab routines and GSAS) and full pattern fitting (with individual pattern data refined by GSAS and batch refinement done by invoking GSAS via a Matlab routine) were applied. Different Matlab routines were written for specific experimental setups; and various analysis methods were selected and used for refinement depending on the requirements of the measurement results interpretation. 16 papers were published, ensuring that the results of this thesis are readily available to other researchers in the field. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|E
