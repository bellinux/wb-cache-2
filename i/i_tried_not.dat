I told her I was sorry, too. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to blame Richard. I don't believe I did. And <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to blame him. She was feeling badly enough without that." ...|$|E
60|$|I can't make it out. It {{seems very}} unfair. The more <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to be extravagant, the more I spent.|$|E
60|$|She {{ended with}} a little mocking laugh. That was the perverse side of her, the cat using her claws. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to be angry, but failed.|$|E
50|$|As I {{feel the}} world {{watching}} <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to care.|$|R
50|$|I {{can talk}} to anyone in any language, {{but that is the}} skill <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to use.|$|R
60|$|That's {{the reason}} <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to {{blame you for}} being hard--you can't {{understand}} a girl like me. You can't understand George.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought I {{might just}} try,' pursued he, disconsolately, 'whether she did think me any steadier. I hope {{she did not}} think me very troublesome. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to harass her much.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I liked it, Mr. Paret," [...] {{she replied}} simply, and I {{knew that she}} had understated. It was quite {{apparent}} that Krebs had captivated her. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to betray my annoyance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{followed}} you," [...] he answered. [...] "I think {{you knew that}} I would. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to," [...] he went on, after a moment's pause. [...] "I fought against it as hard as I could; {{but in the end}} I had to give in." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{will be a}} {{shutting}} of doors, and the botanist and <b>I,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> to {{feel too}} childish, will walk exploring through the capacious train.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do try," [...] said Ann {{suddenly}} {{one evening}} apropos of nothing at all. [...] "No {{one will ever}} know how hard <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to dislike him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it is, and <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to be; {{but people}} praise me, and I can't help liking it, for I really don't think I am repulsive." ...|$|R
60|$|I was all alone, {{and it was}} bitter. The roses, much as I loved them, {{could not}} give me {{sufficient}} companionship. I wanted the clasp of a human hand, and the love-light in human eyes. And then I fell to thinking of Hugh, though <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will think}} of no one but Hugh Stanbury. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to love him, mamma. I tried {{to think that it}} was better to make believe that I loved Mr. Glascock. But he got the better of me, and conquered me, and I will never rebel against him. You may help me, mamma;--but you can't change me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{we should}} not, Jack. Anyhow, not alive. I thought just {{at first you}} were going to keep us up pretty easy, and then young Joe twisted round and got hold of you, and we all went down together. But I could feel then that somehow you were keeping us up, and <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to catch hold of your legs." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Oh, I Like your Outfit Too, Except When I Dress Up As a Frigid Bitch, <b>I</b> <b>Try</b> <b>Not</b> to Look so Constipated" [...] — Reese Witherspoon (from Legally Blonde) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to get {{involved}} in caucuses that make me look like a radical, right-wing nut. I don’t think that’s what the Tea Party is, but I want to avoid the appearance.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> will <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to sin again.|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{good deal}} more talk of the sort, and of course it {{interested}} me greatly, although <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to show it, but I could not help wondering why the subject had been brought forward in such an impressive manner upon the present occasion. It seemed to me that there was something personal in it--personal to me. Had that boy Percy been making reports? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girls did}} not complain, but they huddled up close together, and set their lips firm, {{and every time}} a drop touched them, they visibly shrank and shuddered. It was a noble sight to see them {{suffering}} thus in silence, but it unnerved me altogether. I am too sensitive. I got wild and fitful in my rowing, and splashed more and more, the harder <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to.|$|E
60|$|I told Hugh timidly that Hester did {{not approve}} of our {{friendship}} and that it must end. He took it quietly enough, and went away. I thought {{he did not care}} much, and the thought selfishly made my own heartache worse. I was very unhappy for a long time, but <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to let Hester see it, and I don't think she did. She was not very discerning in some things.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to be rude, but--" [...] She checked herself, {{and turned}} her face away, adding, with an accent of pain in her voice, [...] "It is not my fault, Mr. Coventry. I only obey orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we," [...] she answered, [...] "should only die to live, {{and that}} is why <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to be afraid. I daresay, however, I mean the same as they did, only you do not seem to have put their thought quite clearly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please God, we will, mem! With {{such good}} friends, I never should complain. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to do it, but {{it breaks my}} heart to see my little lass spoiled for life, most like;" [...] and Mrs. Pecq pressed the kind hand with a despondent sigh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} that," [...] he {{answered}} simply. [...] "I didn't {{see how it}} could be done. But if you saw any way, I was willing--No, that was my great trouble! I knew that it was selfish in me, and very conceited, to suppose you would give up your whole life for me; and whenever I thought of that, I determined not to ask you. But <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to think of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Kent, it was dreadful! I {{had come}} back that evening to the library to finish some work. I knew that Mr. Kelly was to dine out and that I would be alone. I had been working quietly for some time when I became aware of voices in the billiard-room. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to listen, but {{they seemed to be}} quarrelling, and I couldn't help hearing. Oh, Mr. Kent, was I wrong?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Russ--what's to {{come of it}} all?" [...] she faltered, {{and then}} she broke down {{and began to cry}} softly. I would have been only too glad to tell her what hung in the balance, one way or another, had I known. But surely, catastrophe! Then I heard Steele's voice again and its huskiness, its {{different}} tone, made me fearful, made me strain my ears when I tried, or thought <b>I</b> <b>tried,</b> <b>not</b> to listen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to, John," [...] she confessed, {{amazed at}} the tremble of her sweet, low voice. Her words seemed like the {{confession}} of a weeping child. [...] "I cannot help it. I do love you! <b>I</b> have <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to so hard, but now--now <b>I</b> shall <b>not</b> <b>try</b> any more!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am, it {{made the}} day go on well like, and settled a body's mind, when I fretted for what could not be helped. But <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to fret after it now, and Mr. Hazlewood said, if I did my best {{wherever}} I was, the Lord would still join our prayers together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can learn; I did. I used to croak and fret dreadfully, and get so unhappy, I was n't fit for anything. I do {{it still}} more than I ought, but <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to, and it gets easier, I find. Get a-top of your troubles, and then they are half cured, Miss Mills says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes {{just for}} a moment, but <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to think of it, Harry. We were so strangely placed, and it {{made it easier for}} you to be a brother, and I felt sure you would not speak till we were safely in England, and I was in Ernest's care. But," [...] she said with a little laugh, [...] "you were nearly {{speaking}} that evening in the cottage when you felt so despairing." ...|$|E
60|$|But my {{call came}} too late: crash went the bowl, out came the bottom, and down plumped {{all the little}} gentlemen into the sea. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to laugh, as the books, wigs, and {{spectacles}} flew about; and, urging my boat nearer, I managed to fish them up, dripping and sneezing, and looking like drowned kittens. When the flurry was over, and they had got their breath, I asked who they were, and where they were going.|$|E
60|$|There {{was little}} talking, for they all gazed {{at me as}} if {{something}} astounding might happen at any moment. The clock had stopped, but the ventilator was clicking. Although Jimmy and the others saw only me, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> to see only them. I conjured up the face of a lady, and she smiled encouragingly, and then I felt safer. But at times her face was lost in smoke, or suddenly it was Marriot's face, eager, doleful, wistful.|$|E
6000|$|She {{softened}} towards tears. [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> {{to think}} of it, and night and day he's haunting me. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> {{to think of}} it. I've been for easy-going all my life. But I'm that worried and afraid, with death and ruin threatened and evil all about me! I don't know what to do! My own sister's son, and me a widow woman and 'elpless against his doin's!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{began with}} my parents' story, {{but it has}} sprung to other things", Apichatpong said in an interview. [...] "When I met the actors, when I found the location, there were other stories {{combined}} and added in. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> to limit it. I allow it to flow whichever way it goes. It is very exciting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> {{to forget}} it," [...] rejoined Candeille lightly, [...] "but of a truth you must admit, Citizeness, {{that it would}} require the {{patience}} of a saint {{to put up with}} the insolence of a penniless baggage, who but lately has had to stand her trial in her own country for impurity of conduct." ...|$|R
