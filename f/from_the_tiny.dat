5|$|Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus. The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, and occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. CSF is also produced by the single layer of column-shaped ependymal cells which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the subarachnoid space; and a small amount directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> spaces surrounding blood vessels around the brain.|$|E
5|$|The corona, or paracorolla, is {{variously}} {{described as}} bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup shaped) or disc-shaped with margins {{that are often}} frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely the corona is a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar {{at the top of}} the ovary. Coronal morphology varies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> pigmented disk of N. serotinus (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in N. cavanillesii to the elongated trumpets of section Pseudonarcissus (trumpet daffodils, Table I).|$|E

He left Charleston in a ship with fewer than 80 men, mostly US citizens. He led the landing party personally on 29 June 1817 with the words: [...] "I shall sleep either in hell or Amelia tonight!"

500|$|The rising Swedish exodus {{was caused}} by economic, political, and {{religious}} conditions affecting particularly the rural population. Europe was {{in the grip of}} an economic depression. In Sweden, population growth and repeated crop failures were making it increasingly difficult to make a living <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> land plots on which at least three quarters of the inhabitants depended. Rural conditions were especially bleak in the stony and unforgiving SmÃ¥land province, which became the heartland of emigration. The American Midwest was an agricultural antipode to SmÃ¥land, for it, Unonius reported in 1842, [...] "more closely than {{any other country in the}} world approaches the ideal which nature seems to have intended for the happiness and comfort of humanity." [...] Prairie land in the Midwest was ample, loamy, and government-owned. From 1841 it was sold to squatters for $1.25 per acre, ( [...] as of [...] ), following the Preemption Act of 1841 (later replaced by the Homestead Act). The inexpensive and fertile land of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin was irresistible to landless and impoverished European peasants. It also attracted more well-established farmers.|$|E
2500|$|Injera {{is usually}} made <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny,</b> iron-rich teff. However, teff {{production}} {{is limited to}} certain middle elevations and regions with adequate rainfall, so it is relatively expensive for the average household. As many farmers in the Ethiopian highlands grow their own subsistence grains, wheat, barley, corn, and/or rice flour are sometimes used to replace {{some or all of}} the teff content. Teff flour is gluten free, therefore injera that is made only with teff flour has higher demand. There are also different varieties of injera in Ethiopia, such as tekore [...] (black), nech [...] (white), and sergegna (mixed).|$|E

2500|$|The Siege of Acre (also {{called the}} Fall of Acre) {{took place in}} 1291 and {{resulted}} {{in the loss of}} the Crusader-controlled city of Acre to the Mamluks. It {{is considered one of the}} most important battles of the period. Although the crusading movement continued for several more centuries, the capture of the city marked the end of further crusades to the Levant. When Acre fell, the Crusaders lost their last major stronghold of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. [...] They still maintained a fortress at the northern city of Tartus (today in north-western Syria), engaged in some coastal raids, and attempted an incursion <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> island of Ruad, but when they lost that as well in 1302â€“3 in the Siege of Ruad, the Crusaders no longer controlled any part of the Holy Land.|$|E
2500|$|For {{his home}} town of Castelfranco, Giorgione painted the Castelfranco Madonna, an altarpiece in sacra conversazione formâ€”Madonna enthroned, with saints on either side forming an {{equilateral}} triangle. This gave the landscape background an importance which marks an innovation in Venetian art, and was quickly followed by his master Giovanni Bellini and others. Giorgione began to use the very refined chiaroscuro called sfumatoâ€”the delicate use of shades of color to depict light and perspectiveâ€”around {{the same time as}} Leonardo. [...] Whether Vasari is correct in saying he learned it from Leonardo's works is unclearâ€”he is always keen to ascribe all advances to Florentine sources. Leonardo's delicate color modulations result <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> disconnected spots of paint that he probably derived from Illuminated manuscript techniques and first brought into oil painting. These gave Giorgione's works the magical glow of light for which they are celebrated.|$|E

Anna Petrovna (aged 16) was to marry Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, who was then living in exile in Russia as Peter's guest after having failed in his attempt to succeed his maternal uncle as King of Sweden, and whose patrimony (Holstein-Gottorp) was at that time under Danish occupation. Despite all this, the prince was of impeccable birth and well-connected to many royal houses; it seemed a politically useful and respectable alliance, and Peter was happy. Some time later, Elizabeth was betrothed to marry Charles Frederick's first cousin, Charles Augustus of Holstein-Gottorp, the eldest son of Christian Augustus, Prince of Eutin. Anna's wedding was held in 1725 as planned, even though Peter died {{a few weeks before the}} nuptials.
