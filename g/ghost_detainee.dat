5000|$|Hiwa Abdul Rahman Rashul, Iraqi {{imprisoned by}} the US as a <b>ghost</b> <b>detainee</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Hiwa Abdul Rahman Rashul, nicknamed Triple-X by his American guards, was {{the first}} <b>ghost</b> <b>detainee</b> to be {{publicly}} acknowledged by American authorities.|$|E
50|$|A <b>ghost</b> <b>detainee</b> {{originally}} {{known only}} as Triple X was not assigned an ISN because his secret imprisonment was requested by the Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E
50|$|On September 9, 2004, General Paul J. Kern {{testified before}} the Senate Armed Services Committee, stating that an inquiry he led found that the Army had cooperated with the CIA in hiding dozens of <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> from the Red Cross. Kern told the Committee {{there may have been}} as many as 100 <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees.</b>|$|R
50|$|The CIA used Syria as an illicit base of {{operations}} to torture <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees,</b> {{as part of a}} program known as extraordinary rendition. This program was established in the mid-1990s and expanded in the 2000s.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to allegations and reports about <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> in Iraq or East Asian {{countries such as}} Afghanistan and Pakistan, {{there have been reports}} that the US had held prisoners in detention centers in some European states. In 2006 the Swiss senator, Dick Marty wrote a memorandum on [...] "alleged detention in Council of Europe states." [...] He said the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had captured about 100 persons on European territory and subsequently rendered them to countries where they may have been tortured. The BBC reported that this number of 100 extraordinarily rendered persons is in {{addition to}} the estimated 100 U.S. <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 17 February 2003, Nasr was {{abducted}} by CIA agents {{as he walked}} to his mosque in Milan for noon prayers, thus becoming an effective <b>ghost</b> <b>detainee.</b> He was later transported to a prison in Egypt where, he states, he was tortured.|$|E
50|$|Since then, Ghul {{became a}} <b>ghost</b> <b>detainee,</b> his very {{existence}} was unacknowledged. In June 2007, {{he was one}} of 39 people cited in a joint release by HRW, Cageprisoners, Center for Constitutional Rights and the New York University School of Law as prisoners who have not been accounted for, and are likely held in secret CIA Black sites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ghost</b> <b>detainee</b> is a {{term used}} in the {{executive}} branch of the United States government to designate a person held in a detention center, whose identity has been hidden by keeping them unregistered and therefore anonymous. Such uses arose as the Bush administration initiated the war on terror following the 9/11 attacks of 2001 in the United States. As documented in the 2004 Taguba Report, it was used in the same manner by United States (US) officials and contractors of the Joint Interrogation and Debriefing Center at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in 2003-2004.|$|E
50|$|Human Rights Watch listed {{him as one}} of 39 <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> in 2005, who are {{not given}} any legal rights or access to counsel, and who are likely not {{reported}} to or seen by the International Committee of the Red Cross.|$|R
2500|$|The list {{of those}} thought to be held by the CIA include {{suspected}} al-Qaeda members Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Abu Zubaydah. The total number of <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> is presumed {{to be at least}} one hundred, although the precise number cannot be determined because fewer than 10% have been charged or convicted. However, Swiss senator Dick Marty's memorandum on [...] "alleged detention in Council of Europe states" [...] stated that about 100 persons have been kidnapped by the CIA on European territory and subsequently rendered to countries where they may have been tortured. This number of 100 persons does not overlap, but adds itself to the U.S.-detained 100 <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees.</b>|$|R
50|$|The authors {{note the}} {{discovery}} of the program's means of transportation, rendition aircraft, by aviation enthusiasts, who spotted discrepancies in the flights of four aircraft, and correlations between their unusual flight patterns and the list of sites reputed to be the destination for <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a 2007 report, Human Rights Watch {{related the}} claims of an alleged <b>ghost</b> <b>detainee,</b> Marwan Jabour, a Palestinian who was arrested in Lahore, Pakistan, in May 2004. He {{claimed to have been}} held {{for more than a month}} in a secret {{detention}} facility operated by Pakistanis and Americans in Islamabad. He was flown to a CIA prison in Afghanistan, where he was held in secret, incommunicado detention for more than two years. During his ordeal, he was tortured, beaten, forced to stay awake for days, and kept naked and chained to a wall for more than a month.|$|E
25|$|The United States Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Rasul v. Bush (2004) that detainees at Guantanamo Bay {{detention}} camp had the habeas corpus right to challenge their detentions before an impartial tribunal. As a result, the US allegedly {{continued to hold}} many <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> outside Guantanamo Bay and the United States {{in order to avoid}} any review of their cases.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Swiss senator Dick Marty's {{memorandum}} on [...] "alleged detention in Council of Europe states", the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{has captured}} about one hundred persons on European territory and subsequently rendered them to countries {{where they may}} have been tortured. This number of one hundred extraordinarily rendered persons is in addition to the estimated hundred U.S. <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} {{has been criticized}} by Amnesty International and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as improper and illegal; it prevents these prisoners from having contact with inspectors and human rights advocates, and {{the families of the}} prisoners have to deal with a [...] "forced disappearance". One 2005 report by Amnesty International indicates that more than 100 <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> may currently be being held in U.S.-operated black sites.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the abuse, the report also cited at least eight cases of <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees,</b> or inmates hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross and other human rights groups. General Kern acknowledged {{there could be more}} than a dozen cases, and other reports later confirmed there could have been more than 100, bringing forth media questions {{about the role of the}} CIA at the prison.|$|R
50|$|For roughly 10 {{months in}} 2004, Lagouranis was {{stationed}} in Abu Ghraib prison (Lagouranis was only at Abu Ghraib {{for a month and}} a half) near Baghdad and for a short time in the Iraqi city of Mosul, where he claims to have observed and took part in a number of interrogation techniques including diet-alteration, the use of military dogs to induce terror, inducing hypothermia (with associated involuntary rectal thermometer readings), sleep deprivation, and the presence of <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> are extrajudicial prisoners whose identities {{have not}} been {{revealed}} and whose families (and frequently, governments) {{have not been}} informed of their status. They are deprived of all legal rights. Ghost detainees' identities, and capture, have been kept secret. As such they are a subset of extrajudicial prisoners, which includes all the detainees who were held in Guantanamo, etc.. They are sure to face multiple, repeated torture sessions {{at the hands of}} skilled CIA torture liaisons, until it is determined what they have done wrong.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003 {{a secret}} compound, known as Strawberry Fields, was {{constructed}} near the main Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba. It {{was not until}} August 2010 that reporters found {{that it had been}} constructed to hold CIA detainees classified as [...] "high value". These were among the many men known as <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees,</b> as they were ultimately held for years for interrogation by the CIA in its secret prisons known as black sites at various places in Europe, the Mideast, and Asia, including Afghanistan.|$|R
2500|$|The Washington Post on December 26, 2002, {{reported}} about {{a secret}} CIA prison {{in one corner}} of Bagram Air Force Base (Afghanistan) consisting of metal shipping containers. On March 14, 2004, The Guardian reported that three British citizens were held captive in a secret section (Camp Echo) of the Guant√°namo Bay complex. Several other articles reported the retention of <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> by the CIA, alongside the other official [...] "enemy combatants". However, it was the revelations of The Washington Post, in a November 2, 2005, article, that would start the scandal. (below) ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{people are}} covertly held by governments or other bodies, and {{effectively}} cease to exist. This {{has happened in}} dictatorial regimes such as Chile under Pinochet, the USSR, and fascist Spain. It was also the guiding strategy behind the Nazi government's Nacht und Nebel (Night & Fog) policy in Western Europe. To dodge pointed questions regarding supposedly democratically controlled governments covertly holding people or employing torture, plausible deniability of knowledge might be used. The existence of <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> in a secret CIA prison system {{is an example of}} this.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2005, Irene Khan of Amnesty International {{addressed}} the issue in a speech: [...] "According to U.S. official sources there could be over one hundred <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> held by the U.S. In 2004, {{thousands of people were}} held by the U.S. in Iraq, hundreds in Afghanistan, and undisclosed numbers in undisclosed locations. AI (Amnesty International) is calling on the U.S. government to [...] "close Guantanamo and disclose the rest." [...] What we mean by this is: either release the prisoners or charge and prosecute them with due process." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{practice}} of ghosting first achieved widespread attention in 2005 when the Washington Post broke a story {{suggesting that the}} U.S. Army and the CIA were detaining [...] "unlawful enemy combatants" [...] at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq {{with little or no}} due process. According to the article, the CIA asked military intelligence officials to let them house <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> at Abu Ghraib by September 2003 and proposed a Memorandum of Understanding between the agencies on the topic that November. The Army and the Defense Department have acknowledged that the United States has used ghosting in the past, but have said it was limited to isolated incidents. According to documents obtained by the Post, [...] "unregistered CIA detainees were brought to Abu Ghraib several times a week in late 2003." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{foreword}} to Amnesty International‚Äôs Report 2005, the Secretary General, Irene Khan, {{referred to}} the Guant√°namo Bay prison as [...] "the gulag of our times, entrenching the practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law. Trials by military commissions have made a mockery of justice and due process." [...] In the subsequent press conference, she added [...] "If Guantanamo evokes images of Soviet repression, 'ghost detainees' - or the incommunicado detention of unregistered detainees ‚Äî bring back the practice of 'disappearances' so popular with Latin American dictators in the past. According to US official sources there could be over 100 <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> held by the US. In 2004, {{thousands of people were}} held by the US in Iraq, hundreds in Afghanistan, and undisclosed numbers in undisclosed locations. AI is calling on the US Administration to close Guantanamo and disclose the rest".|$|R
2500|$|The {{revelation of}} such black sites {{adds to the}} {{controversy}} surrounding US government policy regarding those whom it describes as [...] "unlawful enemy combatants". Approximately 30 detainees are considered the most dangerous or important terrorism suspects and are held by the CIA at black sites under the most secretive arrangements. More than 70 other detainees who may have originally been sent to black sites, but were soon delivered by the CIA to intelligence agencies in allied Middle Eastern and Asian countries such as Afghanistan, Morocco, and Egypt. A further 100 <b>ghost</b> <b>detainees</b> kidnapped in Europe and [...] "rendered" [...] to other countries must be counted, according to Swiss senator Dick Marty's report of January 2006. This process is called [...] "extraordinary rendition". Marty also underlined that European countries probably had knowledge of these covert operations. Furthermore, the CIA apparently financially assists and directs the jails in these countries. While the US and host countries have signed the United Nations Convention Against Torture, CIA officers are allowed to use what the agency calls [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques". These have been alleged to constitute [...] "severe pain or suffering" [...] under the UN convention, {{which would be a}} violation of the treaty and thus US law.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>ghost</b> {{prisoner}} (a <b>detainee</b> {{not logged}} in the records) said he was passive and nervous [...] "like a scared child," [...] and there was reportedly [...] "no need to get physical with him," [...] although an interrogator soon started shouting at him, demanding to know where weapons were hidden.|$|R
