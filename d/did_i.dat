She undertook acting roles in the movies Tyler Perry's Why <b>Did</b> <b>I</b> Get Married? and Hounddog, {{and she had a}} starring role in the television series The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. During her break, she divorced her husband of six years Lyzel Williams in 2007, became engaged to the former drummer Lil' John Roberts in 2008, gave birth to their son Jett Hamilton in 2009, and broke up with Roberts. Scott subsequently began sessions for The Light of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they <b>did</b> <b>I</b> can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

25|$|I am {{not only}} a Zionist, I am a super-Zionist. For me, Zionism was and remains {{the right of the}} Jews to control their fate and their future. I {{consider}} the right of human beings to be their own masters a natural right. A right of which the Jews were deprived by history and which Zionism restored to them. That is its deep meaning. And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, <b>did</b> <b>I</b> stop being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then <b>did</b> <b>I</b> become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.|$|E

5000|$|The song's release came {{shortly after}} their {{previous}} single, [...] "So Long", performed disappointingly {{in terms of}} charts and sales. After the release of [...] "Waterloo", ABBA were having difficulty establishing themselves as an act with longevity. [...] "I <b>Do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>Do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>Do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>Do,</b> <b>I</b> Do", in many cases, put ABBA firmly back in the spotlight. With a rousing saxophone tune and homage to 1950s Schlager music, [...] "I <b>Do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>Do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>Do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>Do,</b> <b>I</b> Do" [...] became a significant improvement on the international charts, although it made little impact in Britain. The song's popularity was boosted (particularly in Australia) by {{the release of a}} promo clip shown on television. The song, presumably because of its title as much as the sentiment, is popular at weddings and was featured in the film Muriel's Wedding, when the ABBA-mad title character gets married.|$|R

25|$|In his mid-twenties in {{the early}} 1960s, he {{switched}} to race walking. Ladany walked his first race in 1962.

I'm not a psychologist, but was I stubborn, so I entered race walking? Or <b>did</b> <b>I</b> enter race walking, and become stubborn? It's the same in all long-distance events.

I will trust the American people not to mistake short-sightedness for patriotism or narrow-mindedness for love of country.|$|E

ABBA also performed the track on both their world tours, as seen in ABBA: The Movie (1977) and the 1979 ABBA In Concert documentary. The song was originally to be featured in the ABBA musical [...] "Mamma Mia!", to be sung on a boat, as the three fathers and a deleted character Stanley rocked the boat from side to side.|$|R
