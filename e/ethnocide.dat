25|$|Many Kurds {{and some}} ethnic Turks {{consider}} Turkish {{military operations in}} Dersim to constitute genocide. A proponent of this view is the academic İsmail Beşikçi. Under international laws, it has been argued, {{the actions of the}} Turkish authorities were not genocide, because they were not aimed at the extermination of a people, but at resettlement and suppression. Scholars, such as Martin van Bruinessen, have instead talked of an <b>ethnocide</b> directed against the local language and identity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ethnocide</b> of the Yanomami {{has been}} well documented, there are an {{estimated}} nine thousand currently living in Brazil in the Upper Orinoco drainage and a further fifteen thousand in Venezuela. The NGO Survival International has reported that throughout the 1980s up to forty thousand gold prospectors entered Yanomami territory bringing diseases the Yanomami had no immunity to, the prospectors shot and destroyed entire villages, and Survival International estimates that up to twenty per cent of the people were dead within seven years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second type}} is insidiously {{hosted by the}} Enlightenment {{philosophy}} of universalism: its dream of unity of mankind may bring it, in specific and extreme cases, to the will to annihilate all cultural differences, amounting to effective genocide or <b>ethnocides.</b> Taguieff's point is not in declaring that the Enlightenment philosophy is racist in itself, but extreme forms of this will of universality may lead, in practice, {{to the destruction of}} the plurality of cultures and to the rejection of even moderate forms of multiculturalism.|$|R
50|$|In the Second Polish Republic, Kalush/Kalusz was {{the seat}} of a county in Stanislawow Voivodeship. Following the 1939 Invasion of Poland, the town was annexed by the Soviet Union. Occupied by the Third Reich in 1941 - 1944, it {{returned}} to the Soviet Union after the war. During World War II {{the residents of the}} city witnessed many <b>ethnocides.</b> In 1940, the Soviets forced inhabitants of Kalush to leave the town and forcefully moved them to Siberia, many of whom were people of various nationalities: Poles, Ukrainians and others. Then, in late 1941 and 1942, majority of Kalush's Jewish inhabitants were murdered by the Germans. Since the 16th century, a Jewish community had flourished in the city; however, in 1941, while under Nazi control, that community was virtually eliminated. Polish Home Army (AK) was active in the town and its area. The town itself was captured by the AK in mid-July 1944, during the Operation Tempest. In 1945, Polish residents of Kalush were expelled to the Recovered Territories.|$|R
25|$|The mantic {{calendar}} {{has proven}} to be particularly resistant to the onslaughts of time (that is, of colonial repression, liberalism, <b>ethnocide,</b> and free market). Nowadays, a 'daykeeper', or divinatory priest, may stand in front of a fire, and pray in Maya to entities such as the 260 days; the cardinal directions; the ancestors of those present; important Mayan towns and archaeological sites; lakes, caves, or volcanoes; and deities from the Popol Vuh. People also come to these daykeepers to know about baby names, wedding dates and other special occasions.|$|E
25|$|Hellenistic Judaism {{spread to}} Ptolemaic Egypt from the 3rd century BCE. After the Great Revolt (66–73 CE), the Romans {{destroyed}} the Temple. Hadrian built a pagan idol on the Temple grounds and prohibited circumcision; these acts of <b>ethnocide</b> provoked the Bar Kokhba revolt 132–136 CE {{after which the}} Romans banned {{the study of the}} Torah and the celebration of Jewish holidays, and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea. In 200 CE, however, Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a religio licita ("legitimate religion") until the rise of Gnosticism and Early Christianity in the fourth century.|$|E
25|$|Many Kurds {{and some}} ethnic Turks {{consider}} {{the events that}} took place in Dersim to constitute genocide. A prominent proponent of this view is İsmail Beşikçi. Under international laws, the actions of the Turkish authorities were arguably not genocide, because they were not aimed at the extermination of a people, but at resettlement and suppression. A Turkish court ruled in 2011 that the events could not be considered genocide because they were not directed systematically against an ethnic group. Scholars such as Martin van Bruinessen, have instead talked of an <b>ethnocide</b> directed against the local language and identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} force {{assimilation}} involved punishing children for speaking their own languages or practicing their own faiths, leading to allegations in the 20th century of cultural genocide and <b>ethnocide.</b> There was widespread {{physical and sexual}} abuse. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, {{and a lack of}} medical care led to high rates of tuberculosis, and death rates of up to 69%. Details of the mistreatment of students had been published numerous times throughout the 20th century, but following the closure of the schools in the 1960s, the work of indigenous activists and historians led to a change in the public perception of the residential school system, as well as official government apologies, and a (controversial) legal settlement.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{inferred}} from the probable number of languages and the guesstimate of pre-contact population levels {{that there may}} have been from 3,000 - 4,800 speakers on average for each of the 250 languages. A number of these languages were almost immediately wiped out within decades of colonization, the case of the Aboriginal Tasmanians being one notorious example of precipitous linguistic <b>ethnocide.</b> Tasmania had been separated from the mainland at the end of the Quaternary glaciation, and indigenous Tasmanians remained isolated from the outside world for around 12,000 years. Claire Bowern has concluded in a recent study that there were twelve Tasmanian languages, and that those languages are unrelated (that is, not demonstrably related) to those on the Australian mainland.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a journey}} among the Bari in South America, the ethnologist Robert Jaulin [...] {{called for a}} {{convention}} on <b>ethnocide</b> in the Americas at the Congress of Americanists, and, in February 1970, the French Society of Americanists convened for that purpose. Jaulin criticized in particular the role of Christian missionaries towards non-Western cultures.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, Díaz’s {{aggressive}} {{move toward}} economic progress—and its success —established a parallel move toward Indian <b>ethnocide.</b> One example will suffice: “It was the village {{that was the}} most important element {{in the life of the}} Mayas and which contributed to the preservation of their tightly knit society…. It was this type of solidarity and unity that the Porfirian government attempted to destroy” so that they could learn, through coercion, to use money and learn to speak Spanish. In other words, to assimilate. For Díaz and all of the científicos, including the leading Indian advocate Sierra, never attempted to help the Indians because their way of helping did not involve an Indian’s perspective. To many Indians, but especially the Yaqui and the Maya, progress for Mexico meant the dissolution of their cultures. “Progress” was not approached within the framework of Indians’ own cultural perceptions, but still “had to become [...] of the progressive Mexican society of [...] day or become non-entities.” This approach, including that of Díaz, was not at all sympathetic to Indian cultures, but rather, indicated a path toward <b>ethnocide,</b> which only came into fruition through the working dynamic of Díaz and the científicos.|$|E
2500|$|The Quinnipiac Stone Giant Twins (Hobbomock and Maushop), as {{the primary}} culture heroes, acted as the epitomes of good and bad, right and wrong, honorable deeds and mischievous behavior. The Puritans refused to {{acknowledge}} any of this. Religious conversion and cultural <b>ethnocide</b> operated to redefine many Quinnipiac ancient traditions and language definitions. For example, the Puritan families refused to honor Quinnipiac teachings. Hobbomock was, to the Quinnipiac, a benevolent spirit who taught the people how to hunt, fish, and survive the Ice Age, earthquakes, famines, etc., {{and he was the}} one prayed to when assistance was needed. The Puritans knew this, yet they forced the Long Water people to teach the children that Hobbomock was a “Bogeyman.” The Puritans redefined Hobbomock, Maushop, and other Quinnipiac spirit helpers as “devils.” [...] Today some believe that the Quinnipiac have vanished from the earth. As the motto of the New England Algonquian Alliance proudly proclaimed after the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1978, “WE ARE STILL HERE”; so today do the Quinnipiac.|$|E
50|$|The French ethnologist Robert Jaulin (1928-1996) {{proposed}} a redefinition {{of the concept}} of <b>ethnocide</b> in 1970, to refer not the means but the ends that define <b>ethnocide.</b> Accordingly, the <b>ethnocide</b> would be the systematic destruction of the thought and the way of life of people different from those who carry out this enterprise of destruction. Whereas the genocide assassinates the people in their body, the <b>ethnocide</b> kills them in their spirit.|$|E
50|$|In Jaulin’s {{understanding}} of the notion, {{it is not the}} means but the ends that define <b>ethnocide.</b> Accordingly, the <b>ethnocide</b> would be the systematic destruction of the thought or culture and the way of life of people different from those who carry out this enterprise of destruction. Whereas the genocide assassinates the people in their body, the <b>ethnocide</b> kills them in their spirit and culture.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing {{the legal}} and {{academic}} history of usage of the terms genocide and <b>ethnocide,</b> Bartolomé Clavero differentiates between them in that [...] "Genocide kills people while <b>ethnocide</b> kills social cultures through the killing of individual souls". In addition, [...] "since cultural genocide can only be the cultural dimension of genocide", the idea of <b>ethnocide</b> {{is more than just}} [...] "cultural genocide", but also part of broader genocidal process.|$|E
5000|$|A long {{reflection}} on the dynamics that led to worldwide <b>ethnocide,</b> its different “masks”, its history and, according to him, one of its earliest manifestations, monotheism, led Robert Jaulin to a complete reappraisal of the phenomenal and conceptual fields polarized by the notion of <b>ethnocide.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Raphael Lemkin, the {{linguist}} and lawyer who coined genocide in 1943 as {{the union of}} [...] "the Greek word genos (race, tribe) and the Latin cide (killing)", also suggested <b>ethnocide</b> as an alternative form representing the same concept, using the Greek ethnos (nation) in place of genos. However, the term genocide has received much wider adoption than <b>ethnocide.</b>|$|E

50|$|However, {{according}} to SIL, efforts to change cultural patterns is not equivalent to destroying cultures, {{and all their}} work is based on voluntary participation of indigenous peoples. In the SIL view <b>ethnocide</b> is not a valid concept, and {{it would lead to}} pessimism if one equated <b>ethnocide</b> with culture change imposed by the inevitable progress of civilization. SIL considers themselves as actively protecting endangered languages by promoting them within the speech community and providing mother-tongue literacy training.|$|E

50|$|Robert Jaulin (7 March 1928, Le Cannet, Alpes-Maritimes - 21 November 1996, Grosrouvre) was a French ethnologist. After several {{journeys}} to Chad, between 1954 and 1959, {{among the}} Sara people, he published in 1967 La Mort Sara (The Sara Death) {{in which he}} exposed the various initiation rites through which he had passed himself, and closely analyzed Sara geomancy. In La Paix blanche (The White peace, 1970), he redefined the notion of <b>ethnocide</b> {{in relation to the}} extermination by the Western world of the Bari culture, located between Venezuela and Colombia. If a genocide designs the physical extermination of a people, an <b>ethnocide</b> refers to the extermination of a culture.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Jaulin {{redefined the}} concept of <b>ethnocide</b> in 1970 with his {{ground-breaking}} La paix blanche : introduction à l’ethnocide ("White Peace: Introduction to Ethnocide"). This capital work, which remains to be translated into English, gives {{a detailed account of}} the ethnocide-in-motion suffered by the Bari, an Indian people living on the border between Venezuela and Colombia, {{in the second half of}} the sixties, as witnessed by Robert Jaulin himself. Whether conflicting or collaborating among themselves, multiple vectors of <b>ethnocide</b> in place (the Catholic Church and other Christian confessions, the Venezuelan and the Colombian armies, the American oil company Colpet, and all the “little colonists” as Jaulin calls them) converged to the relentless disavowal and destruction of Bari’s culture and society.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ethnocide</b> {{means that}} {{an ethnic group}} is {{denied the right to}} enjoy, develop and {{transmit}} its own culture and its own language, whether collectively or individually.

50|$|Ethnodevelopment is {{the means}} of {{countering}} <b>ethnocide</b> by enabling ethnic, minority, and/or exploited groups to revive values of their specific culture {{with a focus on}} strengthening their ability to resist exploitation and oppression and especially, their independent decision-making power through more effective control of the political, economic, social, and cultural processes affecting their development. Ethnodevelopment is a policy established in response to <b>ethnocide,</b> where indigenous cultures and ways of life are being lost due to large-scale development and exploitation in certain developing countries around the world. This large-scale development could include urban development in rural communities and exploitation of natural resources including building dams, mines, or clear-cutting forests. Typically self-led ethnodevelopment is favoured, where the indigenous peoples are involved in creating a plan for their future development and organization of communities in a way that follows their tradition beliefs and customs.|$|E
