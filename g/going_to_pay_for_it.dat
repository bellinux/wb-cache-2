500|$|Dennis {{explained}} that his character is oblivious to Robert's intentions and believes Robert is taking {{him on a}} family camping holiday. When Robert has Paul alone he drugs him and {{take him to the}} mineshaft. Robert admits to causing the plane crash which killed the Bishop family, intending Paul, Elle and Izzy to die. Dennis {{explained that}} Robert [...] "really goes to town telling Paul what a terrible father he's been and how he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> now." [...] Robert gloats about his successful scheming and seals the entrance to the mine leaving Paul for dead. But Katya Kinski (Dichen Lachman) begins to suspect that Robert is mentally ill and it is up to her to convince other residents and save Paul from death. Paul escapes but Katya is next to be kidnapped by Robert because he is infatuated with her. She decides to humour Robert in the hope he will return her to Erinsborough. But Robert discovers that Paul plans to marry his mother Gail. He is unaware that it is a ruse set-up by authorities to arrest him. Katya convinces Robert that they should not leave together because he has a final chance to kill Paul at the wedding.|$|E
2500|$|Collins: He {{was on the}} {{dockside}} with Anne, his daughter[...] [...] [...]. I think I {{arrived in}} April and I don't think we went south until August. It took {{quite a long time}} to get the money together; it kept falling through. I think Columbia was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> at one point, but they insisted he have a union engineer with him and someone extra like that—in situations we were going to be in would have been hopeless. So he refused, and they withdrew their funding. It was very last minute that the Ertegun brothers at Atlantic gave us the cash and we were gone within days of getting that money. Alan had wanted to do it earlier, but there was just no money to do it with. He had no money, ever. He was always living hand to mouth.|$|E

5000|$|Immediately {{after the}} announcement, Pence {{said that he}} was [...] "very {{supportive}} of Donald Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States". Pence {{said that he was}} [...] "absolutely" [...] in sync with Trump's Mexican wall proposal, stating that Mexico was [...] "absolutely" [...] <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Eldritch {{also used}} Steinman {{to get his}} record company to concede an {{appropriate}} recording budget: [...] "That's {{one of the reasons}} why I used Jim Steinman, cos when he says to the record company 'We want choirs and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> now!' they just hand over the money. Whereas if I asked for it they'd think 'What's he really going to spend the money on?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{prosecution}} believed Kraft's former lover, Jeff Graves, {{may have}} assisted Kraft in several murders. Graves, {{who had lived}} with Kraft between 1971 and 1976 (when 16 known murders attributed to Kraft occurred) had been questioned {{in relation to the}} Crotwell abduction and murder in 1975, when he verified part of Kraft's statement to police. When questioned further about the incident following Kraft's arrest in 1983, Graves had informed investigators: [...] "I'm really not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> you know." ...|$|E
5000|$|Judge Murphy fined {{the union}} $90,000, {{to be paid}} out of workers' checks (a cost of {{approximately}} $9 per worker). Mayor Schaefer promised that [...] "taxpayers are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> one red cent for this year's settlement," [...] suggesting that 300 public sector workers would be laid off to accommodate the raise.|$|R

50|$|In addition, Laker Airways {{agreed with}} Japanese lessor Mitsui that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> buy the {{aircraft}} from McDonnell-Douglas before leasing them <b>to</b> Laker <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the leases out of flying revenues only. This meant the airline was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the aircraft {{if they were}} not revenue-earning. It proved to be effective to minimise the financial risk an investment on this scale posed.|$|R
50|$|Deveraux {{continues}} {{to regain his}} memories while Roberts tries {{to find out more}} information about the UniSol program. They step into a greasy spoon diner {{in the middle of the}} desert. Deveraux finds himself alone there for a while and starts ordering and devouring plate after plate of food, until the waitress asks how he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> all. When Deveraux looks blankly at her, she calls out Hank, the cook, who threatens to harm him for being a deadbeat. However, Deveraux, though innocently saying he doesn't want to hurt him, easily beats Hank and every single patron who steps up to take him on.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2015, {{after the}} {{outbreak}} began, Pence allowed {{at least five}} counties to open needle exchanges, but did not move to lift the state ban on funding for needle exchanges. Critics say Pence's compromise has been ineffective because counties {{had no way to}} pay for needle exchanges themselves. Indiana State Health Commissioner Jerome Adams defended Pence, saying that publicly funded needle exchange programs are controversial in many conservative communities. In middle America, Adams said, you can't [...] "just point your finger at folks and say, 'You need to have a syringe exchange and we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> with your tax dollars.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|One of the committee's more {{controversial}} reports {{during his tenure}} suggested that U.S. shipyards {{be allowed to go}} out of business rather than be propped up by government subsidy. The report, released July 16, 1985, concluded that the country's shipyard capacity is [...] "considerably greater" [...] than would be required in a major conventional war. Using classified Pentagon studies, the report concluded that shipyards could expand production by 3½ to six times, providing all the new ships that would be needed. [...] "Look at England in the Falklands", Sonenshein told the Washington Post. [...] "In less than two months, they were able to modify and convert some 50 of their merchant ships that were then used for naval operations...Sure, it's always better to have more shipyards and more merchant ships to give you a margin of safety. But the hard question is, are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it?</b> I wouldn't pay for any more than we now have." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the city's day {{of purple}} spray?" [...] asked Don Holliday of the Cape Argus. [...] "As the {{controversy}} continues over who is <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the clean-up of buildings, streets, cars and clothing sprayed purple by police during Saturday's Mass Democratic Movement's attempted march to parliament, police {{announced that they}} would release details {{of the effects of}} the dye." ...|$|R
5000|$|An Ohio Republican {{state senator}} said, “When {{you take on}} a {{difficult}} student, you’re basically saying, ‘We feel that our model can help this child be successful.

50|$|The court’s {{ruling was}} much broader than just {{abortion}} {{and family planning}} services; {{if the government is}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> a program, it can attach conditions. Under Rust v. Sullivan, federal funds for family planning programs could promote only childbirth options without being considered discriminatory. Other views, particularly abortion services, could not be admitted within the programs’ narrowly defined scope.|$|R
50|$|Lynette {{is furious}} when she finds Preston {{sleeping}} {{in the same room}} as Irina. Later, Preston and Irina announce {{that they are going to}} find an apartment so they can do whatever they want, Lynette is all for it because she is hoping they find a small apartment that will eventually lead them to break up like what almost happened to her and Tom. Her hopes are destroyed when Preston announces that they find a large 3 bedroom apartment and when she asks how he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> he tells them he is putting off college and getting a job. Tom reminds him that he needs an education to get a good job but states that he is making good money by being a gutter at a meat locker. Lynette refuses to let this happen and insists that Preston is making a mistake marrying Irina. Lynette tells Irina that she is going to fight her until she dies and tells Irina that she is Preston's mother and he will always choose her, but Irina says that will change soon because they have decided to move the wedding to next week instead so Preston will choose his wife over her.|$|E

5000|$|John Moelaert {{recalled}} {{that at the}} meeting, [...] "Most of the people were underwhelmed," [...] and that, [...] "Not a few were clearly hostile," [...] but hostilities were present. [...] Opponents of Moelaert's proposal, argued that Kamloops needed a public indoor swimming pool, better facilities for its senior citizens and that they don't feel comfortable with animals being locked up in cages. [...] Moelaert would {{make it clear to}} the public that, [...] "The well-being of animals was as important to me as it was to my critics," [...] and went further to explain, [...] "That a zoological park (The name wildlife park came into use later) could be a major recreational, educational and conservation project." [...] However, opposition to Moelaert's plan was still strong and support for his proposal was lukewarm as different questions were being asked on: How is he going to find a 100 acre? Why not he start small with a few acres? How is he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>it?</b> Moelaert would admit {{that he did not have}} all the answers and reminded the audience at the public meeting that his purpose for this meeting was to start the formation of a society so that they can gather information to answer those questions and to determine whether having a zoological park was even feasible. [...] Moelaert then asked for donations for the proposed society and received a $10 bill from Ralph Thomas, General Manager of the Kamloops Pulp Mill and received an additional $5 from Reg Waugh. The public meeting would end after it appointed Jim Watson, Mrs S. Dow, lawyer Andrew Berna, Chamber of Commerce representative Fred Nesbitt, and John Moelaert as committee members to pursue the matter of setting up a society.|$|E
