40|$|Medical {{family therapy}} has many {{potential}} uses in behavioral medicine and primary care. Current research was reviewed {{to determine the}} most advantageous way to apply solution-focused therapy and motivational interviewing as a perfect marriage in medical family therapy. An extensive literature review was done <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>databases</b> for medical family therapy: Proquest, EBSCO, Medline, and PsychInfo. The search resulted in 86 relevant articles, of which 46 {{of the most recent}} were selected for review. Medical family therapy lacks current research that supports solution-focused therapy or motivational interviewing. However, evidence supports the use of solution-focused therapy as a brief format, as well as the closely related intervention, motivational interviewing. While medical family therapy presents many hopeful possibilities in the fields of behavioral medicine, psychology, and marriage and family therapy, little evidence currently exists for the most effective implementation. This review found evidence supporting solution-focused therapy and motivational interviewing as the perfect marriage of the collaborative team approaches for the future implementation and use of specific interventions in medical family therapy...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} concepts and clinical indicators that evidence spiritual distress in patients. Integrative review was the method adopted {{for the development}} of the study. In the initial stage, 82 studies were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>databases</b> PUBMED, COCHRANE, CINAHL, LILACS and North American Nursing Diagnosis Association Conference Proceedings and 18 were selected. The descriptors used were spirituality and nursing diagnosis in addition to the term spiritual distress. Literature review (38. 9 %) and articles with level of evidence IV (27. 8 %) were the predominant types of study. The analysis of the articles revealed that the identified concepts of spiritual distress presented common and related elements to the human being subjective and individual response to life experiences, which harm the human spiritual dimension. Defining spiritual distress is a complex task since it depends on the perspective of those evaluating it, limiting in this way, its generalization. However, knowledge regarding the constructs that guide the understanding of human spirituality can base the nursing care in its spiritual dimension, thus providing theoretical support for the diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The unique {{anatomy of}} the hip is challenging, and has slowed the {{progress}} of hip arthroscopy. The aim of this review is to provide an updated synthesis of existing clinical evidence on hip arthroscopy. SOURCES OF DATA: A systematic computerized literature search was conducted by two independent reviewers using an iterative manipulation process of the keywords used singularly or <b>in</b> combination. <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>databases</b> were accessed on 30 th November, 2009 : PubMed ([URL] Ovid ([URL] and Cochrane Reviews ([URL] Case reports, literature reviews, letters to editors and articles not including outcome measures were excluded. Twenty-three publications met the inclusion criteria and were included. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Hip arthroscopy can provide an alternative to traditional arthrotomy with great therapeutic potential. However, the available data do not allow definitive conclusion on its routine use. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: It is still unclear whether arthroscopy is superior to open surgery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> management of femoroacetabular impingement and labral lesions. GROWING POINTS: Rather than providing strong evidence for or {{against the use of}} hip arthroscopy, this study generates potential areas for additional prospective investigations to evaluate the role of hip arthroscopy in clinical practice. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: There is a need to perform appropriately planned and powered studies to clarify the role of arthroscopy in hip pathology...|$|R
40|$|Background Self-Medication (SM), i. e. using {{medications}} to treat oneself, {{is a major}} concern for health researchers and policy makers. The terms “self medication ” or “self-medication ” (SM terms) have been used to explain various concepts while several terms have also been employed to define this practice. Hence, retrieving relevant publications would require exhaustive liter-ature screening. So, we assessed the current situation of SM terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature to im-prove the relevancy of search outcomes. Methods In this Systematic exploration, SM terms were searched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 6 <b>following</b> <b>databases</b> and publisher’s portals till April 2012 : Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Google scholar, Scien-ceDirect, and Wiley. A simple search query was used to include only publications with SM terms. We used Relative-Risk (RR) to estimate the probability of SM terms use in related compared to unrelated publications. Sensitivity and specificity of SM terms as keywords in search query were also calculated. Relevant terms to SM practice were extracted and their Likelihood Ratio positive and negative (LR+/-) were calculated to assess their effect on the probability of search outcomes relevancy in addition to previous search queries. We also evaluated the content of unrelated publications. All mentioned steps were performed in title (TI) and title or abstract (TIAB) of publications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{summarize}} the main clinical entities associated with fever without source (FWS) in infants, {{as well as}} the clinical management of children with occult bacteremia, emphasizing laboratory tests and empirical antibiotics. SourcesA non-systematic review was conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>databases</b> – PubMed, EMBASE, and SciELO, between 2006 and 2015. Summary of the findingsThe prevalence of occult bacteremia has been decreasing dramatically in the past few years, due to conjugated vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Additionally, fewer requests for complete blood count and blood cultures have been made for children older than 3 months presenting with FWS. Urinary tract infection is the most prevalent bacterial infection in children with FWS. Some known algorithms, such as Boston and Rochester, can guide the initial risk stratification for occult bacteremia in febrile infants younger than 3 months. ConclusionsThere is no single algorithm to estimate the risk of occult bacteremia in febrile infants, but pediatricians should strongly consider outpatient management in fully vaccinated infants older than 3 months with FWS and good general status. Updated data about the incidence of occult bacteremia in this environment after conjugated vaccination are needed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{conducted}} a literature review of tools {{used to evaluate}} functionality in {{children with low vision}} with the aim of analyzing the applicability, advantages, and disadvantages for children < 6 years of age, an age at which visual development is mostly complete. Publications in Portuguese, English and, Spanish describing functional evaluation tools for children aged 0 - 18 years with low vision <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>databases</b> were included: Web of Science, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane, Scielo, and PubMed. A total of 181 articles were collected, 15 of which were included in this review. Thirteen tools were identified, nine of which evaluated overall functionality and quality of life through questionnaires. The other 4 instruments, using a observational test model, evaluated functionality and they were elected. Observational tests chosen for their accuracy and lower selection bias were used to evaluate visual functionality. Of these, the Functional Vision Assessment up to 6 years seems to be promising. In conclusion, we observed a lack of tools for evaluating functionality in children with low vision. This type of evaluation is necessary for planning visual rehabilitation to improve quality of life in children with low vision...|$|E
40|$|Any library {{objective}} is {{to provide access to}} information to the users. In the case of science libraries we must be aware of the scientific production of our users too. The Virtual Health Sciences Library of the Balearic Islands (Bibliosalut) has been active in social networks from 2012. From the beginning we wanted to disseminate research production of the Balearic Public Health Service, this is why we created the hashtag #PublicaSalutIB. With this tag we wanted to give to any user the option to use it. In order to detect published articles Bibliosalut we created some RSS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>databases</b> and platforms: Pubmed, CINAHL, Embase. com and Web of Science. Searches are also performed manually in databases that do not have the option of RSS. Information is broadcast on Twitter, Facebook and Google+, an email is also sent to the authors to inform the dissemination has been made. Many of the authors inform to Bibliosalut they publish a document. This service improves the user-library relationship as the authors know the usefulness of this work and gives visibility of our researchers work.

40|$|The {{usage of}} {{databases}} containing 3 D information {{is getting more}} and more importance in various domains like traffic management, urban construction, simulation of safety critical driver assistance systems etc. Nevertheless current approaches do not tap the full potential of such databases. Most of them are set up by hand and do only contain data suitable for one main purpose. In this paper a tool chain approach is presented that combines automatically generation of 3 D landscapes with precise real world data (like cadastral plans, road measurement, aerial photographs, navigation data, etc.) for usage in more than one field of application. This tool chain is developing by the Institute of Transportation Systems within the project called “SimWorld”. SimWorld sets up a database <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domain for transportation research. Therefore it was necessary to focus on road representation in a new and very detailed way. Additionally a representation of urban environment and rural areas including high quality visualization needs to be generated out of this data. A special database schema reflects these both issues. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> <b>database</b> design and the tool chain modules will be discussed in comparison to existing approaches and explained <b>in</b> detail. Also <b>the</b> topic of the project outcome and the further development of the Sim-World tool chain will be touched on...|$|R
