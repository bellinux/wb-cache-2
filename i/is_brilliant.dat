It <b>is</b> <b>brilliant,</b> deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E

[...] Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was [...] "not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy".

Thompson was further acclaimed for her work in the London-based romance Last Chance Harvey (2008), where she and Dustin Hoffman played a lonely, middle-aged pair who cautiously begin a relationship. Critics praised the chemistry between the two leads, and both received Golden Globe nominations for their performances.

But man, what a plot". Various critics lauded Noble's performance. Website blogger io9 listed [...] "Grey Matters" [...] {{as one of the few}} [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.

It is a fitting tribute to the masterwork." [...] Subhash K.Jha of IANS gave it 4 out of 5 stars, while commenting, [...] "Every component of the film falls into place, with a resounding thump. Agneepath <b>is</b> <b>brilliant</b> in its brutality. It's a riveting and hectic homage {{to the spirit of}} the cinema when revenge reigned supreme. And content was king.
