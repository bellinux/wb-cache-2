40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} error growth of {{navigation}} systems using low-cost inertial measurement units {{there is a need}} to fuse the information with complementary sensors. In this paper a monocular camera is used to aid the system. Unlike SLAM-like approaches the problem of estimating the location of each feature point viewed in a scene is avoided, instead estimated <b>epipolar</b> <b>points</b> on the image plane are used. By maintaining a buffer of past views, the method mimics a short-term visual memory which imposes multiple constraints on the estimation problem. The result is a Sigma-Point Kalman filter in square-root form with a linear and efficient time-update. A simulation study is presented indicating the filter's capacity to constrain the rate of error growth of an inertial navigation system. The filter may also find useful applications when fusing with additional sensors. QC 20110407 </p...|$|E
50|$|An epipolar {{line is a}} {{function}} of the position of point X in the 3D space, i.e. as X varies a set of epipolar lines is generated in both images. Since the 3D lineOL-X passes through the optical center of the lens OL, the corresponding epipolar line in the right image must pass through the epipole eR (and correspondingly for epipolar lines in the left image). All epipolar lines in one image contain the <b>epipolar</b> <b>point</b> of that image. In fact, any line which contains the <b>epipolar</b> <b>point</b> is an <b>epipolar</b> line since it can be derived from some 3D point X.|$|R
40|$|The viewing graph {{represents}} {{a set of}} views that are re-lated by pairwise relative geometries. In the context of Structure-from-Motion (SfM), the viewing graph is the in-put to the incremental or global estimation pipeline. Much effort has been put towards developing robust algorithms to overcome potentially inaccurate relative geometries in the viewing graph during SfM. In this paper, we take a fun-damentally different approach to SfM and instead focus on {{improving the quality of}} the viewing graph before apply-ing SfM. Our main contribution is a novel optimization that improves the quality of the relative geometries in the view-ing graph by enforcing loop consistency constraints with the <b>epipolar</b> <b>point</b> transfer. We show that this optimization greatly improves the accuracy of relative poses in the view-ing graph and removes the need for filtering steps or robust algorithms typically used in global SfM methods. In addi-tion, the optimized viewing graph can be used to efficiently calibrate cameras at scale. We combine our viewing graph optimization and focal length calibration into a global SfM pipeline that is more efficient than existing approaches. To our knowledge, ours is the first global SfM pipeline capable of handling uncalibrated image sets. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} method for guiding a {{photographer}} to rotate her/his smartphone camera to obtain an image that overlaps with another image of the same scene. The other image is taken by another photographer from a different viewpoint. Our method is applicable even when the images do not have overlapping fields of view. Straightforward applications of our method include sharing attention to regions of interest for social purposes, or adding missing images to improve structure for motion results. Our solution uses additional images of the scene, which are often available since many people use their smartphone cameras regularly. These images may be available online from other photographers who are present at the scene. Our method avoids 3 D scene reconstruction; it relies instead on a new representation that consists of the spatial orders of the scene points on two axes, x and y. This representation allows a sequence of points to be chosen efficiently and projected onto the photographers images, using <b>epipolar</b> <b>point</b> transfer. Overlaying these epipolar lines on the live preview of the camera produces a convenient interface to guide the user. The method was tested on challenging datasets of images and succeeded in guiding a photographer from one view to a non-overlapping destination view...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to camera calibration {{as a part of a}} complete and practical system to recover digital copies of sculpture from uncalibrated image sequences taken under turntable motion. In this paper we introduce the concept of the silhouette coherence of a set of silhouettes generated by a 3 D object. We show how the maximization of the silhouette coherence can be exploited to recover the camera poses and focal length. Silhouette coherence can be considered as a generalization of the well known epipolar tangency constraint for calculating motion from silhouettes or outlines alone. Further, silhouette coherence exploits all the information in the silhouette (not just at <b>epipolar</b> tangency <b>points)</b> and can be used in many practical situations where point correspondences or outer epipolar tangents are unavailable. We present an algorithm for exploiting silhouette coherence to efficiently and reliably estimate camera motion. We use this algorithm to reconstruct very high quality 3 D models from uncalibrated circular motion sequences, even when <b>epipolar</b> tangency <b>points</b> are not available or the silhouettes are truncated. The algorithm has been integrated into a practical system and has been tested on over 50 uncalibrated sequences to produce high quality photo-realistic models. Three illustrative examples are included in this paper. The algorithm is also evaluated quantitatively by comparing it to a state-of-the-art system that exploits only epipolar tangents...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new video {{stabilization}} technique that uses projective scene re-construction to treat jittered video sequences. Unlike methods that recover the full three-dimensional {{geometry of the}} scene, this model accounts for simple geometric relations between <b>points</b> and <b>epipolar</b> lines. Using this level of scene understanding, we obtain the physical correctness of 3 D sta-bilization methods yet avoid their lack of robustness and computational costs. Our method consists of tracking feature points in the scene and using them to compute fundamental matrices that model stabilized camera mo-tion. We then project the tracked points onto the novel stabilized frames using <b>epipolar</b> <b>point</b> transfer and synthesize new frames using image-based frame warping. Since this model is only valid for static scenes, we develop a time-view reprojection that accounts for non-stationary points in a princi-pled way. This reprojection is based on modeling the dynamics of smooth inertial object motion in three-dimensional space and allows us to avoid the need to interpolate stabilization for moving objects from their static sur-rounding. Thus, we achieve an adequate stabilization when both the camera and the objects are moving. We demonstrate the abilities of our approach to stabilize hand-held video shots in various scenarios: scenes with no par-allax that challenge 3 D approaches, scenes containing non-trivial parallax effects, videos with camera zooming and in-camera stabilization, as well as movies with large moving objects...|$|R

The problem of determining camera motion from the apparent contours of curved three-dimensional surfaces, is studied.

A generalised epipolar constraint is introduced, which applies to points, curves, as well as to apparent contours of surfaces.

Results of an iterative scheme to recover the epipolar line structure from real image sequences using only the outlines of curved surfaces, is presented.

40|$|Computing the epipolar {{geometry}} between cameras {{with very}} different viewpoints is often very difficult. The appearance of objects can vary greatly, {{and it is difficult}} to find corresponding feature points. Prior methods searched for corresponding <b>epipolar</b> lines using <b>points</b> on the convex hull of the silhouette of a single moving object. These methods fail when the scene includes multiple moving objects. This paper extends previous work to scenes having multiple moving objects by using the "Motion Barcodes", a temporal signature of lines. Corresponding epipolar lines have similar motion barcodes, and candidate pairs of corresponding epipoar lines are found by the similarity of their motion barcodes. As in previous methods we assume that cameras are relatively stationary and that moving objects have already been extracted using background subtraction...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} matrix, which encodes the <b>epipolar</b> constraint between <b>points</b> in two projective views, is {{a cornerstone}} of modern computer vision. Previous works have proposed different characterizations of the space of essential matrices as a Riemannian manifold.

The proposed algorithm has been implemented and tested on both real and synthetic images, and it is compared to other linear and non-linear approaches to weak calibration. 1 Introduction The geometric information contained in two images taken by uncalibrated perspective cameras is completely captured by the epipolar geometry of the two images, i. e., by {{the knowledge of the}} epipoles and of the homography, called epipolar transformation, relating the pencils of epipolar lines in the two images, or equivalently, by the knowledge of the fundamental matrix [8, 18].

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{introduces}} a novel antipodal-epipolar constraint on relative camera motion. By using antipodal points, {{which are available}} in large Field-of-View cameras, the translational and rotational motions of a camera are geometrically decoupled, allowing them to be separately estimated as two problems in smaller dimensions. We present a new formulation based on discrete camera motions, which works over a larger range of motions compared to previous differential techniques using antipodal points. The use of our constraints is demonstrated with two robust and practical algorithms, one based on RANSAC and the other based on Hough-like voting. As an application of the motion decoupling property, we also present a new structure-from-motion algorithm that does not require explicitly estimating rotation (it uses only the translation found with our methods). Finally, experiments involving simulations and real image sequences will demonstrate that our algorithms perform accurately and robustly, with some advantages over the state-of-the-art.

Then an operator must zoom and click on control points in images to prepare coordinate of control points in image coordinate system and select one image (generally middle image) as base or template image,this is the only stage that needs operator. to compute interior and exterior parameters of cameras, bundle adjustment is performed. then using image matching technique and <b>epipolar</b> geometry <b>points</b> of edges of base image is searched in other images. applying coordinates of corresponding points and collinearity equation,object space coordinate of point is computed in a least square adjustment and its position accuracy is evaluated. then all accepted points (irregular point cloud of object) is filtered to prepare a regular point cloud. all these stages are done automatically without operator interfere. in this paper above mentioned parts of software are explained and finally some practical applications of the software presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|Linear array {{scanners}} {{are used}} as a substitute of two-dimensional/frame digital cameras since they can produce high-resolution digital images comparable to scanned aerial photographs. On the other hand, digital frame cameras have inadequate size that is dictated by technical considerations/limitations. In general, rigorous sensor modelling involves {{the description of the}} physical process of data capture using such a sensor. For imaging systems, rigorous modelling incorporates the systemâ€™s interior and exterior orientation parameters. Such parameters might not be always available for linear array scanners (e. g., commercially available IKONOS scenes). Deriving these parameters requires numerous ground control points. Moreover, the estimation process is geometrically ill posed due to the narrow angular field of view of the imaging system. Recently, parallel projection has emerged as an approximate model (for high altitude scanners with narrow angular field of view) {{that can be used to}} represent the mathematical relationship between scene and object space coordinates using few parameters. This paper outlines the derivation of resampling approach of linear array scanner scenes according to <b>epipolar</b> geometry. Conjugate <b>points</b> should have no y-parallax in the resampled scenes. Moreover, they should have an x-parallax that is linearly proportional to the corresponding object height. Such requirements can only be met by projecting the original scenes into a common horizontal plane. The paper explains the selection of such plane to meet these specifications. Experimental results using IKONOS data demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{geometric}} and algebraic relations that exist between correspondences of points and lines in an arbitrary number of images. We propose {{to use the}} formalism of the Grassmann-Cayley algebra as {{the simplest way to}} make both geometric and algebraic statements in a very synthetic and effective way (i. e. allowing actual computation if needed). We have a fairly complete picture of the situation in the case of points: there are only three types of algebraic relations which are satisfied by the coordinates of the images of a 3 -D point: bilinear relations arising when we consider pairs of images among the $N$Â and which are the well-known epipolar constraints, trilinear relations arising when we consider triples of images among the $N$, and quadrilinear relations arising when we consider four-tuples of images among the $N$. Moreover, we show that for a given triple of images, once the epipolar constraints are known, there is only one algebraically independent trilinear relation which can be used to predict the image coordinates of a point in a third image, given the coordinates of the images in the other two images, even in cases where the prediction by the <b>epipolar</b> constraints fails (<b>points</b> in the trifocal plane, or optical centers aligned). We also show that the trilinear relations imply the bilinear ones, i. e. the epipolar constraints. Finally, we show that the quadrilinear relations are algebraically dependent of the trilinear and bilinear ones, i. e. do not bring in any new information. In the case of lines, we show how the traditional perspective projection equation can be suitably generalized and {{that in the case of}} three images there exist two independent trilinear relations between the coordinates of the images of a 3 -D line...|$|R
