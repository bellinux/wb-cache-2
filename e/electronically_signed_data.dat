With a coverage of over 13.5 million Chamber Members, ChamberSign will ensure the check of {{the identity of the}} sender of <b>electronically</b> <b>signed</b> <b>data</b> over the Internet and the verification of the message integrity, thus securing cross-border trading over the Internet between companies certified by Chambers of Commerce.|$|E
40|$|<b>Electronically</b> <b>signed</b> {{documents}} {{can lose}} value of evidence because {{the security of}} cryptographic algorithms decreases {{in the course of}} time. In this paper we describe legal, technical and user-oriented requirements for long-term conservation of provability of <b>electronically</b> <b>signed</b> documents, which were systematically examined in the project “ArchiSig- Conclusive and secure long term archiving of digitally signed documents”. Existing concepts are presented and evaluated. Subsequently, we present the concept of ArchiSig with its theoretical foundations and its possible applications. 1. Problems and Objectives The integrity and authenticity of electronic documents can be proved with the help of electronic signatures if the underlying cryptographic algorithms are secure. However, hash and public key algorithms can lose their security suitability in the course of time, which can endanger the provability of <b>electronically</b> <b>signed</b> documents after a longer period of time. In many fields of application, documents need to be archived for 30 years or more in a secure and conclusive way. Therefore, the value of evidence of electronic signatures has to be preserved actively before the extinction of security suitability of the employed cryptographic algorithm. In the ArchiSig project, supported by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (VERNET program) under the number 01 MS 121, an interdisciplinary team of representatives from science, industry and users elaborates solutions and concepts for the secure and conclusive long-term archiving of <b>electronically</b> <b>signed</b> documents. Among others, the objective of the ArchiSig project is to work out legal, technical and useroriented requirements for a long-term conservation of provability of <b>electronically</b> <b>signed</b> documents, to evaluate existing concepts according to these requirements and to elaborate new concepts that meet these requirements. 2.

40|$|Organizations often {{transmit}} {{phone conversations}} via private business exchanges (PBXs) using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), which is evermore frequently available via cloud computing. Conversations that utilize this technology are easily recorded, and consequently can become digital artifacts {{that are available}} for use as forensic evidence. However, their soundness as evidence could be called into question because these artifacts can be manipulated. As {{a solution to this}} problem, we present a concept to achieve non-repudiation for natural-language conversations by <b>electronically</b> <b>signing</b> packet-based, digital, voice communication. A digital, voice communication is made up of two parts: a bidirectional data stream and a temporal sequence. Ensuring the security of such a communication involves protecting both its integrity and authenticity. This is achieved using a signature, key-based approach that is conceptually close to the protocols already inherent to VoIP, allowing it to be interoperable with existing VoIP infrastructures. Additionally, in order to develop a fully trustworthy voice signature terminal, we incorporate various design principles defined by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) with regard to both software and hardware. By <b>signing</b> both the <b>data</b> streams and the temporal sequence of a communication, various attacks are mitigated. These include tampering with the content of the conversation in order to change the meaning; deliberately suppressing packets; falsely claiming that packets did not arrive; and finally sending dual data streams with the intention to replace or invalidate data. A trustworthy voice signature terminal will provide complete non-repudiation of conversations by protecting the integrity of voice conversations, authenticating speakers, and <b>electronically</b> <b>signing</b> voice communications...|$|R

40|$|Summary. We {{present a}} concept to achieve {{non-repudiation}} for natural language conversations over the Internet. The method rests on chained electronic signatures applied to pieces of packet-based, digital, voice communication. It establishes {{the integrity and}} authenticity of the bidirectional data stream and its temporal sequence and thus the security context of a conversation. The concept {{is close to the}} protocols for Voice over the Internet (VoIP), provides a high level of inherent security, and extends naturally to multilateral non-repudiation, e. g., for conferences. Signatures over conversations can become true declarations of will in analogy to <b>electronically</b> <b>signed,</b> digital documents. This enables binding verbal contracts, in principle between unacquainted speakers, and in particular without witnesses. A reference implementation of a secure VoIP archive is exhibited. ...|$|R

40|$|PurposeThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether an {{integrated}} imaging computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system with embedded decision support for imaging can be accepted clinically. MethodsThe study was performed in a health care delivery network with an affiliated academic hospital. After pilot testing and user feedback, a Web-enabled CPOE system with embedded imaging decision support was phased into clinical use between 2000 and 2010 across outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings. The primary outcome measure was meaningful use, defined as the proportion of imaging studies performed with orders electronically created (EC) or <b>electronically</b> <b>signed</b> by an authorized provider. The secondary outcome measure was adoption, defined as the proportion of imaging studies that were ordered electronically, irrespective of who entered the order in the CPOE system. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to estimate trends and the significance of practice settings, examination modality, and body part to outcome measures. Chi-square statistics were used to assess differences across specialties. ResultsA total of 4. 1 million imaging studies were performed during the study period. From 2000 to 2010, significant increases in meaningful use (for EC studies, from 0. 4 % to 61. 9 %; for <b>electronically</b> <b>signed</b> studies, from 0. 4 % to 92. 2 %; P <. 005) and the adoption of CPOE (from 0. 5 % to 94. 6 %, P <. 005) were observed. The use of EC studies was greatest in the emergency department and inpatient settings. Meaningful use varied across specialties; surgical subspecialties had the lowest rates of EC studies. ConclusionsImaging CPOE with embedded decision support integrated into the IT infrastructure of the health care enterprise and clinicians' workflow can be broadly accepted clinically...|$|R
