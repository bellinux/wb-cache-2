40|$|The judge basic {{consideration}} in condemning discharge sentence {{can be seen}} from the crime which is committed by military and its effect to the name of Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI). When the crime which is committed by military gives negative effect to the norm of TNI, so it can be used as a basic consideration to give discharge sentence. Besides, it {{can be seen from}} the status of the military who committed a crime. When the military did a crime repeatedly, it can be used as a basic to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>discharge</b> sentence. The existence of discharge sentence still need to be taken care in the future to give deterrent effect to the military. The regulation of discharge sentence in KUHPM must be separated with Civil Penal Code (KUHP) in separated codification. In the future, KUHPM has to formulize explicitly about criteria in discharge sentence application to military as an offender. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates torrent erosion in Lake District {{mountain}} catchments,Northern England. A nested {{research approach}} was used. Detailed investigations were undertaken at two case study sites (Iron Crag, Raise Beck) {{together with a}} survey of torrents across the Skiddaw and Helvellyn massifs. At Iron Crag an annual sediment budget was constructed by monitoring hillslope,channel and fan processes. Particle size characteristics of sediments, {{and the history of}} fan development were investigated. Results show channel and bank sediments are the main source of material supplied to the fan. Large rainfall events cause significant change in the channel, banks and fan. The impact of different meteorological conditions on sediment characteristics is complex, however a seasonal cycle of sediment production (winter) and exhaustion (autumn) exists. Historically, initial fan aggradation predates 36 BC, but a rapid phase of deposition began between 1200 - 1400 AD. Investigations at Raise Beck focussed on a flood that occurred in January 1995 and caused channel avulsion and shallow landsliding. This was reconstructed using a range of geomorphological and sedimentological evidence. Palaeohydrological methods <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>discharge</b> between 27 - 74 in s- 1. whereas as rainfall-runoff values range between 4 - 6 m 3 s- 1. The magnitude of the 1995 flood was smaller than two 19 th Century events, but would still exceed the capacity of contemporary engineered channels. The regional survey considered the characteristics and importance of torrents,mountain streams, and debris flows; and provided a context for work at the case study sites. The case study sites are distinct members of the regional populations. Raise Beck being the largest (133 ha) and highest (858 m O. D.); Iron Crag amongst the smallest (2. 4 ha) and lowest (600 m O. D.). Overall, torrents and hillslope debris flows are minor components of the landscape (aerially 2. 1...|$|E
40|$|Landuse {{change in}} upland Mindanao {{is driven by}} the history of {{commercial}} logging, the disregard for indigenous communities, the lack of tenure for migrants and the limited development of sustainable resource management strategies. The area's climate, forest hydrology and nutrient balances are a source of sustainability, yet with landuse change the potential for erosion and loss of the limited nutrient base, broader environmental degradation is probable without greater accountability and better options. Responses from traditional management indicate some of the possible options to be involved The main forest type is a tangile-oak association (premontane) with total estimated biomass being 479 tha-I. High clay levels, low bulk density and porosity are reflective of the undisturbed forest, estimated infiltration rates start at 10, 000 mmhr-l levelling off in 30 minutes at 1, 700 mmhr-l, high throughflow allows for fast delivery, yet baseflow is sustained during dry season. The other five land uses reflect lower clay, porosity, infiltration rates and nutrient loss especially maize with coffee being an exception given associated activities of soil fauna. The annual precipitation is over 2500 mm, while during El Nifto (1997 - 8) less than 2000 mm fell, registering 3 to 6 months drought in the broader area. Hydrographs <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>discharge</b> pattern of quick return to base flow which is sustained at half rate during droughts. Calculated potential evapotranspiration for maize area is around 28 % while for forest is 55 %of rainfall. More than 30 % of the rainfall events are potentially erosive. Establishing the rainfall pattern and forest water budget gives a definite characterisation and importance to the uplands as valuable water producing areas. Nutrients in precipitation are in the order of sodium, calcium and potassium and, other than magnesium from weathering, are the crucial inputs in a tight forest nutrient cycle. For Bendum, high infiltration may be enough to give constant stream chemistry with established equilibria between aqueous and solid phases, due to the storage time in the soil for where there is good land cover. Ranking of landuses according to levels of sustainability on-site and off site were established [...] .. With expanding agriculture and forest utilization greater soil and water conservation, utilization of buffer zones and a new level of integrated water resource management is needed locally and in both extension work and landuse planning by local government.
