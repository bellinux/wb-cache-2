Her person was graceful her features beautiful and their expression such as to heighten the eloquence of every thing she said.

500|$|Gwendolen, though, still {{insists that}} she can only love a man named Ernest. What is her fiancé's real first name? Lady Bracknell informs Jack that, as the first-born, {{he would have been}} named after his father, General Moncrieff. Jack {{examines}} the army lists and discovers that his father's name—and hence his own real name—was in fact Ernest. Pretence was reality all along. As the happy couples embrace—Jack and Gwendolen, Algernon and Cecily, and even Dr.Chasuble and Miss Prism—Lady Bracknell complains to her newfound relative: [...] "My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality." [...] "On the contrary, Aunt Augusta", he replies, [...] "I've now realised for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> the vital importance of being Earnest." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Crecente, {{editor-in-chief}} of Kotaku, praised the general use of {{light as a}} gameplay-mechanic. He commented on the episodic structure, saying it made the player feel satisfied even after short gameplay sessions. He also praised the overall storyline, having played the final episode thrice in a row, saying: [...] "For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I have experienced something that plays like a game but has {{the impact of a}} movie... Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound to leave you thinking about it and wanting more for days after its completion." [...] He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being [...] "packed with memorable people", but concluded that the game [...] "redefines interactive storytelling".|$|E
500|$|In September 1976, Alston {{announced}} that he would retire {{at the end of the}} season. At a press conference, Alston said, [...] "I've been in baseball for 41 years and it's been awfully good to me. This has been a pretty big day. I had three birdies playing golf for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and now I'm announcing that I'm stepping down as manager. I told Peter this afternoon to give somebody else a chance to manage the club." [...] Alston retired with 2,063 wins (2,040 in the regular season and 23 in the postseason). Alston was named NL Manager of the Year six times. He also managed NL All-Star squads a record nine times and won seven of those games. At a time when multi-year contracts were on the rise, Alston's managerial career consisted of 23 one-year contracts. He earned seven NL pennants in that span.|$|E

500|$|Gens' {{wife and}} {{daughter}} at first went to Kaunas but, after {{the formation of the}} ghetto, they returned to Vilnius and lived near the ghetto's perimeter. His wife used her maiden name rather than Gens'. According to Leonard Tushnet, there were unfounded rumors that the couple had divorced. Gens did not refute the rumors, as he thought they would help protect his family. Other sources state that the two were divorced to protect Elvyra and Ada. Elvyra Gens was opposed to her husband taking {{a leading role in the}} government of the ghetto and urged him to [...] "pass" [...] as a Lithuanian. It is not clear exactly why Gens went into the ghetto, but in a letter to his wife, Gens said [...] "This is the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> that I have to engage in such duties. My heart is broken. But I shall always do what is necessary for the sake of the Jews in the ghetto." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} match, in Bridgetown, Barbados, Boycott was to face what was later {{said to be}} Holding's {{greatest}} over. Boycott was hit on the gloves by the first delivery, played-and-missed the second outside off stump, was hit on the thigh by the third, fended the next two deliveries away with his bat, and was then bowled by the final delivery. Though in 1987 Boycott would claim a 1966 delivery by Gary Sobers {{to be the best}} he ever faced in cricket, he noted of Holding's over that [...] "for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> I can look at a scoreboard with a duck against my name and not feel a profound sense of failure." [...] Boycott led an England fight back in the fourth Test. Having watched Holding's over several times on video, and worked in the nets on his game, Boycott came out and made 38 in the first innings and then hit his twentieth Test century. His career run total was now 7,410, gaining on Gary Sobers' record of 8,032.|$|E
500|$|... "Start Over" [...] {{was written}} by Shea Taylor, Knowles and Ester Dean and {{produced}} by the Knowles and Taylor. It was recorded at MSR Studios and Jungle City Studios in New York City, New York. [...] "Start Over" [...] was mixed by Serban Ghenea with further assistance from Phil Seaford and it was engineered by John Hanes with further assistance from Ramon Rivas and Pete Wolford. Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Knowles' official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and an insightful quote. On June 22, 2011, [...] "Start Over" [...] was the fourth song to be chosen. The quote found Knowles elaborating on what motivated her to record a song like [...] "Start Over": [...] "For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> I was able to travel the world, hear different influences, see different types of dance and choreography and taste different types of food.

500|$|The 2016 Summer Games marked Karma's Olympic début. She {{qualified}} for the women's individual archery tournament after receiving a wildcard from the Tripitate Commission in June 2016 based on her results at the 2015 Asian Archery Championships and the 2016 Archery World Cup qualification event in Antalya. In an interview with Kuensel before the Games, Karma said: [...] "I’m very excited and nervous at the same time. It is {{time for me to}} show what I’ve learned so far against the world’s best archers.”, and to Archer 360, [...] "While in the Sambodromo, I’m hoping to make my country proud. I have a good chance if I am able to maintain my home scores." [...] She competed on 5 August in the ranking round, finishing 60th out of 64th competitors with 588 points. Karma scored 81 points less than the leading competitor, South Korea's Choi Mi-sun. On 8 August she competed in the Round of 64 and was drawn against Tuyana Dashidorzhieva of Russia, the fifth ranking athlete in the ranking round. Karma tied with Dashidorzhieva in the first set before the Russian outscored her by three points to secure the second set. Karma and Dashidorzieva tied with each other in the game's following two sets until the Russian won the final set to win the match. This meant Karma was eliminated from the competition. After the events ended, Karma stated that despite being defeated she enjoyed the match and wanted to compete with archery champions whether she won or lost: [...] "I remember being a bit nervous with the big cameras in the blinds. But I felt excited that it was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> that this would happen," ...|$|E
500|$|From August 2, {{the conference}} debated whether Peng should be disciplined, what {{punishment}} Peng should receive, {{and for what}} reasons. On August 16 the conference passed two resolutions. The first resolution condemned Peng {{as the leader of}} an [...] "anti-Party clique", and called for Peng's removal from the positions of Defense Minister and Vice-Chairman of the Military Commission. The resolution did not eject Peng from the Communist Party, and it allowed Peng to retain his position in the Politburo, but he was excluded from Politburo meetings for years. The second resolution recognized Mao's dominance within the Party and subtly {{called for an end to}} the policies of the Great Leap Forward. After Mao had rallied the rest of the Party against him, Peng's options were limited to stubbornly standing his ground, engaging in a humiliating self-criticism, or suicide. After private discussion with other senior leaders, Peng considered the prestige of Mao and the unity of the Party and agreed to make a self-criticism, which was publicly reviewed at the conference, in which he admitted that he had made [...] "severe mistakes" [...] associated with his [...] "rightist viewpoint", that he had been a follower of Li Lisan and Wang Ming, and in which he openly implicated his supporters in his [...] "mistakes". After the conference, Peng said privately to Zhou Enlai regarding his self-criticism: [...] "For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I have spoken out against my very heart!" [...] Mao purged most of Peng's supporters from important offices following the conference, almost completely isolating Peng politically for the rest of his life. Peng later reflected that he was confused that Mao could have interpreted his private letter as a political attack, and wondered why, after thirty years of working together, Mao could not have discussed the matter privately with him, if Peng had indeed made the mistakes Mao claimed he did.|$|E
500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were {{standing in the way of}} her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E

Dan Martin said that the weather conditions had forced the riders to ride in a conservative manner, since nobody could attack when it was so cold.
