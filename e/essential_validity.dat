40|$|The {{application}} of Ibl’s duplex diffusion layer {{model to the}} analysis of mass transport in pulse reverse plating with bipolar current pulses has been investigated. Although originally proposed to describe normal pulse plating, Yin has recently extended Ibl’s model to include pulse reverse plating. Using the expressions derived by Yin the pulse limiting current density was determined over a wide range of pulse plating conditions, and then compared to values calculated using more accurate numerical solutions. In general, there was good agreement between the two approaches which demonstrated the <b>essential</b> <b>validity</b> of Yin’s extension to Ibl’s original model. The simplified model is most accurate at long duty cycles, small dimensionless pulse times and for low values of the dimensionless pulse reverse current where its underlying assumptions {{are most likely to be}} valid. At very long dimensionless pulse times (i. e. T* > 1) the model becomes increasingly inaccurate and its use in these circumstances cannot be justified...|$|E
40|$|A clear {{choice of}} law rule should be applied to all {{same-sex}} relationships in terms of <b>essential</b> <b>validity.</b> Interest analysis allows {{us to look at}} the public policy reasons behind why a {{choice of law}} rule may be appropriate or inapposite. This technique can lead to unpredictable results. When coupled with depecage, a delineated splitting of competing policy inculcations, this allows for a more certain rules-based system. Each incapacity to marry should have its own appropriate choice of law rule. This piece argues that additional public policy reasons apply to the choice of law appropriate to same-sex relationships. These include citizenship, equality and symbolism, and together require a more extended choice of law rule. It is recommended that a new theory; the continued recognised relationship theory, is suitable for same-sex relationships. This choice of law rule would apply the law where the couple are intending to live, or the law of the country where they have lived, if their relationship has been subsisting for a reasonable period of time.

40|$|The poorly known coleoid genus Atractites Guembel, {{widespread}} in Tethyan Triassic to Lower Jurassic deposits, is formed {{of a number}} of nominal species, most of which represented by incomplete phragmocones and a few by isolated tela. Only a few authors have so far discussed the original species diagnosis of Atractites alpinus Gumbel, 1861 (by monotypy type species of the genus) and the type material, pointing out the difficulties of relating the tela to known phragmocones. After a discussion of aulacocerid forms related to Atractites and their distinctive suprageneric- and generic-rank characters, the present authors distinguish different morphological types among the species attributed to the genus: in particular, the usually poorly-preserved rostral portions are reexamined on the basis of material coming from the Alps, the Dinarids and the Apennines. In the light of the existing evidence, further details are given on rostral morphology of well-preserved specimens and on the different rostral and phragmocone morphologies and relationships, on one side confirming the <b>essential</b> <b>validity</b> of Guembel (1861) ’s diagnosis, on the other one pointing out the necessity to exclude a number of unrelated forms ascribed to the genus.

40|$|The {{proposition}} that late medieval English lawgivers believed {{themselves to be}} exercising a declarative function has been so frequently put forward and so widely accepted {{that it is in}} danger of being canonized by sheer dint of repetition; and thus one who would deny the <b>essential</b> <b>validity</b> of that notion bears the virtually insuperable burden of proof commonly accorded an accused heretic. Nevertheless, it will be argued here that natural law notions are attributed to the medieval English legislator with only the slightest support from the sources, and after only the most rudimentary and uncritical analyses of the implications of such an idea. One possible source of confusion lies {{in the use of the}} term 2 ̆ 2 natural law 2 ̆ 2 in at least two distinct fashions.
