5|$|In 2008, Wong created Wandering Home, an {{installation}} {{consisting of a}} mobile home conceptualised on city living and the homeless, which was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. The small tin hut {{on the back of}} a tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep on the streets and who are forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the house <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in Sham Shui Po. In 2008, Wong created Tin Man No.11, an essay in space in the form of a metallic robot that transforms into a bed. He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E
25|$|A CRID <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> universal, {{unique and}} {{exclusive}} identifier {{for a given}} content. It {{is closely related to}} the authority that creates it, to the resolution service provider, and to the content provider {{in such a way that}} the same content may have different CRIDs depending on the field in which they are used (for example, a different one for each television operator that has the rights to broadcast the content).|$|E
500|$|Around 1171 in Hisn Kayfa, Usama {{wrote the}} Kitab al-'Asa ("Book of the Staff"), a poetry {{anthology}} about famous walking sticks and other staffs, and al-Manazil wa'l-Diyar ("Dwellings and Abodes"). In Damascus {{in the early}} 1180s he wrote another anthology, the Lubab al-Adab ("Kernels of Refinement"), instructions on living a properly cultured life. He is most famous for the Kitab al-I'tibar (translated various ways, most recently as the Book of Contemplation), which was written {{as a gift to}} Saladin around 1183. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> [...] "memoir", as Philip Hitti translated the title, although it does include many autobiographical details that are incidental to the main point. It was meant to be [...] "a book of examples (ibar) from which to draw lessons." ...|$|E
6000|$|He laughed himself, now, a great laugh of relaxation, of relief. [...] "Not {{the least}} in the world! She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> phantom of delight." ...|$|R
50|$|This match <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> final, as {{the tournament}} was a {{round-robin}} tournament. Nevertheless, both teams finished with 6 points, son this tiebreaker playoff final was played.|$|R
50|$|In September, 2008, a Japanese {{franchise}} Crepe House Uni, {{opened in}} Davis, California, but closed in 2010. Their workers wore maid uniforms, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> maid cafe.|$|R
2500|$|In a February 2017 {{review of}} the aircraft's history, AVweb writer Geoff Rapoport blamed the aircraft's failure on an empty weight that was too high, fragile {{construction}} and lack of cockpit space for taller pilots. He stated, [...] "the Skycatcher can’t keep up because it wasn’t really designed as an LSA. It’s a scaled-down Cessna 152, which is a scaled-down Cessna 172, which is a scaled-down 747. I hope I’m not bursting anyone’s bubble {{by pointing out that}} Cessna <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> modern innovator in design of light aircraft." [...] He concluded, [...] "is this all the proof we need that LSAs make for bad airplanes? Well, maybe it’s just proof that the Skycatcher was a bad airplane." ...|$|E
2500|$|Next to the {{downtown}} region {{is the famous}} Savassi district, known for fine restaurants and as a centre of cultural events {{as well as the}} best of the city's nightlife. Many landmarks are located there, such as the Praça da Liberdade (Liberty Square), and its surrounding buildings, including the former Executive Offices of the governor called the Palácio da Liberdade (Liberty Palace), the first building to be finished during the city's planned development in the late 1890s. The government offices moved to the [...] "Cidade Administrativa" [...] in 2010. This complex is made by a few massive buildings just outside the city. Nowadays, the [...] "palaces" [...] are being turned into museums. Still on Savassi, the meeting point of many social groups, especially the youth, is [...] "Praça da Savassi" [...] (Savassi Square), which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> square, and more a crossing between two major avenues (Getúlio Vargas and Cristóvão Colombo), and gathers some of the busiest bars and pubs (called locally [...] "botecos" [...] or [...] "botequins") in town.|$|E
2500|$|The Long Depression was a {{worldwide}} price and economic recession, beginning in 1873 and running either through {{the spring of}} 1879, or 1896, depending on the metrics used.What actually constitutes the Long Depression has been debatable, for {{at first it was}} called the Great Depression, and then that title was transferred to the 1930s. Consequently, some limit the term Long Depression to the worldwide price recession beginning in 1873 and running through the spring of 1879. Six years <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> [...] "long" [...] depression, that in our analysis is 26 years – the typical maximum period which Japan entered following 1989.95. Europe appears to be completing a 13 year depression from 2007 into 2020 thanks to austerity – deliberate deflation to support bondholders. It was the most severe in Europe and the United States, which had been experiencing strong economic growth fueled by the Second Industrial Revolution in the decade following the American Civil War. The episode was labeled the [...] "Great Depression" [...] at the time, and it held that designation until the Great Depression of the 1930s. Though a period of general deflation and a general contraction, it did not have the severe economic retrogression of the Great Depression.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Harmon Andrews, so Avonlea gossip whispered, {{had never}} {{learned how to}} manage her [...] "man," [...] {{and as a result}} the Andrews {{household}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> model of domestic happiness.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps it was absurd. It {{undoubtedly}} appeared so, later. Yet {{there was}} something uncanny about it all. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> feeling of danger or pain, but an apprehension of great evil.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rubbish!" [...] {{the woman}} remarked, sitting {{up on the}} couch. [...] "Why do {{you try to make}} me so uncomfortable, Hester? Sir Leslie may be very clever, but I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> fool myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course," [...] she answered. [...] "If it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> {{coronation}} present, it will {{at least}} help to remind you--of the days before you were a King." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> hold-up," [...] {{said the}} detective {{with a faint}} smile. [...] "Get down and I will explain. If you try to resist, you'll only get into trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{while we}} are hauling strange things up from the deep, suppose we take {{something}} that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> fish, but which is alive and lives in the water. What {{do you think of}} a living thing like this? ...|$|E
60|$|Personal peril <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> {{new thing}} to the major, {{who was also a}} man of fixed ideas; but he made a little {{comprehensive}} gesture when Sewell glanced significantly {{at the edge of the}} precipice.|$|R
6000|$|Now cold {{was another}} word Peter had forgotten, so he answered, 'I think not, but I may be wrong: you see I am rather ignorant. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> boy; Solomon says I am a Betwixt-and-Between.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> stranger, you see," [...] Hamel remarked. [...] "My {{father used}} to stay {{for months at a}} time in that little shanty there and paint pictures. It's a good many years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> fashionable promenade," [...] said Barbel, as we {{approached}} the house, [...] "but in some respects {{it reminds me of the}} streets in Italian towns, where the palaces lean over toward each other in such a friendly way." ...|$|E
60|$|He was grieved {{and polite}} because Mademoiselle was {{beautiful}} and in trouble. For the rest {{he was a little}} tired of her. Brothers of twenty-one, who have never been in Paris before, and cannot speak the language, must occasionally get lost, and the British Embassy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> transported Scotland Yard.|$|E
6000|$|... "My darling girl," [...] {{said her}} ladyship, making the special speech {{for the sake}} of making which she had {{travelled}} up from Richmond,--"it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> question of belief, but one of common prudence. No girl should allow herself to depend on a man before she is married to him. By doing so she will be apt to lose even his respect." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now cold {{was another}} word Peter had forgotten, so he answered, [...] "I think not, but I may be wrong: you see I am rather ignorant. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> boy, Solomon says I am a Betwixt-and-Between." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better than Staples, or Bramshaw & Anderson. Yes, {{it would}} be best to have no {{previous}} knowledge of the family, and no neighbourly acquaintance. Moreover, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>an</b> interested party, so I may be better attended to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As well as I expected," [...] Cheyne {{answered}} with a dry smile. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>an</b> enchanting place--deformed mountains, sun glare, adobe houses, loneliness, and dust. My chief trouble, however, was that I had too much time to think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to argue with you," [...] he said, quietly. [...] "I have ambitions, it is true, and the world <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> {{playground}} for me. Nevertheless, I am not an ascetic like Mannering. The world, the flesh and the devil are very much to me what they are to other men. But in a sense you have cornered me, and you shall have the truth. I want to marry the Duchess of Lenchester myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{have not}} already yielded to {{one who is}} {{naturally}} {{more to me than}} anything, when she begged and entreated, it is because I feel this in a way you don't realize. I apologize for using the word comic just now, I should have said tragic. I'll enlighten Uncle Dennis, if that will comfort you; but this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> matter for anyone, except myself." [...] And, without another look or word, he went out.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no ruler," [...] was the answer, [...] "because {{every member}} of the royal family is imprisoned by the Nome King. But the Princess Langwidere, who is a niece of our late King Evoldo, lives {{in a part of the}} royal palace and takes as much money out of the royal {{treasury}} as she can spend. The Princess Langwidere <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> ruler, you see, because she doesn't rule; but she is the nearest approach to a ruler we have at present." ...|$|E
5000|$|This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> love-letter, and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{certain that}} Beethoven ever {{proposed}} marriage to Therese Malfatti, though authorities such as Hugo Riemann {{believed that he}} did. Further, the bagatelle [...] "F&uuml;r Elise" [...] was found among her personal papers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> sailor; though I may say I {{have worked}} as one before the mast both out and home. That {{was my first}} experience; and I suppose one takes longer than that to get the regular {{nautical}} manner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shut up!" [...] Richard interrupted. [...] "Whatever trouble you're {{ready to}} face, I'm all for it, too. Darned queer {{thing that we}} should be going to the Villa Mimosa, though! I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> popular person with Mr. Grex, I think." ...|$|R
6000|$|He did so, {{and looked}} a trifle grave after it. [...] "I {{know a little}} of these matters, and it is {{advisable}} that this should be seen to," [...] he said. [...] "Now the Portuguese doctor <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> friend of mine, and might ask questions as to how you got hurt and where you came from, {{but there is a}} half-breed who I think is clever, and he would probably refrain from mentioning anything that appeared unusual if he is remunerated sufficiently. It is"--and he made a little expressive gesture, [...] "a thing he is accustomed to doing." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{dropped the}} letter and sat {{motionless}} for a long time. Then I wrote my answer (it was a short one) and went ashore myself to post it. But I passed one letter-box, then another, {{and in the end}} found myself going up Collins Street with the letter still in my pocket--against my heart. Collins Street at four o'clock in the afternoon <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> desert solitude; but I had never felt more isolated from the rest of mankind as when I walked that day its crowded pavement, battling desperately with my thoughts and feeling already vanquished.|$|E
6000|$|... 92. III. The Wild, or gray, Country. [...] "Wild" [...] <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> correct epithet; we mean wide, uninclosed, {{treeless}} undulations of land, whether cultivated or not. The {{greater part}} of northern France, though well brought under the plow, would come under the denomination of gray country. Occasional masses of monotonous forest do not destroy this character. Here, size is desirable, and massiness of form; but we must have no brightness {{of color in the}} cottage, otherwise it would draw the eye to it at three miles off, and the whole landscape would be covered with conspicuous dots. White is agreeable, if sobered down; slate allowable on the roof as well as thatch. For the rest, we need only refer to the remarks made on the propriety of the French cottage.|$|E
60|$|Paul did {{not appear}} much interested. He had a purpose in {{lingering}} here, and {{it had nothing to}} do with May Westover's health. There was a little information he wished to obtain without exciting his mother's curiosity. But it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>an</b> easy matter.|$|R
50|$|The Christ Myth is {{sprinkled}} with {{comparisons between the}} Mithraic mysteries and the cult of Jesus. Although the god Mithras <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> dying-and-rising god, some similarities are meaningful. Especially the sacramental feast which allowed the initiated to experience a mystical union with the god.|$|R
50|$|Yxxxxx, an intergalactic {{parasite}} with {{delusions of}} grandeur and highly dangerous, who is confined {{in a mental}} space, has decided to force three other inmates, who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>an</b> example of prudence, to escape the mental asylum with him to involve them in their evil plans.|$|R
