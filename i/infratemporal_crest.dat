50|$|The upper/superior head {{originates}} on the infratemporal {{surface and}} <b>infratemporal</b> <b>crest</b> {{of the greater}} wing of the sphenoid bone, and the lower/inferior head on the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{inferior}} infratemporal surface, smaller {{in size and}} concave, enters into {{the formation of the}} infratemporal fossa, and, together with the <b>infratemporal</b> <b>crest,</b> serves as an attachment to the lateral pterygoid muscle.|$|E

50|$|The {{superior}} or temporal portion, convex {{from above}} downward, concave from before backward, forms {{a part of}} the temporal fossa, and gives attachment to the Temporalis; the inferior or infratemporal, smaller in size and concave, enters into the formation of the infratemporal fossa, and, together with the <b>infratemporal</b> <b>crest,</b> affords attachment to the Pterygoideus externus.|$|E
50|$|Medial to the {{anterior}} extremity of the <b>infratemporal</b> <b>crest</b> is a triangular process that serves {{to increase the}} attachment of the lateral pterygoid muscle; extending downward and medialward from this process on to the front part of the lateral pterygoid plate is a ridge that forms {{the anterior}} limit of the infratemporal surface, and, in the articulated skull, the posterior boundary of the pterygomaxillary fissure.|$|E
5000|$|This {{tubercle}} {{forms the}} front {{boundary of the}} mandibular fossa, and in the fresh state is covered with cartilage. In front of the articular tubercle is a small triangular area which assists in forming the infratemporal fossa; this area is separated from the outer surface of the squamous part by a ridge which is continuous behind with the anterior root of the zygomatic process, and in front, in the articulated skull, with the <b>infratemporal</b> <b>crest</b> on the great wing of the sphenoid. Between the posterior wall of the external acoustic meatus and the posterior root of the zygomatic process is the area called the suprameatal triangle (Macewen), or mastoid fossa, through which an instrument may be pushed into the tympanic antrum.|$|E
50|$|Each lateral pterygoid {{muscle is}} {{composed}} of 2 heads, the upper or superior head and the lower or inferior head. The lower head originates from the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and inserts at a depression on the neck of mandibular condyle, just below the articular surface, termed the pterygoid fovea. The upper head originates from the infratemporal surface and the <b>infratemporal</b> <b>crest</b> of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The upper head also inserts at the fovea, but a part may be attached directly to the joint capsule and to the anterior and medial borders of the articular disc. The 2 parts of lateral pterygoid have different actions. The lower head contracts during mouth opening, and the upper head contracts during mouth closing. The function of the lower head is to steady the articular disc as it moves back with the condyle into the articular fossa. It is relaxed during mouth closure.|$|E
30|$|LPM has a {{superior}} head with <b>infratemporal</b> <b>crest</b> and surface initiation, the anterior capsule of TMJ insertion, an inferior {{head with a}} lateral surface for pterygoid plate initiation, and the pterygoid fovea below the mandibular head and disc. The main action of the LPM is protruding the jaw and opening the mouth. MPM has a deep head on the lateral pterygoid plate and a smaller superficial head. The main action of the MPM is pulling the mandible upwards, forwards, and medially and closing the mouth during chewing. The LPM and MPM contain venous plexuses that connect with facial veins.|$|E
30|$|The pericranium-attached {{temporal}} {{muscle is}} elevated from the temporal fossa by the remaining 2 – 3 [*]mm fascia on the muscular margin, for its relocation during closing reconstruction. Inferior {{observation of the}} temporalis is recommended until full exposure of the <b>infratemporal</b> <b>crest</b> is achieved. The soft tissues of the sigmoid notch should be protected to prevent IMA injury inside of the mandibular ramus, and the coronoid process should be removed or fractured to increase the inferior rotation arc of the temporal muscle. Wide dissection on the soft tissues of the infratemporal skull base is not recommended due to continuous venous bleeding in the pterygoid plexus. Subtemporal craniotomy {{can be used to}} confirm the neural and vascular foramina (Fig.  3 c and Fig.  4 d).|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the anatomy of the maxillary artery (MA) and its branches. Fourteen sides of Turkish adult cadavers were dissected. The specimens were classified according to the relation between MA and the lateral pterygoid. After the removal of the lateral pterygoid, parts and branches of MA were exposed. We classified the branching patterns of MA in the pterygopalatine fossa. The calibers and lengths of the arteries, and the distance between the zygomatic arch and MA, and between the <b>infratemporal</b> <b>crest</b> and MA were measured. The MA was found superficial to the lateral pterygoid in 57. 2 %. The inferior alveolar artery (IA) was arisen from MA before the middle meningeal artery (MM) in 35. 7 %, after MM in 35. 7 %. The IA and MM were arisen from the same area of MA in 14. 3 %. In other two cases IA was arisen from the beginning of MA (14. 3 %). According to the contours of third portion of MA, we classified “Y ” type (50 %), “intermediate-T ” type (14. 3 %), and “M ” type (35. 7 %). This reinvestigation of the clinical anatomy of MA may provide useful information to the head and neck surgeons, dentists, neurosurgeons and radiologists related with this region...|$|E
