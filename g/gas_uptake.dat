We demonstrate that covalently bonded organic cages can assemble into crystalline microporous materials. The porosity is prefabricated and intrinsic to the molecular cage structure, as opposed to being formed by non-covalent self-assembly of non-porous sub-units. The three-dimensional connectivity between the cage windows is controlled by varying the chemical functionality such that either non-porous or permanently porous assemblies can be produced. Surface areas and <b>gas</b> <b>uptakes</b> for the latter exceed comparable molecular solids. One of the cages can be converted by recrystallization to produce either porous or non-porous polymorphs with apparent Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas of 550 and 23 m 2 g- 1, respectively. These results suggest design principles for responsive porous organic solids and for the modular construction of extended materials from prefabricated molecular pores...|$|R

The activated carbon surface functional groups and pore structure are strongly dependent on the methods of activation and the nature precursor used. Therefore, the main focus of researchers is to develop or modifies the activation techniques in an optimal manner using appropriate precursors for specific applications.

The mesoporosity is decreased when the % solids used during synthesis of the polymer precursor increases and this resulted in kinetic behaviour which was more similar to that predicted by Fickian or LDF models.

Here, through the solvothermal reaction of CuI and 5 -triazole isophthalic acid in different solvents, two metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, FJU- 21 and FJU- 22) with open O donor sites and controllable robustness have been obtained for acetylene separation. They contain the same paddle-wheel {Cu 2 (COO 2) 4 } nodes and metal-ligand connection modes, but with different helical chains as secondary building units (SBUs), leading to different structural robustness for the MOFs. FJU- 21 and FJU- 22 are the first examples in which the MOFs' robustness is controlled by adjusting the helical chain SBUs. Good robustness gives the activated FJU- 22 a, which has higher surface area and <b>gas</b> <b>uptakes</b> than the flexible FJU- 21 a. Importantly, FJU- 22 a shows extraordinary separation of acetylene mixtures under ambient conditions. The separation capacity of FJU- 22 a for 50 : 50 C 2 H 2 /CO 2 mixtures is about twice that of the high-capacity HOF- 3, and its actual separation selectivity for C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 mixtures containing 1 % acetylene is the highest among reported porous materials. Based on first-principles calculations, the extraordinary separation performance of C 2 H 2 for FJU- 22 a was attributed to hydrogen-bonding interactions between the C 2 H 2 molecules with the open O donors on the wall, which provide better recognition ability for C 2 H 2 than other functional sites, including open metal sites and amino groups. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For example, the most common inert gas diluent substitute for nitrogen is helium, which is significantly less soluble in living tissue, but also diffuses faster due to the relatively small size and mass of the He atom in comparison with the N2 molecule.|$|E

The gas-phase diffusion of methanol and of acetone through the interstitial air of snow was investigated in a well-controlled laboratory study in the temperature range of 223 to 263 K. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate how the structure of the snowpack, the interaction of the trace gases with the snow surface, and the grain boundaries influence the diffusion on timescales up to 1 h. The diffusive loss of these two volatile organics into packed snow samples was measured using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer. The structure of the snow was analysed by means of X-ray-computed micro-tomography. The observed diffusion profiles could be well described based on gas-phase diffusion and the known structure of the snow sample at temperatures ≥ 253 K. At colder temperatures, surface interactions start to dominate the diffusive transport. Parameterizing these interactions in terms of adsorption to the solid ice surface, i. e. using temperature-dependent air–ice partitioning coefficients, better described the observed diffusion profiles than the use of air–liquid partitioning coefficients. No changes in the diffusive fluxes were observed by increasing the number of grain boundaries in the snow sample by a factor of 7, indicating that for these volatile organic trace <b>gases,</b> <b>uptake</b> into grain boundaries does not play a role on the timescale of diffusion through porous surface snow. For this, a snow sample with an artificially high amount of ice grains was produced and the grain boundary surface measured using thin sections. In conclusion, we have shown that the diffusivity can be predicted when the structure of the snowpack and the partitioning of the trace gas to solid ice is known...|$|R

They show great promise for many applications thanks to record-breaking internal surface areas, high porosity {{as well as}} a wide variety of possible chemical compositions. Molecular simulation has been instrumental in the study of MOFs to date, and this thesis work aims to validate and expand upon these efforts through two distinct computational MOF investigations. Current separation technologies used for CO 2 /N 2 mixtures, found in the greenhouse gas-emitting flue gas generated by coal-burning power plants, could greatly benefit from the improved cost-effective separation MOF technology offers. MOFs have shown great potential for CO 2 capture due to their low heat capacities and high, selective uptake of CO 2. To ensure that simulation techniques effectively predict quantitative MOF <b>gas</b> <b>uptakes</b> and selectivities, {{it is important that the}} simulation parameters used, such as force fields, are adequate. We show that in all cases explored, the force field in current widespread use for N 2 adsorption over-predicts uptake by at least 50 % of the experimental uptake in MOFs. We propose a new N 2 model, NIMF (Nitrogen in MoFs), that has been parameterized using experimental N 2 uptake data in a diverse range of MOFs found in literature. The NIMF force field yields high accuracy N 2 uptakes and will allow for accurate simulated uptakes and selectivities in existing and hypothetical MOF materials and will facilitate accurate identification of promising materials for CO 2 capture and storage {{as well as a}}ir separation for oxy-fuel combustion. We also present the results of grand canonical and canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC and canonical MC), DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as well as charge density analyses, on both CO 2 and N,N-dimethylformamide adsorbed in Ba 2 TMA(NO 3) and MIL- 68 (In), two MOFs with non-equivalent inorganic structural building units. We demonstrate the excellent agreement found between our simulation results and the solid-state NMR (SSNMR) experiments carried out by Professor Yining Huang (Western University) on these two MOFs. Molecular simulation enables discoveries which complement SSNMR such as the number, distribution and dynamics of guest binding sites within a MOF.

Carbon nano-materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene are claimed to have high strength, high thermal conductivity and light weight, which leads to extensive search about their novel properties and potential applications {{during the past two}} decades and still ongoing. Compared to the multi-scale simulations with different accuracies and computational cost from quantum mechanics to large scale industry processes, this work focuses on molecular-scale which employs classical force field on each atom and has system size in the nanometer scale. Three following examples demonstrate how the molecular dynamics simulations and modeling can be used to investigate and predict carbon nanomaterials’ thermal properties, gas adsorption in carbon nano-foams, and to design high-strength SiCNT-glass composites. In the first example, carbon nanotubes are used as reinforcement to enhance the mechanical strength of glass composites. Recently there has been a surging demand for glass materials on electric device such as a capacitive touch screen on Smartphones and tablets. The obstacle to designing a CNT-glass composite is how to make CNTs connect with a glass matrix due to the smooth and rigid nature of pristine CNTs. With computer-aided molecular dynamics simulation, the structures of CNTs, glass and their interface can be obtained with sufficient details in atomic level, which helps the understanding of the weakness of CNT-glass composites. An effective way to enhance the strength by doping 1 - 10 % of silicon atoms on CNTs is proposed. The new structures show promising improvements of glass’s mechanical property and fracture resistance. The simulation results provide a guideline for experimentalists to synthesize CNT composites and high strength glass materials. The second example focuses on theoretical analysis of thermal properties and heat transfer in carbon nano-structures at such a nano-size where traditional mechanism for heat transfer-Fourier’s Law fails. A novel thermal rectification phenomenon that the heat flux is dependent on the temperature gradient and has preference in a certain direction was observed in some specific designed systems. The third example is about gas adsorption in carbon porous material, where the novel nano-porous structures were designed with light weight and high surface area. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method was used to calculate the <b>gas</b> <b>uptakes.</b> Simulation results show that the carbon nano-foam structures have higher hydrogen storage capacities than traditional materials under normal temperature and pressure condition, and thus they can serve as a promising storage media of hydrogen and can be put in the car as a fuel cell to solve the energy challenge.

In addition to directly destroying ozone, bromine compounds can indirectly enhance ozone loss through coupling to other radical families. Hypobromous acid (HOBr), a key species in the linkage of BrOx to ClOx and HOx, is produced by the hydrolysis of BrONO 2 on sulfate aerosols, and thus the heterogeneous behavior of HOBr must be understood. We have measured the solubility of HOBr in 45 to 70 percent by weight sulfuric acid solutions. Over the temperature range 208 to 255 K, HOBr is very soluble in sulfuric acid, H(*) = 10 (exp 4) to 10 (exp 8) M/atm. The solubility is temperature dependent, and our results agree well with those of Waschewsky and Abbott for 60 percent by weight H 2 SO 4.
