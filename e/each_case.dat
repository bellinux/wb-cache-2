The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be greatly over-optimistic, as did the improvement in passenger numbers expected on the newly electrified MDR – in <b>each</b> <b>case</b> achieving only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E

The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a fresh lemon he acquired at Covent Garden, upon which to base the plastic container. Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in <b>each</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In <b>each</b> <b>case,</b> government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E
