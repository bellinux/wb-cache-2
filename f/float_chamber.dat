Some of the other mechanisms they described include a <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> and an early differential pressure.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{carburettors}} {{was calculated}} {{to give a}} higher specific power output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems. However, the Merlin's float controlled carburettor meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary Bf 109E, which had direct fuel injection, could [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been {{forced out of the}} carburettor's <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> by the effects of negative g-force (g). RAF fighter pilots soon learned to [...] "half-roll" [...] their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents. [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a restrictor in the fuel supply line to restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> to contain fuel under negative G, went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet {{from the bottom of the}} S.U. carburettor to exactly halfway up the side, which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g.|$|E
2500|$|A single jet Zenith {{carburettor}} with {{a remote}} <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> fed a double branched inlet manifold on the right; the plugs, also {{set in the}} cylinder walls, {{were on the same}} side, below and angled to the inlets. The exhaust ports were on the left side, angled forwards. A crankshaft driven Bosch magneto at the rear provided the plugs' high voltage supply. The overhead camshaft was also driven from the crankshaft via worm gears and a vertical shaft {{at the rear of the}} engine. [...] The camshaft operated the valves by rockers with rollers on their camshaft ends and adjusting screws at the other.|$|E
50|$|The <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> {{can become}} fouled and stuck leading to poor feeding. When field {{stripping}} the Ace, the recoil spring is removed after removing the slide. The ejector may be removed before removing the barrel and the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> must be aligned vertically {{to remove the}} barrel from the slide. Once the barrel is removed, the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> can be rotated and separated from the main barrel for cleaning. When the extractor is replaced into the barrel, {{the back of the}} extractor should slide into the rear slot of the slide.|$|R
50|$|Williams {{designed}} and built four semi-automatic rifles while in prison. All four used the high pressure gas within the breech as a cartridge was fired to operate their semi-automatic actions. The means used to accomplish this was a <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> containing the cartridge that channeled the gas {{at the front of}} the chamber to force the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> backwards into the bolt with sufficient energy to operate the action. Rearward movement of the chamber was limited to a short stroke to impact the bolt face, in effect making the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> a short stroke gas piston. All four rifles are part of the permanent David Marshall Williams display in the North Carolina Museum of History.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{machine guns}} were {{expensive}} to operate. The United States Army wanted to train machine gun crews with less-expensive ammunition. To do this, {{they needed the}} [...]22 LR cartridge to operate firearms designed to use the [...]30-06 cartridge. David Marshall Williams invented a method that involved a separate <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> that acted as a gas piston with combustion gas impinging directly {{on the front of}} the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber.</b> [...] The [...]22 caliber Colt Service Ace conversion kit for the [...]45 caliber M1911 pistol also used Williams' system, which allows a much heavier slide than other conversions operating on the unaugmented blowback mechanism and makes training with the converted pistol realistic. A <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> provides additional force to operate the heavier slide, providing a felt recoil level similar to that of a full power cartridge.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the success}} of the 1952 season, {{independent}} or [...] "privateer" [...] riders could now purchase a [...] "catalog" [...] version of the 125 DOHC, now available through the company. [...] The Sport Competizione racer had many of the same features as the factory bike. These included a multi-plate clutch, gear-driven oil pump, Dell'Orto 27mm SS1 carburetor and remote <b>float</b> <b>chamber.</b> The bike was nicknamed the [...] "Boy Racer". In 1953, the race engineers adopted the Earles-type forks to help with handling problems on the works racers. The 1953 season saw the introduction of the 350 Four. [...] MV’s racing efforts now included the 500cc, 350cc and 125cc class.|$|E
2500|$|The Junkers L5 was a {{development}} of Junkers' first water-cooled engine, the L2, but at {{four times the}} swept volume was a much more powerful engine. [...] It was a water-cooled upright inline 6-cylinder unit, four-stroke and petrol-fuelled, with a capacity of nearly 23 litres. It adopted some of the L2 features, having twin exhaust and inlet valves in each cylinderdriven by an overhead camshaft, twin spark plugs and twin magnetos. [...] The splash component of the L2's lubrication was abandoned in favour of a completely forced recirculating system. [...] The twin carburettors of the L2 were replaced with a single <b>float</b> <b>chamber,</b> dual-venturi model. [...] Like the L2, the L5 was a direct drive engine.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "other means" [...] {{was some}} kind of {{inclined}} plane in which canal boats could be lowered and raised to accommodate the vertical interval between the two sections of the canal. At that time, systems of this kind had already been installed in the Shropshire Canal in 1788 and 1790, where 5 tonne boats were hauled up inclines dry, on cradles. In 1798 there had been an attempt on the Somerset Coal Canal to use a system in which 20 tonne boats could rise and descend vertically in a <b>float</b> <b>chamber,</b> the boat contained within a timber caisson; this had been unsuccessful. In 1809 a vertical lift had been installed at Tardebigge, Worcestershire, where boats in a wooden caisson were winched up by manpower; it was not successful and was replaced in 1815.|$|E
50|$|Winchester {{introduced}} the shotgun in 1954 as their Model 50 Automatic Shotgun in 12 and 20 gauge. The shotgun featured an Inertia Operated Bolt Lock designed by Williams. The bolt block and cartridge sat within a large <b>floating</b> <b>chamber.</b> When {{the gun was}} fired the gas forward of the <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> forced the chamber to the rear approximately 1/10th of an inch in a short stroke that generated the energy necessary for the bolt block to disengage {{the rear of the}} <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> and operate the semi-automatic action. This was the first semi-automatic shotgun with a fixed non-recoiling barrel. In 1960 Winchester {{introduced the}}ir Model 59 Automatic Shotgun which also utilized the Williams design from the Model 50. This model featured the Winlite 'glass' barrel; it was a thin tube wrapped with micro-filament glass fibre. This model could bullied with the first ever screw-in Versalite choke tubes.|$|R

50|$|The Williams {{design was}} not {{accepted}} by Remington. The rifle was redesigned by Remington employees K. Lowe and C.C. Loomis using the Williams <b>floating</b> <b>chamber.</b> The rifle was designated the Remington Model 550 and introduced in 1941.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{sophisticated}} water-powered astronomical clock was Al-Jazari's castle clock, {{considered by some}} to be an early example of a programmable analog computer, in 1206. It was a complex device that was about [...] high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar orbits, and a pointer {{in the shape of the}} crescent moon which traveled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart and causing automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour. It was possible to re-program the length of day and night in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year, and it also featured five musician automata who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel. Other components of the castle clock included a main reservoir with a float, a <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> and flow regulator, plate and valve trough, two pulleys, crescent disc displaying the zodiac, and two falcon automata dropping balls into vases.|$|E
50|$|The main {{carburettor}} types {{commonly associated}} with Amal are slide carburettors for motorcycles. These were historically distinguishable as two types: the Monobloc with integral, offset <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> and Concentric, a later development with repositioned <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> directly under the body and air-slide.|$|E
5000|$|Carburettors are {{provided}} with a <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> to provide a constant hydrostatic head of fuel above the carburettor's metering jets, thus a constant pressure. The <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> itself does not vary the pressure according to demand, but it does vary the supply flowrate with demand, to keep this pressure constant.|$|E

5000|$|David Marshall Williams (a noted {{designer}} for the U.S. Ordnance Office and later Winchester) developed {{a mechanism to}} allow firearms designed for full-sized cartridges to fire [...]22 caliber rimfire ammunition reliably. His system used a small 'piston' that incorporates the chamber. When the cartridge is fired, {{the front of the}} <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> is thrust back by gas pressure impinging {{on the front of the}} chamber as in a traditional piston. This, added to the blowback energy imparted on the cartridge, pushes the bolt back with greater energy than either force alone. Often described as accelerated blowback, this amplifies the otherwise anemic recoil energy of the [...]22 rimfire cartridge. [...] Williams designed a training version of the Browning machine gun and the Colt Service Ace [...]22 long rifle version of the M1911 using his system. The <b>floating</b> <b>chamber</b> is both a blowback and gas operated mechanism.|$|R

50|$|A <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> is {{a device}} for {{automatically}} regulating {{the supply of}} a liquid to a system. It is most typically found in the carburettor of an internal combustion engine, where it automatically meters the fuel supply to the engine. However, this arrangement is found in many automatic liquid systems, for example the cistern of a toilet {{could be said to}} be a type of <b>float</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Fish carburettor was to avoid {{the problems of the}} <b>float</b> <b>chamber,</b> and its sensitivity to sideways forces from acceleration and cornering. In the conventional carburettor, a venturi in the airflow creates a lowered pressure and this is enough to encourage the flow of fuel through the metering jets. The flow rate is critically sensitive to the fuel pressure at the jet, i.e. the hydrostatic head owing to the depth of fuel between the jet and the float level. Any sloshing within the <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> affected this. Fish's design kept the <b>float</b> <b>chamber,</b> but avoided the dependency of flow rate on fuel depth. The <b>float</b> <b>chamber</b> was sealed and pressurised by a ram air effect from the air inlet, which then caused fuel to flow through the metering jet. This flow rate was entirely independent of fuel level, but did remain approximately proportional to the mass airflow. The Fish carburettor was also sensitive to mass airflow, rather than volume airflow, making it self-compensating for changes due to temperature or altitude.|$|E
