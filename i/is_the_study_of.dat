5|$|All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, {{including}} {{memory and}} communication. Behavioural ecology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants, mobile phytoplankton, zooplankton swimming toward the female egg, {{the cultivation of}} fungi by weevils, the mating dance of a salamander, or social gatherings of amoeba.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy and {{astrophysics}} {{have developed}} significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Astrobiology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the advent {{and evolution of}} biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis {{on the possibility of}} non-terrestrial life. Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.|$|E

5|$|Plant anatomy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the {{structure}} of plant cells and tissues, whereas plant morphology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> their external form.|$|E
5|$|The {{discipline}} of anatomy can be subdivided {{into a number}} of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. Microscopic anatomy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> structures on a microscopic scale, including histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of an organism in its immature condition).|$|E
5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> alignments. This {{is based on the}} assumption that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E

50|$|Franz Boas (1858-1942) was a German American {{anthropologist}} and has <b>been</b> called <b>the</b> “Father of American Anthropology.” Boas {{made significant}} contributions within anthropology, more specifically, physical anthropology, linguistics, archaeology, and cultural anthropology. His work put an emphasis on cultural and environmental effects on people to explain their development into adulthood and evaluated them in concert with human biology and evolution. This encouraged academics {{to break away from}} static taxonomical classifications of race. It is said that before Boas, anthropology <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> race, and after Boas, anthropology <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> culture.|$|R

5|$|A {{subfield}} of {{the sociology}} of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> death, dying and bereavement, sometimes referred to broadly as {{the sociology of}} death.

5|$|Community ecology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the {{interactions}} among a collections {{of species that}} inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.|$|E
5|$|Cultivated plant {{taxonomy}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> {{the theory and}} practice of the science that identifies, describes, classifies, and names cultigensthose plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity.

5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> {{the chemical}} reactions that are catalysed by enzymes. In enzyme kinetics, the reaction rate is measured {{and the effects}} of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's kinetics in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its activity is controlled, and how a drug or an agonist might inhibit the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Ethology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social {{animals such as}} primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior {{in terms of the}} theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E
5|$|Grammar <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes {{within a}} language {{can be combined}} into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If {{they are free to}} be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E

5|$|How species {{should be}} defined in a {{particular}} group of organisms gives rise to practical and theoretical problems that {{are referred to as}} the species problem. The scientific work of deciding how to define species has been called microtaxonomy. By extension, macrotaxonomy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> groups at higher taxonomic ranks, from subgenus and above only, than species.|$|E
5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems. In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. Sustainability science <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> sustainable development and environmental science.|$|E
5|$|Molecular biology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> {{biology at}} the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology is {{a study of the}} interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated.|$|E
50|$|Eugene Lane's main {{interest}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient religions, {{especially the}} influence of eastern cults in the Roman Empire. He major works <b>were</b> on <b>the</b> cults of the Men and Sabazios, both deities with Anatolian origins.|$|R

50|$|A {{major focus}} {{throughout}} his career <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> false knowledge, biases, and prejudices, and how these relate to matters ranging from race relations to academic disciplines where erroneous theories are perpetuated by those with vested interests in them.|$|R
5|$|Neuroanthropology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the {{relationship}} between culture and the brain.

Cultural differences and their relation to brain development and structure are researched in different fields.|$|E
5|$|Organozirconium {{chemistry}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> compounds {{containing a}} carbon-zirconium bond. The first such compound was zirconocene dibromide ((C5H5)2ZrBr2), reported in 1952 by Birmingham and Wilkinson. Schwartz's reagent, prepared in 1970 by P. C. Wailes and H. Weigold, is a metallocene used in organic synthesis for transformations of alkenes and alkynes.|$|E
5|$|Paleoclimatology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> past climate over a great {{period of}} the Earth's history.
