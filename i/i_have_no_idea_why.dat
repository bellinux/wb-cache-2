However, co-creator David Hoberman {{came up with}} the idea of a detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder. This was inspired by his own bout with self-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder; in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview, he stated that, [...] "Like Monk, I couldn't walk on cracks and had to touch poles. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why</b> [...] but if I didn't do these things, something terrible would happen." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the letters}} was from Bannon, asking for {{professional}} assistance in getting published. On writing to Meaker, she said, [...] "To this day <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why</b> she responded to {{me out of the}} thousands of letters she was getting at that time. Thank God she did. I was both thrilled and terrified." [...] Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to Greenwich Village, which made a significant impression on Bannon: she called it [...] "Emerald City, Wonderland, and Brigadoon combined—a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand." [...] Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, [...] "I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print. And so I made a beginning—and that beginning was the story that became Odd Girl Out." ...|$|E
500|$|Carla Gugino {{revealed}} in August 2009 {{that she had}} begun taking singing lessons for her part in the film. One month later, Jamie Chung announced {{in an interview with}} E! Entertainment that recording for the soundtrack had begun. When Emily Browning auditioned for her role as Babydoll, Snyder asked her to sing because of the musical element in the film. He told her to record herself while singing, and the actress did a version of [...] "Killing Me Softly with His Song". Browning later said, [...] "I was terrified, of course. But he liked it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why,</b> but he thought me capable of carrying a tune on the screen." [...] The crew liked the result and offered her to sing more songs. At first it was just a cover of [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] by Pixies, which ended up becoming a duet with Yoav, but the producers extended to three songs. One, a version by [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] by Eurythmics, is used to open the movie, and Bates noted that [...] " [...] first line of dialogue is actually 27 minutes into the film so it is an interesting way to introduce her character." [...] The other came up when during a discussion on her favorite music with Snyder, Browning said that The Smiths was her favorite band. Several weeks later, Snyder informed her that he had acquired the rights to The Smiths' song [...] "Asleep", and asked her if she would like to perform the lead vocals. At first, she hesitated, saying that [...] "The offer was flattering, but there was so much pressure". However, she recorded the song and according to Snyder, The Smiths' frontman Morrissey was happy with the result. Regarding Browning's performance, de Vries considered that [...] "having Emily sing—essentially commenting in song on her character’s situation in the film — provided an interesting texture, real resonance and depth, and tied the music to the visuals in a way that might otherwise not have been so clearly defined", and Snyder found the actress' [...] "emotional delivery" [...] to [...] "make the songs even more poignant". To work with Browning between takes, de Vries used a portable recording rig on a room with a piano - [...] "a very distressed, out-of-tune, almost-unusable instrument (...) which turned out to have real charm in it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Friedrich was the co-creator {{and initial}} writer of Marvel's motorcycle-demon Ghost Rider, and later teamed with that character's first artist, Mike Ploog, on Marvel's Monster of Frankenstein – {{the first five}} issues of which (Jan.-Oct. 1973) {{contained}} a relatively faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel. As one critic wrote of issue #4: [...] "Unmatched by anything else he'd written at Marvel, Friedrich's script ... had reached a point that perfectly captured the 19th-century cadences of Shelley's prose and lifted the strip far above any past or, so far, future attempt to adapt the character to comics." [...] Friedrich co-created the supernatural hero the Son of Satan in Ghost Rider vol. 2, #1 (Sept. 1973). Friedrich recalled in 2009 that Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee [...] "had some idea that he wanted a character called Son of Satan. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why</b> or where it came from. All he really had was the name and {{he wanted us to}} create a character based around that. I guess it just popped in his mind. He said [...] "I want a title called Son of Satan. Do it!" ...|$|E

6000|$|XI. IDLENESS AND INDUSTRY.--I {{remember}} a time when I was very idle; and lived and profited by that humour. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why</b> I ceased to be so, yet I scarce believe I have the power to return to it; it is a change of age. I made consciously a thousand little efforts, but the determination from which these arose came to me while I slept and in the way of growth. I have had a thousand skirmishes to keep myself at work upon particular mornings, and sometimes the affair was hot; but of that great change of campaign, which decided all this part of my life, and turned me from one whose business was to shirk into one whose business was to strive and persevere,--it seems as though all that had been done by some one else. The life of Goethe affected me; so did that of Balzac; and some very noble remarks by the latter in a pretty bad book, the [...] "Cousine Bette." [...] I daresay I could trace some other influences in the change. All I mean is, I was never conscious of a struggle, nor registered a vow, nor seemingly had anything personally to do with the matter. I came about like a well-handled ship. There stood at the wheel that unknown steersman whom we call God.|$|E
6000|$|DEAR SIR,--In {{a letter}} from {{yourself}} to the Rev. F. A. Malleson,[125] published in the Contemporary Review of the current month, I observe the following passage:--"I have never yet heard so much as one (preacher) heartily proclaiming against all those 'deceivers with vain words,' that no 'covetous person, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God;' and on myself personally and publicly challenging the Bishops of England generally, and by name the Bishop of Manchester, to say whether usury was, or was not, according {{to the will of}} God, I have received no answer from any one of them." [...] I confess, for myself, that until I saw this passage in print a few days ago, I was unaware of the existence of such challenge, and therefore I could not answer it. It appears to have been delivered (A) in No. 82 of a series of letters which, under the title of Fors Clavigera, you have for some time been addressing to the working classes of England, but which, from the peculiar mode of their publication, are not easily accessible to the general reader and which I have only caught a glimpse of, on the library-table of the Athenæum Club, on the rare occasions when I am able to use my privileges as a member of that Society. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why</b> I had the honor of being specially mentioned by name (B); but I beg to assure you that my silence did not arise from any discourtesy towards my challenger, nor from that discretion which, some people may think, is usually the better part of episcopal valor, and which consists in ignoring inconvenient questions from a sense of inability to answer them; but simply from the fact that I was not conscious that your lance had touched my shield.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why</b> {{the mate}} was known by that {{eccentric}} name. He was called Wheeler, but {{though he had}} that English surname {{there was not a}} drop of white blood in him. He was a tall man, and well-made though inclined to stoutness, but much darker than is usual in Hawaii. He was no longer young, and his crisply curling, thick hair was grey. His upper front teeth were cased in gold. He was very proud of them. He had a marked squint and this gave him a saturnine expression. The captain, who was fond of a joke, found in it a constant source of humour and hesitated the less to rally him on the defect because he realised that the mate was sensitive about it. Bananas, unlike most of the natives, was a taciturn fellow and Captain Butler would have disliked him if it had been possible for a man of his good nature to dislike anyone. He liked to be at sea with someone he could talk to, he was a chatty, sociable creature, and it was enough to drive a missionary to drink to live there day after day with a chap who never opened his mouth. He did his best to wake the mate up, that is to say, he chaffed him without mercy, but it was poor fun to laugh by oneself, and he came to the conclusion that, drunk or sober, Bananas was no fit companion for a white man. But he was a good seaman and the captain was shrewd enough to know the value of a mate he could trust. It was not rare for him to come aboard, when they were sailing, fit for nothing but to fall into his bunk, and it was worth something to know that he could stay there till he had slept his liquor off, since Bananas could be relied on. But he was an unsociable devil, {{and it would be a}} treat to have someone he could talk to. That girl would be fine. Besides, he wouldn't be so likely to get drunk when he went ashore if he knew there was a little girl waiting for him when he came on board again.|$|E
