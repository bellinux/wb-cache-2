Suppose F is a compact orientable surface, K is a knot <b>in</b> <b>F</b> × <b>I,</b> and (<b>F</b> × <b>I)</b> surg is the 3 -manifold obtained by some non-trivial surgery on K.

A {{carbohydrate}} mimic N-octyl-β-valienamine (NOV) is an inhibitor of β-Glu. When applied to cultured GD fibroblasts with <b>F</b> 213 <b>I</b> β-Glu mutation, NOV increased the protein level of the mutant enzyme and up-regulated cellular enzyme activity. The maximum effect of NOV was observed <b>in</b> <b>F</b> 213 <b>I</b> homozygous cells in which NOV treatment at 30 μM for 4 days caused a ∼ 6 -fold increase in the enzyme activity, up to ∼ 80 % of the activity in control cells.
