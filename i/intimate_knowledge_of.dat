5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} that humanity could be impacted by {{an influx of}} extraterrestrial science and technology {{in the same way}} that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists. Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more <b>intimate</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.|$|E
5|$|A History of British Birds, Bewick's great {{achievement}} and with which {{his name is}} inseparably associated, was published in two volumes: History and Description of Land Birds in 1797 and History and Description of Water Birds in 1804, with a supplement in 1821. The Birds is specifically British, but is the forerunner of all modern field guides. Bewick was helped by his <b>intimate</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the habits of animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country. He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry, and that obtained in natural history works of his time, including those by Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White, {{as well as the}} translation of Buffon's Histoire naturelle.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{numerous}} mistakes, Villani often displayed an insider's {{knowledge on}} many subjects, {{as a result}} of his extensive travels and access to both official and private documents. For example, De Vries states that he wrote one of the most accurate accounts of the Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, including information that the archers were placed precariously behind the English and Welsh infantry, not on the flanks as others asserted. While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming his readers would have the same <b>intimate</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Florence as he did.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} contemporary, or near-contemporary, {{sources of information}} about the reign of Richard III. These include the Croyland Chronicle, Commines' Mémoires, the report of Dominic Mancini, the Paston Letters, the Chronicles of Robert Fabyan and numerous court and official records, including a few letters by Richard himself. However, the debate about Richard's true character and motives continues, both because of the subjectivity of many of the written sources, reflecting the generally partisan nature of writers of this period, and {{because of the fact that}} none was written by men with an <b>intimate</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Richard, even if they had met him in person.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Van in 1846, {{he married}} Mariam Sevikian. In 1847 he crossed to Persia and the Russian Caucasus, where {{he visited the}} Ararat plain, Shirak, and Nakhichevan. He lived in Alexandropol (Gyumri) for six months. In 1848 once again moved to Constantinople via Tiflis, Batumi, and Trabzon. From 1848 to 1850 he taught at an all-girl school in Constantinople's Khasgiugh (Hasköy) quarter. In 1851 he {{traveled}} to Cilicia where {{he was sent to}} report on the state of Armenian schools. By traveling and living in various Armenian-populated provinces, he acquired an <b>intimate</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the problems and aspirations of ordinary Armenians.

25|$|After {{seven weeks}} at sea the {{opportunity}} to make landfall and take on supplies and effect repairs must have been welcome, but navigation in these waters demanded <b>intimate</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The experience <b>of</b> Spanish mariners in the intricacies of north Atlantic conditions was largely confined to trading voyages to the south and south-west of Ireland, and {{it is likely that the}} fleet's pilots preferred to maintain Sidonia's course, despite the hardships on board their ships.|$|R
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Isle de France, although {{prompted by the}} defeat at Grand Port, had been the ultimate intention of Rowley's squadron since its creation in 1809 and had been planned carefully both on a strategic level by Bertie at Cape Town and Lord Minto at Madras and on a tactical level by Rowley and his British Army counterpart Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Keating on Rodriguez. The transport ships and soldiers would come from the Indian garrisons at Madras, Bombay and Calcutta, to be led by General John Abercromby (although they were also accompanied by Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury, whom Bertie ordered to return to Madras before the invasion) while the naval forces to protect and support the invasion force were to be provided by Bertie from the Cape of Good Hope. These forces were to gather at Rodriguez {{in preparation for the}} invasion. The landings themselves were planned by Rowley and Keating, who relied on Willoughby's <b>intimate</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the coastline of Isle de France and a series of careful surveys of the reefs that surrounded the island to select a landing site.|$|E
5|$|Appointed to {{the rank}} of {{lieutenant}} colonel, Định began to stockpile foodstuffs, manufacture weapons, and recruit forces from the populace with the help of officers from the imperial army. His forces grew to around 6,000 men by June 1861. The French began to report that junks from Singapore and Hong Kong had arrived in Gò Công with shipments of European-made weapons. Định's forces began inflicting substantial damage on the European troops, largely because of their <b>intimate</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the terrain, skill in hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, and support from the local villagers. Định's men focused on chasing French soldiers around the countryside and attacking military installations that were left undefended as a consequence of their guerrilla pursuit. Learning of Định's role in support of the Nguyễn dynasty's call for popular resistance, Tự Đức promoted him {{to the rank}} of lieutenant colonel for the Gia Định region. Later in 1861, the imperial regulars were defeated at Biên Hòa, and the commanding Vietnamese officers were ordered by the royal authorities to meet Định at Tan Hoa to develop a plan for retaking Biên Hòa. As a result, the number of troops under Định's direct authority grew. Early in 1862, the Nguyễn court granted Định command of all the southern nghĩa quân (righteous soldiers), the term that Huế used for the partisans. Định continued to lead raids on enemy forces from his base in Gò Công. Friction developed between the regular army and Định's partisans as to whether to stage aggressive sorties from Tan Hoa, as was Định's strategy, or to bide their time and engage in military buildup.|$|E

25|$|Although {{his work}} is our most {{reliable}} source {{for the history of}} his era, its factual accuracy is occasionally questioned. The Annals are based in part on secondary sources, and there are some obvious mistakes, for instance the confusion of the two daughters of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor, who are both called Antonia. The Histories, however, are written from primary documents and <b>intimate</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the Flavian period, and are therefore thought to be more accurate.|$|E
25|$|After the Jameson Raid, {{relations}} between the British and the Afrikaners had deteriorated steadily. By 1898, war seemed imminent.

With an <b>intimate</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the British, Smuts {{took control of the}} Transvaal delegation. Sir Alfred Milner, head of the British delegation, took exception to his dominance, and conflict between the two led to the collapse of the conference, consigning South Africa to war.|$|E

However, the population of Whitechapel was transient, impoverished and often used aliases. The lives of many of its residents were little recorded. Despite continued interest in the case, as well as ongoing investigation by both professional and amateur researchers, the Ripper's true identity will almost certainly never be known.|$|E

40|$|Planning and {{scheduling}} for space operations entails {{the development of}} applications that embed <b>intimate</b> domain <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> distinct areas of mission control, while allowing for significant collaboration among them. The separation is useful because of differences in the planning problem, solution methods, and frequencies of replanning that arise in the different disciplines. For example, planning the activities of human spaceflight crews requires some reasoning about all spacecraft resources at timescales of minutes or seconds, and is subject to considerable volatility. Detailed power planning requires managing the complex interplay of power consumption and production, involves very different classes of constraints and preferences, but once plans are generated they are relatively stable...|$|R
