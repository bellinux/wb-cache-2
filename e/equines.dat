5|$|Wild <b>equines</b> {{may spend}} seven {{hours a day}} sleeping. During the day, they sleep {{standing}} up while at night they lie down. They regularly rub against trees, rocks and other objects and roll in around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. Except the mountain zebra, wild <b>equines</b> can roll over completely.|$|E
5|$|<b>Equines</b> are {{monogastric}} hindgut fermenters. They {{prefer to}} eat grasses and sedges, {{but may also}} consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits and roots if their favored foods are scarce, particularly asses. Compared to ruminants, <b>equines</b> have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like cecum. where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in <b>equines</b> than in ruminants; 30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for a cow. <b>Equines</b> may spend 60-80 {{percent of their time}} feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.|$|E

5|$|<b>Equines</b> {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of <b>equines</b> vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Grévy's zebras. <b>Equines</b> also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have had}} {{a great impact on}} the populations of wild <b>equines.</b> Threats to wild <b>equines</b> include habitat {{destruction}} and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild <b>equines</b> have been decimated over many of their former ranges and their populations scattered. In recent centuries, two subspecies, the quagga and the tarpan, became extinct. Only the plains zebra remains numerous and widespread. The IUCN lists the African wild ass as critically endangered, the Grévy's zebra, mountain zebra and Przewalski's horse as endangered, the Onager as vulnerable, the kiang as lower risk and the plains zebra as least concern. The Przewalski's horse was considered to be extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996. However, following successful captive breeding, it has been reintroduced in Mongolia.|$|E

Twenty-four <b>equine</b> ambassador participants attended the 2015 Texas 4 -H <b>Equine</b> Ambassador Short Course held at Lone Oak Ranch and Retreat. The <b>equine</b> ambassador participants served as the census population for the evaluation study. The five-day short course was an intense introduction to <b>equine</b> science principles delivered by university professors and staff, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension faculty and industry representatives. The purpose of the short course was to create advanced educational resources for a selected group of 4 -H youth on advanced nutrition and feedings, importance of being an agricultural advocate, team building, hay selection and analysis, communication, agricultural issues, problem solving, hoof and shoeing, health of the horse, <b>equine</b> marketing, <b>equine</b> sales and an overview of agricultural career development. A group consisting of fifty-two Texas 4 -H State Horse Show participants, comparable in age, education and experiences {{to that of the}} <b>equine</b> ambassador participants were selected to show equivalency to the study. The theoretical framework of this study surrounded the work of the experiential learning models. The <b>equine</b> ambassador participants experienced The National 4 -H Experiential Learning Model during the Texas 4 -H <b>Equine</b> Ambassador Short Course. The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition was utilized to analyze the results of the level of <b>equine</b> expertise evaluated through the self-assessment instrument.

5|$|The genus Equus, which {{includes}} all extant <b>equines,</b> {{is believed to}} have evolved from Dinohippus, via the intermediate form Plesippus. One of the oldest species is Equus simplicidens, described as zebra-like with a donkey-like head shape. The oldest material to date was found in Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged E. livenzovensis documented from western Europe and Russia. Molecular phylogenies indicate that the most recent common ancestor of all modern <b>equines</b> (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9-7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 mya for the most recent common ancestor within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 mya.|$|E
5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild <b>equines,</b> zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most <b>equines</b> have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
40|$|As {{in other}} mammals, {{immunoglobulin}} A (IgA) in the horse has {{a key role}} in immune defense. To better dissect <b>equine</b> IgA function, we isolated complementary DNA (cDNA) clones for <b>equine</b> J chain and polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR). When coexpressed with <b>equine</b> IgA, <b>equine</b> J chain promoted efficient IgA polymerization. A truncated version of <b>equine</b> pIgR, equivalent to secretory component, bound with nanomolar affinity to recombinant <b>equine</b> and human dimeric IgA but not with monomeric IgA from either species. Searches of the <b>equine</b> genome localized <b>equine</b> J chain and pIgR to chromosomes 3 and 5, respectively, with J chain and pIgR coding sequence distributed across 4 and 11 exons, respectively. Comparisons of transcriptional regulatory sequences suggest that horse and human pIgR expression is controlled through common regulatory mechanisms that are less conserved in rodents. These studies pave the way for full dissection of <b>equine</b> IgA function and open up possibilities for immune-based treatment of <b>equine</b> diseases...|$|R

5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. <b>Equines</b> are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the wheel was a major technological innovation {{that gave rise to}} chariot warfare. At first, <b>equines,</b> both horses and onagers, were hitched to wheeled carts by means of a yoke around their necks {{in a manner similar to}} that of oxen. However, such a design is incompatible with equine anatomy, limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal. By the time of the Hyksos invasions of Egypt, c.1600 BC, horses were pulling chariots with an improved harness design that made use of a breastcollar and breeching, which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight.|$|E

40|$|<b>Equine</b> {{nutrition}} plays {{a critical}} role in <b>equine</b> health. The veterinarian is an expected major source of <b>equine</b> nutrition information, yet little evidence exists to evaluate this assumed role, particularly from the veterinarian’s perspective. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the knowledge and confidence levels and practices and perceptions regarding <b>equine</b> nutrition by surveying <b>equine</b> clinicians in Georgia, USA. A sample representative of a cross-section of <b>equine</b> veterinarians participated in the survey: response rate was 20 %. Veterinarians reported that although their level of <b>equine</b> nutrition knowledge had improved since graduation, their confidence levels varied when giving nutritional advice on a number of prevalent nutritional-related conditions. Their confidence level in giving nutritional advice on colic was the highest and on hyperkalemic periodic paralysis the lowest. The majority of veterinarians had not taken any recent <b>equine</b> nutrition continuing education, mainly owing to lack of courses available; however, the majority expressed an interest in taking future courses, particularly if offered online. Although the veterinary profession was considered to be an important source of <b>equine</b> nutrition information, almost one-quarter of veterinarians offered no <b>equine</b> nutrition counseling to their clients. More than two-thirds of veterinarians reported having no access to a referral <b>equine</b> nutrition service, but would be likely to use one if it were available. The results of this survey reveal <b>equine</b> nutrition perceptions and practices from an <b>equine</b> clinician perspective. Several areas of concern are highlighted, questioning the quality, responsibility, and provision of <b>equine</b> nutrition in Georgia, USA, and are suggestive of a far more wide-reaching problem, requiring further research...|$|R

5|$|Extant wild <b>equines</b> have {{scattered}} ranges across Africa and Asia. The plains zebra {{lives in}} lush grasslands and savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, while the Mountain zebra inhabits mountainous areas of southwest Africa. The other equine species tend to occupy more arid environments with more scattered vegetation. The Grévy's zebra {{is found in}} thorny scrubland of East Africa, while the African wild ass inhabits rocky deserts of North Africa. The two Asian wild ass species live in the dry deserts of the Near East and Central Asia and the Przwelski's wild horse's habitat is the deserts of Mongolia. Only {{the range of the}} plains and Grévy's zebras overlap. In addition to wild populations, domesticated horses and donkeys are widespread thanks to humans. In certain parts of the world, populations of feral horses and feral donkeys exist, which are descended from domesticated animals that were released or escaped into the wild.|$|E

40|$|The {{composition}} of <b>equine</b> milk differs considerably {{from that of}} the milk of the principal dairying species, i. e., the cow, buffalo, goat and sheep. Because <b>equine</b> milk resembles human milk in many respects and is claimed to have special therapeutic properties, it is becoming increasingly popular in Western Europe, where it is produced on large farms in several countries. <b>Equine</b> milk is considered to be highly digestible, rich in essential nutrients and to possess an optimum whey protein:casein ratio, making it very suitable as a substitute for bovine milk in paediatric dietetics. There is some scientific basis for the special nutritional and health-giving properties of <b>equine</b> milk but this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the composition and physico-chemical properties of <b>equine</b> milk which is required to fully exploit its potential in human nutrition. Quantification and distribution of the nitrogenous components and principal salts of <b>equine</b> milk are reported. The effects of the high concentration of ionic calcium, large casein micelles (~ 260 nm), low protein, lack of a sulphydryl group in <b>equine</b> β-lactoglobulin and a very low level of κ-casein on the physico-chemical properties of <b>equine</b> milk are reported. This thesis provides an insight into the stability of <b>equine</b> casein micelles to heat, ethanol, high pressure, rennet or acid. Differences in rennet- and acid-induced coagulation between <b>equine</b> and bovine milk are attributed not only to the low casein content of <b>equine</b> milk but also to differences in the mechanism by which the respective micelles are stabilized. It has been reported that β-casein plays a role in the stabilization of <b>equine</b> casein micelles and proteomic techniques support this view. In this study, <b>equine</b> κ-casein appeared to be resistant to hydrolysis by calf chymosin but <b>equine</b> β-casein was readily hydrolysed. Resolution of <b>equine</b> milk proteins by urea-PAGE showed the multi-phosphorylated isoforms of <b>equine</b> αs- and β-caseins and capillary zone electrophoresis showed 3 to 7 phosphorylated residues in <b>equine</b> β-casein. In vitro digestion of <b>equine</b> β-casein by pepsin and Corolase PP™ did not produce casomorphins BCM- 5 or BCM- 7, believed to be harmful to human health. Electron microscopy provided very clear, detailed images of <b>equine</b> casein micelles in their native state and when renneted or acidified. <b>Equine</b> milk formed flocs rather then a gel when renneted or acidified which is supported by dynamic oscillatory analysis. The results presented in this thesis will assist in the development of new products from <b>equine</b> milk for human consumption which will retain some of its unique compositional and health-giving properties...|$|R

APHIS also checks horses to prevent the introduction of ticks and other parasites. In the Lower Rio Grande Valley, U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors look for horses and livestock that stray across the border carrying ticks. These animals are often called wetstock, and the inspectors {{are referred to as}} tickriders.|$|R
5|$|While the {{domestic}} horse and donkey (along with their feral descendants) exist worldwide, wild equine populations {{are limited to}} Africa and Asia. Wild equine social systems come in two forms; a harem system with tight-knit groups consisting of one adult male or stallion, several females or mares and their young or foals; and a territorial system where males establish territories with resources that attract females, which associate very fluidly. In both systems, females {{take care of their}} offspring but males may play a role as well. <b>Equines</b> communicate with each other both visually and vocally. Human activities have threatened wild equine populations and out of the seven living species, only the plains zebra remains widespread and abundant.|$|E
5|$|Among harem-holding species, {{the adult}} females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more {{promiscuous}} and the males have larger testes for sperm competition. Estrous in female <b>equines</b> lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread {{and raise their}} tails when {{in the presence of}} a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares will come into estrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals will attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like the Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the Scheldt, near Valenciennes. Although it is a popular myth that many French draft breeds, including the Trait du Nord, are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at Solutré, this is not true. Two or possibly three subspecies of now-extinct <b>equines</b> have been found at Solutré, {{but there is no}} evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced the Trait du Nord. Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant, the origin of the Trait du Nord is found in the large, fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands, northern France and all of Belgium. The Hainaut region is the true birthplace of the breed in France. The Belgian draft breeds, the Ardennes and the Trait du Nord share the same ancestry, and the Trait du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes, due to the influence of the latter breed on the former. The Ardennes, Belgian, Dutch Heavy Draft, Trait du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the same group of breeds, due to their heritage, physical characteristics and selection for draft work. Until relatively recently, the breeds were not differentiated, and were frequently crossbred.|$|E
