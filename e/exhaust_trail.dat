The simulations confirm that the early wake dynamics can have a strong influence on the properties of persistent contrails even at late times. The vortex dynamics are the primary determinant of the vertical extent of the contrail (until precipitate ton becomes significant) : and this together with the local wind shear largely determines the horizontal extent. The ice density, ice crystal number density, and a conserved exhaust tracer all develop and disperse in different fashions from each other. The total ice crystal number can be significantly reduced due to adiabatic compression resulting from the downward motion of the vortex system, even for ambient conditions that are substantially supersaturated with respect to ice. The fraction of the initial ice crystals surviving, their spatial distribution and the ice mass distribution are all sensitive to the aircraft type, ambient humidity, assumed initial ice crystal number, and ambient turbulence conditions. There is a significant range of conditions for which a smaller transport such as a B 737 produces as significant a persistent contrail as a larger transport such as a B 747, even though the latter consumes almost five times as much fuel.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Aircraft {{measurements}} of gaseous ship emissions were {{performed in the}} vicinity of the heavily travelled ship lanes through the English Channel and in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>trail</b> of a major sea-going container ship. In the single ship plume experiment the concentration and dilution of major emissions (CO 2, NO, NOy, SO 2) were measured up to a distance to the source ship and plume age of 25 km and 1650 s, respectively. Emission factors for NOx and SO 2 were determined from individual plume encounters. The inferred NOx emission indices compare well with calculated emission indi-ces from the engine emission model of the manufacturer. The deduced SO 2 emission indices from the SO 2 enhancements in the plume are smaller than calculated emission indices bases on the ana-lysed sulphur content in the fuel sample. However, the difference is still within the estimated error limits for the SO 2 emissions factor measurements. A survey flight in the ship corridor through the English Channel revealed the presence of a multitude of ship plumes aged between 0. 5 and several hours. Many of the observed concentration enhancements in the ship corridor are due to the super-position of several plumes with different ages. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{decay of}} wing-tip {{vortices}} under the in uence of turbulence in a stably strati ed atmosphere is discussed {{by means of}} large-eddy simulations. The vortices originate from a B- 747 aircraft in cruise. Atmospheric turbulence and turbulence originating from the boundary layer around the aircraft are distinguished. The former is weak and anisotropic with eddy sizes {{in the order of}} the wing span, whereas the latter is wrapped around the vortices with the maximum intensity at the core diameter. During their descent, the parallel vortex tubes approach each other because strati cation and turbulence detrain mass into the ambient air. The atmospheric eddies deform the trailing vortices such that their spacing varies. This, in turn, yields different mutually induced velocities that amplify the deformation quickly according to Crow’s instability theorem. The bent vortex tubes link after about 1. 5 min and form rings. The continuous trail of turbine exhaust is reorganized in a row of single puffs.

5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is <b>exhausted,</b> no new <b>trails</b> are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|R
40|$|The {{indirect}} {{effects of a}} nearby lightning strike on an airborne vehicle with its long trailing conducting plume is not well understood. Since airborne vehicles and its payload are expensive, their loss {{as a result of}} either a direct strike or due to the induced current and voltage of a nearby lightning strike is not desirable. The electromagnetic field generated due to the induced current on the skin of the vehicle may get coupled with the internal circuitry through the apertures on the vehicle body. If the coupled electromagnetic energy is more than the damage threshold level of the sensitive devices of the control circuit, they may fail which may lead to aborting the mission or a possible degradation in the vehicle performance. It has been reported that lightning induced phenomena was the cause of malfunctioning as well as aborting of some of the lunar missions. So in the present work, the computation of induced current and voltage on the skin of the vehicle body in the presence of an ionized long <b>trailing</b> <b>exhaust</b> plume has been attempted. The lightning channel is assumed to be vertical to the ground plane and extends up to a height of 7. 5 km. The radiated electric and magnetic fields from the lightning channel at different heights from 10 m to 10 km and for lateral distances varying from 20 m to 10 km from the lightning channel are computed and the field waveforms are presented. For the computation of the radiated electric and magnetic fields from the lightning channel, modified transmission line with exponential current decay (MTLE) model for representing the lightning channel and the Heidler’s expression for the lightning channel base current are used. The peak amplitude of the lightning current used is 12 kA with a maximum current derivative of 40 kA/µs. It is seen that the vertical electric field in general, is bipolar in nature and that the height at which the change in polarity reversal takes place increases with increase of lateral distance from the lightning channel. The vertical electric field just above the ground is unipolar for all lateral distances from the channel and this is because the contribution due to the image of the lightning channel dominates the vertical electric field. The horizontal electric field is always unipolar for all heights and all lateral distances from the lightning channel studied. The effect of variation in the rate of rise of lightning current (di/dt) and the velocity of lightning current on the radiated electric and magnetic fields for the above heights and distances have also been studied. It is seen that the variation in maximum current derivative does not have a significant influence on the electric field when ground is assumed as a perfect conductor but it influences significantly the horizontal electric field when ground has finite conductivity. The velocity of propagation of lightning current on the other hand has a significant influence for both perfectly as well as finitely conducting ground conditions. For the computation of the induced current and voltage on the body of the airborne vehicle due to the coupling of the above mentioned electromagnetic fields radiated from a near by lightning discharge, the vehicle and its exhaust plume have been modeled as a transmission line and Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) numerical technique has been used for the computation. Regardless of the vehicle size, the structure can be modeled as a nonuniform transmission line consisting of a series of sections consisting of capacitive and inductive components. These components of the vehicle and its exhaust plume are computed using the Method of Moment (MoM) technique. The interaction of the electromagnetic wave with the plume depends on the electrical conductivity as well as the gas dynamic characteristics of the plume. Hence, in this research work an attempt has also been made to study the electrical conductivity (σe) and permittivity (εe) as well as the gas dynamic properties of the exhaust plume taking into consideration its turbulent nature. In general, the airborne vehicle can be considered as perfectly conducting (conductivity 3 x 107 S/m) where as the plume has finite conductivity. The electrical properties of an airborne vehicle exhaust plume such as electrical conductivity and the permittivity and their distribution along axial and radial directions depend on several factors. They are (i) propellant composition, (ii) impurity content in the propellants which generate ionic charge particles in the exhaust and (iii) the characteristics of the exhaust plume intensive parameters such as temperature, pressure, velocity and the presence of shock waves. These properties of the exhaust plume are computed in the two separate regions of interest as discussed next. The first region is inside the combustion chamber and up to the nozzle throat of the vehicle and the second region is from the throat to the exterior i. e., the ambient atmosphere or the downstream of the plume. In the first region where chemical reaction kinetics have to be considered, NASA Chemical Equilibrium with Application (CEA) software package has been used to compute the intensive parameters of the fluid at the throat of the nozzle. The pressure in the combustion chamber is taken as 4410 kPa and the back pressure at the exit plane is taken as 101. 325 kPa. In the second region, FLUENT software package have been used for the fluid dynamic study of the exhaust plume from the vehicle nozzle throat to the exterior domain. The data obtained from the first region using CEA provides the parameters at the nozzle throat that are used as input parameters for the second region. In the study, a conical nozzle configuration of throat radius (rt) of 0. 0185 m (nozzle exit plane radius is 0. 05 m), half cone angle of 18 º and nozzle expansion ratio (Ae/At) of 7. 011 are used. The contour plot of the intensive parameters of the exhaust plume and the mass fraction of the charged particles are presented. The vehicle exhaust flow passes through different types of expansion and compression waves. In the present work, simulation is done for a slightly under expanded nozzle i. e. nozzle exit static pressure is slightly more than the ambient static pressure. Since the exit pressure is more than the ambient pressure, the exhaust gases expand to reach the ambient pressure. As the expansion waves reach the contact discontinuity (i. e. the boundary where {{the outer edge of the}} gas flow meets the free stream air), they again reflect back inward to create compression waves. These compression waves force the flow to turn back inward and increase its pressure. If the compression waves are strong enough, they will merge into an oblique shock wave. In the present work, more than eight such barrel shocks are captured. When the shock waves are generated, Mach number reduces sharply and static temperature and static pressure increases where as the total temperature of the exhaust remains constant in the shock wave formations. The characteristics of the plume such as pressure, temperature, velocity and concentration of the charged particles (i. e., e¯, Na+ and Cl¯) and neutral species such as CO, CO 2, Cl, H, HCl, H 2 O, H 2, N 2, Na, NaCl, O, OH and O 2 along axial and radial directions in the external domain have been studied. The above parameters are used to compute the collision frequencies and plasma frequencies of the charged particles as well as the number density of the species along axial and radial directions of the exhaust plume. These parameters are used to compute the effective conductivity distribution in the axial and radial directions for an incident electromagnetic field of frequency 1 MHz. The peak value of the conductivity computed is 0. 12 S/m near the exit plane and it reduces to 0. 02 S/m at an axial distance of 7. 5 m from the exit plane which is well within the range suggested in the published literature. It has been observed that the oscillation in the conductivity along axial direction is a reflection of the shock wave formation in the exhaust plume. The electrical conductivity and the relative permittivity of the exhaust plume have been computed for three different radii of the nozzle at the exit plane i. e., 0. 025 m, 0. 05 m and 0. 075 m. It is seen that the distribution of the conductivity and relative permittivity along the axial direction of the exhaust are independent of the nozzle exit plane radius. To study the coupling of lightning electromagnetic field with the vehicle and its exhaust plume two cases have been considered. These are (i) when the vehicle and its exhaust plume are at certain height above the ground and (ii) when the exhaust plume is touching the ground. The dimensions of the vehicle used in the study are as follows: length of the vehicle is 20 m and the length of its exhaust plume is 75 m. The radius of the vehicle is taken as 0. 5 m. The vehicle and its exhaust plume are assumed to be at a lateral distance of 250 m from the lightning channel. In case one, when the vehicle and its inhomogeneous exhaust plume tip is at a height of 10 m above the ground, both the ends are open. So the reflection coefficients of the current wave and voltage wave at the end points are - 1 and + 1 respectively irrespective of the characteristic impedances of the vehicle and its exhaust plume. So when the reflected current propagates it will tend to reduce along the length of the object. Hence, the induced current at the end points are zero and the currents in the end segments are less than those in the intermediate segments. The spatial distribution of the peak magnitude of the time varying induced current, |Imax|, in each segment along the length of the vehicle without and with the exhaust plume are presented. In case of vehicle without plume, the maximum value of the induced current is at the middle segment of the vehicle and its value is 4. 8 A. The presence of the inhomogeneous plume enhances the maximum|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} large-eddy {{simulations}} {{the decay of}} wingtip vortices {{and the distribution of}} the turbine exhaust under the influence of turbulence in a stratified atmosphere is discussed. It is distinguished between atmospheric turbulence and a random turbulent flow originating from the boundary-layer around the aircraft. The ambient turbulence is weak, anisotropic, and decaying with sizes of the most energetic eddies at the order of the separation between the two wingtip vortices. The boundary-layer turbulence in wrapped around the vortices with the maximum intensity at the core diameter. The atmospheric eddies disturb the parallel vortex tubes by advection. Once distorted at that scale, the vortex induced velocities amplify the disturbance according to Crow's instability. The vortex tubes break up after about 1. 5 minutes and form rings; the continuous trail of exhaust is reorganized in a row of single puffs. Without any atmospheric turbulence, the wake does not experience a sinusoidal instability but the parallel vortex tubes approach and start to dissolve after 2 minutes when they touch.
