A {{glance at}} the mealie grounds showed me that the old head man had not exaggerated the {{mischief}} done by the elephants to his crops, which were now getting ripe. Nearly half of the entire patch was destroyed. The great brutes had eaten all they could, and the rest they had trampled down. I went up to their spoor and started back in amazement--never had I seen such a spoor before. It was simply enormous, more especially that of one old bull, that carried, so said the natives, but a single tusk. One might have used any of the footprints for a <b>hip-bath.</b>|$|E

Frank (dear old Frank!) had none; nor the [...] "Parent's Assistant;" [...] nor the [...] "Evenings at Home;" [...] nor our copy of the [...] "Ami des Enfans:" [...] {{there were a few}} just {{at the end of the}} Spelling-Book; besides the allegory at the beginning, of Education leading up Youth to the temple of Industry, where Dr. Dilworth and Professor Walkinghame stood with crowns of laurel. There were, we say, just a few pictures at the end of the Spelling-Book, little oval gray woodcuts of Bewick's, mostly of the Wolf and the Lamb, the Dog and the Shadow, and Brown, Jones, and Robinson with long ringlets and little tights; but for pictures, so to speak, what had we? The rough old wood-blocks in the old harlequin-backed fairy-books had served hundreds of years; before OUR Plancus, in the time of Priscus Plancus--in Queen Anne's time, who knows? We were flogged at school; we were fifty boys in our boarding-house, and had to wash in a leaden trough, under a cistern, with lumps of fat yellow soap floating about in the ice and water. Are OUR sons ever flogged? Have they not dressing-rooms, hair-oil, <b>hip-baths,</b> and Baden towels? And what picture-books the young villains have! What have these children done that they should be so much happier than we were? ...|$|R
