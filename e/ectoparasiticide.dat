50|$|Predatory mites and <b>ectoparasiticides</b> {{can be used}} {{to treat}} {{affected}} poultry. Predatory mites are sold and distributed internationally and throughout the United States as an effective solution. Amblyseius andersoni is an effective predatory mite for target pests including red mites. For <b>ectoparasiticides,</b> these chemical controls, if used, should be used in rotation to avoid the buildup of resistance. Red mites can survive for up to 10 months in an empty hen house. Creosote treatment of wood will kill mites. Prevention of infestation in a human habitation consists of eliminating vectors (pigeons in eaves, infested backyard poultry, etc.). Elimination of an infestation in a human habitation is best achieved through a combination of eliminating potential vectors (nesting pigeons, backyard poultry, etc.); reducing potential hiding places (rugs, clutter); judicious use of pesticides; consistent use of dehumidifiers to maintain a low humidity environment; maintaining a low temperature in the environment; frequent thorough cleaning; minimizing {{the amount of time spent}} in the home; and maintaining excellent hygiene and exercise habits.

40|$|Commercial feedlots for {{beef cattle}} {{finishing}} are {{potential sources of}} a range of trace chemicals which have human health or environmental significance. To ensure adequate protection of human and environmental health from exposure to these chemicals, the application of effective manure and effluent management practices is warranted. The Australian meat and livestock industry has adopted a proactive approach to the identification of best management practices. Accordingly, this review was undertaken to identify key chemical species that may require consideration in the development of guidelines for feedlot manure and effluent management practices in Australia. Important classes of trace chemicals identified include steroidal hormones, antibiotics, <b>ectoparasiticides,</b> mycotoxins, heavy metals and dioxins. These are described in terms of their likely sources, expected concentrations and public health or environmental significance based on international data and research. Androgenic hormones such as testosterone and trenbolone are significantly active in feedlot wastes, but they are poorly understood in terms of fate and environmental implications. The careful management of residues of antibiotics including virginiamycin, tylosin and oxytetracycline appears prudent in terms of minimising the risk of potential public health impacts from resistant strains of bacteria. Good management of <b>ectoparasiticides</b> including synthetic pyrethroids, macrocyclic lactones, fluazuron, and amitraz is important for the prevention of potential ecological implications, particularly towards dung beetles.

40|$|A patient {{ingested}} about 250 ml of Cuprex. an <b>ectoparasiticide</b> containing tetralin (1. 2. 3. 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene). copper oleate. paraffin oil, and acetone, in {{an episode}} of self-poisoning. This caused a mild degree of liver and kidney damage that subsided within two weeks. The main urinary metabolite of tetralin was 1. 2. 3. 4 -tetrahydro- 1 -naphthol. The glucuronides of this naphthol and of 1. 2. 3. 4 -tetrahydro- 2 -naphthol were also detected in the urine. Hydroxylation of tetralin only on the alicyclic ring and mainly at the benzylic car-bon suggests that tetralin metabolism may occur via a pathway involving the formation of free radicals. Tetralin (1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene) is widely used as a solvent and as a turpentine sub-stitute in polishes and paints. The metabolism of tetralin has been studied in rabbits (1) and rats (2, 3).

40|$|Abstract Background The isoxazolines are a novel {{class of}} parasiticides that are potent inhibitors of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -gated {{chloride}} channels (GABACls) and, {{to a lesser}} extent, of inhibitory glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls). Lotilaner (Credelio™), a novel representative of this chemical class, is currently evaluated for its excellent <b>ectoparasiticide</b> properties. Methods In this study, we investigated the molecular mode of action and pharmacology of lotilaner. We report the successful gene identification, cDNA cloning and functional expression in Xenopus oocytes of Drosohpila melanogaster (wild type and dieldrin/fipronil-resistant forms), Lepeophtheirus salmonis (an ectoparasite copepod crustacean of salmon), Rhipicephalus microplus and Canis lupus familiaris GABACls. Automated Xenopus oocyte two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology {{was used to assess}} GABACls functionality and to compare ion channel inhibition by lotilaner with that of established insecticides addressing GABACls as targets. Results In these assays, we demonstrated that lotilaner is a potent non-competitive antagonist of insects (fly) GABACls. No cross-resistance with dieldrin or fipronil resistance mutations was detected, suggesting that lotilaner might bind to a site at least partly different from the one bound by known GABACl blockers. Using co-application experiments, we observed that lotilaner antagonism differs significantly from the classical open channel blocker fipronil. We finally confirmed {{for the first time that}} isoxazoline compounds are not only powerful antagonists of GABACls of acari (ticks) but also of crustaceans (sea lice), while no activity on a dog GABAA receptor was observed up to a concentration of 10  μM. Conclusions Together, these results demonstrate that lotilaner is a non-competitive antagonist specific to invertebrate’s γ-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride channels (GABACls). They contribute to our understanding of the mode of action of this new <b>ectoparasiticide</b> compound...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} number of <b>ectoparasiticides</b> for pets and their use, flea infestations of cats and dogs are still widespread in Europe. It is therefore important to assess the maintenance of efficacy of the <b>ectoparasiticides</b> for cats and dogs. The present studies aimed to evaluate the efficacy of monthly treatments using a fipronil/(S) -methoprene combination spot-on (Frontline Combo®) on dogs and cats from private veterinary clinics located in seven European countries. The survey was conducted for three months during the flea season 2009. A total of 233 dogs and 180 cats were included. Each animal was treated at Days 0 (Day 0), 30 (D 30) and 60 (D 60) at the vet clinics. For each animal, at least three flea counts were performed at D 0, D 30 and/or D 60 and/or day 90 (Day 90) in order to evaluate the prevalence of flea infestation and the efficacy of control. At the beginning of the study the prevalence of infested animals was 41. 63 % (97 / 233) in dogs and 47. 22 % (85 / 180) in cats. At D 90, the number of dogs remaining infested fell to 8 / 211 therefore 91. 75 % became flea-free. The number of infested cats fell from 85 to 9 / 173 at D 90 therefore 89. 41 % were cured. All animals still infested at Day 90 were living under epidemiological conditions that favour heavy flea burdens.

40|$|Commercial feedlots for {{beef cattle}} {{finishing}} are {{potential sources of}} a range of trace chemical contaminants which have human health and environmental significance. The Meat and Livestock Association of Australia aim to ensure adequate protection of human and environmental health from exposure to these chemicals and have been working with the University of New South Wales to identify best practices for the management of contaminants in feedlot wastes. This involved studying the fate and analysis of key contaminants of concern in manure and composted waste on feedlot operations. Chemical contaminants of concern identified include steroidal hormones - oestrogens (17 &# 946 -oestradiol, 17 &# 945 -oestradiol, oestrone) and androgens (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, testosterone propionate, 17 &# 946 -trenbolone, 17 &# 945 -trenbolone) which are administered to beef cattle as hormone growth promoters. These compounds are of concern due to their endocrine disrupting properties. <b>Ectoparasiticides</b> are also commonly used on Australian feedlots as anti-parasitic agents to control ticks, flies and lice. These include the synthetic pyrethroids (deltamethrin, cypermethrin, flumethrin) and macrocyclic lactones (ivermectin, doramectin, abamectin, eprinomectin). Good management of <b>ectoparasiticides</b> is important for the prevention of potential ecotoxicological implications, particularly towards dung beetles. Very few of these chemical contaminants have been thoroughly investigated in terms of concentrations, effects and attenuation in feedlot wastes. This project involved the development and optimisation of analytical methods to determine the fate and levels of these compounds in cattle manure and composted waste. These methods were applied to analyse feedlot samples taken after various stages of processing from Australian beef cattle feedlots. Synthetic pyrethroids were not detected in any of the samples while macrocyclic lactones and steroidal hormones were detected in some samples. These results will be discussed with respect to sample type, chemical usage, seasonal variation, waste management practice and ecotoxicological significance.
