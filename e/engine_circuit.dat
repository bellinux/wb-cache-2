We show that a refrigerator can cool to much lower temperatures than predicted by the thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT (which is based on linear-response arguments). The lowest achievable temperature has a discontinuity, called a fold catastrophe in mathematics, at a critical driving current I=I_c. For I >I_c one can in principle cool to absolute zero, when for I<I_c the lowest temperature is about half the ambient temperature. Heat back-flow due to phonons and photons stop cooling at a temperature above absolute zero, and above a certain threshold turns the discontinuity into a sharp cusp. We also give a heuristic condition for when an arbitrary system's nonlinear response means that its ZT ceases to indicate (even qualitatively) the lowest temperature to which the system can refrigerate.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} aheuristic {{for finding}} close to optimal {{solutions to the}} local alignment problem of two DNA sequences, and more precisely to the gene prediction problem on the Connex <b>Engine</b> <b>circuit,</b> a new hierarchical parallel in-memory device. Though not optimal, the solutions generated by our algorithm compare well with those generated by other algorithms in the public domain. When aligning a probe of N symbols to a target of M symbol, the algorithm has a theoretical time complexity of O(N log(N)), with a small constant of proportionality, and faster experimental linear execution times, and requires no preprocessing of the data. 1 Introduction The Connex Engine [15] is a hierarchical in-memory device that permits fast string operations. It contains standard RAM circuitry at the higher level of the hierarchy, and a specialized memory circuit at the lower level, the Connex Memory, that permits parallel search at the memory-cell level and shift operations. A controller oversees the exchange of data between the two levels. Just as regular memory circuits, the operations supported by the Connex Engine can be performed in well-defined cycles whose duration {{is controlled by the}} current memory technology, which in today's technology is in the 10 ns range. We refer to this cycle as connex cycle. The Connex Engine can find all the locations of a given symbol in the Connex Memory in one just one connex cycle. Furthermore, it maintains all the symbols in a connected string fashion, such that symbols can be inserted in or deleted from the sequence of symbols stored in memory, in one connex cycle, whil...|$|E
40|$|Network {{speeds and}} bandwidths have {{improved}} over time. However, {{the frequency of}} network attacks and illegal accesses have also increased as the network speeds and bandwidths improved over time. Such attacks are capable of compromising the privacy and confidentiality of network resources belonging {{to even the most}} secure networks. Currently, general-purpose processor based software solutions used for detecting network attacks have become inadequate in coping with the current network speeds. Hardware-based platforms are designed to cope with the rising network speeds measured in several gigabits per seconds (Gbps). Such hardware-based platforms are capable of detecting several attacks at once, and a good candidate is the Field-programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The FPGA is a hardware platform {{that can be used to}} perform deep packet inspection of network packet contents at high speed. As such, this thesis focused on studying designs that were implemented with Field-programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Furthermore, all the FPGA-based designs studied in this thesis have attempted to sustain a more steady growth in throughput and throughput efficiency. Throughput efficiency is defined as the concurrent throughput of a regular expression matching <b>engine</b> <b>circuit</b> divided by the average number of look up tables (LUTs) utilised by each state of the engine"s automata. The implemented FPGA-based design was built upon the concept of equivalence classification. The concept helped to reduce the overall table size of the inputs needed to drive the various Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) matching engines. Compared with other approaches, the design sustained a throughput of up to 11. 48 Gbps, and recorded an overall reduction in the number of pattern matching engines required by up to 75 %. Also, the overall memory required by the design was reduced by about 90 % when synthesised on the target FPGA platform...|$|E

40|$|In the {{transportation}} sector, engine oil thermal management {{has not yet}} received the attention it deserves in the path towards carbon dioxide and pollutants reduction. During the homologation cycle (which represents a typical daily trip), oil temperature reaches its thermal steady value, which insures best performances in terms of viscosity, only in the final part of the trip, when most part of the harmful emissions have been already emitted; therefore, a warm up acceleration would surely represent a strong beneficial action. In this paper, a faster warming up of the lubricant oil was done using the heat owned by the exhaust gases, which was almost immediately ready after the engine ignition, {{in the early part}} of a driving cycle. An experimental activity has been developed in a turbocharged engine (F 1 C 3 L IVECO), modifying the oil circuit in order to heat up the oil during the cold phase of a homologation cycle by the exhaust gases.

The experimental performances of the novel pump were compared with the ones of a conventional centrifugal device through a test bench that reproduced the real operating conditions of a passenger car <b>engine</b> cooling <b>circuit.</b> Characteristic curves and efficiency maps were further used as input data for a comprehensive model that takes into account heat transfer and hydraulic phenomena of a real <b>engine</b> cooling <b>circuit.</b> The simulation platform was eventually used to assess the energy benefits of the sliding vane pump over a centrifugal machine along the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) with respect to a fixed geometrical configuration and an optimized one achieved through a control on the eccentricity between stator and rotor that tuned up the flow rate on the cooling demand. A mechanical power reduction of 12 % was estimated for a sliding vane pump mechanically linked to the engine crankshaft while the benefits reached 22 % if the eccentricity actuation was considered. In terms of CO 2 reduction, the benefits related to the introduction of the sliding vane pump are of about 0. 5 g/km...|$|R
