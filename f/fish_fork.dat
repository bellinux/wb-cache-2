The number of primary filaments, and therefore the surface area potentially colonized, is subject to variation with age. Assessment of the colonizable area raises specific problems of estimation. A new method taking into account surface areas of primary filaments and using image-processing techniques is proposed. Models related to the increase of filament number and colonizable gill area as functions of the <b>fish</b> <b>fork</b> length are proposed.

40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluated}} passage delays of migratory redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) {{at three}} diversion dams on the Donner und Blitzen River, Oregon. Two of these dams have Denil fish ladders {{and the third}} one has a jump-pool ladder. Our study objectives were: 1) to compare redband trout delays among the three dams, 2) to determine whether trout experienced greater passage delay in entering the fish ladders or in ascending after the initial entry, and 3) to identify relationships between passage likelihood and water temperature, discharge, daylight, and <b>fish</b> <b>fork</b> length. An array of Passive Interrogation Transponder (PIT) antennas detected tagged trout, first, when they approached each dam, subsequently when they entered its ladder, and finally {{when they reached the}} upper end of that ladder. Therefore, data on ladder entry time, ladder ascending time, and total passage time for individual trout were obtained. Statistical methods for survival analysis were used because they handled both censored data and time-dependent covariates. The results showed that trout were 7 times more likely to pass the jumppool ladder during the day than during the night, but none of the other parameters were significantly associated with the likelihood of passage. Trout passage varied significantly between each of the dams. The expected median passage time was 0. 07 days at one of the Denil fish ladders, 2. 1 days at the jump-pool ladder, and 20. 4 days at the other Denil ladder. At all three passage installations, a greater proportion of the total passage time involved ladder entry than ladder ascending. Entry time ranged from 14. 6 to 71. 5 times longer than ascending time among the three ladders. Our results revealed highly variable passage likelihood and time depending on ladder design, location and attraction flows...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{resorption}} in {{the first}} spine of the first dorsal fin of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT) has long been considered for age estimation studies. In the present paper spine bone resorpion was assessed in wild (aged 1 to 13 years) and captive-reared (aged 2 to 11 years) ABFT sampled from the Mediterranean Sea. Total surface (TS), solid surface (SS) and reabsorbed surface (RS) were measured in spine transverse sections {{in order to obtain}} proportions of SS and RS. The spine section surface was found to be isometrically correlated to the <b>fish</b> <b>fork</b> length by a power equation. The fraction of solid spine bone progressively decreased according to a logarithmic equation correlating SS/TS to both fish size and age. The values ranged from 57 % in the smallest examined individuals to 37 % in the largest specimens. This phenomenon was further enhanced in captive-reared ABFT where SS/TS was 22 % in the largest measured specimen. The difference between the fraction of SS of wild and captive-reared ABFT was highly significant. In each year class from 1 - to 7 -year-old wild specimens, the fraction of spine reabsorbed surface was significantly higher in specimens collected from March to May than in those sampled {{during the rest of the}} year. In 4 -year-old fish the normal SS increase during the summer did not occur, possibly coinciding with their first sexual maturity. According to the correlations between SS/TS and age, the rate of spine bone resorption was significantly higher, even almost double, in captive-reared specimens. This could be attributed to the wider context of systemic dysfunctions occurring in reared ABFT, and may be related to a number of factors, including nutritional deficiencies, alteration of endocrine profile, cortisol-induced stress, and loss of spine functions during locomotion in rearing conditions.

However, many of the fish species of high ecological value have not been studied due to their less prominent roles in local recreational and commercial fisheries in comparison to other targeted species. This study describes the age and growth patterns of three small tuna species inhabiting South Florida waters: blackfin tuna Thunnus atlanticus, little tunny Euthynnus alletteratus, and skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis. Tuna specimens were collected via donations obtained from various fishing tournaments and charter captains {{in the areas of}} the Florida Straits as well as hook-and-line by the Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Center. Age was described via sagittal otolith deposition patterns. They were removed, dried, sectioned, and rings were counted as well as measured. Validation of the timing of ring deposits was done by marginal increment analysis. Growth parameters were determined by comparison of <b>fish</b> <b>fork</b> length to count measurements. This comparison via the Von Bertalanffy growth equation produced a growth rate for each species: blackfin, L∞ = 95. 34 cm, K = 0. 28, and t 0 = - 1. 53; little tunny, L∞ = 77. 93 cm, K = 0. 69, and t 0 = - 0. 69; and skipjack, L∞ = 112. 76 cm, K = 0. 24, and t 0 = - 1. 70. The curves indicate an average size of an individual of a given species at a certain age. They also give an estimation of a maximum length (L∞) of each species, in addition to specific growth rate, which is indicated by the slope. Parameters of each resulting Von Bertalanffy equation were compared among species.

40|$|The Atlantic {{bluefin tuna}} (ABFT) fishery is {{regulated}} by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), which establishes the allowable annual yield and the minimum capture size, and allocates capture quotas to the Contracting Parties. Despite fishery monitoring, {{a considerable amount of}} captures escapes ICCAT control. In the Mediterranean Sea, the purse seine fishery supports ABFT farming, a capture-based aquaculture activity that involves catching fish from the wild and rearing them in sea cages for a few months. The first spine of the cranial dorsal fin undergoes a continuous bone remodeling process consisting in old bone (primary bone) resorption and new bone (secondary bone) apposition. A marked increase of spine bone resorption was shown in captive-reared ABFT with respect to wild specimens. In this paper, the Random Forest (RF), a Computer Aided Detection system, was applied to distinguish captive-reared from wild ABFT based on fish age, <b>fish</b> <b>fork</b> length, total surface of spine cross section, and surface of remodeled bone tissue in the spine cross section (sum of reabsorbed bone tissue and secondary cancellous bone). The RF system was also compared to the Logistic Regression method (LR). The percentages of properly classified animals, either wild or captive-reared, with respect to the overall number of animals, i. e. accuracy, was 95. 3 ± 2. 6 % and 79. 0 ± 5. 1 % for RF and LR, respectively. The percentages of the properly classified captive-reared specimens, i. e. sensitivity, were 93. 5 ± 3. 1 % and 75. 8 ± 5. 3 % for RF and LR, respectively. The percentages of the properly classified wild specimens was 96. 7 ± 2. 2 % and 81. 4 ± 4. 9 %, for RF and LR, respectively. The proposed technique appears to be a reliable investigation tool anytime the suspicion arises that illegally caught ABFT are sold as aquaculture products...|$|E
40|$|Abundances of eye flukes (Diplostomum spp.) were {{compared}} between walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) and white suckers (Catostomus commersoni) collected {{in late summer}} 1997 from Lake St. Louis and Lake St. Pierre, two expansions of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada. The white sucker, a benthic consumer, was more heavily infected than the walleye, a pelagic piscivore, in both lakes. Infection levels increased significantly with host age and size. For both species, abundance of Diplostomum spp. within each age group and length class was higher in fish from Lake St. Louis than in those from Lake St. Pierre. Walleye {{of all ages and}} white suckers 7 years old from Lake St. Louis were also larger at age than those of corresponding age from Lake St. Pierre. Therefore, walleye and white suckers from Lake St. Louis are probably different populations from those in Lake St. Pierre. The higher infection levels in Lake St. Louis are most likely due to the larger number of ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis), an important definitive host of Diplostomum spp., in colonies in close proximity to that lake; there are > 75 000 pairs within 40 km of Lake St. Louis and 16 000 pairs within 40 km of Lake St. Pierre.

40|$|Background. Understanding {{the life}} {{history of a}} species is {{essential}} for fully understanding its role within an ecosystem. However, many of the fish species of high ecological value have not been studied due to their less prominent roles in local recreational and commercial fisheries in comparison to other targeted species. These valuable fishes are also important trophic linkages between small neritic fishes and large, economically valuable apex predators. This study describes {{for the first time}} the yearly age and growth patterns of three small tuna species inhabiting South Florida (USA) waters: blackfin tuna, Thunnus atlanticus (Lesson, 1831); little tunny, Euthynnus alletteratus (Rafinesque, 1810); and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis (Linnaeus, 1758). Materials and methods. Tuna specimens were collected in two ways: via donations obtained from various fishing tournaments and charter captains in the areas of the Florida Straits as well as hook-and-line catches performed especially for this project. Age determination was based on sagittal otolith hyaline deposition patterns. Marginal increment analysis was used as an indirect validation method. Growth parameters were determined by comparison of the <b>fish</b> <b>fork</b> length and the hyaline band measurements. Results. Two hyaline bands formed each year in all three species—one in winter and one in summer. The von Bertalanffy growth equation produced a growth rate for each species: blackfin tuna, L∞ = 95. 34 cm, K = 0. 28, and t 0 = – 1. 53; little tunny, L∞ = 77. 93 cm, K = 0. 69, and t 0 = – 0. 69; and skipjack tuna, L∞ = 112. 76 cm, K = 0. 24, and t 0 = – 1. 70. Parameters of each resulting von Bertalanffy equation were compared among species showing that little tunny grew the fastest, but skipjack had the largest estimated size. Results were also compared with growth rates currently used in stock assessments by fisheries management organizations, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Conclusion. Sectioned otoliths indicate two bands a year for these three species in the Florida Straits. Results were comparable to other studies, with a similar finding of two bands per year in hard parts for these species. Further knowledge of these populations will aid in stock assessments for these species and the ongoing shift to ecosystem-based management plans...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the concerted {{influence}} of temperature and salinity on the fecundity of clupeid fishes. Due to a globally changing climate, both physical parameters might act as stressors, severely affecting the reproductive potential of clupeid fish populations inhabiting tropical estuaries. Differences in relative batch fecundities, the gonado-somatic index, and the condition index of bonga shad (Ethmalosa fimbriata) were analysed in individual females sampled at the Senegalese coast and inside the inverse Sine Saloum estuary, where salinity increases upstream in all seasons. Sampling took place at the Senegalese coast and inside the Saloum River from February to October 2014, during the peak of E. fimbriata's spawning season. An additional sampling campaign could be conducted in November 2016. Three different sites were sampled: Joal (Senegalese coast, 14 ° 9. 1 ' N; 16 ° 51. 7 ' W), Djifer (Saloum River's mouth, 13 ° 57. 8 ' N; 16 ° 44. 8 ' W), and Foundiougne (upstream Saloum River, 14 ° 8. 1 ' N; 16 ° 28. 1 ' W). MODIS satellite-derived (Aqua, level 2, 0. 1 degrees) sea surface temperatures ([URL] were assessed at Joal (20 km radius) and Djifer once per sampling week to enhance spatial coverage by avoiding cloud cover. As no remote sensing data for inland waters were available, the Saloum River's surface water temperatures were recorded in situ once per sampling week with a digital thermometer (ama-digit ad 15 th; precision 0. 4 %; accuracy 0. 4 %). Monthly means in MODIS satellite-derived (Aquarius, level 3, 0. 5 degrees) sea surface salinities ([URL] were used to assess the coastal ocean's salinity in a radius of 20 km around Joal. For Djifer and Foundiougne salinity was measured with a handheld refractometer (Aqua Medic; precision 0. 7 %, accuracy 0. 2 %) using a Practical Salinity Scale (PSS- 78). Staging of fish was conducted macroscopically after a key by Blay Jr. & Eyeson (1982). In order to discriminate between mature females with ovaries containing fully hydrated oocytes (stage V) and females that have recently spawned (spent, stage VI) further descriptions on maturity stages in clupeid fishes were consulted (West 1990, ter Hofstede et al. 2007). Conversions of <b>fish</b> <b>fork</b> length (LF) to total length (LT) were conducted using the equation LT = 1. 0007 × LF + 3. 9. In order to access the nutritional status of female fish, a condition index (K) was calculated for each individual using wet weight (WW, ± 0. 1 g), total length (LT, nearest mm), and b of the length-weight relationship: K = WW x LT ^ - 3. 62 x 1000. The condition index (Khyd) and gonado-somatic index (IG) of hydrated female spawners (Stage V) was based on the ovary-free body weight (WOF, ± 0. 1 g) and the ovary weight (WOv, ± 0. 0001 g) : Khyd = WOF x LT ^ - 3. 62 x 1000; IG = WOv x WOF ^ - 1 x 100. The length-weight relationship of all sampled females across all sampling sites could be described by the following function: WW = 0. 0015 x LT ^ 3. 6...|$|E
