40|$|A {{compatibility}} graph-based, {{general area}} router for integrated circuit (IC) designs is presented. The highly flexible constraint system allows {{a number of}} modern and mixed-signal routing requirements to be handled, even for {{a large number of}} nets. The IC router can efficiently construct near-minimal Steiner trees for multi-terminal nets in both classical rectilinear, or Manhattan, geometry as well as octilinear geometries. These Steiner trees can be constructed around blockages, and in the presence of obstacles such as other nets. A method for routing trees through weighted areas is also introduced. The routing system can predict congested routing areas before routing is performed, and appropriately weight congested areas in order to reduce net congestion. Finally, a <b>fast</b> <b>crosstalk</b> violation checker can run alongside the routing engine. Each portion of the router is bounded by O(n log(n)) runtime, or less, making the entire routing process bounded by the same runtime. The system thus scales well to handle {{a very large number of}} exact routes in a fully mixed-signal aware engine, in either rectilinear or newly-introduced octilinear geometries...|$|E
40|$|For system-on-chips (SoC) using deep {{submicron}} (DSM) technologies, interconnects {{are becoming}} critical determinants for performance and reliability. Buses and long interconnects {{are susceptible to}} crosstalk defects and may lead to functional and timing failure. Hence, testing for crosstalk errors on interconnects and buses in a SoC has become critical. To facilitate development of new crosstalk test methodologies and to efficiently evaluate crosstalk defect coverage for existing tests, {{there is a need}} for efficient crosstalk defect coverage analysis techniques. In this paper, we present an efficient high-level crosstalk defect simulation methodology. By using a novel high-level DSM error model for the interconnects, together with HDL models for the cores, our methodology enables <b>fast</b> <b>crosstalk</b> defect simulation to be conducted at high level. We validate the high-level interconnect DSM error model by comparing its outputs with HSPICE simulation results. The fast and accurate high-level crosstalk defect simulation methodology will enable evaluation and exploration of new crosstalk test techniques, as well as existing tests, leading to the development of low-cost crosstalk test.

30|$|Line {{selection}} (LS), tone selection (TS), {{and joint}} tone-line selection (JTLS) partial crosstalk cancellers {{have been proposed}} to reduce the online computational complexity of far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellers in digital subscriber lines (DSL). However, when the crosstalk profile changes rapidly over time, there is an additional requirement that the partial crosstalk cancellers, particularly the LS and JTLS schemes, should also provide a low preprocessing complexity. This {{is in contrast to}} the case for perfect crosstalk cancellers. In this paper, we propose two novel channel matrix inversion methods, the approximate inverse (AI) and reduced inverse (RI) schemes, which reduce the recurrent complexity of the LS and JTLS schemes. Moreover, we propose two new classes of JTLS algorithms, the subsort and Lagrange JTLS algorithms, with significantly lower computational complexity than the recently proposed optimal greedy JTLS scheme. The computational complexity analysis of our algorithms shows that they provide much lower recurrent complexities than the greedy JTLS algorithm, allowing them to work efficiently in very <b>fast</b> time-varying <b>crosstalk</b> environments. Moreover, the analytical and simulation results demonstrate that our techniques are close to the optimal solution from the crosstalk cancellation point of view. The results also reveal that partial crosstalk cancellation is more beneficial in upstream DSL, particularly for short loops.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} much improved, accurate, <b>fast</b> and simple <b>crosstalk</b> model for coupled {{interconnect}} line considering the skin effect. It {{is time for}} VLSI designers to examine the crosstalk noise effects in their designs, {{so that they are}} free from noise. Hence, accurate noise modelling for RLC lines is critical for timing and system integrity analysis. Skin effect alters the values of the resistance and also the inductance, which in turn affects the system integrity in particular and its response as a whole. Till now the skin effect has been neglected for modelling the on-chip interconnects. This paper addresses a novel analytical model to find the impact of skin effect on the noise variation in RLC interconnect, without considering the skin effect modelling in inductance under ramp input. In the proposed work, the resistance variation due to the skin effect is considered in a two wire transmission line model. The correlation between the skin effect and noise is also considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Crosstalk {{is a major}} {{limitation}} {{to achieving}} high data-rates in next generation VDSL systems. Whilst crosstalk cancellation {{can be applied to}} completely remove crosstalk, it is often too complex for application in typical VDSL binders, which can contain up to hundreds of lines. A practical alternative, known as partial cancellation limits the cancellation to crosstalkers that cause severe interference to the other lines within the binder. In real VDSL systems, the crosstalk environment changes rapidly as new lines come online; old lines go offline, and the crosstalk channels change with fluctuations in ambient temperature. Therefore, adaptive crosstalk cancellers are often required. In this paper, we propose a new detection guided adaptive NLMS method for Adaptive Partial Crosstalk Cancellation that detects significant crosstalkers and tracks variations in their crosstalk channels. This exploits the sparse and column-wise diagonal dominant properties of the crosstalk channel matrix and leads to <b>fast</b> convergence, accurate <b>crosstalk</b> channel tracking, with a lower update complexity. The end result is an adaptive Partial Crosstalk Cancellation algorithm that has lower run-time complexity than prior state-of-the-art whilst yielding comparatively high data-rates and reliable service...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{crosstalk}} {{problem for}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) bundled interconnects ismodeled {{in the framework}} of the multiconductor transmission line (MTL) theory by using a fluid description of the conduction phenomena in CNTs. Two two-port models for a two-line interconnect (one aggressor and one victim) are proposed. The first is based on the full-MTL equations coupling each CNT in the bundles. The second, which is a reduced order TL model coupling the CNT bundles, is derived from the first one and used for <b>fast</b> computations. The <b>crosstalk</b> models are used to study the impact on relevant electromagnetic performances of some actual technological and design aspects, such as the variability of the number of conducting CNTs in each bundle, their position in the cross section, the proximity of the signaling lines, the cross-sectional aspect ratio, and some advances in CNT manufacturing techniques. Both frequency- and timedomain characteristics are evaluated and compared with those of ideally scaled traditional copper interconnects. The results are compared with those obtained by simplified approaches, showing, in particular, that simple RC models may underestimate the crosstalk...|$|R
