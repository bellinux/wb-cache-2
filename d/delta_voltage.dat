Neonates whose seizures began after more than 28 days of life were excluded; in all, five patients from four families were studied. Follow up ranged from 2 to 10 years.  RESULTS—A history of miscarriage and neonatal death during an epileptic seizure had occurred in the siblings of two families. One mother reported rhythmic movements of her child during the last month of pregnancy. At birth, all babies were hypotonic; four had decreased visual alertness. All babies were agitated, irritable, jittery, hyperalert, and exhibited sleeplessness and a startle reaction to touch and sound. Age of onset of seizures varied from 30 minutes to 3 days. Seizures of various types were recorded in all cases on EEG tracings, including spasms, myoclonic seizures, partial clonic, and secondary generalised seizures. Burst-suppression patterns occurred in three cases, and a combination of continuous and discontinuous patterns in two others. Bilateral high <b>voltage</b> <b>delta</b> slow wave activity was observed in four patients.

40|$|Frequency {{synthesizer}} is {{an essential}} circuit block for up conversion and down conversion in transmitters and receivers respectively. Fractional-N frequency synthesizers are replacing conventional integer- N frequency synthesizers because of their better performance in terms of settling time and phase noise. However, fractional-N frequency synthesizers suffer from fractional spurs or side bands which increase errorvector magnitude (EVM). To solve the fractional spur problem various techniques are suggested in the literature but have limitations in terms of area and power. To reduce the limitations, two fractional-N phase-locked loop (PLL) architectures are proposed where the phase is locked in each reference cycle unlike conventional sigma delta PLLs. This reduces fractional spurs and increases bandwidth. The proposed architectures are compared with sigma delta, finite impulse response (FIR) filtering based sigma <b>delta</b> and multi-phase <b>voltage</b> controlled oscillator (VCO) based fractional-N PLLs.

Implementation challenges like deterministic mismatch and random mismatch are also considered and sigma delta modulator and butterfly scrambler are used to compensate mismatch.

The rapid initial hyperpolarization of Vmc and Vcs was followed by a slower depolarization of cell membrane voltages and a lumen-negative change in transepithelial voltage (Vms). This phase also included an additional decrease in fRa. Removal of the ATP caused a further depolarization of membrane voltages followed by a hyperpolarization and then a return to control values. fRa fell to a minimum after removal of ATP and then returned to control values as the cell membrane voltages repolarized. Similar responses could be elicited by ADP but not by adenosine. The results of two-point cable experiments revealed that ATP induced an initial increase in cell membrane conductance followed by a decrease. Transient elevations of mucosal solution [K+] induced a larger depolarization of Vmc and Vcs during exposure to ATP than under control conditions. Reduction of mucosal solution [Cl-] induced a slow hyperpolarization of Vmc and Vcs before exposure to ATP and a rapid depolarization during exposure to ATP. We conclude that ATP 4 - is the active agent and that it causes a concentration-dependent increase in apical and basolateral membrane K+ permeability. In addition, an apical membrane electrodiffusive Cl- permeability is activated by ATP 4 -...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{placement}} of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, ventricular arrhythmias are induced {{to test the}} function of the devices. Although cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemic electroencephalographic changes occur in patients while implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are being tested, no investigation has assessed neurologic outcome in these patients. Nine patients having either implantation or change of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator underwent neurologic examination and neuropsychometric tests before and after the operation. After induction of general anesthesia and insertion of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads (when needed), ventricular fibrillation, ventricular flutter, or ventricular tachycardia, was induced by means of programmed electrical stimulation. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator testing continued until satisfactory lead placement was confirmed. The intraoperative electroencephalographic recording was analyzed for evidence of ischemic change. In all, an electroencephalogram was recorded during 50 periods of circulatory arrest. Mean duration of the arrest periods was 13. 6 seconds. By means of conventional visual inspection of the raw electroencephalogram, high-amplitude rhythmic <b>delta</b> or theta, <b>voltage</b> attenuation, or loss of fast frequency activity was observed in 30 of the arrests. By means of an automated technique of electroencephalographic interpretation based on power spectral analysis, electroencephalographic changes were correctly identified in 26 of the arrests. The incidence of these electroencephalographic changes was dependent on the arrest duration. The mean interval from arrest onset to electroencephalographic change was 7. 5 seconds (standard deviation ± 1. 8 seconds). In patients with electroencephalographic changes during multiple arrests, no downward trend in this interval was detected in later arrests and no evidence of persistent ischemic change was observed in electroencephalograms recorded after the conclusion of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator testing. Postoperative neurologic and neuropsychometric testing was completed in eight patients, none of whom exhibited a new neurologic deficit, exacerbation of a preexisting neurologic condition, or significant deterioration in neuropsychometric performance. We conclude that the brief arrest of cerebral circulation induced during insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is not associated with permanent neurologic injury.

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this paper to present an electroencephalographic study on Japanese B {{encephalitis}} for elucidating its pathophysiology, aiding its diagnosis and treatment and for evaluating its prognosis. Electroencephalograms of 19 patients admitted to our clinic were investigated in their courses of Japanese B encephalitis. We clinician have had only one method to know cerebral pathology in encephalitis, that is to judge on neurological signs and symptoms, and yet it is not entirely reliable. However, EEG can disclose pathological process which has been taken place and is going on in the acute stage in the brain of the patient and we can grasp whole pathology objectively by EEG. Besides this, we suppose we can know the prognosis of the patients more accurately by reading EEG than other conventional methods. In the acute stage, there is a bilateral symmetric monorhythmic continuous high <b>voltage</b> <b>delta</b> activity of 1 to 2. 5 c/s with frontal dominancy. This pattern is very characteristic of the Japanese B encepaalitis. This finding suggests that the primary lesion of this disease is located in the subcortical structure, especially in the ascending reticular formation of the brain stem. Electroencephalographic findings in the process of Japanese B encephalitis are illustrated in Table 1 Patients recover from encephalitis with the EEG findings in the order of 1) to 7) (from up to down) shown on the Table 1. in his EEG if the patient follows uneventful course. We have confirmed it takes about 1 year for the patient to follow the above-mentioned process and finally attain normal EEG. This is quite different from in the case of aseptic meningitis. If the patient fails to follow the above-mentioned course and stop at some stage in the middle, we consider this patient has much possibility to develop mental deficiency or other nourological sequelae. In the case that patient shows epileptic discharge in his EEG during convalescent period, we predict this patient will develop clinical epilepsy sooner or later. We, therefore, think it very important to have successive EEG study at least for four years on the patient with encephalitis even after his clinical abnormality clears up...|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{quantify}} the impact in the steady state operation of a distribution system when electric vehicles are connected. It {{is worth noting that}} the connection of them may cause significant changes in the voltage profile, in the degree of voltage unbalance and in the electrical losses of the system. In order to make this analysis, a three-phase power flow program was developed in MATLAB language. This program is based on the Ladder Iterative Technique and it contains models of overhead distribution lines, underground distribution lines, spot loads, distributed loads connected in wye and <b>delta,</b> step <b>voltage</b> regulators, capacitor banks, three-phase transformers and the model of an electric vehicle. This model allows simulation of a real electric vehicle of model Tesla Roadster, produced by Tesla Motors. The test system used in all simulations was the IEEE 13 bus. Moreover, the methodology consisted in simulate the system with the voltage regulator and without the voltage regulator under heavy load and light load conditions. The electric vehicle was connected to a specific systemâs bus and it were considered that it could work as a load or as a distributed generator with or without positive sequence voltage control. Constants configurations of the electric vehicles were considered for the heavy load and light load cases. The results of the simulations reveal there was voltage violation due to the connection of electric vehicles acting as loads in the test system under heavy load conditions without voltage regulator. When they operate as generators, they can maintain the voltage unbalance under the allowed 2 %, turning the systemâs voltages more balanced. There were significant reductions when the electric vehicles acted as a load (71. 1 %) and as generator (77. 5 %) on the total real power losses when the system operated with voltage regulator on the substation and the electric vehicles operated with positive sequence voltage control (specified at 1, 0 pu). Este trabalho tem o objetivo de quantificar o impacto da conexÃo de veÃculos elÃtricos na operaÃÃo em regime permanente de um sistema de distribuiÃÃo. Ã visto que a conexÃo dos mesmos pode causar mudanÃas significativas no perfil de tensÃes, no grau de desequilÃbrio de tensÃo e nas perdas elÃtricas do sistema. Para realizar essa anÃlise, desenvolveu-se um programa de fluxo de potÃncia trifÃsico na linguagem MATLAB. O programa Ã baseado na tÃcnica iterativa de escada. Foram implementados nesse programa modelos de linhas de distribuiÃÃo aÃreas e subterrÃneas, modelos de cargas concentradas e distribuÃdas conectadas em delta e em estrela, modelos de reguladores de tensÃo, modelos de banco de capacitores, modelo de transformadores trifÃsicos e o modelo do veÃculo elÃtrico. Esse modelo permite simular o veÃculo elÃtrico Tesla Roadster da Tesla Motors. O sistema teste utilizado em todas as simulaÃÃes foi o sistema IEEE 13 barras. A metodologia utilizada consistiu em simular o sistema sem regulador de tensÃo e com o regulador de tensÃo, em carga pesada e em carga leve. O veÃculo elÃtrico foi conectado a uma barra do sistema e considerou-se que o mesmo podia funcionar como carga ou gerador distribuÃdo sem e com controle de tensÃo de sequÃncia positiva no ponto de conexÃo. Adotou-se disposiÃÃes constantes de veÃculos elÃtricos para os casos de carga pesada e carga leve. Os resultados das simulaÃÃes revelam que houve violaÃÃo de tensÃo devido Ã inserÃÃo de veÃculos elÃtricos atuando como carga no sistema teste em carga pesada sem regulador de tensÃo. JÃ quando operam como gerador, os veÃculos elÃtricos diminuem o grau de desequilÃbrio em mÃdia, podendo mantÃ-lo abaixo do limite permitido de 2 %, tornando assim as tensÃes das barras trifÃsicas do sistema mais equilibradas. Houve reduÃÃes significativas quando os veÃculos elÃtricos atuaram como carga (71, 1 %) e como gerador (77, 5 %) na perda de potÃncia ativa total do sistema quando o sistema operou com regulador de tensÃo na subestaÃÃo e os veÃculos elÃtricos operaram com controle de tensÃo de sequÃncia positiva (especificada em 1, 0 pu) ...|$|R
