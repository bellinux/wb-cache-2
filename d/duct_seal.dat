40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the variability of duct leakage impacts on air distribution system performance for typical large commercial buildings in California. Specifically, a hybrid DOE- 2 /TRNSYS sequential simulation approach was used to model the energy use of a low-pressure terminal-reheat variable-air-volume (VAV) HVAC system with six duct leakage configurations (tight to leaky) in nine prototypical large office buildings (representing three construction eras in three California climates where these types of buildings are common). Combined fan power for the variable-speed-controlled supply and return fans at design conditions was assumed to be 0. 8 W/cfm. Based on our analyses of the 54 simulation cases, the increase in annual fan energy is estimated to be 40 to 50 % for a system with a total leakage of 19 % at design conditions compared to a tight system with 5 % leakage. Annual cooling plant energy also increases by about 7 to 10 %, but reheat energy decreases (about 3 to 10 %). In combination, the increase in total annual HVAC site energy is 2 to 14 %. The total HVAC site energy use includes supply and return fan electricity consumption, chiller and cooling tower electricity consumption, boiler electricity consumption, and boiler natural gas consumption. Using year 2000 average commercial sector energy prices for California ($ 0. 0986 /kWh and $ 7. 71 /Million Btu), the energy increases result in 9 to 18 % ($ 7, 400 to $ 9, 500) increases in HVAC system annual operating costs. Normalized by duct surface area, the increases in annual operating costs are 0. 14 to 0. 18 $/ft{sup 2 }. Using a suggested one-time <b>duct</b> <b>sealing</b> cost of $ 0. 20 per square foot of duct surface area, these results indicate that <b>sealing</b> leaky <b>ducts</b> in VAV systems has a simple payback period of about 1. 3 years. Even with total leakage rates as low as 10 %, <b>duct</b> <b>sealing</b> is still cost effective. This suggests that <b>duct</b> <b>sealing</b> should be considered at least for VAV systems with 10 % or more total duct leakage. The VAV system that we simulated had perfectly insulated ducts, and maintained constant static pressure in the ducts upstream of the VAV boxes and a constant supply air temperature at the airhandler. Further evaluations of duct leakage impacts should be carried out in the future after methodologies are developed to deal with duct surface heat transfer effects, to deal with airflows entering VAV boxes from ceiling return plenums (e. g., to model parallel fan-powered VAV boxes), and to deal with static pressure reset and supply air temperature reset strategies...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundTo {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} both mechanical methods (clips) and electrosurgical instruments, harmonic scalpel (HS) and LigaSure (LS), for securing the cystic duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). MethodsDuring the study period from October 2010 to October 2012, 458 patients with gallbladder stones underwent LC. A total of 38 patients {{were excluded from the}} study for different reasons. The gallbladder was excised laparoscopically through the traditional method. The gallbladder specimens of the patients were divided into three equal groups randomly, and the distal part of the cystic <b>duct</b> was <b>sealed</b> ex vivo using ligaclips (Group A), HS (Group B), and LS (Group C). The gallbladders were then connected to a pneumatic tourniquet device and we very gradually increased the pressure with air. The bursting pressure of the cystic duct (CDBP) was measured and differences between the three groups were calculated. ResultsThe mean CDBP was 329. 7  ±  38. 8  mmHg in the ligaclip group, 358. 0  ±  33. 1  mmHg in the HS group, and 219. 7  ±  41. 2  mmHg in the LS group. A comparison of the mean CDBP between the groups indicated the superiority of HS over ligaclip and LS. CDBP was significantly higher in the ligaclips group compared with the LS group (p  195  mmHg) than the maximum common bile duct pressure, whereas for LS the CDBP range was 150 – 297  mmHg, indicating that it is not safe for sealing.

MethodsPorcine common bile <b>ducts</b> (CBDs) were <b>sealed</b> with two electrosurgical devices, an electrothermal bipolar vessel-sealing device (EBVS) and ultrasonic coagulation shears. Acute study animals underwent surgical bile <b>duct</b> <b>sealing</b> followed by immediate burst pressure testing. Chronic study animals were maintained for 1 week postoperatively and then tested. ResultsThe seal failure rate in the acute study was 50 % for both the EBVS device and shears, and 0 % for the laparoscopic surgical clip device used as a control. The latter had significantly higher burst pressures (646. 2 ± 281. 8 mmHg; P= 0. 006) than the EBVS device (97. 6 ± 86. 6 mmHg) and shears (71. 7 ± 89. 3 mmHg). No significant difference in burst pressures was noted between the EBVS device and shears (97. 6 ± 86. 6 mmHg vs. 71. 7 ± 89. 3 mmHg). In the chronic study, obvious bile leaks occurred in one of four pigs (25 %) in the EBVS device subgroup and two of four pigs (50 %) in the shears subgroup. The average proximal CBD pressure in seven pigs was 16. 1 ± 4. 1 mmHg. The average chronic burst pressure in the control subgroup was 1088. 0 ± 922. 6 mmHg.

40|$|Inefficiencies in air {{distribution}} {{systems have been}} identified as a major source of energy loss in US sunbelt homes. Research indicates that approximately 30 [...] 40 % of the thermal energy delivered to the ducts passing through unconditioned spaces is lost through air leakage and conduction through the duct walls. Field experiments {{over the past several years}} have well documented the expected levels of air leakage and the extent to which that leakage can be reduced by retrofit. Energy savings have been documented to a more limited extent, based upon a few field studies and simulation model results. Simulations have also indicated energy loss through ducts during the off cycle caused by thermosiphon-induced flows, however this effect had not been confirmed experimentally. A field study has been initiated to separately measure the impacts of combined <b>duct</b> leak <b>sealing</b> and insulation retrofits, and to optimize a retrofit protocol for utility DSM programs. This paper describes preliminary results from 6 winter and 5 summer season houses. These retrofits cut overall duct leakage area approximately 64 %, which translated to a reduction in envelope ELA of approximately 14 %. Wrapping ducts and plenums with R- 6 insulation translated to a reduction in average flow-weighted conduction losses of 33 %. These experiments also confirmed the appropriateness of using duct ELA and operating pressures to estimate leakage flows for the population, but indicated significant variations between these estimates and measured flows on a house by house basis. In addition, these experiments provided a confirmation of the predicted thermosiphon flows, both under winter and summer conditions. Finally, average material costs were approximately 20 % of the total retrofit costs, and estimates of labor required for retrofits based upon these experiments were: 0. 04 person-hrs/cm{sup 2 } of <b>duct</b> <b>sealed</b> and 0. 21 person-hrs/m{sup 2 } of duct insulated...|$|R
40|$|According to the California Energy Commission (CEC 1998 a), California {{commercial}} buildings account for 35 % of statewide electricity consumption, and 16 % of statewide gas consumption. Space conditioning accounts for roughly 16, 000 GWh {{of electricity and}} 800 million therms of natural gas annually, {{and the vast majority}} of this space conditioning energy passes through thermal distribution systems in these buildings. In addition, 8600 GWh per year is consumed by fans and pumps in {{commercial buildings}}, most of which is used to move the thermal energy through these systems. Research work at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has been ongoing over the past five years to investigate the energy efficiency of these thermal distribution systems, and to explore possibilities for improving that energy efficiency. Based upon that work, annual savings estimates of 1 kWh/ft{sup 2 } for light commercial buildings, and 1 - 2 kWh/ft{sup 2 } in large commercial buildings have been developed for the particular aspects of thermal distribution system performance being addressed by this project. Those savings estimates, combined with a distribution of the building stock based upon an extensive stock characterization study (Modera et al. 1999 a), and technical penetration estimates, translate into statewide saving potentials of 2000 GWh/year and 75 million thermal/year, as well as an electricity peak reduction potential of 0. 7 GW. The overall goal of this research program is to provide new technology and application knowledge that will allow the design, construction, and energy services industries to reduce the energy waste associated with thermal distribution systems in California commercial buildings. The specific goals of the LBNL efforts over the past year were: (1) to advance the state of knowledge about system performance and energy losses in commercial-building thermal distribution systems; (2) to evaluate the potential of reducing thermal losses through <b>duct</b> <b>sealing,</b> <b>duct</b> insulation, and improved equipment sizing; and (3) to develop and evaluate innovative techniques applicable to large buildings for <b>sealing</b> <b>ducts</b> and encapsulating internal duct insulation. In the UCB fan project, the goals were: (1) to develop a protocol for testing, analyzing and diagnosing problems in large commercial building built-up air handling systems, and (2) to develop low-cost measurement techniques to improve short term monitoring practices. To meet our stated goals and objectives, this project: (1) continued to investigate and characterize the performance of thermal distribution systems in commercial buildings; (2) performed energy analyses and evaluation for duct-performance improvements for both small and large commercial buildings; (3) developed aerosol injection technologies for both <b>duct</b> <b>sealing</b> and liner encapsulation in commercial buildings; and (4) designed energy-related diagnostic protocols based on short term measurement and used a benchmarking database to compare subject systems with other measured systems for certain performance metrics. This year's efforts consisted of the following distinct tasks: performing characterization measurements for five light commercial building systems and five large-commercial-building systems; analyzing the potential for including duct performance in California's Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Non-Residential Buildings (Title 24), including performing energy and equipment sizing analyses of air distribution systems using DOE 2. 1 E for non-residential buildings; conducting laboratory experiments, field experiments, and modeling of new aerosol injection technologies concepts for sealing and coating, including field testing aerosol-based sealing in two large commercial buildings; improving low-cost fan monitoring techniques measurements, and disseminating fan tools by working with energy practitioners directly where possible and publishing the results of this research and the tools developed on a web-site.

New developments include defining combined duct and equipment efficiencies in a concept called "Tons At the Register" and on performance issues related to field use of the aerosol sealant technology. Some of the key results discussed in this report include: o Register, boot and air handler cabinet leakage can often represent a significant {{fraction of the total}} duct leakage in new construction. Because of the large range of pressures in duct systems an accurate characterization may require separating these components through improved leakage testing. o Conventional duct tape failed our accelerated longevity testing and is not, therefore, considered generally acceptable for use in <b>sealing</b> <b>duct</b> systems. Many other tapes and sealing approaches are available and practical and have passed our longevity tests. o Simulations of summer temperature pull-down time have shown that duct system improvements can be combined with equipment downsizing to save first cost, energy consumption, and peak power and still provide equivalent or superior comfort. o Air conditioner name plate capacity ratings alone are a poor indicator of how much cooling will actually be delivered to the conditioned space. Duct system efficiency can have as large an impact on performance as variations in SEER. o Mechanical duct cleaning techniques do not have an adverse impact on the <b>ducts</b> <b>sealed</b> with the Aerosol sealant.

40|$|The duct leakage in forced-air {{distribution}} {{systems has}} been recognized for years as {{a major source of}} energy losses in residential buildings. Recently, a measurement technique for estimating the total air leakage from residential duct systems, called Delta-Q, has been proposed.

This paper discusses the Delta-Q measurement technique and proposes improvements on its model to increase the accuracy of the total leakage estimations and to provide appropriate estimation of local leakages. Accurate estimations of the total and local leakages can help to focus the choice for both the right house and location in the duct system for performing the potential repair job.

Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections a method of <b>sealing</b> the <b>duct</b> system is required. Typical sealing methods include tapes or mastics applied around the joints in the system. Field examinations (both physical measurements and visual observations) of duct systems have shown that these seals tend to fail over extended periods of time. In this study, three test methods were used to test the longevity of duct sealants: simple heating, heat cycling and combined pressure and heat cycling (aging). The most advanced method was the "aging " test, developed to evaluate the longevity of duct sealants by alternatively blowing hot (75 °C) and cold (- 5 °C) air through test sections, with the apparatus cycling between hot and cold air quickly. The temperatures and cycle length were chosen to accelerate the aging process of the <b>duct</b> <b>seals.</b> The aging apparatus was able to test eight samples at a time, with the test samples constructed from standard duct fittings. The results of these tests were used to evaluate different sealants relative to each other, so that recommendations regarding duct sealants may be developed. Typical duct tape (i. e. fabric backed tapes with rubber adhesive) was found to fail more rapidly than all other duct sealants. The accelerated test method is being developed into an ASTM Standard under sub-committee E 6. 41. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Subsurface Ventilation System {{supports}} {{the construction and}} operation of the subsurface repository by providing air for personnel and equipment and temperature control for the underground areas. Although the system is located underground, some equipment and features may be housed or located above ground. The system ventilates the underground by providing ambient air from the surface throughout the subsurface development and emplacement areas. The system provides fresh air for a safe work environment and supports potential retrieval operations by ventilating and cooling emplacement drifts. The system maintains compliance within the limits established for approved air quality standards. The system maintains separate ventilation between the development and waste emplacement areas. The system shall remove {{a portion of the}} heat generated by the waste packages during preclosure to support thermal goals. The system provides temperature control by reducing drift temperature to support potential retrieval operations. The ventilation system has the capability to ventilate selected drifts during emplacement and retrieval operations. The Subsurface Facility System is the main interface with the Subsurface Ventilation System. The location of the <b>ducting,</b> <b>seals,</b> filters, fans, emplacement doors, regulators, and electronic controls are within the envelope created by the Ground Control System in the Subsurface Facility System. The Subsurface Ventilation System also interfaces with the Subsurface Electrical System for power, the Monitored Geologic Repository Operations Monitoring and Control System to ensure proper and safe operation, the Safeguards and Security System for access to the emplacement drifts, the Subsurface Fire Protection System for fire safety, the Emplacement Drift System for repository performance, and the Backfill Emplacement and Subsurface Excavation Systems to support ventilation needs...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Standards requirements for mechanical systems is to reduce energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. These goals are achieved by: 1. Maximizing equipment efficiency, both at design conditions and during part load operation 2. Minimizing distribution losses of heating and cooling energy 3. Optimizing system control to minimize unnecessary operation and simultaneous use of heating and cooling energy The Standards also {{recognize the importance of}} indoor air quality for occupant comfort and health. To this end, the Standards incorporate requirements for outdoor air ventilation that must be met during all operating conditions. This chapter summarizes the requirements for space conditioning, ventilating, and service water heating systems. It is organized in 11 sections including this overview. The other sections are as follows: Section 4. 2 Equipment Requirements addresses the requirements for HVAC and service water heating equipment efficiency and equipment mounted controls. Section 4. 3 Ventilation Requirements includes mechanical ventilation, natural ventilation and demand controlled ventilation. Section 4. 4 Pipe and Duct Distribution System covers construction and insulation of ducts and pipes, and <b>duct</b> <b>sealing</b> to reduce leakage. Section 4. 5 HVAC System Control Requirements covers control requirements for HVAC systems including zone controls, and controls to limit reheat and recooling. Section 4. 6 HVAC System Requirements covers the remaining requirements for HVAC systems including sizing and equipment selection, load calculations, economizers, electric resistance heating limitation, limitation on air-cooled chillers, fan power consumption and fan and pump flow controls.

40|$|Background and Objectives:Multiple single-port or sin-gle-incision {{techniques}} {{have been successfully}} imple-mented for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in adults and children. These techniques require either a large multi-channel port or a larger skin incision to accommodate multiple ports or instruments. Inspired by a first genera-tion single-port instrument, we developed a safe and ef-fective technique for a single-port laparoscopic cholecys-tectomy with virtually scarless results. Methods: Over a 14 -mo period, 20 patients (19 females, 1 male) underwent the hybrid single-port cholecystectomy. A straight 10 -mm Storz telescope with inbuilt 6 -mm work-ing channel in combination with 2 portless 2. 3 -mm per-cutaneous graspers was used. The dissection is carried out with 43 -cm bariatric length instruments. The cystic artery and <b>duct</b> are <b>sealed</b> with WECK Hem-o-lok clips or the Harmonic scalpel...|$|R

In weatherseals, TPV {{is used as a}} lightweight alternative to thermoset rubber materials in semi-dynamic and static parts, while in underhood and under-car applications it is well-suited for air <b>ducts,</b> tubing, molded <b>seals,</b> grommets, suspension bellows, cable jacketing, plugs, bumpers and many other parts. This is due to its sealing performance and resistance to extreme temperatures, chemical exposure and harsh environments.|$|R
40|$|Leaky and {{disconnected}} joints in HVAC {{air distribution}} systems are extremely widespread. The average efficiency of duct systems in {{homes in the}} US is approximately 55 % with approximately 60 % of the loss due to duct leakage. Beyond the energy and emissions penalties caused by these leaks, leaky systems have detrimental comfort, health, and safety effects. The health and safety effects include the delivery of combustion products into the homes due to leakage induced depressurization. Current duct installation practice does not attempt to address the problem. This project developed a prototype Professionally Engineered Duct System that will virtually eliminate air leakage {{and that can be}} applied in new and replacement installations at the same labor cost as current designs. It uses snap-together duct fittings that will not come apart, can be applied to all types of duct systems, and cannot be separated without exceptional force. its use would require minimal changes to current installation practice. The research team developed the prototype through a multi-step process beginning with a functional analysis of duct connections. This was followed by identifying <b>duct</b> <b>sealing</b> and attachment methods offering potential to meet design objectives, evaluating the designs in terms of function and economic feasibility, and building and testing the most promising design option. Two versions of this design were developed through a test, revise, retest process. One application was to a rigid sheet metal duct, the other was to a helix core flex duct. The process produced a sheet metal application with 1 / 20 th the leakage of a standard connection and a flex duct application with 1 / 10 th the leakage of a standard connection. A patent search has found that the design will not infringe on existing patents and is patentable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} field performance testing of five thermal distribution systems in four light commercial buildings. The systems studied {{are located in}} Sacramento and Pleasanton, California, and are connected to typical rooftop packaged units serving small office spaces. All of the buildings are single-story office-buildings with floor areas less than 1, 000 m 2. The field study included distribution system characterization of the five duct systems, and short-term refrigerant-side monitoring {{on two of the}} packaged units. The air leakage results are presented in terms of specific effective leakage areas (ELAs), the ASHRAE-defined duct leakage classes, leakage flowrate (from flow subtraction or derived from ELA and operating pressures), and air leakage ratios (i. e., fractional loss of fan flow). Comparisons are made with results from previous studies on light commercial buildings. The specific ELAs ranged from 0. 8 to 5. 3 cm 2 per m 2 of floor area served, and the leakage classes ranged from 232 to 414, making these duct systems much leakier than the “unsealed ductwork ” classification by ASHRAE. The air leakage ratios were approximately 10 % of fan-supplied airflow on average, which was considerably lower than previous studies. Conduction energy losses calculated by temperature measurements in the duct systems were found to be significant, ranging from 9 % to 24 % of capacity. Refrigerant-side monitoring of temperature and pressure were used to calculate equipment efficiencies. The results show that there were considerable energy losses by air leakage and conduction through ducts, and that the losses varied from system to system. Frequent on-off cooling cycling was common with the systems we tested and additional losses were also found due to improper system control. These diagnostic results suggest that efficiency improvement in thermal distribution could be achieved via better system control, design and sizing, and by <b>duct</b> <b>sealing...</b>|$|R
