Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> the next movie?

Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also.

[...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written.

5000|$|Scott {{warns that}} the most tragic [...] "state episodes" [...] in recent history {{originates}} with a genuine desire to improve the human condition. These tragic state episodes begin with an authoritarian state implementing policies reflecting high modernist ideals amidst a weak civil society. While Scott is not categorically opposed to high modernism or legibility, he warns that a false perception of human knowledge and social engineering is a dangerous combination. As a result, the negative implications of legibility should be thoroughly considered when contemplating networked advocacy plans, {{even if they are}} well-intentioned. The anonymity of data is one area of concern that deserves special attention. If states seek to impose their scientific beliefs, and methods for making populations legible, what <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> ICTs whose very purpose is to lower the cost of collaboration and information? The prior literature discussed here has shown that digital technologies and platforms can be leveraged for collective and social benefits, can hold state’s accountable, or can provide modalities of governance in areas where no state seemingly exists. ICTs have the ability to play a very different role when examined against a backdrop of James Scott and population legibility, one that aims for control and repression rather than liberation and collaboration. This raises the possibility for the state to use ICTs for purposes that are enslaving, quite the opposite of liberating. One of the problems with such state initiated standardization, even when done with the best of intentions, is that it robs a community of its very ability to resist to this state imposition and control, and even total authoritarian repression. Another problem arises from, {{in the case of a}} digital and abundant information environment, who controls the data? If the state also has a total monopoly over the information environment, then control and manipulation in this day and age become as easy as pressing a button, wiretapping a phone call, or locating political dissidents to within mere feet of their physical location represented on a GIS map. As Scott states, the technologies and capabilities now available to “enhance the legibility of a society to its rulers have become vastly more sophisticated, but the political motives driving them have changed little - appropriation, control, and manipulation remain the most prominent (77).” ...|$|E

5000|$|A leading {{proponent of}} {{educational}} modernization, Brumbaugh oversaw {{reform of the}} teacher training curriculum {{for the state of}} Louisiana. After the American Invasion of Puerto Rico, then a wealthy overseas province of Spain, and the Treaty of Paris of 1899, Brumbaugh was charged with implementation of an American-style educational system in Puerto Rico. What <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> the Island? At that time, and since the early 1500s the Island's educational system was based in Castilian Spanish. By order of King Ferdinand the Catholic, every church had to have a School Parish and all children were to be educated -"in letters and numbers, in science and Faith"- up to 6th grade. There had been a close coordination between the civil authorities and the Catholic Church parish schools and since the mid 1700s Puerto Rico had a semi-public school system. Around the 19th century education was modernized and the Civil authorities took over a greater role, with the aid of the Church. By the 1880s every Mayoralty had its own Education Board, coordinated with the island's Education Ministry, and with that of Spain's. When Brumbaugh took over, Puerto Rico's alphabetization (literacy?) levels in the urban centers was about 98%. The first thing done by Gen. Brooks, the newly appointed military occupation governor (by President McKinley) was to fire and deport the entire priesthood that managed parishes and their schools, who at the time depended on the civil government for their salaries. 36 of the 74 Island parishes and parish schools were left without a priest and teacher. Upon taking over, the first thing Martin G. Brumbaugh did was to dissolve the entire Education Ministry that had been in place for centuries. Then Brumbaugh had the entire public school faculty, most of whom were trained professors of either Antillean or Peninsular Spanish origins, fired and deported. He then brought from the US a great number of Anglophone school teachers, including his cousin Dr. D. Brumbaugh, considered more [...] "friendly to the American cause". The problem was that the American school teachers spoke only English, and the island's primary language was Spanish, with great numbers of French and Italian speakers. In less than 18 months, after Brumbaugh took over, school absenteeism shot up to 98% with the ensuing performance collapse of a population that spoke one language and the teachers another. Those children who did go to school were punished for speaking Spanish, and put down for their culture. The next thing Brumbaugh did, with the backing of the US Military Government, was to change the entire curriculum, to [...] "Americanize it". He re-wrote the entire Puerto Rican history curriculum, sanitized it and purged from it any data threatening to the [...] "American cause". In addition, he began to edit and doctor data so as to exacerbate anything political or social by the former Spanish Authorities, making it negative, out of context and proportion, in a national humiliation process that caused tremendous public outrage and protests. To this day, the island's educational system is still suffering from Brumbaugh's [...] "reforms". After he left Puerto Rico he held lecturer positions at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University. In 1906, he became superintendent of the Philadelphia Public Schools and gained statewide recognition for his performance in this role.|$|R

30|$|I {{acknowledge}} that the evidence I provided to support my arguments {{about the impact of}} the region’s political economy on labor market and human capital outcomes, although compelling, is mostly circumstantial. A formal statistical test of the effects of such an enduring and pervasive practice as the use of public sector employment as a tool for political appeasement is hard to come by. My attempt at a formal test of the hypothesis that queuing for government jobs explains high youth unemployment rates does provide support for the hypothesis but also suffers from some obvious limitations. Because the test depends on local variation in the availability of government jobs to drive differences in local youth unemployment rates, it relies on the assumption that youth job search behavior is mostly limited to local labor markets. While that may be true for the most part for some youth, such as young women and possibly lesser educated young men, it is not likely to be true for more educated men, who probably search for jobs in a national, if not international, labor market. Thus the absence of a positive association between high local rates of public employment and unemployment for these groups <b>does</b> not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> queuing <b>for</b> government jobs is not taking place at a broader scale.|$|R

If we can term this process as heroic, what <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> a generation of media-aware children versed in the systematic vanquishing of terrible odds and endless evil via quick thinking and rapid hand-eye co-ordination? This paper attempts to approach these concepts {{from the direction of the}} stories and logics themselves. I will ask what extent are Japanese and American/Western games and their stories affecting the cultural landscape of these countries? More specifically, how has this impacted on the role of television in the home...|$|E

In the 1990 s both countries changed to the option for designers to provide alternative solutions, where designers provide calculations to demonstrate that the codes are satisfied but not through the traditional deemed to satisfy route. Other social and legislative changes have {{had an impact on the}} profession. In the UK the Institute of Building Control, the equivalent of the Australian Institute of Building Surveyors responded by joining the Royal Institution of the Chartered Surveyors. Thus it has become part of the largest surveying professional body, what <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> the profession? This paper compares the Australian and UK professions and looks at some of the issues affecting their future direction. <br /...|$|E
40|$|If {{globalisation}} can {{be described}} as an evolution of imperialism on a global scale, as postcolonial theorist Bill Ashcroft suggests, what <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> contemporary writing about animals? This paper examines how questions of globalisation inflect the representation of animals in postcolonial fiction, taking the examples of Julia Leigh’s The Hunter(Australia), the recent film of the same name, and Laurence Fearnley’s Butler’s Ringlet(New Zealand). Their approaches differ in that both versions of The Hunter emphasise dangers associated with globalisation, whereas different reactions are in tension in Butler’s Ringlet. However, I argue that in each case responses to animals figure as a strategy in the negotiation of globalisation, and encourage reassessments of local species relations in the process. I explore the implications of this approach to animals in terms of comments by Zygmunt Bauman about the potential for pluralism within globalisation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ontologies and vocabularies {{are a key}} {{resource}} for creating interoperable metadata on the Semantic Web. To make finding and using ontologies easier, the idea of Ontology Repositories has been introduced with current implementations including e. g. the NCBO Bioportal, ONKI and Cupboard. There is a genuine need for different kinds of Ontology Repositories, each focusing on different kinds specific user-needs, different ontologies and different organizational requirements which cannot be addressed by a single general implementation. However, at the moment each Ontology Repository is a separate island with its own user interfaces and APIs. They also use varying ontology languages such as OWL, SKOS, and RDF Schema. Due to this, global search, browsing, and inference over the repositories is difficult and generally not <b>done</b> which <b>means</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> example, finding and reusing existing ontologies becomes difficult. To address the problems, we have developed a loosely coupled Network of Ontology Repositories (NOR) architecture that makes the repositories globally interoperable while maintaining their unique functionalities and strengths. To participate in the network, each ontology repository is required to implement a shared API. As a proof-of-concept evaluation, we present three case implementations demonstrating {{different aspects of the}} NOR approach: 1) internal distributed architecture of ONKI, 2) global search of ONKI and NCBO Bioportal, 3) publishing non-ontological concept collections as NOR endpoints, demonstrated with the semantic portal CultureSampo and the metadata editor SAHA. ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Jan Narveson, {{the view}} of some {{that there is no}} {{distinction}} between negative and positive rights on the ground that negative rights require police and courts for their enforcement is [...] "mistaken." [...] He says that the question between what one has a right to do and who if anybody enforces it are separate issues. If rights are only negative then it simply means no one has a duty to enforce them, although individuals have a right to use any non-forcible means to gain the cooperation of others in protecting those rights. Therefore, he says [...] "the distinction between negative and positive is quite robust." [...] Libertarians hold that positive rights, which would include a right to be protected, do not exist until they are created by contract. However, those who hold this view <b>do</b> not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> police, <b>for</b> example, are not obligated {{to protect the rights of}} citizens. Since they contract with their employers to defend citizens from violence, then they have created that obligation to their employer. A negative right to life allows an individual to defend his life from others trying to kill him, or obtain voluntary assistance from others to defend his life - but he may not force others to defend him, because he has no natural right to be provided with defense. To force a person to defend one's own negative rights, or the negative rights of a third party, would be to violate that person's negative rights.|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} the psychophysics behind the Banariu visual phenomenon is a delight. Scientifically, a phenomenon is any event that is observable. In this case {{we will be}} describing an entoptic phenomenon (ent means within and optic means the eye). Before starting to experience the phenomenon, ask yourself: Does the eye lie? It is certainly undeniable <b>that</b> it <b>does</b> not, anyway, not voluntarily. Even if it may not lie, it <b>does</b> not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a moment at least it can’t be lied to. In this case the patient suddenly experiences dizziness {{and a feeling of}} falling on his back accompanied by a brief moment of slight brightness. Because of this “brightness”, it is obvious that Banariu visual phenomenon is a particular case of Phosphene. In fact, Phosphene appears as the movement of multiple light sensations. But that Banariu visual phenomenon when expressed, at least in descriptions, gives the illusion of light growth. This will generate the sensation of falling, especially when the head is tilted back to look upward. These clinical observations have led to the working out of a method to establish when the phenomenon occurs, but it relies basically on the sincerity of the subject analyzed (Banariu method). In this method the subject studied is asked to look up quickly at a fixed point which should preferably be at the equivalent height of a second or third floor of a building. Meanwhile, a medical team should be standing behind the patient to catch him if he falls back...|$|R
