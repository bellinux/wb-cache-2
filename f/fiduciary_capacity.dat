Trustees, company directors, agents and business partners are all fiduciaries, as in Yugraneft v Abramovich, but other positions may be recognised by the court if the misuse of powers in a particular circumstance renders them so, as in Reid.

2500|$|A {{fiduciary}} is {{a person}} who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with one or more other parties (person or group of persons). Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other asset for another person. One party, for example a corporate trust company or the trust department of a bank, acts in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity</b> to the other one, who for example has entrusted funds to the fiduciary for safekeeping or investment. Likewise, asset managers—including managers of pension plans, endowments and other tax-exempt assets—are considered fiduciaries under applicable statutes and laws. [...] In a fiduciary relationship, one person, in a position of vulnerability, justifiably vests confidence, good faith, reliance, and trust in another whose aid, advice or protection is sought in some matter. [...] In such a relation good conscience requires the fiduciary to act at all times for the sole [...] and interest of the one who trusts.|$|E

40|$|Although ERISA {{expressly}} permits {{employers to}} act as both an employer/plan sponsor and fiduciary of an ERISA employee benefit plan, the statute does not address itself to whether corporate counsel should represent an employer {{in both of these}} capacities. Conflicts of interest frequently arise in this context because corporate officers have a fiduciary duty to act {{in the best interests of}} their shareholders, while ERISA plan fiduciaries have a duty to act in the best interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries. Although the Model Rules speak generically of how to identify the client in corporate situations, and also of how to resolve concurrent conflicts of interests between two clients, the Model Rules do not adequately address themselves to the common ERISA circumstance in which counsel represents simultaneously the company in its employer and plan <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacities.</b> This article for the first time therefore proposes a modification to the current version of the Model Rules to address these recurring and inherent attorney conflict of interest situations under ERISA. Although the new provision, denominated Rule 1. 13 (h), would not ban outright joint representation of dual role fiduciaries under ERISA, it would establish a strong presumption against such joint representations because of the inevitable conflicts of interest that develop between the interests of the employer in its corporate <b>capacity</b> and the <b>fiduciary</b> interests of the employer as ERISA plan fiduciary. The only way such joint representation of ERISA dual role fiduciaries should be considered ethically appropriate is if counsel can assure herself under the conflict of interest principles for current and former clients under Model Rules 1. 7 and 1. 9 that such recurring conflicts will not jeopardize the effectiveness of the legal representation for either the company or the plan...|$|R
40|$|Professional {{paper for}} the {{fulfillment}} of the Masters of Public PolicyThis paper discusses how building the capacity of charter school boards of directors to govern more effectively could contribute to improving accountability in Minnesota. State legislation has enacted an elaborate system of charter school accountability that is intended to submit schools to accountability from three main sources: bureaucratic authority, market and performance. Yet, more than 15 {{years after the first}} charter school opened in Minnesota, there is compelling evidence to suggest that this system is not effective. Though many stakeholders play a role in this failure, charter school boards of directors play a unique role in holding schools accountable, as they lie at the confluence of regulatory, market and performance accountability. They have a statutory obligation to conduct fiduciary oversight to ensure that their schools conduct themselves legally and responsibly. The board is a key party in a performance contract with the school’s authorizer. Unlike other stakeholders in the charter school accountability system, boards of directors have decision making authority at the school site level. Given this unique role, charter school boards have a unique opportunity to help build capacity for better charter school accountability in Minnesota. This paper outlines a vision for how charter school boards of directors can build their own capacity for effective governance by systematizing <b>fiduciary</b> oversight, building <b>capacity</b> for policy development and effectively evaluating performance. This increased capacity can help improve how charter schools in Minnesota are held accountable...|$|R

5000|$|Defalcation, for example, applies when a debtor {{is acting}} in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity.</b> To {{constitute}} a defalcation, the conduct involves a degree of culpability that is greater than negligence, but the act {{does not need to}} {{rise to the level of}} a [...] "fraud" [...] under common law.

50|$|Defalcation {{occurs when}} a debtor commits a bad act while acting in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity.</b> The classic example of defalcation is when a trustee {{recklessly}} invests trust funds and loses the money.

50|$|Lord Upjohn {{also agreed}} with Lord Cohen that {{information}} is not property at all, although equity will restrain its transmission if it has been acquired by a breach of confidence. He said unequivocally that knowledge learnt by a trustee {{in the course of}} his duties is not property of the trust and may be used for his own benefit unless it is confidential information which is given to him (i) in circumstances which, regardless of his position as a trustee, would make it a breach of confidence to communicate it to anyone or (ii) in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{term in the}} United States is {{most often}} used to {{describe}} the business activities of many financial services companies and banks that act in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity</b> for investors in a particular security (i.e. stock investors or bond investors). For example, instead of borrowing funds from a bank, a company might borrow funds from the general public {{in the form of a}} bond. When a bank lends money to a company, it may often inspect the company's financial statements to ensure that the company follows the rules (known as covenants) of the loan agreement, and may also attempt to negotiate a settlement if the company has problems and stops repaying its loan.|$|E

5000|$|Trust {{companies}} may also perform corporate trust services. Corporate trust services are services which assist, in the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{in the administration}} of the corporation's debt. For example, in a normal bank loan, the lender normally lends money to the company (usually with conditions called [...] "covenants"), accepts payments from the company monthly, and monitors the financial conditions of the company to ensure that it is meeting all its agreed upon conditions (for example, that its ratio of profits to expenses stays above a certain amount). However most large companies borrow money not from banks, but by selling bonds. When the company sells bonds, a corporate trust company can handle the acceptance of payments from the company (which it passes on to the bondholders), and is the entity which monitors the company to ensure it is meeting covenants. In the event of the company's bankruptcy, the corporate trust company represents the interests of the bondholders and acts to recover as much of the loan proceeds as possible.|$|E
5000|$|For a {{revocable}} trust, the grantor {{retains the}} power to direct transactions for the trust, even if a third party serves as the trustee. [...] This may even include situations where {{there may be a}} conflict in the grantor's direction and the actual terms of the trust. [...] In an irrevocable trust, there has developed a growing use of a so-called trust protector. This is generally an unaffiliated, third party (often a lawyer or an accountant) who is granted {{the power to}} amend or change the terms of the trust in order to accommodate unexpected changes in tax or fiduciary law, unexpected changes in the trust's circumstances or other contingencies. The Code permits the use of such third parties to amend or alter even an irrevocable trust. [...] The trustee is to act in accordance with such powers unless [...] "the attempted exercise is manifestly contrary to the terms of the trust or the trustee knows the attempted exercise would constitute a serious breach of a fiduciary duty that the person holding the power owes to the beneficiaries of the trust." [...] Furthermore, the Code assumes such trust protectors act in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity</b> and must act in good faith with respect the trust's purposes and {{the best interests of the}} beneficiaries.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the House of Lords (Lords Cohen, Guest and Hodson) held {{that there was a}} possibility of a conflict of interest, because the solicitor and beneficiary might have come to Boardman for advice as to the purchases of the shares. They owed fiduciary duties (to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest) because they were negotiating over use of the trust's shares. The majority disagreed about the nature and relevance of information used by Boardman and Phipps. Lord Cohen said the information is not truly property and it does not necessarily follow that, because an agent acquired information and opportunity while acting in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity,</b> he is accountable. His liability to account depends on the facts. His Lordship regarded Boardman to be liable because he acquired the information {{in the course of the}} fiduciary relationship and because of the fiduciary relationship. The other two members of the majority, Lord Hodson and Lord Guest, opined that information can constitute property in appropriate circumstances and in the current case, the confidential information acquired can be properly regarded as property of the trust. Therefore, Boardman was speculating with trust property and should be liable. The majority agreed unanimously that liability to account for the profits made by virtue of a fiduciary relationship is strict and does not depend on fraud or absence of bona fides, and so Phipps and Boardman would have to account for their profits. However, they were generously remunerated for their services to the trust.|$|E
40|$|Bankruptcy law has {{fiercely}} competing policies. A primary one is {{the debtor}} 2 ̆ 7 s fresh start.

This Article makes three contributions. First, it compiles and evaluates the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence on the meaning of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity</b> in the bankruptcy setting. The most recent opinion on that term was issued in 1934 and provided limited guidance that was obscure and primarily in a negative form. 3 Since the time of that decision, circuit and bankruptcy courts throughout the country have struggled to apply a consistent framework for determining whether modern legal relationships amount to a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity.</b> The second contribution is the categorization of the circuit split into four separate approaches. The final contribution is an assessment of the adequacy of the current judicial approaches and the proposal of a new framework for determining if a relationship is a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity</b> for purposes of the exception to discharge. This is done by exploring the methods used to identify a fiduciary relationship under non-bankruptcy law, examining the problems with using those methods in a bankruptcy context, and suggesting the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 2013 opinion on defalcation justifies a rebalancing of the judicial construction of the statutory terms 2 ̆ 2 defalcation 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity.</b> 2 ̆ 2 4...|$|E

40|$|The most {{business}} entities in Europe {{are small}} or medium-sized enterprises (SME), {{which have a}} legal obligation to prepare financial statements in accordance {{with a set of}} accounting principles accepted in their country. Those statements are available to creditors, suppliers, and national governments but they could be badly understandable to creditors, suppliers and subjects in other countries. This is a great obstacle of their activities in the EU internal market. The existence of 27 different national accounting systems in the EU can be held for the most important obstacle. There are many ways how to develop compatible accounting standards for SMEs but the most significant activity in this field is the research project of IASB (International Accounting Standards Board). IASB has developed IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). Even though IFRS are suitable for all enterprises, their application in case of SMEs would be very expensive and could significantly increase compliance costs of taxation. This development has not been finished yet and there are still some problems which need to be solved before the introduction of accounting standards to the public. The research has shown that IFRS for SMEs should be used mainly by the entities which do not have public accountability – i. e. that its equities are not publicly traded and do not hold assets in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity</b> for a broad group of outsiders. This paper discusses those IFRS modifications, which should be done in case of SMEs...|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{exploring}} {{the relevance of}} forensic accounting in curbing crime and corruption in public sector. The objective of the research work is to explore the role forensic accounting can play {{in the fight against}} corruption via the application of investigative skills, in addition to provision of litigation support services, documentation, and reporting. The population used in the research was the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). The research design employed was the survey research. Data was majorly collected from primary sources. The hypothesis testing in this research work was done using regression analysis. The result of the empirical findings shows that forensic accountants are relevant in investigating crime and corruption in the public sector. Forensic accountants play a role in litigation support services in the public sector and are relevant in documentation and reporting. It was observed that forensic accounting plays a significant role in curbing crime and corrupt practices in any public sector since it provides a mechanism to hold people accountable, such that those who manage resources in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity</b> do not easily abuse that trust without detection. The paper recommends, among others, that: accounting professionals should always act proactively such that members are kept abreast of emerging technologies, especially in the area of forensic accounting; the legislature should see to it that the executive grants full autonomy to the agents of government that are charged with enforcing accountability; and that the office of the Auditor-Genera/ of the Federation, the Economic and Financial Crime Commission, Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, and Code of Conduct Bureau should be fully independent entities free to do their job without undue meddling and interference...|$|E
30|$|The {{response}} to the moral dilemma (i.e. supply of borehole water), {{and those of the}} stakeholders’ moral prioritisation reveal that the moral theories underpinning the drivers of CSR among the mining cases under investigation do not mirror any of the four afore-mentioned orientations, except ordinary morality. First, the position of the Ethical Egoist implies that we have no moral duty to any party, or special group other than ‘self’ – neither in the short nor long run. In the corporate context, ‘self’ means the corporate ownership and the ‘moral duty’ is profit-maximisation. Where the corporate entity is publicly traded on the stock market, this ownership is the body of shareholders as represented, according to agency theories, by managers in their <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity.</b> In its purest form, the Egoist would avoid, evade or ignore laws and regulations as much as possible if doing so can be seen to maximise his profit. Where this is not possible, the egoist would adhere to the least demanding of legal compliance, or at best, address herself to the low hanging fruits of ‘beyond legal compliance’ positive duties. For the same reason, he may go beyond legal compliance, albeit only on an instrumental basis, in the short or long run, although the proclivity favours the short run. Further, even though the egoist would normally not give preferential treatment to any stakeholder other than the shareholder, he would not hesitate to do so if it will serve his interest of maximising shareholder value. This indicated that doing a positive duty is not necessarily precluded from an egoist’s behavioural options. Data from both corporate and community sources indicated that the mining companies officially recognised both negative rights of their stakeholders as well as positive moral duties towards their communities, a dual position Egoists would not take.|$|E
40|$|The crux of {{bankruptcy}} law is giving debtors {{a fresh start}} by discharging their debts. Yet society has recognized that some debts should not be discharged because they either have {{a high level of}} societal importance or derive from a debtor’s culpable conduct. One of these exceptions from discharge is for defalcation while acting in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity.</b> The legal meaning of defalcation has been unclear for 172 years, ranging from a breach of trust by one who has charge of money to the misappropriation of money in one’s keeping. A three-way federal circuit split developed on whether a state of mind was required for defalcation and if so, how culpable. In May 2013, the U. S. Supreme Court resolved the circuit split in Bullock v. BankChampaign by establishing a new, heightened mental standard based on the Model Penal Code’s definition of “recklessly. ” Bullock’s holding is significant because it did not adopt any of the tests from the circuit split. Bullock’s new test is challenging for three reasons. First, applying a Model Penal Code culpability to civil fiduciary law is awkward because the various sources of fiduciary duties rarely contain a mental state requirement. Second, the Model Penal Code’s recklessly definition is abstract and difficult to apply. For example, instead of focusing on the breach of a fiduciary duty, it concentrates on the risk that a fiduciary duty will be breached. Further, some elements of recklessly must be evaluated from a subjective standard while others require an objective one. Finally, in delineating the new recklessly test, Bullock parenthetically grafted in the separate criminal law doctrine of willful blindness. This synthesis of recklessness and willful blindness, which are two completely different tests, results in a seemingly unworkable standard that does not make sense. This Article explores each element of the new recklessly standard and identifies pitfalls to avoid. It also suggests an approach to reconcile the troubling analytical problems resulting from combining recklessness and willful blindness. This Article concludes by establishing an analytical framework to apply Bullock’s new test...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{examines}} {{how and why}} the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) added the project on Small and Medium-sized Entities (SMEs) onto its active agenda, and examines the complete SME project to understand the IASB’s standard setting activity. This study covers events from March 2000 to July 2009 and is important because it is the first to examine the IASB’s agenda setting activity and accounting standard setting in such depth. Conventional thinking since the 1950 s has been that one set of reporting requirements should be applicable to all entities, regardless of size. From the time of its establishment in early 2001 the IASB’s constitutional mandate was to “develop in the public interest a single set of high quality [...] . accounting standards [...] . to help participants in the various capital markets of the world” (IASB, 2004 : para 8, emphasis added). In 2009, however, the IASB promulgated an accounting standard International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for Small and Medium Entities (SMEs), that seemed to overturn this thinking. This research applies historical research methods, observation at key meetings and interviews to carry out this study. This study employs a wide range of documents relating to the SME project and observations of key meetings. It also goes beyond the evidence in the public domain and includes 32 interviews with key people with an interest and involvement {{in the development of the}} standard. It also draws on International Standard-setting Report (IStaR) documents that provide detailed observer accounts of the IASB board meetings. Kingdon’s (1984) policy oriented agenda setting framework provides a means of interpreting the research material obtained. This framework identifies three streams—problem, policy and politics— to understand how issues gain entrance onto a policy maker’s agenda, and is also useful for interpreting the more detailed policy formulation. Key findings of this thesis show that the SME project was opposed within the IASB by both some board members and senior staff, who did not believe that the IASB had the mandate to produce another set of standards. There was a possibility that the project could have been blocked or sidetracked by those opposed to the project. Sir David Tweedie, the chairman of the IASB, removed these obstacles by seeking a change in the International Accounting Standard Committee Foundation (IASCF) ’s constitution and creating a new senior position to direct the project. The director of the SME project reported directly to Tweedie. A legacy issue inherited from the IASB’s predecessor, the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), noted a “strong demand exists for more work on the application of accounting standards to reporting by small enterprises” (IASC, 2000 : para 29). As the IASB discussed this issue with its stakeholders, this potential project on SMEs was extended to include developing countries. Before the SME project was added onto the IASB’s agenda in July 2003, the project focus was narrowed to SMEs. The IASB assumed that SMEs and developing countries had similar reporting needs and that by developing the SME standard it would address the needs of developing countries. The IASB added the SME project onto its agenda for several reasons. The IASB was under external pressure to develop a simplified set of reporting standards for SMEs. There were also other groups, including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), and the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), which had indicated they would step into the IASB’s standard setting domain if the IASB did not ii commit to the SME project. This possibility seemed to be a threat to the IASB, which wanted to protect its standard setting domain. Even before adding the project on SMEs to its active agenda the IASB had identified its proposed policy proposal if it were to act which was to minimise divergence from full IFRS. When the IASB issued its discussion paper in June 2004, it identified multiple objectives for the project of which the two primary objectives were to focus on meeting the needs of users of SME financial reports, and to reduce the reporting burden on SMEs. One of the secondary objectives was to facilitate transition to full IFRS, and this secondary objective seemed to be consistent with the IASB’s earlier proposed policy to minimise divergence. During the course of the project the IASB increasingly concentrated on the secondary objective of facilitating transition to full IFRS. The IASB seemed to resist changes sought via the public due process that would have simplified the recognition and measurement criteria in the SME standard. However, private lobbying by other groups such as EFRAG seemed more influential in convincing the IASB to provide some recognition and measurement simplifications. The IASB claimed that it was developing a standard for SMEs that would also assist developing countries, but it used a narrowly defined concept of public accountability to determine which entities can use the eventual standard. SMEs were described as those entities that do not have public accountability and that publish general purpose financial statements for external users. An entity was deemed to be publicly accountable if it was trading in the public market to raise funds or if it was holdings assets in a primary <b>fiduciary</b> <b>capacity.</b> The criteria used to determine which entities can use the standard were inconsistent with the description of the standard’s target users. Those entities that meet the criteria will not necessarily be SMEs. Rather it will be those regarded as nonpublicly accountable, according to the IASB’s definition of public accountability. The board struggled to find an appropriate title for the standard that aptly described the scope of the standard. The title of the project was changed five times but eventually, two months before the standard was released, it was re-titled IFRS for SMEs, despite the IASB’s awareness that the title is inconsistent with the criteria used to determine which entities can use the standard. However, the title IFRS for SMEs was considered to be widely understood and to give a positive impression of the standard. This study makes four contributions to the accounting standard setting literature. First, this study responds to a gap in the literature in relation to how issues are added on to the IASB’s agenda. This study showed that the IASB may add a project onto its agenda for several reasons other than those described in its Due Process Handbook. Second, the study showed that the IASB had already identified its proposed policy before adding the project onto its agenda. During the course of the project it became apparent that the IASB may not be open to making substantial changes to its predetermined policy as part of its due process. Third, the literature identified the need to understand the role of the technical staff in defining and managing projects. This study showed that the role of the technical staff extends beyond acting as an intermediary on the technical aspects of the project and includes managing projects to build support for and to market projects. Fourth, this study is the first to use only Kingdon’s framework to examine standard setting process of an international accounting standard setting body—the IASB. By using the Kingdon’s framework this study has highlighted subtleties embedded in the IASB’s standard setting process. This provides a better understanding of IASB’s agenda entrance process and how it develops a standard after it is added onto its agenda...|$|E
