25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors {{having to do}} with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between <b>declarative</b> <b>knowledge</b> (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of <b>declarative</b> <b>knowledge,</b> but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} for training programs is learning. Learning outcomes can be organized into three broad categories: cognitive, skill-based, and affective outcomes. Cognitive training {{is aimed at}} instilling <b>declarative</b> <b>knowledge</b> or the knowledge of rules, facts, and principles (e.g., police officer training covers laws and court procedures). Skill-based training aims to impart procedural knowledge (e.g., skills needed to use a special tool) or technical skills (e.g., understanding the workings of software program). Affective training concerns teaching individuals to develop specific attitudes or beliefs that predispose trainees to behave a certain way (e.g., show commitment to the organization, appreciate diversity).|$|E

2500|$|The name Prolog {{was chosen}} by Philippe Roussel as an {{abbreviation}} for [...] (French for programming in logic). [...] It was created around 1972 by Alain Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel, based on Robert Kowalski's procedural interpretation of Horn clauses. [...] It was motivated {{in part by the}} desire to reconcile the use of logic as a <b>declarative</b> <b>knowledge</b> representation language with the procedural representation of knowledge that was popular in North America in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [...] According to Robert Kowalski, the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by Colmerauer and Phillipe Roussel. The first implementations of Prolog were interpreters. However, David H. D. Warren created the Warren Abstract Machine, an early and influential Prolog compiler which came to define the [...] "Edinburgh Prolog" [...] dialect which served {{as the basis for the}} syntax of most modern implementations.|$|E
2500|$|A {{similar case}} {{involved}} Clive Wearing, an accomplished musicologist who contracted a cold sore virus that attacked his brain, causing herpes simplex encephalitis. As a result, Wearing developed both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, {{so he has}} little memory of what happened before the virus struck him in 1985, and cannot learn new <b>declarative</b> <b>knowledge</b> after the virus struck him either. As a result of anterograde amnesia, Wearing repeatedly [...] "wakes up" [...] every day usually in 30-second intervals. [...] He {{has a history of}} repeatedly recording these moments of waking up in his journal (e.g., On Sept 2, 2013 I woke up, etc. etc.) and crossing out prior entries, as if the other moments of waking up were not real. [...] His episodic memory is nonfunctional (so he does not consciously recall having woken up 30 seconds prior). [...] Clive is often elated to see his wife, as if he has not seen her for a while. [...] Despite this, however, Wearing maintained his ability to play the piano and conduct choirs. This case is significant because it demonstrates declarative and procedural memory are separate. Therefore, despite anterograde amnesia preventing Wearing from learning new bits of information that can be explained in words (declarative memory), and also preventing him from storing new memories of events or episodes (also part of declarative memory), he has little trouble in retaining his musical abilities (procedural memory), though he has no conscious memory of having learned music.|$|E

This study aimed to establish the content validity of scenes of the <b>Declarative</b> Tactical <b>Knowledge</b> Test in Volleyball – DTKT:Vb. Five male coaches of the Brazilian Volleyball team who worked with male athletes participated as judges, being responsible for training formation categories up to 21 years, experts in the sport, with minimum ten years of experience. The judges evaluated 212 scenes containing extremity attack (n= 55), central attack (n= 33), setting (n= 68) and block (n= 60) situations and used a 1 - 5 point likert scale to assign a score to the scene according to requisites image clarity, practical relevance and item representativity. The Content Validity Coefficient (CVC) {{was used to determine}} the CVC for each scene and the instrument as a whole, with cutoff point of 0. 80. The results demonstrated that “image clarity” (CVC= 0. 92), “practical relevance” (CVC= 0. 96) and “item representativity” criteria (CVC= 0. 96) showed satisfactory levels. After calculating CVC, the ecological validity of scenes was determined, which consists of the selection of scenes where there was convergence among decision made by judges and decision made by athletes. Thus, from 212 scenes initially prepared, 66 have been validated. Scenes validated using CVC enabled the evaluation of the <b>Declarative</b> Tactical <b>Knowledge,</b> assisting in the planning of teaching-learning-training processes of male volleyball athletes...|$|R

40|$|In {{a number}} of works dealing with {{cooperative}} teaching affective domain variables were in focus, while the cognitive domain variables were studied less. In this paper, we try to look on cooperative teaching {{from the point of}} conformation of <b>declarative</b> and procedural <b>knowledge.</b> The influence of three modalities of cooperative work in teaching Nature and Society on comformability of students’ <b>declarative</b> and procedural <b>knowledge</b> are experimentally checked. Arranging the students within small homogeneous and heterogeneous groups was the basis for the formation of the applied modalities. The sample consisted of 259 fourth-grade students of elementary school. The experiment was done with parallel groups. The results showed that students in the experi­mental group had better conformation of <b>declarative</b> and procedural <b>knowledge</b> not only at the final, but also at the subsequent measurings, as compared to the control group. Heterogeneous or homogeneous grouping led to the same conformation of <b>declarative</b> and procedural <b>knowledge.</b> Quality knowledge can not be obtained by accumulation of either declarative or procedural one, but by balancing these two kinds of knowledge, by their conformation. Conformed skills last longer and that is precisely the goal of a successful teaching in general, and not only cooperative teaching Nature and Society we dealt with in our study.
