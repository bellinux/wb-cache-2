I even paid a call or two on my own account; but I have no recollection of whom I went to see or what we talked about. I had no chance to visit either Mr. Parker or Eve, for neither of them left their places {{and they were in}} the middle of a row; but I took good care that we were close together in the vestibule toward the end. With a little shiver I saw that Lady Orstline was there too--next Mr. Parker. I was a few feet behind them both, with my sister. I found myself watching almost feverishly.|$|E

60|$|I gladly let him assist Demetria to {{her seat}} on the side-saddle, for that was perhaps the last {{personal}} service {{he would be able}} to render her. The poor old fellow was crying, I believe, his utterance was so husky. Before leaving I gave him on a scrap of paper my address in Montevideo, and bade him take it to Don Florentino Blanco with a request to write me a letter in the course of the next two or three days to inform me of Don Hilario's movements. We then trotted softly away over the sward, and in about half an hour struck the road leading from Rocha to Montevideo. This we followed till daylight, scarcely pausing once from our swift gallop, and a hundred times during that dark ride over a country utterly unknown to me I blessed the little witch Cleta; for never was there a more steady, sure-footed beast than the ugly roan that carried my companion, and when we drew rein in the pale morning light he seemed fresh as when we started. We then left the highway and rode across country in a north-westerly direction for a distance of eight or nine miles, for I was anxious to be far away from public roads and from the prying, prating people that use them. About eleven o'clock that morning we had breakfast at a rancho, then rode on again till we came to a forest of scattered thorn-trees growing on the slopes of a range of hills. It was a wild, secluded spot, with water and good pasturage for the horses and pleasant shade for ourselves; so, after unsaddling and turning loose our horses to feed, we sat down to rest under a large tree with our backs against its portly trunk. From our shady retreat we commanded a splendid view of the country over which we had been riding all the morning, extending for many leagues behind us, and while I smoked my cigar <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> companion, calling her attention to the beauty of that wide, sunlit prospect.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} not much combat {{took place between}} Turkey or Turkish-backed Syrian rebels against ISIL in Jarabulus and the {{closeness}} in Islamist political ideology between ISIL {{and some of the}} rebel groups involved, has led to much local and international speculation about collusion between Turkey and ISIL in the operation, including allegations of ISIL fighters changing uniform. In an interview published in The Independent on 9 September, an ISIL fighter claimed that [...] "when the Turkish army entered Jarabulus, <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> friends who were there.

5000|$|I was {{painting}} my mom's house in Ontario {{when the phone}} rang. The {{voice on the other}} end said it was Cardinal Bertone, and my first thought was that it was a prank, … you know, I thought maybe it was one of the Redemptorists fooling around. Quickly, though, I realized that it really was Bertone, and he said that the Holy Father wants you to do this. My first reaction was to tell him that off the top of my head, I could give him the names of five people much more qualified to do this job than I am. I was completely serious about it. But Cardinal Bertone said no, this is what the Holy Father wants. He said I could take a week to ten days to think about it, so <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> superiors, my closest friends in religious life, and my spiritual director.|$|E

When <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> buddy Dark Thriller, he agreed because he had these emotions too, so we started to do the project together. We see there are no other valid prophetic references about the endtimes rather than from the book of Revelation.

After {{a few months of}} wrestling through all the theory it finally became clear to me. The next thing to do was numerically constructing the behaviour predicted in the theory, and after that writing this report. Most of all I want to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. R van der Hout for all of his support. We almost met weekly and discussed the progress. I want to thank Dr. J. B. van den Berg for letting me use figures 2. 5 and 2. 6. I want to thank Peter Bruin for helping me including a flipbook in this thesis of the differential equation I studied. I also want to thank my parents for their support during my study. Finally I want to thank all the other people who supported me during my studies. ...|$|E
40|$|In 2008 Barack Obama {{was elected}} {{to be the first}} African-American {{president}} of the United States of America. While most of us grasped the historical significance of this moment, there were clear differences in how its meaning was interpreted. To draw on a personal experience, when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> ailing grandfather at the time, he expressed a tremendous amount of admiration for President Obama and seemed to hold him in the highest regards. But when we ended the conversation he said: “I am still surprised that the Americans are willing to elect a Negro. ” A couple weeks earlier, my five-year-old daughter had asked me why this election was such a big deal. When I tried to explain to her that it was important because {{for the first time in}} history a “black man” would be president of the most powerful country in the world, she pointed to a picture of Obama and his family and said “He is not black, he is brown!” These differences in interpretation of one and the same event do not reflect differences in race, class, nationality, gender, or even personalities, but instead they result from the fact that the three of us were, and still are, members of different generations and thus are anchored in different temporal locations...|$|E

40|$|Generally it is {{believed}} that our diseases are mostly psycho-somatic. It implies that sometimes our psychic stress and strains lead to physical ailment(s) & sometime our physical ailments lead to mental/psychic sickness, stresses and strains. I incidentally passed through a similar situation & remained a victim of prolonged suffering. Still I am not fully recovered but I have somehow learnt to live with my disease sheerly on the basis of my will-power and spiritual reorientation. In this brief narration I have stated precisely the psycho-somatic conditions that I witnessed over the years. I have done it on my assumption that my readers may learn a new way to look at themselves & their ailments. My assumption is that our diseases may vary but the underlying mental & spiritual attitudes may remain the same & as objective and scientific as may be demanded of by any objective & dispassionate observer. Let me unfold my mental & spiritual states. You are, of course fully entitled to form your own opinion. It all started in early part of 2004, when I came back from Saudi Arabia after performing my one of the most cherished religious obligation, “hajj-tul-akbar”. Despite taking a complete rest of about one week, I felt tired and lazy most of the time. I also noticed that I had to make conscious efforts to walk properly because I felt lack of energy and coordination between the movements of my legs and arms. At times, I imagined myself walking awkwardly and stiffly with my arms hanging sideways instead of swinging alternatively along with legs. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> doctor about these feelings; however he consoled me with the assurance that perhaps these are only temporary consequences of fatigue due to hajj and Javed Iqbal Shah {{is a frequent contributor to}} the Journal...|$|E
