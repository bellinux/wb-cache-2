5|$|In the 1930s, Meher Baba began {{a period}} of {{extensive}} world travel, with several trips to Europe and the United States. It was during this period that he established contact with his first close group of Western disciples.

5|$|Although Æthelred {{had been}} Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers {{proved to be}} equally hostile to Eardwulf. In 798 a dux named Wada, {{who was one of}} those who had killed King Æthelred, fought with Eardwulf on Billington Moor, near Whalley, Lancashire. Wada was put to flight and may have gone into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. The {{evidence}} for Osbald's continued ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald is known to have become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> his ambitions.|$|E
5|$|When Octavian {{returned}} to Rome {{two years after}} defeating Mark Antony, no one remained to oppose him. Decades of war had taken a terrible toll on the People of Rome. The political situation was unstable, {{and there was a}} constant threat of renewed warfare. Octavian's arrival alone caused a wave of optimism to ripple throughout Italy. As soon as he arrived, he began addressing the problems that were plaguing Rome. Octavian's popularity soon reached new heights, which ultimately gave him the support he needed to implement his reforms. When Octavian deposed Mark Antony in 32 BC, he resigned his position as triumvir, but was probably vested with powers similar to those that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Pioneer Corps was disbanded on 1 October 1890, and {{the members}} of the company were offered a parcel of land to farm, which {{included}} mining rights. Pocock took up the option and acquired a farm in one of the richest farming areas just outside Salisbury.

25|$|Crawford {{maintained}} consistent batting form {{across his}} eight seasons with Leicestershire, although as the county usually played fewer matches than Surrey had done, he passed 1,000 {{runs in a}} season only in 1908 and 1909, after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> the secretaryship. His best year was 1908, when he made 1416 runs {{at an average of}} 32.93 and increased his highest score to 170 in an innings that took just 160 minutes and included 24 fours and four sixes against Hampshire. In 1909, he improved on that again with an innings of 172 not out against Surrey in which he made his runs out of 226 put on while he was at the wicket in just over three hours. He was less successful in 1910 and left first-class cricket {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|Duchamp's final major {{art work}} {{surprised}} {{the art world}} that believed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> art for chess 25 years earlier. Entitled Étant donnés: 1° la chute d'eau / 2° le gaz d'éclairage ("Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas"), it is a tableau, visible only through a peep hole in a wooden door. A nude woman can be seen lying on her back with her face hidden, legs spread, and one hand holding a gas lamp in the air against a landscape backdrop. Duchamp had worked secretly on the piece from 1946 to 1966 in his Greenwich Village studio while even his closest friends thought he had abandoned art. The torso of the nude figure is based on Duchamp's lover, the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins, {{with whom he had}} an affair from 1946 to 1951.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{testified that}} he then endured five days of {{derogatory}} comments about himself, his beliefs, his girlfriend and his pastor, and diatribes by Ross {{about the ways in}} which Christianity and conservative Protestantism were wrong. He was intimidated, forced to watch videos on cults and told his church was just the same. He said he was watched 24 hours a day. On every visit to the bathroom, he was accompanied by at least two men. Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving him a chance to say anything in return, often tapping him or hitting him on the head to underscore his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the deprogramming had been concluded successfully and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> his beliefs.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} billed as a marquee match-up {{between two of the}} best {{starting}} pitchers in Major League Baseball, Clayton Kershaw for the Dodgers and Max Scherzer for the Nationals, but neither starter was particularly sharp. with Nationals rookie Pedro Severino catching, Scherzer gave up a solo home run – the 32nd homer <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> in 2016 – to the second batter he faced, Dodgers rookie shortstop Corey Seager, on his sixth pitch of the game. In the third inning, after Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley drove in left fielder Andrew Toles with an RBI single, Scherzer gave up his 33rd home run of the year, a two-run shot to Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner, giving Los Angeles a 4–0 lead. The Dodgers did not score again; Scherzer did not allow another run before he left the game after six innings, and the Nationals bullpen also held them scoreless.|$|E
25|$|According to the Buddhist tradition, the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta is {{the first}} {{teaching}} given by the Buddha after he attained enlightenment. According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha attained enlightenment and liberation while meditating under the Bodhi Tree by the Nerañjarā river in Bodh Gaya. Afterwards, he remained silent for forty-nine days. The Buddha then journeyed from Bodhgaya to Sarnath, a small town near the sacred city of Varanasi in central India. There he met his five former companions, the ascetics {{with whom he had}} shared six years of hardship. His former companions were at first suspicious of the Buddha, thinking <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> his search for the truth when he renounced their ascetic ways. But upon seeing the radiance of the Buddha, they requested him to teach what he had learned. Thereupon the Buddha gave the teaching that was later recorded as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which introduces fundamental concepts of Buddhist thought, such as the Middle Way and the Four Noble Truths.|$|E
25|$|Octavian {{returned}} to Rome {{two years after}} defeating Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium. With Mark Antony's defeat, no one remained to oppose Octavian. Decades of war had taken a terrible toll on the People of Rome. The political situation was unstable, {{and there was a}} constant threat of renewed warfare. Octavian's arrival alone caused a wave of optimism to ripple throughout Italy. As soon as he arrived, he began addressing the problems that were plaguing Rome. He declared a general amnesty for the former supporters of his enemies, and provided land for over 120,000 former soldiers. As soon as these reforms had been implemented, the price of land began to rise and trade was revived. Octavian's popularity soon reached new heights, which ultimately gave him the support he needed to implement his reforms. When Octavian deposed Mark Antony in 32 BC, he resigned his position as triumvir, but was probably vested with powers similar to those that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up.</b> In 29 BC, another alteration was made to his legal status, of which we know very little. We know that it involved the granting to Octavian of Consular imperium (command authority), and thus control over the army and the provinces. This alteration probably also gave him the authority to take a census.|$|E
