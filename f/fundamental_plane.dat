2500|$|The {{economic}} strategy of General Velasco's government {{was shaped by}} a conception frequently advocated in Latin America but rarely put into practice. The idea {{was to find a}} [...] "third way" [...] between capitalism and socialism, with a corporatist society much more inclusionary than that possible under capitalism but without rejecting private ownership or adopting any of the compulsory methods identified with communism. Under this strategy, land reform was designed to override existing property interests in order to establish cooperative ownership, rejecting both individual private farming and state farms. Promoting worker participation in ownership and management was intended to reshape labor relations. Foreign influences were reduced through tight restrictions on foreign investment and nationalization of some of the largest foreign firms. On a more <b>fundamental</b> <b>plane,</b> the Velasco government saw its mission as one of eliminating class conflict and reconciling differences among interest groups within its own vision of a cooperative society.|$|E

By correlating the observed γ-ray luminosities L_γ with various cluster properties, we probe the origin of the high energy photons from these GCs. We report L_γ is positively correlated with the encounter rate Γ_c and the metalicity [Fe/H] which place an intimate link between the gamma-ray emission and the millisecond pulsar population. We also find a tendency that L_γ increase with the energy densities of the soft photon at the cluster location. Furthermore, the two-dimensional regression analysis suggests that L_γ, soft photon densities, and Γ_c/[Fe/H] possibly span <b>fundamental</b> <b>planes</b> which potentially provide better predictions for the γ-ray properties of GCs.

The surface brightness profiles of nine galaxies (≈ 26 per cent) show regions with blue UV-optical colours suggesting RSF. Five of these (≈ 15 per cent) show blue integrated UV-optical colours that set them aside in the NUV integrated colour-magnitude relation. These are objects with either exceptionally intense and localized NUV fluxes or blue UV-optical colours throughout. They also have other properties confirming they have had RSF, in particular Hβ absorption higher than expected for a quiescent population and a higher CO detection rate. This suggests that residual star formation is more common in early-type galaxies than we are used to believe. NUV blue galaxies are generally drawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion (σe < 200 km s- 1) and thus lower dynamical mass part of the sample.

40|$|Making use of HI 21 cm line {{measurements}} {{from the}} ALFALFA survey (alpha. 40) and photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and GALEX, we investigate the global scaling relations and <b>fundamental</b> <b>planes</b> linking stars and gas for {{a sample of}} 9417 common galaxies: the alpha. 40 -SDSS-GALEX sample. In addition to their HI properties derived from the ALFALFA dataset, stellar masses (M_*) and star formation rates (SFRs) are derived from fitting the UV-optical spectral energy distributions. 96 % of the alpha. 40 -SDSS-GALEX galaxies belong to the blue cloud, with the average gas fraction f_HI = M_HI/M_* ~ 1. 5. A transition in SF properties is found whereby below M_* ~ 10 ^ 9. 5 M_sun, {{the slope of the}} star forming sequence changes, the dispersion in the specific star formation rate (SSFR) distribution increases and the star formation efficiency (SFE) mildly increases with M_*. The evolutionary track in the SSFR-M_* diagram, as well as that in the color magnitude diagram are linked to the HI content; below this transition mass, the star formation is regulated strongly by the HI. Comparison of HI- and optically-selected samples over the same restricted volume shows that the HI-selected population is less evolved and has overall higher SFR and SSFR at a given stellar mass, but lower SFE and extinction, suggesting either that a bottleneck exists in the HI to H_ 2 conversion, or that the process of SF in the very HI-dominated galaxies obeys an unusual, low efficiency star formation law. A trend is found that, for a given stellar mass, high gas fraction galaxies reside preferentially in dark matter halos with high spin parameters. Because it represents a full census of HI-bearing galaxies at z~ 0, the scaling relations and <b>fundamental</b> <b>planes</b> derived for the ALFALFA population can be used to assess the HI detection rate by future blind HI surveys and intensity mapping experiments at higher redshift.

This allowed us to analyze the assembly patterns of the high mass end of the galaxy distribution at these high zs, by focusing on their structural and dynamical properties. Our simulations indicate that massive objects at high redshift already follow certain scaling relations. These relations define virial planes at the halo scale, whereas at the galactic scale they define intrinsic dynamical planes that are, however, tilted relative to the virial plane. Therefore, we predict that massive galaxies must lie on <b>fundamental</b> <b>planes</b> from their formation. We briefly discuss the physical origin of the tilt in terms the physical processes underlying massive galaxy formation at high z, {{in the context of}} a two-phase galaxy formation scenario.
