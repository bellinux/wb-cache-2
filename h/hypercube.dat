5|$|The {{analysis}} of Sudoku falls into two main areas: analyzing {{the properties of}} (1) completed grids and (2) puzzles. Also studied are computer algorithms to solve Sudokus, and to develop (or search for) new Sudokus. Analysis has largely focused on enumerating solutions, with results first appearing in 2004. There are many Sudoku variants, partially characterized by size (N), and the shape of their regions. Unless noted, discussion in this article assumes classic Sudoku, i.e. N=9 (a 9×9 grid and 3×3 regions). A rectangular Sudoku uses rectangular regions of row-column dimension R×C. Other variants include those with irregularly-shaped regions or with additional constraints (<b>hypercube)</b> or different constraint types (Samunamupure).|$|E

Characterizations of clique-graphs in terms of these intersection concepts when k> 0, are presented. Furthermore, we introduce the so-called maximal 2 -intersection graph of maximal <b>hypercubes</b> of a median graph G, denoted Qm 2 (G), whose vertices are maximal <b>hypercubes</b> of G, and two vertices are adjacent if the intersection of the corresponding <b>hypercubes</b> is not a proper subcube of some intersection of two maximal <b>hypercubes.</b> We show that a graph H is diamond-free if and only if there exists a median graph G such that H is isomorphic to Qm 2 (G).
