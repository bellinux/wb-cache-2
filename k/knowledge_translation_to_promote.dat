40|$|Abstract Background The {{implementation}} of evidence based clinical practice guidelines on self-management interventions {{to patients with}} chronic diseases is a complex process. A multifaceted strategy may offer an effective <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> (KT) intervention <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> <b>knowledge</b> uptake and improve adherence in an effective walking program based on the Ottawa Panel Evidence Based Clinical Practice Guidelines among individuals with moderate osteoarthritis (OA). Methods A single-blind, randomized control trial was conducted. Patients with mild to moderate (OA) of the knee (n= 222) were randomized {{to one of three}} KT groups: 1) Walking and Behavioural intervention (WB) (18 males, 57 females) which included the supervised community-based aerobic walking program combined with a behavioural intervention and an educational pamphlet on the benefits of walking for OA; 2) Walking intervention (W) (24 males, 57 females) wherein participants only received the supervised community-based aerobic walking program intervention and the educational pamphlet; 3) Self-directed control (C) (32 males, 52 females) wherein participants only received the educational pamphlet. One-way analyses of variance were used to test for differences in quality of life, adherence, confidence, and clinical outcomes among the study groups at each 3 month assessment during the 12 -month intervention period and 6 -month follow-up period. Results Short-term program adherence was greater in WB compared to C (p 0. 05) was observed for long-term adherence (6 to 12 months), and total adherence between the three groups. The three <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> strategies demonstrated equivalent long-term results for the {{implementation of}} a walking program for older individuals with moderate OA. Lower dropout rates as well as higher retention rates were observed for WB at 12 and 18 months. Conclusion The additional <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> behavioural component facilitated the implementation of clinical practice guidelines on walking over a short-term period. More studies are needed to improve the long-term walking adherence or longer guidelines uptake on walking among participants with OA. Particular attention should be taken into account related to patient’s characteristic and preference. OA can be managed through the implementation of a walking program based on clinical practice guidelines in existing community-based walking clubs as well as at home with the minimal support of an exercise therapist or a trained volunteer.

40|$|BACKGROUND: All {{sectors in}} health care {{are being asked to}} focus on the knowledge-to-practice gap, or <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation,</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} service effectiveness. A social interaction approach <b>to</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> assumes that research evidence becomes integrated with previously held knowledge, and practitioners build on and co-create knowledge through mutual interactions. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> strategies for public health have not provided anticipated positive changes in evidence-based practice, possibly due in part to a narrow conceptualization of knowledge. More work is needed to understand the role of tacit knowledge in decision-making and practice. This pilot study examined how health practitioners applied tacit knowledge in public health program planning and implementation. METHODS: This study used a narrative approach, where teams from two public health units in Ontario, Canada were conveniently selected. Respondents participated in individual interviews and focus groups at each site. Questions were designed to understand the role of tacit knowledge as it related to the program planning process. Data were analyzed through a combination of content analysis and thematic comparison. RESULTS: The findings highlighted two major aspects of knowledge that arose: the use of tacit knowledge and the integration of tacit and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge included: past experiences, organization-specific knowledge, community contextual knowledge, and the recognition of the tacit knowledge of others. Explicit knowledge included: research literature, the Internet, popular magazines, formal assessments (surveys and interviews), legislation and regulations. Participants sometimes deliberately combined tacit and explicit knowledge sources in planning. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot demonstrated that front-line public health workers draw upon both tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge in their everyday lived reality. Further, tacit knowledge {{plays an important role in}} practitioners 2 ̆ 7 interpretation and implementation of explicit research findings. This indicates a need to broaden the scope of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> <b>to</b> include other forms of knowledge beyond explicit knowledge acquired through research.

40|$|Abstract Background While {{there is}} a growing {{awareness}} of the importance of organizational context (or the work environment/setting) <b>to</b> successful <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation,</b> and successful <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> <b>to</b> better patient, provider (staff), and system outcomes, little empirical evidence supports these assumptions. Further, {{little is known about the}} factors that enhance <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> and better outcomes in residential long-term care facilities, where care has been shown to be suboptimal. The project described in this protocol is one of the two main projects of the larger five-year Translating Research in Elder Care (TREC) program. Aims The purpose of this project is to establish the magnitude of the effect of organizational context on <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation,</b> and subsequently on resident, staff (unregulated, regulated, and managerial) and system outcomes in long-term care facilities in the three Canadian Prairie Provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba). Methods/Design This study protocol describes the details of a multi-level – including provinces, regions, facilities, units within facilities, and individuals who receive care (residents) or work (staff) in facilities – and longitudinal (five-year) research project. A stratified random sample of 36 residential long-term care facilities (30 urban and 6 rural) from the Canadian Prairie Provinces will comprise the sample. Caregivers and care managers within these facilities will be asked to complete the TREC survey – a suite of survey instruments designed to assess organizational context and related factors hypothesized to be important <b>to</b> successful <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> and <b>to</b> achieving better resident, staff, and system outcomes.

40|$|Abstract Background Healthcare-associated infections affect 10 % of {{patients}} in Canadian acute-care hospitals and are significant and preventable causes {{of morbidity and mortality}} among hospitalized patients. Hand hygiene is among the simplest and most effective preventive measures to reduce these infections. However, compliance with hand hygiene among healthcare workers, specifically among physicians, is consistently suboptimal. We aim to first identify the barriers and enablers to physician hand hygiene compliance, and then to develop and pilot a theory-based <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> intervention <b>to</b> increase physicians’ compliance with best hand hygiene practice. Design The study consists of three phases. In Phase 1, we will identify barriers and enablers to hand hygiene compliance by physicians. This will include: key informant interviews with physicians and residents using a structured interview guide, informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework; nonparticipant observation of physician/resident hand hygiene audit sessions; and focus groups with hand hygiene experts. In Phase 2, we will conduct intervention mapping to develop a theory-based <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> intervention <b>to</b> improve physician hand hygiene compliance.

40|$|In {{the past}} few decades <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> has emerged as a common {{strategy}} intended to improve the effectiveness of health interventions and increase the utilization of research. Underlying the emergence of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> is a belief that new research findings will increase the efficiency of the present health care system, decrease the inequitable distribution of negative health outcomes, and improve the health of individuals. One growing population that faces increased risk of negative health outcomes in Canada, and Saskatoon, is street-involved youth. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to understand how the organizational context of a national surveillance study targeting street-involved youth, the Enhanced Street Youth Study, influences <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> activities in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

40|$|Abstract Background In some current {{healthcare}} settings, {{there is}} a noticeable absence of national institutions committed to the synthesis and use of evidence in healthcare decision- and policy-making. This absence creates a need to broaden the responsibilities of healthcare providers to include knowledge brokering and advocacy in order <b>to</b> optimize <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> <b>to</b> other stakeholders, especially policy-makers. However, this process requires practitioners and researchers to acquire certain types of knowledge and skills. This article introduces two innovative methods for capacity building in <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> (KT). Methods During a workshop aimed at preparing 21 trainers in evidence-based medicine, two innovative methods were used: (1) debate and (2) a <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> project (KTP). The main objective of the debates approach was to strengthen participants' critical thinking abilities by requiring them to search for and appraise evidence and defend their arguments. The KTP was used to introduce participants to the essential steps of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> and <b>to</b> suggest an extended role for healthcare practitioners, i. e., using evidence to manage not only individual patients but also to a community of patients. Participants' performances were assessed according to a pre-designed scheme. At {{the end of the}} workshop, participants' opinions and experiences with the innovative teaching methods were evaluated based on their answers to a questionnaire and the results of small-group discussions. Results The participants performed well in both the debate and KTP methods. During post-workshop group discussions, they indicated that the debate approach had added a new dimension to their evidence-based medicine skills by adding purpose and motivation. However, they felt that their performances would have been better if they had been offered practical demonstrations of how to conduct the debate. The participants indicated that the KTP enhanced their understanding of the relationships between evidence and implementation, and motivated them to investigate public health problems in addition to individual patient problems. However, some participants maintained that these issues fell outside the scope of their role as doctors. Conclusion Debates and evidence implementation through KTP are generally well accepted by healthcare practitioners as methods by which they can improve their skills in KT. </p...|$|R

40|$|Proven {{effective}} interventions {{exist that}} would enable all countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals. However, uptake and use of these interventions in the poorest populations is at least 50 % less than in the richest populations within each country. Also, we have recently shown that community effectiveness of interventions is lower for the poorest populations due to a "staircase" effect of lower coverage/access, worse diagnostic accuracy, less provider compliance and less consumer adherence. We propose an evidence-based framework for equity-oriented <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> <b>to</b> enhance community effectiveness and health equity. This framework is represented as a cascade of steps to assess and prioritize barriers and thus choose effective <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> interventions that are tailored for relevant audiences (public, patient, practitioner, policy-maker, press and private sector), {{as well as the}} evaluation, monitoring and sharing of these strategies.

We invite researchers and implementers to use the cascade for equity-oriented <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> as a guide when planning implementation strategies for proven effective interventions.

40|$|The {{development}} of a dynamic leadership coalition between practitioners and researchers/scientists – which is known in Canada as integrated <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> (KT) – can {{play a major role}} in bridging the know-do gap in the health care and public health sectors. In public health, and especially in globally oriented public health, integrated KT is a dynamic, interactive (collaborative), and nonlinear phenomenon that goes beyond a reductionist vision of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation,</b> <b>to</b> attain inter-, multi-, and even transdisciplinary status. Intimately embedded in its socioenvironmental context and closely connected with the complex interventions of multiple actors, the nonlinear process of integrated KT is based on a double principle: (1) the principle of transcendence of frontiers (sectorial, disciplinary, geographic, cultural, and cognitive), and (2) the principle of integration of knowledge beyond these frontiers. However, even though many authors agree on the overriding importance of integrated KT, there is as yet little understanding of the causal framework of integrated KT. Here, one can ask two general questions. Firstly, what “determines” integrated KT? Secondly, even if one wanted to apply a “transfrontier knowledge translation” vision, how should one go about doing so? For example, what would be the nature and qualities of a representative research program that applied a “transfrontier collaboration” approach? This paper focuses on the determinants of integrated KT within the burgeoning field of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> research (KT research). The paper is based on the results of a concurrent mixed method design which dealt with the complexity of building and sustaining effective coalitions and partnerships in the health care and public health sectors. The aims of this paper are: (1) to present an “integrated KT” conceptual framework which is global-context-sensitive, and (2) <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> the incorporation of a new “transfrontier knowledge translation” approach/vision designed primary for globally oriented public health researchers and health scientists...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the most}} {{consistent}} findings from clinical and health services research is the failure to translate research into practice and policy. As {{a result of these}} evidence-practice and policy gaps, patients fail to benefit optimally from advances in healthcare and are exposed to unnecessary risks of iatrogenic harms, and healthcare systems are exposed to unnecessary expenditure resulting in significant opportunity costs. Over the last decade, there has been increasing international policy and research attention on how to reduce the evidence-practice and policy gap. In this paper, we summarise the current concepts and evidence <b>to</b> guide <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> activities, defined as T 2 research (the translation of new clinical knowledge into improved health). We structure the article around five key questions: what should be transferred; to whom should research knowledge be transferred; by whom should research knowledge be transferred; how should research knowledge be transferred; and, with what effect should research knowledge be transferred? Discussion We suggest that the basic unit of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> should usually be up-to-date systematic reviews or other syntheses of research findings. Knowledge translators need to identify the key messages for different target audiences and to fashion these in language and <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> products that are easily assimilated by different audiences. The relative importance of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> <b>to</b> different target audiences will vary by the type of research and appropriate endpoints of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> may vary across different stakeholder groups. There are a large number of planned <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> models, derived from different disciplinary, contextual (i. e., setting), and target audience viewpoints. Most of these suggest that planned <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> for healthcare professionals and consumers {{is more likely to be}} successful if the choice of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> strategy is informed by an assessment of the likely barriers and facilitators. Although our evidence on the likely effectiveness of different strategies to overcome specific barriers remains incomplete, there is a range of informative systematic reviews of interventions aimed at healthcare professionals and consumers (i. e., patients, family members, and informal carers) and of factors important to research use by policy makers. Summary There is a substantial (if incomplete) evidence base to guide choice of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> activities targeting healthcare professionals and consumers. The evidence base on the effects of different <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> approaches targeting healthcare policy makers and senior managers is much weaker but there are a profusion of innovative approaches that warrant further evaluation. </p...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{emerging}} literature describing {{the use of}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> strategies <b>to</b> increase the relevance and usability of research, yet there are few real-world examples of how this works in practice. This case study reports on the steps taken <b>to</b> embed <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> strategies in the Movember Foundation's Men’s Mental Health Grant Rounds in 2013 – 14, which were implemented in Australia and Canada, and on the support provided to the applicants in developing their <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> plans. It identifies the challenges faced by the Men’s Mental Health Program Team and how these were resolved. The strategies explored include articulating <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> requirements, ensuring a common understanding of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation,</b> assessing <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> plans, methods of engaging end users, and building capacity with applicants. An iterative approach <b>to</b> facilitating <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> planning within project development was rolled out in Australia just prior to Canada so that lessons learned were immediately available to refine the second roll out. Implementation included the use of external <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> expertise, the development of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> plans, {{and the need for}} internal infrastructure to support monitoring and reporting. Differences in the Australian and Canadian contexts may point to differential exposure to the concepts and practices of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation.</b> This case study details an example of designing and implementing an integrated <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> strategy that moves beyond traditional dissemination models.

In public health, and especially in globally oriented public health, integrated KT is a dynamic, interactive (collaborative), and nonlinear phenomenon that goes beyond a reductionist vision of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation,</b> <b>to</b> attain inter-, multi-, and even transdisciplinary status. Intimately embedded in its socioenvironmental context and closely connected with the complex interventions of multiple actors, the nonlinear process of integrated KT is based on a double principle: (1) the principle of transcendence of frontiers (sectorial, disciplinary, geographic, cultural, and cognitive), and (2) the principle of integration of knowledge beyond these frontiers. However, even though many authors agree on the overriding importance of integrated KT, there is as yet little understanding of the causal framework of integrated KT. Here, one can ask two general questions. Firstly, what &ldquo;determines&rdquo; integrated KT? Secondly, even if one wanted to apply a &ldquo;transfrontier knowledge translation&rdquo; vision, how should one go about doing so? For example, what would be the nature and qualities of a representative research program that applied a &ldquo;transfrontier collaboration&rdquo; approach? This paper focuses on the determinants of integrated KT within the burgeoning field of <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> research (KT research). The paper is based on the results of a concurrent mixed method design which dealt with the complexity of building and sustaining effective coalitions and partnerships in the health care and public health sectors. The aims of this paper are: (1) to present an &ldquo;integrated KT&rdquo; conceptual framework which is global-context-sensitive, and (2) <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> the incorporation of a new &ldquo;transfrontier knowledge translation&rdquo; approach/vision designed primary for globally oriented public health researchers and health scientists.

40|$|The DOM 34 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is similar}} to genes found in diverse eukaryotes and archaebacteria. Analysis of dom 34 strains shows that {{progression}} through the G 1 phase of the cell cycle is delayed, mutant cells enter meiosis aberrantly, {{and their ability to}} form pseudohyphae is significantly diminisehd. RPS 30 A, which encodes ribosomal protein S 30, was identified in a screen for high-copy suppressors of the dom 34 delta growth defect. dom 34 delta mutants display an altered polyribosome profile that is rescued by expression of RPS 30 A. Taken together, these data indicate that Dom 34 p functions in protein <b>translation</b> <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> G 1 progression and differentiation. A Drosophila homolog of Dom 34 p, pelota, is required for the proper coordination of meiosis and spermatogenesis.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{shortage}} of transplantable organs {{is a global}} problem. There {{are two types of}} organ donation: living and deceased. Deceased organ donation can occur following neurological determination of death (NDD) or cardiocirculatory death. Donation after cardiocirculatory death (DCD) accounts for the largest increments in deceased organ donation worldwide. Variations in the use of DCD exist, however, within Canada and worldwide. Reasons for these discrepancies are largely unknown. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-based <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> intervention <b>to</b> provide practical guidance about how to increase the numbers of DCD organ donors without reducing the numbers of standard NDD donors. Methods We will use a mixed method three-step approach. In step one, we will conduct semi-structured interviews, informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, to identify and describe stakeholders’ beliefs and attitudes about DCD and their perceptions of the multi-level factors that influence DCD. We will identify: determinants of the evidence-practice gap; specific behavioural changes and/or process changes needed to increase DCD; specific group(s) of clinicians or organizations (e. g., provincial donor organizations) in need of behaviour change; and specific targets for interventions. In step two, using the principles of intervention mapping, we will develop a theory-based <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> intervention that encompasses behavior change techniques to overcome the identified barriers and enhance the enablers to DCD. In step three, we will roll out the intervention in hospitals across the 10 Canadian provinces and evaluate its effectiveness using a multiple interrupted time series design. Discussion We will adopt a behavioural approach to define and test novel, theory-based, and ethically-acceptable <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> strategies <b>to</b> increase the numbers of available DCD organ donors in Canada. If successful, this study will ultimately lead to more transplantations, reducing patient morbidity and mortality at a population-level...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} involves transdisciplinary, participatory {{research to}} identify strategies, approaches, tools, and resources that <b>promote</b> effective <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> related <b>to</b> {{health in the}} rural communities of Prince Edward Island (PEI). Partnerships established with six rural PEI communities enabled researchers to identify and evaluate effective <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> strategies. Interactive engagement of communities results in the most effective <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> (St Croix 2001) and forms {{the basis of this}} research project. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> has become a priority for many research organizations (Canadian Institute of Population Health 2002) because many decision makers have not used academic research findings in developing programs or policies (Barahamson 1996 & Mowday 1997). This gap is found in nearly all fields in which there are both practitioners and researchers. Preliminary findings from focus group interviews involving parents, youth and service providers from rural communities on PEI are presented as a means of addressing this gap. This research demonstrates that when rural communities are engaged in unique, participatory forms of relationship building and approaches that translate research results into meaningful information and programs, positive changes in a community?s attitudes and behaviours will result. This article describes how members of one rural community engaged with researchers and used knowledge gained from the results of research to established a youth centre for their children...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Evidence-based {{practice}} is pivotal to effective patient care. However, its translation into practice remains limited. Given {{the central role}} of primary care in many healthcare systems, it is important to identify strategies that bolster clinician-capacity <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> evidence-based care. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify strategies to increase Practice Nurse capacity <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> evidence-based sexual healthcare within general practice. Design/methodology/approach - A survey of 217 Practice Nurses in an Australian state and ten respondent-interviews regarding two resources <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> evidence-based sexual healthcare - namely, a clinical aide and online training. Findings - The perceived impact of both resources was determined by views on relevance and design - particularly for the clinical aide. Resource-use was influenced by role and responsibilities within the workplace, accessibility, and support from patients and colleagues. Research limitations/implications - This is the first Australian study to reveal strategies <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> evidence-based sexual healthcare among Practice Nurses. The findings provide a platform for future research on <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> processes, particularly among clinicians who might be disengaged from sexual healthcare. Practical implications - Given the benefits of evidence-based practices, it is important that managers recognize their role, and the role of their services, in promoting these. Without explicit support for evidence-based care and recognition of the Practice Nurse role in such care, <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> is likely <b>to</b> be limited. Originality/value - <b>Knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> among Practice Nurses can be facilitated by: resources-deemed informative, relevant, and user-friendly, as well as support from patients, colleagues, and their workplace...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to report a {{multifaceted}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> intervention <b>to</b> facilitate use of the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and innovation in nutritional care for patients at risk of malnutrition. Background: Malnutrition among hospitalized patients is a widespread problem leading to adverse health outcomes. Despite evidence of the benefits of malnutrition screening and recommendations for achieving good nutrition, shortfalls in practice continue. Design: A mixed method integrated <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> study. Methods: The <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> intervention comprised nutrition champions supported by <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> facilitators and an action planning process. Data collection was undertaken over 18 months between 2011 - 2012 in a hospital in England. Data comprised observation of mealtimes, audit of patient records, survey of nurses and semi-structured interviews with nutrition champions, <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> facilitators, senior ward nurses and nurse managers. Findings: Statistically significant relationships (Chi Square) were observed between self-reported confidence of nurses (a) to assess patients using the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, (b) to teach colleagues how to use the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and (c) to ensure that patients were assessed within 24 hours of admission. Ward-based nutrition champions facilitated successful innovation in nutrition support. Contextual factors operating at micro (ward), meso (organization) and macro (healthcare system) levels acted as barriers and enablers for change. Conclusion: Nutrition champions were successful in increasing the timely assessment of patients at risk of malnutrition and promoting innovation in nutritional care. Support from <b>knowledge</b> <b>translation</b> facilitators helped nutrition champions develop their role and work collaboratively with senior ward nurses to implement action plans for improving nutrition...|$|R
