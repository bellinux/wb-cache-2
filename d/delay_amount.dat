40|$|An adjusting-amount {{procedure}} {{was used to}} measure discounting of reinforcer value by delay. Eight rats chose between a varying amount of immediate water and a fixed amount of water given after a <b>delay.</b> The <b>amount</b> of immediate water was systematically adjusted {{as a function of the}} rats' previous choices. This {{procedure was}} used to determine the indifference point at which each rat chose the immediate <b>amount</b> and the <b>delayed</b> <b>amount</b> with equal frequency. The amount of immediate water at this indifference point was used to estimate the value of the <b>delayed</b> <b>amount</b> of water. In Experiment 1, the effects of daily changes in the delay to the fixed reinforcer (100 microliters of water delivered after 0, 2, 4, 8, or 16 s) were tested. Under these conditions, the rats reached indifference points within the first 30 trials of each 60 -trial session. In Experiment 2, the effects of water deprivation level on discounting of value by delay were assessed. Altering water deprivation level affected the speed of responding but did not affect delay discounting. In Experiment 3, the effects of varying the magnitude of the delayed water (100, 150, and 200 microliters) were tested. There was some tendency for the discounting function to be steeper for larger than for smaller reinforcers, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. In all three experiments, the obtained discount functions were well described by a hyperbolic function. These experiments demonstrate that the adjusting-amount procedure provides a useful tool for measuring the discounting of reinforcer value by delay...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For {{collecting}} data from all sensor nodes, {{some changes in}} Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol is proposed. At each hop level, route-ranking technique is used for distributing packets to different selected routes dynamically. For calculating rank of a route, different parameters like: delay, residual energy and probability of packet loss are used. A hybrid topology of DMPR(Disjoint Multi Path Routing) and MMPR(Meshed Multi Path Routing) is formed, where braided topology is used in different faulty zones of network. For reducing energy consumption, variant transmission ranges is used instead of fixed transmission range. For reducing number of packet drop, a fuzzy logic inference scheme is used to insert different types of delays dynamically. A rule based system infers membership function strength {{which is used to}} calculate the final <b>delay</b> <b>amount</b> to be inserted into each of the node at different clusters.

40|$|Abstract — A {{multiplier}} {{is one of}} the key hardware {{blocks in}} most digital and high performance systems such as FIR filters, digital signal processors and microprocessors etc [1]. The area and speed of the multiplier is an important issue, increment in speed results in large area consumption and vice versa. Performance of a system depends to a great extent on the performance of multiplier thus multipliers should be fast and consume less area and hardware. This idea forced us to study and review about the Booth’s Algorithm, modified Booth’s algorithm and its radix- 4 forms. Generally as we know multiplication goes in two basic steps, Partial product and then addition [4].

40|$|Speech {{technology}} {{has made it}} possible to use speech recognition for simultaneous subtitling of live television broadcasts via the technique of respeaking. Despite the considerable prior research into the quality of live subtitling using speech recognition, little research has focused on the quantitative aspects of subtitles. Although live subtitles are nearly always a reduced form of the spoken comments, the exact causes of text reduction are still largely unidentified. This study aims at {{a better understanding of the}} causes and consequences of text reduction in a live subtitling context. Three excerpts of an infotainment talk show were subtitled by twelve respeakers of the Flemish public television. They were instructed to do this in three different reduction conditions. Various subtitle features, such as reduction percentages and delay, as well as measures of the respeakers’ working memory were collected. Both a quantitative and qualitative analysis were carried out. In the quantitative analysis we opted for a multilevel analysis to take into account the hierarchical nature of the data. In the qualitative analysis, we discussed the effects of commonly used reduction strategies. The results show that reduction is not a random process. In contrast, it is largely determined by a number of external factors, viz. <b>delay,</b> <b>amount</b> of source text and the proportion of ‘full’ reductions. There is a large amount of evidence suggesting that respeakers prefer to omit certain comments rather than reducing them to a certain extent. It also appears that the decision to fully omit a comment seems not to be primarily based on the amount of input, while the decision to partially reduce is. Differences in the capacity of the working memory do not seem to affect text reduction as such. Finally, the qualitative analysis demonstrated that respeakers use a wide variety of strategies to reduce the spoken comments in order to limit the loss of information as much as possible.

After that we designed these recoders and PP generators and found out the time delays and area covered and power consumed by each scheme.

In the case of money, that heightened appetite enhances the perceived value of immediate monetary rewards.

That is, sexual cues make the temporal delay seem subjectively longer, resulting in greater impatience for monetary rewards. We attribute this process to the arousing nature of sexual cues, thus extending findings on arousal and overestimation of elapsed time to the domain of future time perception and intertemporal preferences...|$|R

40|$|Studies on the {{foraging}} {{choices are}} reviewed, {{with an emphasis}} on the neural representations of elementary factors of food (i. e., <b>amount,</b> <b>delay</b> and consumption time) in the avian brain. Domestic chicks serve as an ideal animal model in this respect, as they quickly associate cue colors with subsequently supplied food rewards, and their choices are quantitatively linked with the rewards. When a pair of such color cues was simultaneously presented, the trained chicks reliably made choices according to the profitability of food associated with each color. Two forebrain regions are involved in distinct aspects of choices; i. e., nucleus accumbens-medial striatum (Ac-MSt) and arcopallium intermedium (AI), an association area in the lateral forebrain. Localized lesions of Ac-MSt enhanced delay aversion, and the ablated chicks made impulsive choices of immediate reward more frequently than sham controls. On the other hand, lesions of AI enhanced consumption-time aversion, and the ablated chicks shifted their choices toward easily consumable reward with their impulsiveness unchanged; delay and consumption time are thus doubly dissociated. Furthermore, chicks showed distinct patterns of risk-sensitive choices depending on the factor that varied at trials. Risk aversion occurred when food amount varied, whereas consistent risk sensitivity was not found when the <b>delay</b> varied; <b>amount</b> and <b>delay</b> were not interchangeable. Choices are thus deviated from those predicted as optima.
