Clinically measured Cobb Angles from existing standing coronal radiographs and fulcrum bending radiographs [4] were compared to existing low-dose supine CT scans taken within 3 months of the reference radiograph. Reformatted coronal CT images were used to measure Cobb Angle variability with and without endplate pre-selection (end-plates selected on the radiographs used on the CT images). Inter and intra-observer measurement variability was assessed. Multi-linear regression was used to investigate whether there was a relationship between supine to standing Cobb Angle change and patient characteristics (SPSS, v. 21, IBM, USA).

40|$|Introduction : With the {{increase}} of sedentary style of life and ageing, quantifying the amount of movement during daily life becomes crucial. For monitoring daily life activities, inertial measurement units (IMU), a combination of miniature tri-axial angular rate and gravity sensors, are promising tool. To this purpose, different studies proposed to apply machine learning methods to the data provided by single or multiple sensors [1] attached to the various segments of the body [2]. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and test amethod to identify some of the daily life activities simply using a single IMU attached at the waist level on a body side. Materials and methods : Data were acquired using a single IMU (FreeSense, Sensorize ®) featuring a tri-axial accelerometer and two bi-axial gyroscopes (sampling frequency 50 Hz) placed at the waist level on the right body side. Training data set was acquired on ten subjects (four females, 31 ± 4 yrs) who performed the following dynamic activities: walking, walking up/down stairs, turning, sit-to-stand, and stand-to-sit. Static activities performed were: standing, sitting. The subjects were guided by an examiner, who identified the timing of each activity, throughout the 5 min long acquisitions. Ten acquisitions were made for each subject. The distinction between dynamic and static activities was accomplished with the method that was presented in a previous study [3]. Then, two different approaches were used for each activity type. Static activities were distinguished based on the relative angle with respect to the <b>gravitational</b> acceleration <b>direction.</b> For the dynamic activities a neural classifier was used. Distinguishing static and dynamic activities allows the neural classifier to focus on fewer types of activities aimed at increasing its accuracy. Multilayered feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) with the resilient backpropagation (RPROP) learning algorithm was used to train the neural classifier. The ANN presented two hidden layers and a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function was used as transfer function for each layers. The signal inspection is performed using a sliding window approach, with window size 128 samples (2. 56 s) and 64 samples (1. 28 s) overlapping between each consecutive window. For each window, features characterizing the signal were extracted from the IMU signals. The selected features were: (1) the mean value of the signal within the window interval, (2) the standard deviation of the window interval, (3) the energy content (sum of squared FFT component magnitudes divided by the window length), (4) correlation between signals in the interval of window. The correlation was useful for differentiating among activities in which most of the movement is along a sensing axis. For example, walking and running feature the largest displacement in one of the sensor directions, whereas stair climbing involves a displacement in a combination of two sensor directions. Effectiveness of these features was demonstrated in prior work [1, 2]. Thirty-three features for each window were extracted: six features (three for the acceleration and three for the angular velocities) for mean, standard deviation and energy and, fifteen features for correlation were calculated. 75...|$|R

40|$|The {{extinction}} of a diffusion flame is of fundamental interest in combustion science. Linan, Law, and Chung and Law analytically and experimentally determined an extinction boundary {{in terms of}} droplet diameter and pressure for a single droplet due to Damkohler, or blowoff, extinction. More recently, other researchers demonstrated extinction due to finite rate kinetics in reduced gravity for free droplets of heptane. Chao modeled the effect of radiative heat loss on a quasi-steady spherically symmetric single droplet burning {{in the absence of}} buoyancy. They determined that for increasing droplet diameter, a second limit can be reached such that combustion is no longer possible. This second, larger droplet diameter limit arises due to radiative heat loss, which increases with increasing droplet and flame diameter. This increase in radiative heat loss arises due to an increase in the surface area of the flame. Recently, Marchese modeled fuel droplets with detailed chemistry and radiative effects, and compared the results to other work. The modeling also showed the importance of radiative loss and radiative extinction Experiments examined the behavior of a large droplet of decane burning in reduced gravity onboard the NASA Lewis DC- 9 aircraft, but did not show a radiative extinction boundary due to g-jitter (Variations in <b>gravitational</b> level and <b>direction)</b> effects. Dietrich conducted experiments in the reduced gravity environment of the Space Shuttle. This work showed that the extinction diameter of methanol droplets increased when the initial diameter of the droplets was large (in this case, approximately 5 mm).

Non-linear interactions of tidal components are of paramount importance to the sediment transport, since they can give rise to a net, tide averaged, sediment flux. The tidal asymmetry depends on the sea-boundary conditions and the local generation of higher components. Depending on the bed status, an asymmetry in slack water periods or in combination with an asymmetry in peak velocity magnitude is of importance to net up-estuary sediment transport. Peak velocity asymmetry is flood-dominant throughout the estuary and increases in magnitude up-estuary. Slack water period asymmetry due to tidal components M 2 and M 4 shows a different result than analysis of low velocity magnitude. Thus it can be concluded that analysis of only components M 2 and M 4 is not sufficient to describe slack water period asymmetry in the Humber estuary. Slack water period analysis of low velocity magnitude reproduces a flood dominant asymmetry in the outer estuary and in the inner estuary. Tidal asymmetry in the inner estuary is primarily locally generated and therefore less sensitive to small changes in the M 4 sea-boundary condition. Horizontal density gradients can generate a vertical circulation in the system resulting in a net up-estuary sediment transport. Three factors can cause this gravitational circulation: salinity differences, temperature differences and differences in concentration of solid matter. During this sensitivity study the effect of gravitational circulation on net up-estuary fine sediment transport is limited to density gradients due to salinity. Integrating of the gross discharges and transport gives the net distribution of discharge and fine sediment transport. From this analysis follows that in longitudinal <b>direction</b> <b>gravitational</b> circulation results in a small increase in net up-estuary fine sediment transport. In the Humber estuary-channel, and especially -mouth, large longitudinal gross ebb (export) and flood (import) transports of fine sediments occur. If part of the sediments entering the system during flood is deposited in intertidal areas, a net import of fine sediments is the possible result. In the intertidal areas, bedshear stresses play an important role in the overall sediment import. The sensitivity of net up-estuary transport on channel-shoal interaction is analyzed by a change in bed roughness in the SE-processes. The main conclusion from this analysis is that, as bed roughness increases, a lower amount of fine sediments is net imported. Whereas, -with the exception of the areas Skeffling clays and Easington clays- the net transport in transversal direction increases for the rough bed-simulation. This process can be explained by a lower deposition in the deeper parts of the estuary, resulting in a higher amount of material that reaches the intertidal areas. Besides the three key processes that are focused on, several other processes can be of importance. The literature survey shows the high variability in conditions due to biological, chemical and seasonal processes. Knowledge of the influence of this variability on net fine sediment import and distribution can be improved by additional work that needs to be done. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

To grasp any object of unknown dimensions and weight by using an intelligent gripper safely the forces are to be calculated along the gripping direction and <b>gravitational</b> <b>direction,</b> and perform the force control with the measured forces. Thus, the intelligent gripper should be composed of six-axis gripper force sensor that measure forces f_x,f_y and f_z and M_x,M_y and M_zat the same time. In this paper, a six-axis gripper force sensor for measuring forces f_x,f_y and f_zand M_x,M_y and M_z simultaneously were newly modeled using 16 strain gauges. The structure of a six-axis wrist force/moment sensor was modeled for an intelligent hand in robot newly. And the sensing elements of it were designed by using FEM design system ANSYS. All along the way the stress points are found out where max. And min. stresses are applicable and the design of sensor is done so...|$|E
