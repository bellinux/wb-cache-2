30|$|The primary {{drawback}} to our high-precision STEM technique {{is the large}} dose resulting from {{the large amount of}} images required to get the increased SNR. This makes high-precision imaging either difficult or impossible for beam-sensitive materials. Four common methods to attempt to <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> dose usually have adverse effects on the image precision. First, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> pixel dwell time will <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> dose to the sample, but it will also <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> signal collected at each pixel and <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> SNR, possibly compromising the image precision. Second, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> probe current will <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> dose to the sample, but it will also have a similar effect as decreased dwell time. Third, increasing the pixel size by sampling the same area of the specimen with a coarser grid will <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> dose to the sample, but it will also <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> number of pixels per atomic column, possibly reducing the ability to locate the atomic column positions and compromising the image precision. Fourth, increasing the pixel size by <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> microscope’s image magnification while keeping the same number of pixels in <b>the</b> image will <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> dose to the sample, but it could have a similar effect as using fewer pixels. Here, we show that <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> electron dose by acquiring course-sampled HAADF STEM images can preserve high precision in locating atomic columns.|$|R

50|$|Another {{method of}} <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> skip zone is by <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> {{frequency}} of <b>the</b> radio waves. <b>Decreasing</b> <b>the</b> frequency {{is akin to}} increasing the ionospheric width.

5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California.

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed along {{the end of a}} quasi-stationary frontal trough.

After becoming a hurricane, Frances curved northeastward, and remained well east of Bermuda. By midday on October 24, Frances peaked as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane.|$|E

40|$|Casinos {{could help}} inhibit the {{development}} of pathological gambling by limiting the contributions they make to {{the development of}} pathology among gamblers. Reasonable strategies for limiting pathology might include limiting the size of jackpots, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> length of play, limiting access, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> rate of play, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> arousal of patrons, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> variability of games, and <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> inducements to play. These strategies could be employed in the domains of accessibility, environment, game structure, promotion|marketing, education and treatment. The author argues that the implementation of these strategies would not only inhibit the development of pathological gambling, but might also benefit the casinos and society. The suggested changes in casinos offers a focal point for further research and further dialogues between clinicians and casino operators. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
