5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E

40|$|Financial markets build {{regulated}} structures whose role is {{to provide}} market participants with continuous liquidity among others. By nature, they are composed of dependent elements, which have {{to conform to the}} prevailing regulation for stability prospects. Therefore, the financial flows resulting from such markets are mutually dependent to some extent. Here is the cornerstone underlying the seminal theory proposed by William Sharpe (1963, 1964) with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). A nonnegligible portion of <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices results then from the broad market trend, namely, the propensity of security prices to move together and at the same time. The complementary part or residual part of <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices depends consequently on the specific features peculiar to each <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> or, at least, to each <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> class a security can belong to. Of course, the residual part of asset prices is totally different and independent from the broad market trend.

Second, we clearly point out that a correct assessment {{of the relation between}} optimal monetary policy and either equity prices or exchange rates necessitates a model including both kinds of financial prices simultaneously. Third, we show how these interactions between <b>financial</b> <b>asset</b> prices and monetary policy are affected by a particular form of coordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy, arising from a public debt solvency constraint.
