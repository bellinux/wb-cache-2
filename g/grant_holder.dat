40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} {{the profile of}} dental researchers receiving grants related to their productivity in research from the Brazilian National Research and Development Council (CNPq). Data collection {{was carried out in}} March 2008, using the Brazilian database for curriculum vitae (Lattes Format). There were 144 researchers registered in the database and linked to 25 institutions. These researchers published a total of 12, 997 full-text articles, 6, 927 of which were published in the last 5 years. Category 1 <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> (n= 77) were responsible for 53. 5 % of this production; Category 2 <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> (n= 65) were responsible for 45. 1 %; Senior <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> (n= 2) were responsible for 1. 4 %. Regarding institutional affiliation, 90. 3 % of the research <b>grants</b> <b>holders</b> develop activities at public institutions and 9. 7 % develop activities in private institutions. Furthermore, 84. 0 % of the researchers are linked to institutions located in the southeast region of Brazil and 75. 0 % of the researchers perform their activities in the state of São Paulo. This study performed a mapping of the distribution of CNPq researchers, revealing a concentration in the southeast region of the country, especially in the state of São Paulo. The findings of the present study also demonstrate the important contribution of <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> to the scientific production in dentistry in Brazil...|$|R

40|$|In Portugal, {{since the}} end of the {{eighteen}} century, science professors at superior schools made scientific voyages through Europe. In 19 th century, the country possessed two Polytechnic Schools, at Lisbon and Oporto, and one University in Coimbra, already centenary (1290). In the firsts decades of 20 th century the Portuguese Governments tried to implement reforms at the superior education. In 1907 it ordered the establishment of grants to subsidize visits abroad, hoping to contribute to the development of the country. The superior schools were in charge of all the administrative process and they distributed the grants only among their scholars. Few professors had made those trips. Meanwhile, the republican movement appealed to the improvement of the country through progress and in 1911 they made a big reform on University. The professor’s visits abroad were also here but not many were undertaken. Besides the University or Coimbra there were created two new universities, at Lisbon and Oporto, based on the previous Polytechnical Schools. It was just after 1929 that we assist to the intensification of visits abroad, due to the work of Junta de Educação Nacional (JEN) [National Education Board]. JEN’s main objectives were to support, manage and promote the scientific research in Portugal. One of its main tasks was to provide grants to foreign countries. This was intended to comprehend all scholar population and not only to the university one. However, later on the majority of <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> was attached at a superior school as professor or professor assistant. In the period 1929 - 1938 (roughly JEN’s first decade) the grants to foreign countries were around 32 by year. England, France and Germany were the countries more frequently chosen. Furthermore, there were <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> going to Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Poland, Yugoslavia, Spain and United States. So, Portuguese <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> were visiting Central Europe, but also equally the western one. Grants to foreign countries covered a great scope of disciplines, from Astronomy to Zoologie and the preferred countries varied accordingly with those disciplines. The scientific activities developed by <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> varied accordingly with their objectives and the period of time to accomplish them, as agreed with JEN. Those activities could be of different types, as apprenticeships, stages, voyages, or just taking a quick look to surroundings, so the expression “visit” abroad has a vast range of meanings. At our work we are studying JEN’s activities related with the service of grants abroad. Based on JEN grant’s information, we can take <b>grant</b> <b>holders</b> as professors of superior schools and the expression “visiting” abroad would have a great scope directed to the activities developed during the grant period. Then, JEN’s study would highlight us about the “visit professor” phenomena.
