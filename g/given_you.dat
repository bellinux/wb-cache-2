500|$|The Gospels relate {{that on the}} eve of his Crucifixion, Jesus Christ ate a {{meal with}} his disciples.

[...] For I have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> an example, that ye should do as I have done unto you." [...] Mandatum is the derivation of the word [...] "Maundy", and the Royal Maundy service evolved from Jesus' command to his disciples.|$|E

[...] On reaching manhood, he left the Apache {{under the tutelage of}} Miles Freeman, a frontier scout. [...] Running Bear's parting words were 'The war clouds darken once more over the white man and the Indian nations... there is much need for warriors who talk peace to both sides! Freeman's words are that the great spirit has <b>given</b> <b>you</b> to us for such a mission'. He occasionally takes on other jobs such as army scout, mail delivery driver, and US Marshal.

500|$|The ministers {{intended}} to protect their orthodox doctrine and to examine Hutchinson's theological errors. [...] Ruling elder Thomas Leverett was charged with managing the examination. He called Mrs. Hutchinson and read the numerous errors with which she had been charged. [...] A nine-hour interrogation followed, in which the ministers delved into some weighty points of theology. [...] At {{the end of the}} session, only four of the many errors were covered, and Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering the admonition to his admirer. [...] He spoke, [...] "I would speake it to Gods Glory [...] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us... he hath <b>given</b> <b>you</b> a sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God." [...] The ministers overwhelmingly concluded that Hutchinson's unsound beliefs outweighed all the good which she had done, and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community.|$|E
500|$|By 1762, however, Johnson {{had gained}} notoriety for his dilatoriness in writing; the {{contemporary}} poet Churchill teased Johnson {{for the delay}} in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: [...] "He for subscribers baits his hook / and takes your cash, but where's the book?" [...] The comments soon motivated Johnson to finish his Shakespeare, and, after receiving the first payment from a government pension on 20 July 1762, {{he was able to}} dedicate most of his time towards this goal. Earlier that July, the 24-year-old King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of £300 in appreciation for the Dictionary. While the pension did not make Johnson wealthy, it did allow him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining 22 years of his life. The award came largely through the efforts of Sheridan and the Earl of Bute. When Johnson questioned if the pension would force him to promote a political agenda or support various officials, he was told by Bute that the pension [...] "is not <b>given</b> <b>you</b> for anything you are to do, but for what you have done".|$|E
500|$|During the 1890s, Elgar {{gradually}} {{built up}} {{a reputation as a}} composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the English Midlands. The Black Knight (1892) and King Olaf (1896), both inspired by Longfellow, The Light of Life (1896) and Caractacus (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in Novello and Co. Other works of this decade included the Serenade for Strings (1892) and Three Bavarian Dances (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career. Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was [...] "very sick at heart over music" [...] and hoped {{to find a way to}} succeed with a larger work. His friend August Jaeger tried to lift his spirits: [...] "A day's attack of the blues ... will not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has <b>given</b> <b>you.</b> Your time of universal recognition will come." ...|$|E

500|$|After the {{disaster}} at Sidi Barrani and the withdrawal from Egypt, Lieutenant General Annibale Bergonzoli's XXIII Corps faced the British {{from within the}} strong defences of Bardia. Mussolini wrote to Bergonzoli: [...] "I have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> a difficult task but one suited to your courage and experience as an old and intrepid soldier—the task of defending the fortress of Bardia to the last. I am certain that 'Electric Beard' and his brave soldiers will stand at whatever cost, faithful to the last." [...] Bergonzoli replied: [...] "I am aware of the honour and I have today repeated to my troops your message — simple and unequivocal. In Bardia we are and here we stay." [...] Bergonzoli had approximately 45,000 defenders under his command. The Italian divisions defending the perimeter of Bardia included remnants of four divisions. The northern ("Gerfah") sector was held by the 2nd [...] "28 October" [...] Blackshirt Division; the centre ("Ponticelli") sector by the 1st [...] "23 March" [...] Blackshirt Division and elements of the 62nd [...] "Marmarica" [...] Infantry Division; and the southern ("Mereiga") sector by the 63rd [...] "Cirene" [...] Infantry Division {{and the rest of}} the 62nd [...] "Marmarica" [...] Infantry Division. [...] Bergonzoli also had the remnants of the disbanded 64th [...] "Catanzaro" [...] Infantry Division, some 6,000 Frontier Guard (GaF) troops, three companies of Bersaglieri, part of the dismounted Vittorio Emanuele cavalry regiment, and a machine gun company of the 60th [...] "Sabratha" [...] Infantry Division.|$|E
500|$|Bani Khuraiza,^ as {{they had}} {{assisted}} the confederates, breaking their league with the Muslims. The Muslim army besieged them for fifteen days and nights and reduced them to distress. They came down at the order given them by Saad bin Maaz, who adjudged that the males should {{be put to the}} sword, the women and children made slaves, and their goods divided among the Muslims. The Prophet (the blessing and peace of God be on him !) addressing Saad, said, [...] "0 Saad Maaz—you have pronounced that which the Most High had ordered above the seven skies." [...] God refers to this event when He says that He brought them out of their fortresses {{as they had}} assisted the confederates and protected them. These were believers in the Old Testament, namely, Jews. God cast into their hearts terror of the Prophet and his army, and those who were killed numbered between seven and nine hundred, and their women and children were made slaves. You inherited their land, gardens, fields and houses, their fortified places, and their property consisting of money and cattle. All these were <b>given</b> <b>you</b> by God. And this saying likewise applies to the Kliaiber, to Turkey, or to Persia.
