50|$|ANS {{stands for}} {{automatic}} neutral shift at standstill by opening the <b>input</b> <b>clutch,</b> the converter is fully decoupled from the input shaft. As a result, the power flow between engine and transmission is automatically interrupted when the vehicle stand while the engine keeps running.The ANS function is automatically activated both at bus stops and stops at red traffic lights which reduces fuel consumption during these operating conditions.|$|E
50|$|During Starting, the proven DIWA {{power split}} {{principle}} comes into action. As {{soon as the}} vehicle begins to move, power is divided steplessly between the hydrodynamic and the mechanical transmission of torque. In 1st gear, the DIWA range, <b>input</b> <b>clutch</b> and turbine brake are closed. The engine torque is directly transmitted to the outer rim of the differential. The impeller and the pump shaft is driven in opposite rotary directions via the planetary gears of the differential. During this process, the output and hence the planetary carrier remain stationary.In the converter, oil delivered by the impeller flows through the guide wheel to the turbine wheel in a closed circuit. The torque that is delivered and converted, that is increased, is transmitted to the planetary carrier via the sun gear of the turbine gear. The planetary gear shaft transmits both the torque of the input differential, that is the purely mechanical share, and the torque of the turbine gear, that is the hydrodynamic share, directly to the transmission output.|$|E
50|$|From 2nd to 4th gear, in {{contrast}} to the 1st gear, power transmission in 2nd to 4th gear occurs purely mechanically. The transition from 1st gear into 2nd gear occurs automatically, independent on the driving speed and the driving peddle position. The hydrodynamic power transmission is switched off in 2nd gear. This occurs by the pump brake being closed, which stops the impeller. At the same time, the turbine wheel is not transmitting torque to the turbine gear due to the open turbine brake. The transmission ratio of the 2nd gear corresponds to the input differential.When changing from 2nd into 3rd gear, the <b>input</b> <b>clutch</b> opens and the lockup clutch, is shut. As a result, the drive shaft is, by the outer rim of the locked up clutch, directly connected with the planetary gear shaft, and thus the output shaft. The ratio is now 1:1.Depending on the position of the accelerator pedal, the vehicle load and the topography, the shift from 3rd to 4th gear occurs automatically. During this transition, the locked up clutch opens while the coupling for the 4th gear, the fast release coupling, closes.The 4th gear represents the overdrive gear, with the ratio of 0.7 or 0.73 depending on the differential.|$|E
50|$|Front-wheel and rear-wheel-drive {{transmissions}} operate similarly. When {{the transmission}} {{is put in}} neutral and the clutch is disengaged, the <b>input</b> shaft, <b>clutch</b> disk and countershaft can continue to rotate under their own inertia. In this state, the engine, the <b>input</b> shaft and <b>clutch,</b> and the output shaft all rotate independently.|$|R
5000|$|The 45RFE was {{introduced}} in the Jeep Grand Cherokee in 1999, it is notable for including three planetary gearsets rather than the two normally used in a 4-speed automatic. It also features three multiple disc <b>input</b> <b>clutches,</b> three multiple disc holding clutches, and a dual internal filter system (one primary filter for transmission sump, one for the fluid cooler return system). In the 45RFE applications four gears are utilized, with a different (1.50:1 rather than 1.67:1) second gear to increase versatility when downshifting. In 545RFE usage, an extra taller overdrive ratio is also used. Chrysler decided to refer to it as a [...] "multi-speed automatic".|$|R

40|$|The {{comfort of}} a car as {{perceived}} by the driver can be as important to its commercial success as its performance and fuel efficiency. Modern engines deliver increased torque {{and there is a}} current trend to reduce transmission-shaft stiffness, both phenomena militating against maintaining, let alone increasing, ride comfort. Dry Clutch Control for Automotive Applications analyses the control of a part of the powertrain which has a key role in ride comfort during standing-start and gear-shifting manoeuvres. The mechanical conception of the various elements in the driveline has long since been optimised so this book takes a more holistic system-oriented view of the problem featuring: * a comprehensive description of the driveline elements and their operation paying particular attention to the clutch; * a non-linear model of the driveline for simulation and a simplified model for control design, complete with a standing-start driver automaton for closed loop simulation; * a detailed analysis of the engagement operation and the related comfort criteria; * different control schemes aiming at meeting these criteria; * friction coefficient and unknown <b>input</b> <b>clutch</b> torque observers; * practical implementation issues and solutions based on the hands-on experience of implementing optimal engagement strategies on two Renault prototypes. Dry Clutch Control for Automotive Applications will be essential reading for automotive engineers working on model design and contains much to interest the academic researcher with its combination of theoretical results and application in the important and widely studied field of automotive engineering and control...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Clutch {{system is}} among the main systems inside a vehicle. Clutch is a {{mechanical}} device located between a vehicle engine and its transmission and provides mechanical coupling between the engine and transmission <b>input</b> shaft. <b>Clutch</b> system comprise of flywheel, clutch disc plate and friction material, pressure plate, clutch cover, diaphragm spring and the linkage necessary to operate the clutch. The clutch engages the transmission gradually by allowing {{a certain amount of}} slippage between the flywheel and the transmission input shaft. However, the slipping mechanism of the clutch generates heat energy due to friction between the clutch disc and the flywheel. At high sliding velocity, excessive frictional heat is generated which lead to high temperature rise at the clutch disc surface, and this causes thermo-mechanical problems such as thermal deformations and thermo-elastic instability which can lead to thermal cracking, wear and other mode of failure of the clutch disc component. In this project, the modeling of clutch is done in detailed using modeling software. After that the FEM analysis is done for sintered iron friction material. The stresses & deformation obtained for this friction material is then compared to analysis software result. The analysis is done for worn out friction disc.

50|$|Previously, {{motorcycles}} with a non-primary {{starting system}} used the transmission <b>input</b> shaft and <b>clutch</b> hub {{to connect the}} kick-start lever to crankshaft. It was thus necessary for the rider to first put the transmission into neutral, and then {{to engage the clutch}} before the starting the engine by pushing down on the kick-start lever. With its primary starting system, the YA-1 engine is equipped with a mechanism in which the primary driven gear is turned by means of a kick idling gear and kick pinion. This enables the rider to simply pull the clutch lever on the handlebar (i.e., disengage the clutch) and then to kick-start engine, regardless of whether the transmission is in neutral or in (any) gear. This mechanism is now the established kick start system for motorcycles worldwide.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{proof of concept}} of a variable stiffness actuator (VSA) that uses only one (high power) input motor. In general, VSAs use two (high power) motors {{to be able to}} control both the output position and the output stiffness, which possibly results in a heavy, and bulky system. In this work, two small and light-weight clutches are used to lock either one of the degrees of freedom, allowing the other to be controlled by the <b>input</b> motor. These <b>clutches</b> are realized by friction belts that can engage to a surrounding cylinder. The clutches are operated by solenoids, and small bistable mechanisms ensure that no electrical energy is lost in keeping a degree of freedom locked or unlocked.

50|$|The <b>input</b> of the <b>clutch</b> is {{connected}} to the engine crankshaft while the output may drive a shaft, chain, or belt. As engine revolutions per minute increase, weighted arms in the clutch swing outward and force the clutch to engage. The most common types have friction pads or shoes radially mounted that engage the inside of the rim of a housing. On the center shaft there are an assorted number of extension springs, which connect to a clutch shoe. When the central shaft spins fast enough, the springs extend causing the clutch shoes to engage the friction face. It can be compared to a drum brake in reverse. This type can be found on most home built karts, lawn and garden equipment, fuel-powered model cars and low power chainsaws. Another type used in racing karts has friction and clutch disks stacked together like a motorcycle clutch. The weighted arms force these disks together and engage the clutch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{synchronizer}} has {{to overcome}} {{the momentum of the}} entire <b>input</b> shaft and <b>clutch</b> disk when it is changing shaft rpm to match the new gear ratio. It can be abused by exposure to the momentum and power of the engine, which is what happens when attempts are made to select a gear without fully disengaging the clutch. This causes extra wear on the rings and sleeves, reducing their service life. When an experimenting driver tries to [...] "match the revs" [...] on a synchronized transmission and force it into gear without using the clutch, the synchronizer will make up for any discrepancy in RPM. The success in engaging the gear without clutching can deceive the driver into thinking that the RPM of the layshaft and transmission were actually exactly matched. Nevertheless, approximate rev. matching with clutching can decrease the difference in rotational speed between the layshaft and transmission gear shaft, therefore decreasing synchro wear.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the SAE Technical Papers and the definitive published version is available at [URL] are commonly utilised in passenger type and off-road heavy-duty vehicles to disconnect the engine from the driveline and other parasitic loads. In off-road heavy-duty vehicles, along with fuel efficiency start-up functionality at extended ambient conditions, such as low temperature and intake absolute pressure are crucial. Off-road vehicle manufacturers can overcome the parasitic loads in these conditions by oversizing the engine. Caterpillar Inc. as the pioneer in off-road technology has developed a novel clutch design to allow for engine downsizing while vehicle’s performance is not affected. The tribological behaviour of the clutch will be crucial to start engagement promptly and reach the maximum clutch capacity in the shortest possible time and smoothest way in terms of dynamics. A multi-body dynamics model of the clutch system is developed in MSC ADAMS. The flywheel is introducing the same speed and torque as the engine (represents the engine <b>input</b> to the <b>clutch).</b> The hydraulic pressure is applied behind the piston to initiate the engagement. The angular motion of the plates is supported by friction torque between the plates and friction linings. The conjunctions between paper-based linings and steel plates {{are designed to be}} dry. Friction (the most significant tribological feature of the linings in torque transmission) is measured in a pin-on-disc tribometer and mapped into the dynamics model in MSC ADAMS. The pin-on-disc tribometer is able to capture the variation of friction coefficient with contact pressure and sliding velocity. The surface topography is obtained experimentally to examine the consistency of surface properties. The normal pressure and tribology of the contacting components determines the engagement time, clutch capacity and dynamic behaviour of the clutch...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of {{driveline}} modelling. The modelling is done in MathModelica. Components from the free standard Modelica library have been used when appropriate. The remaining components have either been defined by mathematical equations only or by using mathematical equations together with standard components. The main work has been put into modeling and verifying the clutch, manual gearbox, final drive, shafts, brake and wheel. To this, models of engine, driver, chassis and air drag have been connected and simulated during different driving cycles. The vehicle model is moving in longitudinal motion. The results shows the expected behaviours, however since no measurements has been available {{it is hard to}} say how near the truth the model is, just that the qualitative behaviour is correct.
