The majority of this was spat out of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports</b> and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature. The same coarse-pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E

25|$|The {{reciprocating}} sleeve valves were open-ended, {{rather than}} sealing in a junk head. The open end uncovered the <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports</b> {{high in the}} cylinder wall {{at the bottom of}} the sleeves' stroke, leaving the ports cut into the sleeve to handle the incoming charge only. The sleeves had a stroke of 30% of the piston travel at 1.950 in (49.5mm) and operated 15 degrees in advance of the crankshaft. The Crecy sleeve valves were of similar construction but differed in their operation compared to the rotary sleeve valve design that was pioneered by Roy Fedden, and used successfully for the first time in an aircraft engine, the Bristol Perseus, in 1932.|$|E

2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports,</b> which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and thermal distortion problems of side intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports.</b> A scraper seal was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. The side port trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the side exhaust port Wankel engine are 35â€“50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine, because of near zero intake and exhaust port opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port. [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|E

5000|$|These {{conflicting}} {{requirements are}} reconciled by constructing the exhaust pipe with diverging and converging conical sections to create pressure wave reflections which travel {{back up the}} pipe and are presented at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port.</b> The <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> opens while there is still significant pressure in the cylinder, which drives the initial outflow of exhaust. As the pressure wave from the pulse of exhaust gas travels down the pipe, it encounters a diverging conical section; this causes a wave of negative pressure to be reflected back up the pipe, which arrives at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> {{towards the end of}} the exhaust phase, when the cylinder pressure has fallen to a low level, and helps to draw the remaining exhaust gas out of the cylinder. Further along the exhaust pipe, the exhaust pressure wave encounters a converging conical section, and this reflects a positive pressure wave back up the pipe. This wave is timed to arrive at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> after scavenging is completed, thereby [...] "plugging" [...] the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> to prevent spillage of fresh charge, and indeed may also push back into the cylinder any charge which has already spilled.|$|R

2500|$|Construction on K5054 {{started in}} December 1934, {{although}} several modifications {{were to be}} incorporated into the prototype as construction continued. The most obvious change was to the Merlin engine's cooling system, which was now to use pure ethylene glycol rather than water, and the incorporation of a ducted radiator designed using the results of research conducted by Frederick Meredith of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. At the time of her first flight on 5 March 1936, K5054 was unpainted and the undercarriage had no fairings fitted and was fixed down. The first engine was a prototype Merlin C engine of 990hp (738kW), with six flush-fitting <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports</b> each side, driving an Aero-Products [...] "Watts" [...] two-bladed, wooden fixed-pitch propeller.

2500|$|The 12A engine {{has a long}} thin shaped {{combustion}} chamber, {{having a}} large surface area in relation to its volume. Therefore, combustion is cool, giving few oxides of nitrogen. However, the combustion is also incomplete, so there are large amounts of partly burned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The exhaust is hot enough for combustion of these to continue into the exhaust. An engine driven pump supplies air into the exhaust to complete the burn of these chemicals. This {{is done in the}} [...] "thermal reactor" [...] chamber where the exhaust manifold would normally be on a conventional engine. Under certain conditions the pump injects air into the thermal reactor and at other times air is pumped through injectors into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports.</b> This fresh air is needed for more efficient and cleaner burning of the air/fuel mixture.|$|E

2500|$|A band mask is a {{heavy duty}} {{full-face}} mask {{with many of the}} characteristics of a lightweight demand helmet.

It is provided with a padded sealing surface around the frame edge which is held firmly against the diver's face by a rubber [...] "spider", a multiple strap arrangement with a pad behind the diver's head, and usually five straps which hook onto pins on the band. The straps have several holes so the tension can be adjusted to get a comfortable seal. A band mask is heavier than other full face masks, but lighter than a helmet, and can be donned more quickly than a helmet. They are often used by the standby diver for this reason.|$|E

2500|$|Mazda later {{abandoned}} the Wankel {{in most of}} their automotive designs, continuing to use the engine in their sports car range only, producing the RX-7 until August 2002. The company normally used two-rotor designs. A more advanced twin-turbo three-rotor engine was fitted in the 1991 Eunos Cosmo sports car. In 2003, Mazda introduced the Renesis engine fitted in the RX-8. The Renesis engine relocated the ports for exhaust from {{the periphery of the}} rotary housing to the sides, allowing for larger overall ports, better airflow, and further power gains. Some early Wankel engines had also side <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports,</b> the concept being abandoned because of carbon buildup in ports and the sides of the rotor. The Renesis engine solved the problem by using a keystone scraper side seal, and approached the thermal distortion difficulties by adding some parts made of ceramics.
