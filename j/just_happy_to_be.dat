5|$|During {{the latter}} part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a {{multi-media}} project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were <b>just</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse.|$|E
25|$|I'm <b>just</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here. I {{think being}} a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I {{want to give a}} little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

500|$|In October 2013, Delia {{is killed}} in a hit and run accident. Hendrickson {{felt that it was}} hard to have her {{on-screen}} daughter die, but she was pleased to have an [...] "emotional storyline" [...] that you can [...] "sink your teeth into", stating, [...] "I had been wanting [...] for a long time, which I really haven’t had since [...] got cancer. So I was <b>just</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of an emotional storyline that I was really excited to attempt and be challenged by as an actress." [...] Moments before her death Billy left Delia alone in his car to buy ice-cream, but after her puppy Dash ran away, Delia followed. Billy arrived to find Delia's barely alive body {{on the side of the}} road, and called the ambulance. Due to her rough medical history and weak immune system, Delia succumbed to her injuries and died after being rushed to the hospital. Chloe initially blames Billy for their daughter's death, with Hendrickson calling this her [...] "automatic response".|$|E
500|$|Liverpool midfielder Vladimír Šmicer {{was looking}} forward to playing a part in the final: [...] "Everyone wants to play in the final, I'm no different. I was <b>just</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the pitch against Auxerre because I didn't know even the day before whether I'd be fit enough after my injury problem. I'm still not 100% fit, I just wanted to train well this week and be fit for the final." [...] Šmicer was hopeful that victory in the final would rescue Liverpool's season: [...] "I hope that this re-ignites our season. Our season is not good, we know, but there is still plenty to play for. We have not said this is a bad season, let's forget about it and {{concentrate}} on the next one, we have been criticised and we are intent on responding on the pitch." [...] Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy was eager to win the match: [...] "Winning in Cardiff would be a massive result for us, we have to be honest, we haven't been as good as Manchester United over the last 10 years. And winning would bring European football next year, which isn't guaranteed at the moment." ...|$|E

5000|$|Japanese pirates (or Wokou) were a {{constant}} problem, {{not only for}} China and Korea, but also for Japanese society, from the thirteenth century until Hideyoshi's failed invasions of Korea {{at the end of}} the sixteenth century. Japanese pirates were often from the undesirable parts of Japanese society, and the Japanese <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> (for the most part) rid of them as they were raiding more prosperous shores (at the time, Japan was ravaged by civil wars, and so while Korea, China, and the Mongol Empire were enjoying relative peace, prosperity, and wealth, the Japanese were upon hard times).|$|R
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Nostalgia, Ultra, other artists took {{interest}} in Ocean and contacted him about working together, leading to collaborations on Channel Orange. He previewed songs {{at different stages of}} completion to get feedback from guest artists, some of whom he cited as his [...] "creative heroes", including record producer Pharrell, who co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Sweet Life" [...] with Ocean. Ocean and Malay previewed songs to rock musician John Mayer, which inspired his guitar playing for both [...] "Pyramids" [...] and [...] "White". For the latter track, they used the instrumental of the song of the same name from Odd Future's 2012 album The OF Tape Vol. 2, recorded atmospheric instrumentation by Mayer and other musicians, and tracked it to the original instrumental. Ocean reached out to rappers André 3000 and Big Boi of hip hop duo Outkast to appear on [...] "Pink Matter". However, André 3000 did not want to reunite with Big Boi as a duo on another artist's album. The former ended up rapping alone and playing guitar on the song. Ocean told him to tell any kind of story with his verse for [...] "Pink Matter", of which André 3000 later said, [...] "when I got the track, I just started writing to it and I was just, I'm <b>just</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of that whole movement and his whole movement because he has become a whole 'nother kind of icon in today's age." ...|$|E

2500|$|That {{was written}} {{around the time}} of the first record [...] I think that was the second thing Ed and I wrote together. It came out of a jam in the studio and Ed didn't really have any lyrics. He came up with some ideas right there on the spot, and that's what we recorded. For some reason, it didn't make it on Ten. I was kind of bummed at the time. I really wanted it to be on our first record. But at the time, I was really young and <b>just</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> around this situation, so I did whatever.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the later}} 1960s, Nikkatsu began losing its {{audience}} to TV, and its film production dropped. At this time, assistant directors {{moved on to}} TV or non-film work. In order {{to find a new}} audience, Nikkatsu president Takashi Itamochi made the decision to put the company's high production values and professional talent entirely into the [...] "pink-film" [...] (softcore pornographic) industry, which had until then been made by independent and low-budget filmmakers like Kōji Wakamatsu. Many of Nikkatsu's staff either did not return to the studio or left, not wanting to make sex films.

2500|$|In the 1985 NBA All-Star Game, Thomas {{was joined}} on the Eastern Conference squad by star rookie Michael Jordan. Jordan wound up {{attempting}} nine shots, relatively few for a starting player. Afterward, Thomas {{and his fellow}} veteran East players were accused of having planned to [...] "freeze out" [...] Jordan from their offense by not passing him the ball, supposedly out of spite over the attention Jordan was receiving. No player involved has ever confirmed that the freeze-out occurred, but the story has long been reported {{and has never been}} refuted by Jordan. Thomas has ridiculed the idea of him being the mastermind behind a supposed freeze-out as [...] "ludicrous", pointing out that he was a relatively young player on a team that included Larry Bird, Julius Erving and Moses Malone. During Michael Jordan's Hall of Fame induction, in which Thomas introduced John Stockton, who was also being inducted, Jordan dismissed the claims about a freeze-out having taken place, saying [...] "I was <b>just</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there, being the young guy surrounded by all these greats, I just wanted to prove myself and I hope that I did prove myself to you guys." ...|$|E

The taping goes awry as fans of the band stream into the sound stage and turn the event into a rock concert, much to the chagrin of Kubrick and President Richard Nixon, who is also on hand; the crowd might be discovering by being there, that the landings were fake or <b>just</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the concert.
