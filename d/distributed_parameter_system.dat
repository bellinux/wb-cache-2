40|$|Abstract: Using mobile {{sensors to}} perform optimal {{measurement}} and estimation of a <b>distributed</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>system</b> in a domain {{of interest is}} considered in this paper. Given parameters, how to optimally plan the motion trajectories of the mobile sensors has been known in the literature, where the purpose of mobile sensing is to best estimate the parameters. Clearly, there is a “chick-and-egg ” problem regarding the optimal mobile sensor motion planning and parameter estimation for distributed parameter systems. For the first time, this paper solved this problem by the proposed optimal interlaced mobile sensor motion planning and parameter estimation. The problem formulation is given in detail with a numerical solution for generating and refining the mobile sensor motion trajectories for parameter estimation of the <b>distributed</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>system.</b> The basic idea {{is to use the}} finite horizon type of scheme. First, the optimal trajectories are computed in a finite time horizon based on the assumed parameter values. For the following time horizon, the parameters of the <b>distributed</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>system</b> are estimated using the measured data in the previous time horizon, and the optimal trajectories are updated accordingly based on these estimated parameters obtained. Simulations are offered to illustrate the advantages of the proposed interlaced method over the non-interlaced techniques. We call the proposed scheme “on-line ” or “real-time ” which offers practical solutions to optimal measurement and estimation of a <b>distributed</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>system</b> when mobile sensors are used. 1.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{application}} of reduced models of a <b>distributed</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>system</b> for robust process control and state estimation. We take the approach of integrating model reduction, parameter identification, and model uncertainty analysis, in purpose to find an appropriate trade-off between complexity and robust performance. The application example is the temperature system in a continuous paper pulp digester. Physical modeling of this process results in coupled linearized partial differential equations which are then reduced into low-order nominal process models using an orthogonal collocation approximation method. Two different approaches to obtaining a model uncertainty description are adapted for use on a <b>distributed</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>system</b> with low-order nominal model and shown to produce similar results when tested with measurement data. It is also demonstrated how this uncertainty description, {{in combination with the}} reduced model, may be used for robust control design and verification of the control performance on the <b>distributed</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, the possibility of estimating the distributed process state using a state observer for the reduced process is demonstrated.
