5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the <b>hypolimnion.</b> Above the <b>hypolimnion</b> is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E
25|$|The {{stratification}} {{in a lake}} is {{not always}} the result of variation to density because of thermal gradients. Stratification within a lake can also be the result of differences in density resulting from gradients in salinity. In case of a difference in salinity, the <b>hypolimnion</b> and epilimnion are separated not by a thermocline but by a halocline, which is sometimes referred to as a chemocline.|$|E
25|$|F.A. Forel, {{who is also}} {{referred}} to as the father of limnology, was the first scientist to classify lakes according to their thermal stratification. His system of classification was later modified and improved upon by Hutchinson and Laffler. Because the density of water varies with temperature, with a maximum at +4 DC, thermal stratification is an important physical characteristic of lakes that controls the fauna and flora, sedimentation, chemistry, and other aspects of individual lakes. First, the colder, heavier water typically forms a layer near the bottom, which called the <b>hypolimnion.</b> Second, normally overlying it is a transition zone known as the metalimnion. Finally, overlying the metalimnion is a surface layer of a warmer, lighter water is called the epilimnion. However, this typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending either on the specific lake, the time of season, or combination of both.|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{trends of}} hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations, vertical distributions of dissolved oxygen were measured in eight deep tropical {{bodies of water}} (one natural lake with two basins, five natural lakes, and one reservoir) in Indonesia. A comparison of those concentrations with previously reported data revealed that shoaling of hypolimnetic oxygen-deficient (around a few decimeters to a few meter per year) water had occurred {{in all of the}} lakes. Calculated areal hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rates were 0. 046 – 5. 9 [*]g[*]m− 2 y− 1. The oligomictic or meromictic characteristics of the bodies of water suppressed circulation and mixing in the <b>hypolimnions</b> and thus resulted in continuous shoaling of the uppermost oxygen-deficient layers. In some lakes, millions of fish sometimes died suddenly, probably owing to upward movement of oxygen-deficient water to near the surface during periods of strong winds. In the future, the rate of shoaling will be accelerated by human impacts in the basins and by climate warming, the influence of which has already been manifested by rising water temperatures in these lakes. Appropriate monitoring and discussions of future restoration challenges are urgently needed to prevent the <b>hypolimnions</b> of the lakes from becoming completely anoxic...|$|R
5000|$|The {{relevance}} of [...] "dark" [...] (aphotic) abiotic transformations varies by pesticide. The presence of functional groups supports textbook predictions for some compounds. For example, aqueous abiotic hydrolysis degrades organophosphates, carboxylic acid esters, carbamates, carbonates, some halides (methyl bromide, propargyl) and many more. Other pesticides are less amenable. Conditions {{such as high}} pH or low-redox environments combined with in situ catalyst formation including (poly)sulfides, surface-bound Fe(II) or [...] Microorganisms often mediate the latter, blurring the boundary between abiotic and biotic transformations.

40|$|The {{vertical}} {{distributions of}} dissolved H,, CO, and CH, and bacterial production (thymidine incor-poration) were measured throughout 1987 in Lake Constance (Bodensee) {{and again in}} 1988 at a station in a small bight in the lake. Lake waters were supersaturated with respect o atmospheric H,, CO, and CH 4, especially in the epilimnion; concentrations inthe surface water showed a significant (P < 0. 05) positive correlation with either autotrophic picoplankton, primary production, Chl a, pheophytin, or bacterial production. Dissolved H, and CO did not exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, but dissolved CH, regularly increased uring stratification and decreased in winter. Vertical profiles showed that surface maxima of CH, were not due to diffusion from methanogenic profundal sediment. Lateral transects and epilimnetic mass balance indicated that CH, may have originated from methanogenic littoral sediments along the shoreline and {{may also have been}} produced in oxic epilimnetic water by unknown processes. The water samples contained microbes able to oxidize HZ, CO, and CH 4, but threshold concentrations required to sustain oxidation usually were higher than actual in situ concentrations ofthese gases. We therefore inferred that epilimnetic production of the gases was balanced by evasion to the atmosphere. With the stagnant film model, we determined that the mean residence times of the gases in the epilimniom were on the-order of 2 - 16 d. Hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane are reduced trace gases formed by anaerobic bacteria living in anoxic zones of aquatic en-vironments. In contrast to the oceans, H 2 and CO have been little studied in freshwater lakes (Conrad et al. 1983 a,b; Dahm et al. 1983; Schiitz et al. 1988), and studies on CH, have concentrated on anoxic <b>hypolimnions</b> and an-oxic-oxic interfaces ofwater columns (Rudd and Taylor 1980). The concentrations, origin, and turnover of these trace gases in the oxic epilimnia of lakes are largely unknown. Our laboratory has reported supersaturatio...|$|R
2500|$|Based upon thermal stratification, lakes are {{classified}} as either holomictic lakes or meromictic lakes. A meromictic lake is a lake which has layers of water which do not intermix. The deepest layer of water in such a lake does not contain any dissolved oxygen. In addition, the [...] layers of sediment {{at the bottom of}} a meromictic lake remain relatively undisturbed because there are no living aerobic organisms. The lack of disturbance allows for the development of lacustrine varves. A Holomictic lake is a lake that has a uniform temperature and density from top to bottom at a specific time during the year. This uniformity temperature and density in allows the lake waters to completely mix. Holomictic lakes are non-meromictic lakes. Based upon thermal stratification and frequency of turnover, holomictic lakes are divided into amictic lakes, cold monomictic lakes, dimictic lakes, warm monomictic lakes, polymictic lakes, and oligomictic lakes. The classification of lakes by thermal stratification presupposes lakes with sufficient depth to form a <b>hypolimnion.</b> As a results, very shallow lakes are excluded this classification system.|$|E
2500|$|Temperature {{regimes are}} very {{different}} in large lakes (Fig. 2). [...] In temperate regions, for example, as air temperatures increase, the icy layer formed {{on the surface of}} the lake breaks up, leaving the water at approximately 4°C. [...] This is the temperature at which water has the highest density. [...] As the season progresses, the warmer air temperatures heat the surface waters, making them less dense. [...] The deeper waters remain cool and dense due to reduced light penetration. [...] As the summer begins, two distinct layers become established, with such a large temperature difference between them that they remain stratified. [...] The lowest zone in the lake is the coldest and is called the <b>hypolimnion.</b> [...] The upper warm zone is called the epilimnion. [...] Between these zones is a band of rapid temperature change called the thermocline. [...] During the colder fall season, heat is lost at the surface and the epilimnion cools. [...] When the temperatures of the two zones are close enough, the waters begin to mix again to create a uniform temperature, an event termed lake turnover. [...] In the winter, inverse stratification occurs as water near the surface cools freezes, while warmer, but denser water remains near the bottom. [...] A thermocline is established, and the cycle repeats.|$|E
