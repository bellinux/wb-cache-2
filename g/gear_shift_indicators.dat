40|$|The {{manner of}} gear {{shifting}} {{is one of}} the main factors affecting the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles. Potential savings resulted from optimized gear shifting led to introduction of <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>indicators</b> in passenger vehicles as an obligation from year 2012. The effects of <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>indicators</b> usage are still not studied enough. That was the motive for the authors to conduct the experiments to justify their usage, both from the economic and ecological standpoint. The presented results come from the tests conducted on FIAT 500 L vehicle to determine the fuel consumption using the new European driving cycle, but for three different gear shift patterns: (1) as defined in UNECE Regulation No. 83, (2) as indicated by vehicle’s gear shift indicator, and (3) based on the average vehicle speed values collected from <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>indicators</b> of 35 passenger vehicles of different makes, types, and characteristics. Maximum difference in fuel consumption recorded in tests done using three different gear shift patterns is 18. 7 %...|$|E
40|$|European {{regulations}} set {{the emissions}} requirements for new vehicles at 130 g CO 2 /km, {{with an additional}} 10 g CO 2 /km to be achieved by additional complementary measures, including <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>indicators.</b> However, there is presently little knowledge of how much fuel or CO 2 could actually be saved {{by the introduction of}} <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>indicators,</b> and there is no consensus on how these savings should be quantified. This study presents a procedure which allows these savings to be quantified over a New European Driving Cycle, and explores the trade-off between fuel savings and drivability. A vehicle model was established and calibrated using data obtained from pedal ramp tests conducted at steady speed using a chassis dynamometer, significantly reducing the time required to generate a calibration data set when compared with a steady-state mapping approach. This model was used for the optimisation of gear shift points on the New European Driving Cycle for reduced fuel consumption subject to drivability constraints. During model validation the greatest fuel saving achieved experimentally for a warm engine was 3. 6 % over the New European Driving Cycle, within the constraints imposed using subjective driver appraisal of vehicle drivability. The same shift strategy for a cold start driving cycle showed a fuel saving of 4. 3 % over the baseline, with corresponding savings in CO 2 of 4. 5 % or 6. 4 g CO 2 /km. For both hot and cold tests the savings were made entirely in the urban phase of the New European Driving Cycle; {{there were no significant differences}} in fuel consumption in the extra-urban phase. These results suggest that the introduction of <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>indicators</b> could have a substantial impact, contributing significantly towards the 10 g CO 2 /km to be achieved by additional complementary measures when assessed in this way. It is not clear whether these savings would translate into real world driving conditions, but for legislative purposes an assessment procedure based on the New European Driving Cycle remains a logical choice for simplicity and continuity...|$|E

40|$|Environmentally {{friendly}} driving – or eco-driving – {{refers to}} the driving of a vehicle {{in a way that}} conserves fuel and reduces emissions. Large fuel savings are possible by targeting the role of driver behaviour in the protection of the environment, and teaching them how to ‘eco-drive’. This study forms part of the ecoDriver project, which aims to develop an in-vehicle eco-driving support system. While many current systems offer after-trip feedback on the fuel efficiency of driving or simple in-trip recommendations (e. g. <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> <b>indicators),</b> this study investigates a number of systems that provide real-time, feed-forward guidance on how to alter accelerator usage in the upcoming moments to minimise fuel consumption. A driving simulator was used to test three potential eco-driving interfaces which used a common eco-driving guidance algorithm. Two systems used a haptic accelerator pedal, while one presented multi-modal visual and auditory information. Objective eco-driving performance was measured as the error between desired accelerator position defined by the system and accelerator position selected by the driver. Subjective feedback on workload and acceptability of the system was analysed and driver visual distraction was monitored throughout. This study informs on the most effective and acceptable presentation methods for real-time in-vehicle guidance on eco-driving...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper outlines a computationally efficient analytical method to evaluate fuel consumption and NOx emissions during manoeuvres pertaining to the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC). An integrated optimisation procedure is {{also included in the}} analysis to minimise the Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and NOx emissions as objective functions. A set of optimum gear ratios are determined for 4, 5 and 6 -speed transmission systems as the governing parameters in the optimisation process. The analysis highlights the determination of <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> strategies, based on the minimisation of either of these declared objective functions. A 7. 5 % reduction in the BSFC and 6. 75 % in NOx are attainable in the best case scenario for a 6 -speed transmission and a <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> strategy, based on the least BSFC for the case of the chosen engine. The novel integrated analytical simulation and multi-objective optimisation has not hitherto been reported in literature. It provides the opportunity for objective intelligent-based approach to the use of <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>indicator</b> technology.

40|$|Driver {{behaviour}} can strongly affect fuel consumption, {{and driver}} training in eco-driving techniques {{has been shown}} to reduce fuel consumption by 10 % on average. However the effects of this training can be short-lived, so there is an apparent need for continuous monitoring of driver behaviour. This study presents a driver advisory tool which encourages eco-driving, and its evaluation in the field. The system, developed by Ashwoods Automotive Ltd (UK) and the University of Bath (UK), is aimed at fleet operators of light commercial vehicles, where the driver is typically a company employee. A significant strength of the system is that it has been designed for easy integration with the vehicle CAN-bus, reducing complexity and cost. By considering the Inertial Power Surrogate (speed times acceleration) the core algorithm is able to identify behaviour which is likely to increase fuel consumption. The algorithm also enforces the advice of the <b>Gear</b> <b>Shift</b> <b>Indicator</b> to encourage earlier upshifting. Fuel saving is therefore encouraged both by reducing the power demand of the drive cycle and by operating the engine in a more efficient region. Instantaneous visual feedback to the driver is augmented by audible warnings, which avoids the need for the driver to concentrate on the display, reducing cognitive loading. Reports on driver performance are made available to the fleet manager so that fuel efficient and safe driving can be encouraged. Trials of the system ran for four weeks and included 15 vehicles from 7 companies; a total of 39 300 km of trip data were collected during more than 1 100 hours of real world driving. Results show an average fleet reduction in fuel consumption of 7. 6 %, with some vans showing savings up to 12 %. Furthermore, reductions of over 10 % in both average engine speed and throttle activation were observed. It was also noted that the system shows strong potential for synergetic use with a hybrid electric powertrain, where modifying driver behaviour may facilitate energy harvesting from regenerative braking...|$|R

40|$|Currently, most hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) equipped with automated mechanical transmission (AMT) are implemented with the conventional two-parameter <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule based on engineering experience.

The question is whether older drivers show a better driving performance when using automatic <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> instead of manual <b>gear</b> <b>shifting.</b> Twenty young and twenty older drivers participated in a driving simulator study. Each participant drove both in the manual and the automatic gear conditions. Young drivers reported significantly higher risk taking behaviour in traffic than the older drivers. The older drivers experienced more collisions in the driving simulator than the young participants, but this was only true in the manual gear condition. Older participants swerved more than young participants in both gear conditions. Altogether, the driving performance of the older drivers was better in the automatic gear condition compared with the manual gear condition.
