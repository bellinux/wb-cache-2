40|$|This paper {{presents}} an accurate and robust geometric and material nonlinear formulation to predict structural behaviour of unprotected steel members at elevated temperatures. A fire analysis including large displacement effects for frame structures is presented. This finite element formulation of beam-column elements {{is based on}} the plastic hinge approach to model the elasto-plastic strain- hardening material behaviour. The Newton-Raphson method allowing for the thermal-time dependent effect was employed for the solution of the nonlinear governing equations for large deflection in thermal history. A combined incremental and total formulation for <b>determining</b> <b>member</b> resistance is employed in this nonlinear solution procedure for the efficient modeling of nonlinear effects. Degradation of material strength with increasing temperature is simulated by a set of temperature-stress-strain curves according to both ECCS and BS 5950 Part 8, which implicitly allows for creep deformation. The effects of uniform or non-uniform temperature distribution over the section of the structural steel member are also considered. Several numerical and experimental verifications are presented.

40|$|Recent timber trussed roof {{failures}} in South Africa, especially in Gauteng, of large-span trusses have necessitated a rethink about {{the analysis of}} timber trusses in general, but especially primary girder trusses, which support major loads from secondary trusses. The {{failures in}}clude roofs that collapsed (these having {{been reported in the}} press) to roofs where the bottom chord of multiple-ply girder trusses had rotated {{to such an extent that}} nail plates on the outer ply failed. These roofs were repaired before collapse could occur. Some of these failures are still under investigation and to divulge their location would be inappropriate. The author has identified eccentric loading as one of the possible reasons for some of the failures. In this paper he investigates all the possible factors that may influence the strength and stiffness of the trusses and he uses these to analyse three different span of girder truss. The author shows that by ignoring the eccentric loading the plate force may be underestimated by a factor in excess of 5. He shows a simple way of <b>determining</b> <b>member</b> and plate forces and suggests that these should be used when girder trusses are designed. This may then reduce the number of failures and should lead to timber roof structures that are more robust and more capable of accommodating erection errors...|$|E

In Romania, the crystallization {{of this type of}} association is driven by the dynamics and increasing flexibility of the business environment, the impulse from abroad and the opportunity to access European funds to finance such projects. The innovative cluster concept approach is based on the “four leaf clover” model, consisting of a partnership between four categories of stakeholders: the business, the academic and research institution, the public authority and the organizations’ catalyst, in a relationship of mutual interaction. Clusters are groups of independent companies (start-ups, small, medium and large enterprises and research organizations) acting in a specific area, in order to stimulate innovative activity by promoting intensive interactions, the use of common facilities, exchanges of experience and knowledge and by contributing to technology transfer, networking and information dissemination among the cluster's enterprises. Against the background of a global financial crisis and intense competition to conquer new markets, in this paper we show how firms can gain a competitive advantage by participating in an innovative cluster that bestows important benefits upon its members. Innovative clusters are most likely to provide a new type of economy based on innovation, by means of producing dense knowledge flows for strengthening entrepreneurship by stimulating the formation of new businesses, thereby influencing the regional economic performance. By enhancing competitiveness, stimulating innovation and generating entrepreneurial initiatives in order to rejuvenate and diversify businesses, the clusters are acting as local development tools...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background High-throughput {{methods for}} {{detecting}} protein-protein interactions {{enable us to}} obtain large interaction networks, and also allow us to computationally identify the associations of proteins as protein complexes. Although there are methods to extract protein complexes as sets of proteins from interaction networks, the extracted complexes may include false positives {{because they do not}} account for the structural limitations of the proteins and thus do not check that the proteins in the extracted complex can simultaneously bind to each other. In addition, there have been few searches for deeper insights into the protein complexes, such as of the topology of the protein-protein interactions or into the domain-domain interactions that mediate the protein interactions. Results Here, we introduce a combinatorial approach for prediction of protein complexes focusing not only on <b>determining</b> <b>member</b> proteins in complexes but also on the DDI/PPI organization of the complexes. Our method analyzes complex candidates predicted by the existing methods. It searches for optimal combinations of domain-domain interactions in the candidates based on an assumption that the proteins in a candidate can form a true protein complex if each of the domains is used by a single protein interaction. This optimization problem was mathematically formulated and solved using binary integer linear programming. By using publicly available sets of yeast protein-protein interactions and domain-domain interactions, we succeeded in extracting protein complex candidates with an accuracy that is twice the average accuracy of the existing methods, MCL, MCODE, or clustering coefficient. Although the configuring parameters for each algorithm resulted in slightly improved precisions, our method always showed better precision for most values of the parameters. Conclusions Our combinatorial approach can provide better accuracy for prediction of protein complexes and also enables to identify both direct PPIs and DDIs that mediate them in complexes. </p...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 44 - 46). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The objective of this thesis is to determine fatigue stresses in the stringer to floor beam connections of through plate girder (TPG) and through truss (TT) bridges in order to predict failure. Field observations by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) indicate failure in the stringer to floor beam connections of both the TPG and TT bridges, although a higher frequency of failure appears in the TT bridges. Accordingly, this study includes 1) creating analytical models for the TPG and TT bridges, 2) <b>determining</b> <b>member</b> internal forces, 3) developing force envelopes, 4) determining maximum internal stresses, and 5) comparing these results to field observations. First, bridge models for the TPG and TT bridge were assembled using a finite element analysis program in order to evaluate member internal forces. The TPG bridge model was taken from the plans of an existing bridge designed in 1912 and located near TX Highway 21 between College Station and Caldwell, TX. The TT bridge model was taken from the plans of an existing bridge designed in 1902 in the Chicago Office of the American Bridge Company. Next, a finite element analysis was conducted to obtain member internal forces. The resulting forces were compiled to create axial load, shear force, and moment envelopes. These envelopes were constructed to provide the magnitudes and location of the maximum forces required for analysis. These forces were also used to develop maximum tensile stresses for the rivets in the floor beams. After examining the results, the following conclusions were drawn. Axial load was predicted {{to be a source of}} higher failure frequency within TT bridges versus TPG bridges. Lower chord deformation in the TT bridge caused elongation of the floor system that, in turn, produced axial loads in the bridge members. The TPG bridge members, however, carried no axial load. Shear force was not predicted to be a contributing factor for increased connection failure rates in the TT bridges as compared to the TPG bridges, but bending moment was. This result, however, was sensitive to the degree of fixity in the stringer to floor beam connection...|$|E

40|$|Situated as the {{cornerstone}} of the Common European Asylum System, the EU’s Dublin system functions as the legal mechanism for <b>determining</b> <b>Member</b> State responsibility for the processing of asylum claims. Controversial from inception, it has been subject to extensive criticism that speaks not only to the distributional inequalities that it produces among the Member States, but also to its potentially detrimental impact on the human rights of asylum seekers. Despite these problems, however, the core features of the system as originally agreed in the 1990 Dublin Convention have remained remarkably resilient over the course of two reforms – one in 2003, and one in 2013. At the same time, the EU’s governance landscape as it pertains to asylum policy-making has undergone a marked transformation. While Dublin I was the product of intergovernmentalism, both Dublin II and Dublin III were negotiated as part of the EU acquis communitaire, the former following the partial communitarisation of asylum policy-making and the latter following its full communitarisation. Though the specific changes to the institutional features of policymaking that this transition has entailed have been both theoretically expected and empirically proven to {{have a positive effect on}} EU policy output, the overall stability of the Dublin system in the face of these changes leaves it unclear as to what extent the ‘promise of communitarisation’ has been delivered in this particular case. How then do we explain the perseverance of a system that has not only failed to provide adequate standards of protection to those seeking it within EU borders, but which has also continually disadvantaged some of the very Member States party to its terms? And what impact, if any, has the communitarisation of asylum policy-making had on the attempts at its reform? This research traces the evolution of the Dublin system from its initial formation through to its current state, by analysing the negotiations that produced each of the three Dublin agreements in order to explain both the system’s emergence and its on-going stability. Using a rational choice institutionalist framework, it finds that the Dublin system’s endurance can ultimately be credited to the deliberate choices that have been made by both the Member States and the EU’s supranational institutions in pursuit of their preferences (bolstered or weakened by their relative strength of position) in the context of the (either empowering or constraining) institutional settings within which the reform negotiations took place...|$|E
