Furthermore we investigate how the interaction {{can be used in}} a game. We investigate through theory on EEG, classification algorithms, Emotivs software and our own game working with both active and passive interaction. We found that even though the technology is new at a consumerlevel, it’s still very powerful and can be used for a wide range of purposes, while it still offers possibilities that wasnt available before...|$|R

First part deals with golden ratio appearance <b>in</b> chemistry. <b>Specificly</b> inquire into distance between centers of atoms in a halide salts compounds, asymmetric features of chemical processes, stability of transuranic elements, energy levels of gas electrons and spin number of subatomic elements. Another part takes an interest in simulation of electrical power lines supplied by two sides and calculatinon of its parameters. Last section is included in order to present variety of Fibonacci numbers appearence. It shows us relations between insects and flower, where insect live...|$|R

40|$|Many {{problems}} in computer vision can be formulated as an optimization problem. Developping the efficient global optimizational technique adaptive to the vision proplem {{becomes more and}} more important. In this paper, we present a geometric primitive extraction method, which plays a crucial role in content-based image retrieval and other vision problems. We formulate the problem as a cost function minimization problem and we present a new optimization technique called Evolutionary Tabu Search (ETS). Genetic algorithm and Tabu Search Algorithm are combined <b>in</b> our method. <b>Specificly,</b> we incorporates "the survival of strongest" idea of evolution algorithm into tabu search. In experiments, we use our method for shape extraction in images and compare our method with other three global optimization methods including genetic algorithm, simulated Annealing and tabu search. The results show that the new algorithm is a practical and effective global optimization method, which can yield good near-o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The diploma work {{is dealing}} with Corporate Governance system in {{selected}} countries in the European union. The goal {{of the work is}} to compare three companies in three countries and make a conclusion, which company is in the best compliance with the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance and act according to recommendations for Corporate Governance. The work is divided into two parts. In the first part we are analyzing the environment of Corporate Governance in the countries as a whole, <b>specificly</b> <b>in</b> Czech Republic, France and Great Britain. In the second part we are comparing Corporate Governance in these countries on selected examples of three companies, i. e. Telefónica O 2 Czech Republic, a. s., Alcatel Lucent (limited liability company, France) and British Telecommunications plc (Great Britain). The analysis is based on the criterias formulated according to the OECD Principles and it was made from the investor's point of view and his opportunity to get the necessary information about the company...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1970 s, historiography {{has been}} subject to new tendencies that can {{generally}} be grouped under the multifaceted concept of «postmodernism». This article explores the influx of these new trends in medievalism and, more <b>specificly,</b> <b>in</b> the intepretation of historical texts. The {{first part of the}} article describes the theoretical positions of the socalled «new medievalism». In the second part, the author analyzes the results of its application to the study of medieval historiography, using examples from French, Catalan and Castilian chronicles and genealogies. Specifically, he looks at the following key aspects of reconsidering medieval historiography in the context of postmodernism and the new medievalism: the historical text as a literary artefact; the social logic of the historical text; the function of genealogies; the relationship between past, present and future and the idea of presentism; the connection between social mutations and literary transformations; the prosification and the vernacularization of the chronicles; and the political function of historiography...|$|R
40|$|Felt is {{described}} as a type of very thick warpless cloth, made by compressing wool in various ways without weaving, came up by humans’ covering up and sheltering needs against natural conditions in the first ages. Turkish nomads made ornaments and the objects they use completely from the wools derived from the animals raised by them. Wool allowed them to produce everything required for them. Felt has developed <b>specificly</b> <b>in</b> Middle Asia and oldest samples of felt are also found in there. Turkic tribes, which went towards west from the regions called as “Felt Land” by Chinese, has brought felt art with themselves and provided continuance of this art in an area involving up to thousands of kilometers from Balkans to the east borders Mongolia which also includes Anatolian and Iranian plateaus. Felt making is a handicraft which develops by traditional way, exists in Konya city centre from past to present. Konya Felt making is handed on “from father to son” or by “apprenticeship” from past to present. Felt products found in museum and storages of Konya has been investigated...|$|R

Cipta Agung in formulating the competitive strategy to face environment changing. This research is conducted in the strategic management area, <b>specificly</b> <b>in</b> analyzing strategic formulation. The research used three steps analysis. The first step is internal and external audit which showed in internal and external factor evaluation. Then the second step is compare the Internal and external matrix with TOWS matrix. And the last step is to make decision using QSPM to select which strategy could be used. The result from internal audit evaluation ended a score 2, 613 and external evaluation ended a score 2, 359.
