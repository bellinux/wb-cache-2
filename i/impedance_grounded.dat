40|$|The {{generator}} {{differential protection}} {{is one of}} the most important electrical protections of synchronous generator stator windings. Its operation principle is based on the comparison of the input current and output current at each phase winding. Unwanted trip commands are usually caused by CT saturation, wrong CT selection, or the fact that they may come from different manufacturers. In generators grounded through high impedance, only phase-to-phase or three-phase faults can be detected by the differential protection. This kind of fault causes differential current to flow in, at least, two phases of the winding. Several cases of unwanted trip commands caused by the appearance of differential current in only one phase of the generator have been reported. In this paper multi-phase criterion is proposed for generator differential protection algorithm when applied to high <b>impedance</b> <b>grounded</b> generators...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the single phase earth fault in medium voltage {{distribution}} networks that are high <b>impedance</b> <b>grounded.</b> Networks are normally radially operated but partially meshed. First, the basic properties of high <b>impedance</b> <b>grounded</b> networks are discussed. Following this, the characteristics of earth faults in distribution networks are determined based on real case recordings. Exploiting these characteristics, new applications for earth fault indication and location are then developed. The characteristics discussed are the clearing of earth faults, arc extinction, arcing faults, fault resistances and transients. Arcing faults made up {{at least half of}} all the disturbances, and they were especially predominant in the unearthed network. In the case of arcing faults, typical fault durations are outlined, and the overvoltages measured in different systems are analysed. In the unearthed systems, the maximum currents that allowed for autoextinction were small. Transients appeared in nearly all fault occurrences that caused the action of the circuit breaker. Fault resistances fell into two major categories, one where the fault resistances were below a few hundred ohms and the other where they were of the order of thousands of ohms. Some faults can evolve gradually, for example faults caused by broken pin insulators, snow burden, downed conductor or tree contact. Using a novel application based on the neutral voltage and residual current analysis with the probabilistic method, it is possible to detect and locate resistive earth faults up to a resistance of 220  kΩ. The main results were also to develop new applications of the transient based differential equation, wavelet and neural network methods for fault distance estimation. The performance of the artificial neural network methods was comparable to that of the conventional algorithms. It was also shown that the neural network, trained by the harmonic components of the neutral voltage transients, is applicable for earth fault distance computation. The benefit of this method is that only one measurement per primary transformer is needed. Regarding only the earth faults with very low fault resistance, the mean error in absolute terms was about 1. 0  km for neural network methods and about 2. 0  km for the conventional algorithms in staged field tests. The restriction of neural network methods is the huge training process needed because so many different parameters affect the amplitude and frequency of the transient signal. For practical use the conventional methods based on the faulty line impedance calculation proved to be more promising. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Today cables replace {{overhead}} lines in distribution systems and cause higher system capacitance and higher capacative fault currents. This fault current, in the fault location, {{is limited by}} a Petersén coil and a resistance in parallel when a fault occurs in so called “high <b>impedance</b> <b>grounded</b> systems” which are commonly used in Europe. The high impedance however has the disadvantage {{that it needs to}} be adjusted to the capacitance in the system in order to optimize the limitation of the fault current. Another option is to use a solidly grounded system with a so called “Fault Current Limiter” (FCL) instead, on the outgoing terminals of the transformer feeding the system. The FCL interrupts the outgoing current on the load side of the transformer that feeds the system, in case of a fault, by forcing the current to a zero with a counter voltage. The FCL in this master thesis triggers on 1. 5 times higher current than nominal current. After fault clearing the FCL is reclosed. The FCL has the advantage that it {{does not have to be}} adapted to the capacitance in the system. It should be noted that the current in all of the phases (even the healthy phases) are interrupted downstream the FCL. It also has the ability to interrupt the single line-to-ground fault before it develops into a three phase fault. This thesis presents a comparison between the high impedance grounding and the FCL. The characteristics of the two grounding principles are investigated in a distribution system from Vattenfall. The assessment is done via simulations in the program PSCAD with three types of grounding of the transformer; high impedance grounding, solid grounding (without FCL) and solid grounding with FCL. The system is simulated with the faults “single line-to-ground” and “three phase short circuit” respectively, even if a line-to-line can occur. The results from the simulations show that the FCL gives a short fault duration time and a possibility to limit both single line-to-ground faults and three phase faults. The high impedance grounding on the other hand is able to limit single line-to-ground faults whereas it is generally known that not able to limit three phase short circuits...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Photonic Band-Gap {{materials}} (PBG) are periodic struc-tures {{composed of}} dielectric materials or metal.

The theoretical models were extended to {{consider the case of}} sound diffraction by an absorbing sphere with a locally reacting boundary or an extended reaction boundary placed above an outdoor ground surface of finite impedance. The separation of variables techniques and appropriate wave field expansions were used to derive the analytical solutions. By adopting an image method, the solutions could be formulated to account for the multiple scattering of sound between the sphere and its image near a flat acoustically hard or an <b>impedance</b> <b>ground.</b> The effect of ground on the reflected sound fields was incorporated in the theoretical model by employing an approximate analytical solution known as the Weyl-van der Pol formula.

The approximate method substantially reduced the computational time for calculating the sound field.
