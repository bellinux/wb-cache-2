5|$|In 1986, Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlüter {{commissioned}} a radiological {{examination of the}} surviving workers. The Danish Institute for Clinical <b>Epidemiology</b> concluded 11 months later that cancer incidents were 40percent higher in Project Crested Ice workers than in workers who had visited the base {{before and after the}} operation. The Institute of Cancer <b>Epidemiology</b> found a 50percent higher cancer rate in the workers than in the general population, but could not conclude that radiation exposure was to blame.|$|E
5|$|Louis-René Villermé (10 March 1782 – 16 November 1863) was a French {{economist}} and physician. He {{was known for}} his early studies of social <b>epidemiology,</b> or the effects of socioeconomic status on health, in early industrial France, and was an advocate for hygienic reform in factories and prisons. His work is considered pivotal {{in the history of the}} fields of sociology and statistical inquiry, and he is considered a founder of <b>epidemiology.</b>|$|E
5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale <b>epidemiology</b> studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating in}} 1995 with a {{first-class}} honours degree in medicine from Magdalen College, Oxford, Goldacre obtained an MA in philosophy from King's College London, then undertook clinical training at UCL Medical School, qualifying {{as a medical}} doctor in 2000 and as a psychiatrist in 2005. As of 2014 he was Wellcome Research Fellow in <b>Epidemiology</b> at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tourette's is unknown, {{but it is}} well {{established}} that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. Genetic <b>epidemiology</b> {{studies have shown that}} the overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known and no gene has been identified. In other cases, tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette's, a phenomenon known as tourettism.|$|E
5|$|As cancers do not {{immediately}} emerge after {{exposure to radiation}} instead radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of some 5+ years. An <b>epidemiology</b> study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers of unspecificed lethality, {{could be due to}} radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality. Both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly those {{who took part in the}} study.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, 28 prizes {{have been}} awarded to 48individuals. The inaugural winner for the Astronomy award was Canadian Jim Peebles; he was honoured for his {{contributions}} to cosmology. Two inaugural prizes were awarded for the Life Science and Medicine category: Americans Stanley Norman Cohen, Herbert Boyer and Yuet-Wai Kan jointly won one of the prizes for their works pertaining to DNA while British physiologist Sir Richard Doll won the other for his contribution to cancer <b>epidemiology.</b> Shiing-Shen Chern of China won the inaugural Mathematical Sciences award {{for his work on}} differential geometry.|$|E
5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or <b>epidemiology.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{retired from}} the University of Maryland in 1963 but {{continued}} teaching <b>Epidemiology</b> into the 1970s. Faber {{was inducted into the}} National Lacrosse Hall of Fame that year and into the University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame in 1983. He survived his wife of 62 years, Olyure née Hammack, who died in 1992. Faber died of pneumonia two years later on January 14, 1994, and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery. The University of Maryland Alumni Association Hall of Fame posthumously inducted Faber in 2000. In 2003, Maryland established the Faber Memorial Men's Lacrosse Scholarship Endowment Fund through the Maryland Educational Foundation, Inc. to award scholarships to men's lacrosse players.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} 1826, he {{conducted}} a study connecting mortality rates with wealth and poverty based on neighborhoods in Paris. Louis-René Villermé is also accounted {{as the author of}} the one of the first life expectancy tables that directly linked income to mortality rates and life expectancy. He concluded that poor people die younger. This extended into his study in 1829 that reasoned the cause for shorter heights in poorer people was the result of inadequate money to provide proper nutrition. Villermé's work on height is considered the first study in auxological <b>epidemiology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic <b>epidemiology,</b> Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E
5|$|The annual {{incidence}} of clinically recognized PanNETs is low (about 5 per one million person-years) and {{is dominated by}} the non-functioning types. Somewhere between 45% and 90% of PanNETs are thought to be of the non-functioning types. Studies of autopsies have uncovered small PanNETs rather frequently, suggesting that the prevalence of tumors that remain inert and asymptomatic may be relatively high. Overall PanNETs are thought to account for about 1 to 2% of all pancreatic tumors. The definition and classification of PanNETs has changed over time, affecting what is known about their <b>epidemiology</b> and clinical relevance.|$|E
5|$|The {{death toll}} was 61 as of October6, {{and a day}} later it reached about 250. The Mexican {{government}} reported 341 deaths on October13, excluding victims in a landslide in Acalama, Puebla, and the total reached 379 by October28. However, non-government agencies reported 500deaths in Mexico by October9, {{and as many as}} 600 as of mid-November. The International Disaster Database, published by the Centre for Research on the <b>Epidemiology</b> of Disasters, reported 636deaths from the floods. The high death toll, in comparison to similar floods in 1944, was due to more landslides and flooding in more populated areas. About 500,000people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Viral <b>epidemiology</b> is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the {{transmission}} and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E
25|$|To date, few {{universities}} offer <b>epidemiology</b> as {{a course}} of study at the undergraduate level. One notable undergraduate program exists at Johns Hopkins University, where students who major in public health can take graduate level courses, including <b>epidemiology,</b> their senior year at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.|$|E

25|$|The term <b>epidemiology</b> is {{now widely}} applied {{to cover the}} {{description}} and causation of not only epidemic disease, but of disease in general, and even many non-disease, health-related conditions, such as {{high blood pressure and}} obesity. Therefore, this <b>epidemiology</b> is based upon how the pattern of the disease cause changes in the function of everyone.|$|E
25|$|Different {{fields in}} <b>epidemiology</b> have {{different}} levels of validity. One way to assess the validity of findings is the ratio of false-positives (claimed effects that are not correct) to false-negatives (studies which fail to support a true effect). To take the field of genetic <b>epidemiology,</b> candidate-gene studies produced over 100 false-positive findings for each false-negative. By contrast genome-wide association appear close to the reverse, with only one false positive for every 100 or more false-negatives. This ratio has improved over time in genetic <b>epidemiology</b> as the field has adopted stringent criteria. By contrast other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result.|$|E
25|$|Major {{areas of}} {{epidemiological}} study include disease causation, transmission, outbreak investigation, disease surveillance, forensic <b>epidemiology,</b> Occupational <b>epidemiology,</b> screening, biomonitoring, and comparisons of treatment effects {{such as in}} clinical trials. Epidemiologists rely on other scientific disciplines like biology to better understand disease processes, statistics to make efficient use of the data and draw appropriate conclusions, social sciences to better understand proximate and distal causes, and engineering for exposure assessment.|$|E

25|$|John Snow {{is famous}} for his {{investigations}} into {{the causes of the}} 19th century cholera epidemics, and is also known as the father of (modern) <b>epidemiology.</b> He began with noticing the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company. His identification of the Broad Street pump as the cause of the Soho epidemic is considered the classic example of <b>epidemiology.</b> Snow used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and removed the handle; this ended the outbreak. This has been perceived as a major event in the history of public health and regarded as the founding event of the science of <b>epidemiology,</b> having helped shape public health policies around the world. However, Snow’s research and preventive measures to avoid further outbreaks were not fully accepted or put into practice until after his death.|$|E

25|$|<b>Epidemiology</b> is {{the study}} and {{analysis}} of the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in defined populations. It is the cornerstone of public health, and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare. Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and statistical analysis of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including peer review and occasional systematic review). <b>Epidemiology</b> has helped develop methodology used in clinical research, public health studies, and, to a lesser extent, basic research in the biological sciences.|$|E
