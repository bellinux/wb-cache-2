40|$|Abstract—Recent {{ultrasound}} (US) {{experiments on}} packed myeloid leukaemia cells have shown that, at frequen-cies from 32 to 40 MHz, significant increases of signal amplitude were observed during apoptosis. This paper {{is an attempt}} to explain these signal increases based upon a simulation of the backscattered signals from the cells nuclei. The simulation is an expansion of work in which a condensed sample of cells, with fairly regular sizes, could be considered as an <b>imperfect</b> <b>crystal.</b> Thus, destructive interference could occur and this would be observed as a large reduced value of backscattered signals compared with the values obtained from a similar, but random, scattering source. This current paper explores the possibility that simple changes in the nuclei, such as their observed condensation or the small loss of nuclei scatterers from cells, could cause {{a significant increase in the}} observed backscattered signals. This model indicates that the greater backscattered signals can be explained by further randomisation of the average positions of the scattering sources in each cell. When these “microech-oes ” are added together, so that the destructive interference is reduced, a large increase in the signal is predicted. The simplified model strongly suggests that much of observed large increases of the backscattered signals could be simply explained by the randomisation of the position of the condensed nuclei during apoptosis, and the destruction of the nuclei could produce further signal amplitude changes due to disruption of the cloud o...|$|E

Achievements {{and limitations of}} the preparation approach are critically discussed. We show that self-assembled metallic nanoparticles can be prepared with diameters d = 2 – 12 nm and interparticle distances D = 20 – 140 nm on various substrates. Structural, electronic and magnetic properties of the particle arrays were characterized by several techniques to give a comprehensive view of the high quality of the method. For Co nanoparticles, it is demonstrated that magnetostatic interactions can be neglected for distances which are at least 6 {{times larger than the}} particle diameter. Focus is placed on FePt alloy nanoparticles which show a huge magnetic anisotropy in the L 10 phase, however, this is still less by a factor of 3 – 4 when compared to the anisotropy of the bulk counterpart. A similar observation was also found for CoPt nanoparticles (NPs). These results are related to <b>imperfect</b> <b>crystal</b> structures as revealed by HRTEM as well as to compositional distributions of the prepared particles. Interestingly, the results demonstrate that the averaged effective magnetic anisotropy of FePt nanoparticles does not strongly depend on size. Consequently, magnetization stability should scale linearly with the volume of the NPs and give rise to a critical value for stability at ambient temperature. Indeed, for diameters above 6 nm such stability is observed for the current FePt and CoPt NPs. Finally, the long-term conservation of nanoparticles by Au photoseeding is presented...|$|E

Even for a weak disorder, semi-classical theories, {{such as those}} based on the Boltzmann equation for matter-waves scattering from the impurities, often fail to describe transport properties and full quantum approaches are necessary. The properties of the quan- tum systems are of fundamental interest as they show intriguing and non-intuitive phenomena that are not yet fully understood such as Anderson localization, percola- tion, disorder-driven quantum phase transitions and the corresponding Bose-glass or spin-glass phases. Under- standing quantum transport in amorphous solids {{is one of the}} main issues in this context, related to electric and thermal conductivities. Ultracold atomic gases can now be considered to re- visit the problem of quantum conductivity and quan- tum transport under unique control possibilities. Dilute atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and degener- ate Fermi gases (DFG) are produced routinely taking advantage of the recent progress in cooling and trap- ping of neutral atoms. Transport has been widely in- vestigated in controlled potentials with no defects, for instance periodic potentials (optical lattices). Controlled disordered potentials can also be produced with various techniques such as the use of magnetic traps designed on atomic chips with rough wires, the use of localized impurity atoms, the use of radio-frequency fields or the use of optical potentials.

40|$|High-power, {{coherent}} radiation from semiconductor lasers is attractive for such diverse applications as free-space communication, optical data storage, and microsurgery. However, several factors conspire to prevent near-ideal performance from broad area devices and laser arrays. Waveguides wider {{than a few}} microns support many lateral modes with poor gain discrimination. Consequently, such modes are easily "mixed" by perturbations in gain and refractive index caused by gain saturation, thermal gradients, and inhomogeneities that are due to <b>imperfect</b> <b>crystal</b> growth. This causes spatially localized modes, multimode operation, and reduced spatial coherence, all of which lead to farfields broader than the "diffraction limit. " In this thesis, we have investigated the influence of gain saturation on the lateral modes of broad area structures and laser arrays. Analytical and numerical techniques {{have been developed to}} solve self-consistently for mode shapes and propagation constants as a function of injected current density above threshold. For example, our analysis indicates that the gain-saturated modes of broad area lasers consist of an integer number of phase-locked "filaments. " In gain-guided quantum well lasers, these nonlinear modes are observed to oscillate into narrow, single-lobed farfields, which broaden only slightly with increased power output up to the 500 mW level. Conversely, laser arrays have been widely touted as structures that suppress unwanted filamentation in favor of spatial mode control. Indeed, in this work we have demonstrated supermode control at the 100 mW power level by varying the diffraction region length in diffraction-coupled arrays. Both theoretically and experimentally, however, we have found the lateral modes of laser arrays to be unstable with increased current injection. Waveguides that are phase-matched below threshold become detuned under the influence of gain saturation, so that interguide power transfer is reduced. This decreases the injection-locking bandwidth, and ultimately, the spatial coherence. While undesirable for a laser oscillator, this property may be attractive for all-optical switching in nonlinear directional couplers. Finally, we have considered marrying the high-power, coherent output of broad area lasers and laser arrays with the broadband tunability possible in semiconductor lasers. In particular, the steplike density of states unique to quantum well structures results in gain spectra that are broader and flatter than comparable spectra of double heterostructure lasers. Experimentally, we have tuned uncoated, single quantum well stripe lasers in a grating-coupled external cavity over a range > 125 nm centered about 800 nm. Similarly tuned broad area lasers output in excess of 200 mW (pulsed) into a single longitudinal mode over 80 nm, and buried heterostructure lasers were operated continuously over 90 nm. We expect that in the future, such devices could provide a compact, rugged, more efficient alternative to dye lasers...|$|E

Knowing the crystal structure parameters helps the understanding of the physical behavior of material. For complex structures, particularly for materials which also contain local symmetry as well as global symmetry, obtaining crystal parameters can be very hard.

Summary of revisions:Defect quantification capability is added. The tool can process the <b>imperfect</b> <b>crystal</b> structures, finds and quantifies the crystalline defects. The tool is capable of finding positional defects, vacancy defects, substitutional impurities and interstitial impurities. The algorithms presented in [3] are used for defect quantification implementation. Transparency support is added to the visualization tool. Users are now allowed to set the transparency of each atom type individually. Runtime visibility sorting functionality is added to facilitate correct transparency computations. Visual Studio 2012 support is added. Visual Studio 2012 specific project files are created and the project is tested with this development environment.

40|$|The Rietveld {{method is}} a standardless {{technique}} that corrects for all X-ray diffraction (XRD) intensity aberrations. From crystal structure data and least-squares refinement of Rietveld parameters, a Rietveld analysis fits a calculated XRD pattern to an observed XRD pattern {{to calculate the}} weight percentage of minerals in a sample. In the Rietveld program SIROQUANT, used in this study, the crystal structure data are converted into (hkl) files that are used for calculated pattern modelling. SIROQUANT allows amorphicity and microabsorption (Brindley) corrections {{to be made in}} the Rietveld analysis. In order to apply the Rietveld method to samples from Australian Tertiary oil shale sequences, a methodology was developed so that the Rietveld method could quantify clay minerals, organic matter could be quantified from XRD data, and the Rietveld method could be used as a rapid and routine procedure. Calculated pattern fitting of the XRD patterns for illite, illite/smectite and montmorillonite was achieved by using observed (hkl) files which allowed for the <b>imperfect</b> <b>crystal</b> structure of these minerals. The observed (hkl) files were calculated by measuring (hkl) file data directly from standard clay mineral XRD patterns for each of the clay minerals. A two halfwidth function was tested on the Duaringa clay mineral patterns and although the calculated fits improved, there was only a small difference in the quantitative results. Intensity calibration curves were used to correct for intensity losses caused by beam overflow and the X-ray absorption properties of each rock type in the Duaringa sequence. The absolute mineral abundances were calculated using the Rietveld method by including the organic content in the Rietveld analysis. The organic matter was quantified with a calibration curve which related the area of the organic (amorphous) hump to the organic content Calibration curves were calculated with the direct method, which involves quantifying the organic content in 2 ̆ 7 spiked 2 ̆ 7 calibration mixtures using the Rietveld method, or the addition method, which involves preparing calibration mixtures with a standard organic matter sample. An iron-correction curve and formula were used to correct for microabsorption effects produced by iron-bearing minerals. A user-friendly method consisting of a four-file system and Parameter Groups was developed to analyse a large number of samples using the Rietveld method. The four files stored and allowed easy manipulation of files used in a Rietveld analysis. From each Parameter Group, a representative parameter (PAR) file was used to prescale the Rietveld parameters in all the other PAR files in the same Parameter Group; this increased the speed of the Rietveld analysis by a factor of five to ten. The only Rietveld parameters that require refining for the Rietveld analysis of the non-representative PAR files are the more variable Rietveld parameters such as scale and preferred orientation. One hundred and fifty samples from the Tertiary Duaringa oil shale sequence, consisting of oil shale, claystone and carbonate-rich rocks, were analysed using the Rietveld method. The quantitative mineral data of each sample was used to interpret lithological changes in the sequence. Illite/smectite, quartz and kaolinite are the dominant detrital minerals in the oil shales with minor albite, montmorillonite and anatase.

The {{aim of the}} work is to study asymptotical functions for average probability of survival rate and for the constant of reaction velocity being under observation in dense disordered systems and in crystals with lattice imperfection. Analytical methods calculation of kinetic dependences in pre-threshold percolation systems, in <b>imperfect</b> <b>crystals</b> and in systems with correlated location of active particles have been developed. Asymptotical mechanisms, determining reagent average concentration decrease in systems with diffusion, reaction, density fluctuations and space correlations that may be used when interpreting experimental data, have been obtainedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
