5|$|American {{journalist}} H. R. Knickerbocker, who had met both Hitler and Hess, {{speculated that}} Hitler had sent Hess {{to deliver a}} message informing Winston Churchill of the forthcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, and offering a negotiated peace or even an anti-Bolshevik partnership. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin believed that Hess's flight had been engineered by the British. Stalin persisted in this belief as late as 1944, when <b>he</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> matter to Churchill, who insisted {{that they had no}} advance knowledge of the flight.|$|E
5|$|In {{conversations with}} Eidelman, Meyer {{mentioned}} {{that since the}} marches that accompanied the main titles for the previous Star Trek films were so good, he {{had no desire to}} compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. <b>He</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> opening to Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision. Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of Bernard Herrmann; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.|$|E

He referred to his chronic illnesses as his “sisters". His deep sense of brotherhood under God embraced others, and he declared that “he considered himself no friend of Christ {{if he did not}} cherish those for whom Christ died”.|$|E
25|$|Sports Illustrateds Stewart Mandel has Tech ranked at #10 in his preseason {{poll and}} later #8 in his college {{football}} power rankings. The team is also ranked #10 {{in the preseason}} by Fox Sports. ESPN.com writer Mark Schlabach ranked the Red Raiders #12 in his preseason poll and later #11 and #8 in revised editions of his preseason polls. In a March 26, 2008 article, Yahoo! Sports writer Olin Buchanan declared that Tech could challenge Oklahoma and Texas for supremacy in the Big 12 South in 2008. As plusses, he cited a strong quarterback (Graham Harrell), experienced wide receivers (including Michael Crabtree), and five returning starters on the offensive line. As a weakness, <b>he</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> defense's trouble stopping the run but speculated that a year of experience and new talent may help to alleviate this problem. Another weak spot he pointed out was the Red Raiders' trouble moving {{the ball on the}} ground on those rare instances when a rushing play is called.|$|E

This makes the Stawski's video the earliest parody featured in an American newspaper.

500|$|In 1910, more partial fossils were {{discovered}} in Dera Bugti during an expedition by the British palaeontologist Clive Forster-Cooper. Based on these remains, Foster-Cooper moved A. bugtiense to the new genus Paraceratherium, meaning [...] "near the hornless beast", in reference to Aceratherium. His rationale for this reclassification was the species' distinctly down-turned lower tusks. In 1913, Forster-Cooper named a new genus and species, Thaumastotherium ("wonderful beast") osborni, based on larger fossils from the same excavations, but he renamed the genus Baluchitherium later that year because the former name was preoccupied, as {{it had already been}} used for a hemipteran insect. The fossils of Baluchitherium were so fragmentary that Foster-Cooper was only able to identify {{it as a kind of}} odd-toed ungulate, but <b>he</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> possibility of confusion with Paraceratherium. The American palaeontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, after which B. osborni was named, suggested it may have been a titanothere.|$|E
500|$|Occasionally, Colbert {{mentioned}} his real-life siblings on the show. In one episode, {{he placed his}} brother Ed, a lawyer who advises the International Olympic Committee, [...] "on notice" [...] for refusing to grant the show the rights to air footage of a dispute between two American speed skaters. Ed later appeared {{at the start of}} the February 22, 2010 edition advising Stephen on how to cover the Vancouver Winter Olympics since his character does not have the television rights to the games. Footage from the Richmond Olympic Oval was used after Stephen was named a special advisor to USA Speedskating. Generally, journalists covering the Olympics do not have access to the venues unless their employer has the rights to Olympic TV coverage, and cannot show moving video coverage of any official Olympic event unless they have permission from the rights holder. When his sister Elizabeth Colbert Busch declared her intention to run for congress, <b>he</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> event. Later, when she was nominated to run against Mark Sanford and the MSNBC show Morning Joe declared their support for Sanford and mentioned Colbert, he defended his sister's campaign.|$|E
500|$|In the debate, Wilson {{concentrated}} {{almost exclusively}} {{on the extent to}} which the prime minister and his colleagues had been dilatory in not identifying a clear security risk arising from Profumo's association with Ward and his circle. Macmillan responded that he should not be held culpable for believing a colleague who had repeatedly asserted his innocence. <b>He</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> false allegations against Galbraith, and the failure of the security services to share their detailed information with him. In the general debate the sexual aspects of the scandal were fully discussed; Nigel Birch, the Conservative MP for West Flintshire, referred to Keeler as a [...] "professional prostitute" [...] and asked rhetorically: [...] "What are whores about?" [...] Keeler was otherwise branded a [...] "tart" [...] and a [...] "poor little slut". [...] Ward [...] was vilified throughout as a likely Soviet agent; one Conservative referred to [...] "the treason of Dr Ward". Most Conservatives, whatever their reservations, were supportive of Macmillan, with only Birch suggesting that he should consider retirement. In the subsequent vote on the government's handling of the affair, 27 Conservatives abstained, reducing the government's majority to 69. Most newspapers considered the extent of the defection significant, and several forecast that Macmillan would soon resign.|$|E
