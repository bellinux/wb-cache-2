500|$|Television critics {{tended to}} view [...] "Cocktails" [...] positively. Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO Networks praised the episode's writing and directing, {{explaining}} that [...] " [...] {{of the credit}} goes to Paul Lieberstein for his ruthlessly funny writing, but ol' J.J. really knows how to run with the material and make awkward situations just that much more painful with his direction, {{one of the best}} episodes of the series." [...] Buddy TV writer Oscar Dahl noted that [...] "besides a couple of crafty camera moves, his work was mostly invisible, which is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> from a director on The Office." [...] IGN's Brian Zoromski appreciated the spotlight on female characters Jan, Pam, and Karen, and thought there were [...] "quite a few great little moments this episode," [...] including [...] "a great Creed moment as he revealed he runs a fake ID company out of his car." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West enjoyed Karen conning Jim at the party, called Rashida Jones' performance [...] "brilliantly played"; West also liked Pam's newfound confidence, but believed she was [...] "dumb" [...] for telling Roy of her kiss with Jim.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{most of whom}} seemed to have judged it on different criteria from their normal {{because it was a}} holiday episode. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon may have called it [...] "sickly oversweet", but maintained [...] "that's <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> at Christmas". His colleague Patrick Burns wrote, [...] "Holiday episodes tread a dangerous line between sweet and saccharine, but this episode splits the difference perfectly." [...] The title of the article they wrote with Meghan Brown, [...] "Glee Does Christmas: Cheesy but Charming", found echoes in other reviews: both Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times and Anthony Benigno of the Daily News also thought the episode was quite cheesy, but Benigno characterized it as [...] "the good kind of cheese; the kind you'll eat for antipasti before grandma and grandpa bring out the roast beef on Christmas dinner", and Reiter's bottom line was that it [...] "may not have been the most wonderful episode of the year, but it did feature moments that twinkled and shined like the lovingly trimmed family tree." [...] Time James Poniewozik was less enthusiastic when he noted that Glee delivered an episode [...] "that touched on all the requisite holiday bases but that felt perfunctory", and added that it was [...] "generally ho-ho-hum". Robert Canning of IGN gave it a [...] "great" [...] 8 out of 10, but stated that [...] "the episode as a whole was lacking just a bit to turn it into an absolute classic", and The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave the episode a [...] "B−" [...] and wrote, [...] "I guess I'd say that I thought the episode worked moment-to-moment, without working as an overall narrative", but also stated that it was [...] "positively filled with stupid moments".|$|E

2500|$|The {{formation}} of a College for engineering, or technical university, was quite a difficult project, as the entire subject of engineering education was obscure. A small number of colleges had commenced this, such as Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey and Harvard, Yale, and RPI in New York; MIT and Cornell were just being founded. The University of Pennsylvania opened a small school in 1852, for mining and materials, but which had closed {{at the onset of}} the Civil War. As W. Ross Yates notes: [...] "No one knew with certainty how many years a course [...] in engineering should take, or even what branches of engineering should be included within a university. The relationship between theory and practice was hazy." [...] A statement made years later by industrialist and Lehigh Trustee Eckley B. Coxe summarizes the problem succinctly: [...] "Not knowing <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do or the material you have to do it with, what is the best way of doing it?" ...|$|E

[...] Stephen Filippelli from Review Stream called the song decent, but mainly criticized the music video for the song. Amanda Dobbins and Lindsay Weber of Vulture listed [...] "Love Takes Time" [...] at number-nineteen on their list of [...] "Mariah Carey’s 25 Best Singles". OO Cities called the song a [...] "beautiful ballad".|$|R
2500|$|After 1965, Brown's bandleader and {{arranger}} was Alfred [...] "Pee Wee" [...] Ellis. Ellis credits Clyde Stubblefield's {{adoption of}} New Orleans drumming techniques, {{as the basis}} of modern funk: [...] "If, in a studio, you said 'play it funky' that could imply almost anything. But 'give me a New Orleans beat' – <b>you</b> got <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted.</b> And Clyde Stubblefield was just the epitome of this funky drumming." [...] Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from [...] "New Orleans—through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s." [...] Concerning the various funk motifs, Stewart states: [...] "This model, it should be noted, is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle." ...|$|R

Not that I am in love with him, though I think very highly of him--you know I am not a romantic fool; but he {{is very much in}} love with me; and I wish I could return it as he deserves. The French say that one person turns the cheek and the other kisses it. It has not got quite so far as that with us; indeed, since he declared what he felt he has only been able to snatch a few words with me when I have been skating or walking.

5000|$|Work stalled on Laid Back as {{production}} commenced on Brothers and Sisters, {{though the}} two were worked on roughly concurrently. Sandlin, a former Hour Glass bassist and longtime Allman friend, helped hire various session musicians {{to work on the}} album, including Boyer and Tommy Talton on guitars, Bill Stewart on drums, and Charlie Hayward on bass guitar. Allman likened the album's presence to a mistress, noting {{that the rest of the}} band were not thrilled. It slowed down progress on their own album, and it created tension between the group, particularly between Allman and guitarist Dickey Betts. Nevertheless, several Allman Brothers members made appearances on Laid Back, including Jaimoe, who provided congas, and Chuck Leavell, a new addition to the Brothers, who added piano. Leavell stayed in Macon after leaving Dr. John's band, and found himself contributing to both albums. Allman felt Leavell's style of playing fit the album perfectly: [...] "He'd give <b>you</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted,</b> without any questions, and if he embellished on a song, he made it even better." ...|$|R

2500|$|In Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes {{to produce}} manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg {{developed}} an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but {{also had a}} high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating. Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: [...] "if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see {{this is a very}} shiny surface. When you write you use a water based ink, [...] you put your pen into it and it runs off. [...] Now [...] if <b>you</b> print that's <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>want.</b> One of Gutenberg's inventions was an ink which wasn't ink, it's a varnish.
