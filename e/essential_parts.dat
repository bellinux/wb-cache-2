5|$|The {{fortification}} of Castle Rising {{was constructed}} in a carefully designed landscape. In front of the castle was the town of Castle Rising, moved to its new site when the castle was built. The settlement {{appears to have been}} laid out to a grid-plan design, possibly bounded by ditches; with the castle positioned just behind it, in a similar fashion to that at New Buckenham and Malton Castle. A dovecot and a religious house were founded nearby; both of these were important symbols of lordship at the time, and were considered <b>essential</b> <b>parts</b> of a properly established castle.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{biological}} macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are <b>essential</b> <b>parts</b> {{of organisms}} {{and participate in}} virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion breaks the proteins down {{for use in the}} metabolism.|$|E

5|$|The vimana, {{also called}} the cella, {{contains}} the most sacred shrine wherein resides {{the image of the}} presiding deity. The vimana is often topped by a tower which is quite different on the outside than on the inside. Inside, the vimana is plain and square, whereas outside it is profusely decorated and can be either stellate ("star-shaped") or shaped as a staggered square, or feature a combination of these designs, giving it many projections and recesses that seem to multiply as the light falls on it. Each projection and recess has a complete decorative articulation that is rhythmic and repetitive and composed of blocks and mouldings, obscuring the tower profile. Depending on the number of shrines (and hence on the number of towers), the temples are classified as ekakuta (one), dvikuta (two), trikuta (three), chatushkuta (four) and panchakuta (five). Most Hoysala temples are ekakuta, dvikuta or trikuta, the Vaishnava ones mostly being trikuta. There are cases where a temple is trikuta but has only one tower over the main shrine (in the middle). So the terminology trikuta may not be literally accurate. In temples with multiple disconnected shrines, such as the twin temples at Mosale, all <b>essential</b> <b>parts</b> are duplicated for symmetry and balance.|$|E

25|$|After the 9th {{century the}} Roman Mass, now quite fixed {{in all its}} <b>essential</b> <b>parts</b> (though the Proper Masses for various feasts {{constantly}} change), quickly became the universal use throughout the Western patriarchate.

25|$|At {{other times}} clan names and patronymics ("son of") were also common, as in Aristides Lysimachu. For example, Alexander the Great {{was known as}} Heracleides (as a {{supposed}} descendant of Heracles) and by the dynastic name Karanos/Caranus, which referred to {{the founder of the}} dynasty to which he belonged. In none of these cases, though, were these names considered <b>essential</b> <b>parts</b> of the person's name, nor were they explicitly inherited in the manner that is common in many cultures today.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} maps (or morphisms) from one sheaf to another; sheaves (of a {{specific}} type, such as sheaves of abelian groups) with their morphisms {{on a fixed}} topological space form a category. On the other hand, to each continuous map there is associated both a direct image functor, taking sheaves and their morphisms on the domain to sheaves and morphisms on the codomain, and an inverse image functor operating in the opposite direction. These functors, and certain variants of them, are <b>essential</b> <b>parts</b> of sheaf theory.|$|E

Nevertheless, during 2005, Hurd developer Neal Walfield finished the initial memory management framework for the L4/Hurd port, and Marcus Brinkmann ported <b>essential</b> <b>parts</b> of glibc; namely, getting the process startup code working, allowing programs to run, thus allowing the first user programs (trivial ones such as the hello world program) in C to run.|$|E
25|$|Runestones {{were placed}} on {{selected}} spots in the landscape, such as assembly locations, roads, bridge constructions, and fords. In medieval churches, there are often runestones that have been inserted as construction material, and it is debated whether they were originally part of the church location or had been moved there. In southern Scania, runestones can be tied to large estates that also had churches constructed on their land. In the Mälaren Valley, the runestones appear to be placed so that they mark <b>essential</b> <b>parts</b> of the domains of an estate, such as courtyard, grave field, and borders to neighbouring estates. Runestones usually appear as single monuments and more rarely as pairs. In some cases, {{they are part of}} larger monuments together with other raised stones.|$|E
25|$|Once Mehmed {{had created}} an Ottoman {{bureaucracy}} and transformed the empire from a frontier society to a centralized government, {{he took care}} to appoint officials who would help him implement his agenda. His first grand vizier was Zaganos Pasha, who was of devşirme background {{as opposed to an}} aristocrat, and Zaganos Pasha’s successor, Mahmud Pasha Angelović, was also of devşirme background. Mehmed was the first sultan who was able to codify and implement kanunname solely based on his own independent authority. Additionally, Mehmed was able to later implement kanunname that went again previous tradition or precedent. This was monumental in an empire that was so steeped in tradition and could be slow to change or adapt. Having viziers and other officials who were loyal to Mehmed was an essential part of this government because he transferred more power to the viziers than previous sultans had. He delegated significant powers and functions of government to his viziers as part of his new policy of imperial seclusions. A wall was built around the palace as an element of the more closed era, and unlike previous sultans Mehmed was no longer accessible to the public or even lower officials. His viziers directed the military and met foreign ambassadors, two <b>essential</b> <b>parts</b> of governing especially with his numerous military campaigns.|$|E

Ross believed that Eve was not defined by identity as an African American: [...] "If they wanted to make my character any other ethnicity they wouldn't have to change a thing about her... She's just a person." [...] The actress cited the show's racial diversity as a primary reason for her attraction to the role. She stated that she felt [...] "tremendous support from NBC and Passions that the black characters and/or Hispanic characters are all <b>essential</b> <b>parts</b> of the story". She has cited Eve as helping to expand the TV representation of African Americans and interracial relationships.|$|E

Deacetylation is simply the reverse reaction where an acetyl group is removed from a molecule.|$|E
