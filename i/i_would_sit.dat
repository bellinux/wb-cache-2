25|$|I had the {{opportunity}} to get acquainted with writers and artists such as Vydunas, Tumas-Vaižgantas, even Basanavičius, who was taken care of by my parents. When I was four or five years old, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in Basanavičius's easy chair and I would feel fine. And later, throughout my entire life, Basanavičius's collected folklore remained extraordinarily important for me.|$|E
500|$|Because {{there was}} no dragon in the {{original}} legend, Mulan did not have animal companions; it was Roy E. Disney who suggested the character of Mushu. Veteran story artist Joe Grant created the cricket character, Cri-Kee for, though animator Barry Temple admitted [...] "the directors didn't want him in the movie, the story department didn't want him in the movie. The only people who truly wanted him in the movie were Michael Eisner and Joe Grant – and myself, because I was assigned the character. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in meetings and they’d say, 'Well, where's the cricket during all this?' Somebody else would say, 'Oh, to hell the cricket.' They felt Cri-Kee was a character who wasn't necessary to tell the story, which is true." [...] Throughout development on the film, Grant would slip sketches of Cri-Kee under the directors' door.|$|E
500|$|In early 2005, Brian Welch {{announced}} that he would be quitting the band. In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said [...] "I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in church high [...] I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said , 'Show me how to quit.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{much rather}} not," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "and besides, I think for to-day <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>sit</b> quiet {{and think it}} all over and realize how happy I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{declared}} to his sisters that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> down to table with him till {{he had told}} the truth, and I have kept my word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] agreed Frances, {{sitting down}} and {{beginning}} to peel apples. [...] "So there is no use in lamenting, or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> certainly <b>sit</b> down and cry, I feel so disappointed." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{characters}} and their stories {{served as an}} extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child. They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on August 8, 2006. Cassie made television appearances on MTV's Total Request Live and BET's 106 & Park to support the album on its release week. Her first televised performances were described as [...] "rocky" [...] and [...] "less-than-stellar," [...] but Diddy {{said that it was}} due to her inexperience, continuing that he would be [...] "with her through her development," [...] and has no [...] "question on her ability [...]" [...] Cassie later added: [...] "I don’t think I should have done those shows. But I didn't know I had a choice. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in rehearsals and sing full songs a cappella. I wasn't Beyoncé, but I wasn't fucking up. Then I got out there and was like, 'Oh my God, millions of people are watching me right now. I have stage fright.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{wish that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> to you?" [...] I clasped him madly round the waist, And breathlessly replied, [...] "I do!" [...] "All right," [...] said he, [...] "but please make haste." ...|$|E
60|$|So as I {{had lost}} the chance I thought that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> just <b>sit</b> tight, hoping {{that they would not}} see me. Nor indeed would they if it hadn't been for that horrible Tom.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{thought you}} one whit like Madame Ginevra, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> here {{waiting for your}} communications. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> get up, walk at my ease about the room, and {{anticipate}} {{all you had to}} say by a round lecture. Go on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Dora; [...] "I {{will say}} {{only one more}} thing, {{and that is that}} if I were the lord of the manor, who had been working in the {{hay-field}} all day, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> up very long, waiting for a wandering doctor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{said that}} if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in her children's schoolroom I should do very well for a penwiper! When things have come to that I don't think I need stand upon ceremony." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it does," [...] said Raymond, in {{the same}} dreamy manner, {{as if trying to}} shake {{something}} off. [...] "Some years, isn't it? I wanted it done, somehow. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> down to it now, only I have fallen asleep a dozen times over it already." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{two women}} spoke {{together}} for a while. [...] "Oh, miss!" [...] cried the elder and humbler, evidently astonished at some gratuity which Miss Newcome bestowed upon her, [...] "I didn't {{want this to be}} good to him. Everybody here loves him for himself; and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> up for him for weeks--that I would." ...|$|E
6000|$|Macallister looked thoughtful. [...] "Weel," [...] he said, [...] "that is a reason. Jacinta {{thinks a}} good deal of me, an' if I was no married already <b>I</b> <b>would</b> show ye how to make up to her. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> down, a long way off, an' look at her. She's no liking ye any the better for that way of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{should there}} be to be done? If you do remain here <b>I</b> wish you <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> down, Mr. Greenwood. You oppress me by {{standing}} up in that way {{in the middle of}} the room." ...|$|R
40|$|T REMEMBER afternoons on {{the terrace}} by the sea. <b>I</b> •*• <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> and read. Sometimes, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> pick a {{conversation}} out of the murmur of voices. I 2 ̆ 7 d eavesdrop up to a half-hour on the more interesting ones. As the summer wore on, {{a lot of the}} faces became pretty familiar. We 2 ̆ 7 d nod, somewhat hesitantly, as 2 ̆ 2 familiar 2 ̆ 2 strangers tend to do [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I know I wants it, for {{letters and}} that sort of thing, but it is bitter hard. I would rather stand {{opposite}} a house all day in winter than <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> for an hour trying to make my pen go where I wants it to. It allus will go the other way, and the drops of ink will come out awful. Good night, sir.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, {{consequent}} on these examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable opinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert's compliments, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> with his symmetrical bundle and my own {{on the table before}} me among the stationary, and feel like a Bank of some sort, rather than a private individual.|$|E
60|$|When I {{turned into}} the shepherd's cottage, if it was in winter and he was sitting by the fire, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> and smoke with him, and {{if we were in}} a talking mood I would tell him where I had been and what I had heard and seen, on the heath, in the woods, in the village, or anywhere, on the chance of its {{reminding}} him of something worth hearing in his past life.|$|E
6000|$|... "There will never, {{never be}} any rupture, Mary. If {{you were to}} shut your door against me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come and <b>sit</b> down on the doorstep, which I once--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} get much sleep in a tree, Sahib. I have done it once or twice, when I have been hunting in a tiger-infested neighbourhood; but I got {{scarcely}} any sleep, and was so stiff, in the morning, that I could hardly walk. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>sit</b> up all night, and keep up a good fire, than do that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jee-hoshaphat, Harry!" [...] Jerry exclaimed as {{he stepped}} out; [...] "that was worse nor a cyclone. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>sit</b> {{on the back of}} the worst kind of bucker than jump over those waves again. If we are going to have much of this I should say let us find our way back and ask the Utes to finish us off." ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, {{with the}} frantic {{energy of a}} Gladstone out of office, I plied my ax, its echoing strokes making fit accompaniment to my strains, until for many yards about me the ground was {{littered}} with white and yellow chips; then, exhausted with my efforts, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> down to rest and eat my simple midday fare, to admire myself in my deep-green and chocolate working-dress, and, above everything, to think and dream of Yoletta.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{father looked}} at, and, I feared, {{was going to}} check her; but he only said, [...] "Proceed, Polly, proceed with that catechism--prove {{yourself}} the little wiseacre you are. If Miss Snowe were to blush and look confused, I should have to bid you hold your tongue; and you and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> out the present meal in some disgrace; but she only smiles, so push her hard, multiply the cross-questions. Well, Miss Snowe, why do you go on with it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Well! I loved her, and I went on loving her, most absorbingly, entirely, and completely. But going on, too, working pretty hard, and busily keeping red-hot all the irons I now {{had in the}} fire, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> {{sometimes}} of a night, opposite my aunt, {{thinking how}} I had frightened Dora that time, and how I could best make my way with a guitar-case through the forest of difficulty, until I used to fancy that my head was turning quite grey.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing has {{happened}} to my father. His partner has been badly hurt. I must return to-morrow, and, {{as it is a}} tiresome journey, if you will excuse me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather not <b>sit</b> out the play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is neither}} spirit nor flesh {{in the house}} at present," [...] she said, [...] "which should not be there. It is now near eleven o'clock, fully bedtime; yet <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>sit</b> up a little longer, {{if you do not}} object, Shirley. Here," [...] she continued, [...] "I have brought the brace of pistols from my uncle's study. You may examine them at your leisure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do {{not think}} I can go to bed, Lady Annabel,' he said. 'The thought of this night is terrible to me. I {{do not think}} it ever can end. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> much sooner <b>sit</b> up in this room.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{began to}} be terribly frightened, sir--terribly frightened. I went dis {{afternoon}} and asked Captain Burley {{if he had any}} news ob you. He said 'No'; and asked me ef I knew where you were. I said 'No, sah;' that I knew nuffin about it except that you had gone on some dangerous job. He said as dey had heard nuffin had happened to you. Still I was bery anxious, and tought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> up till de last train came in from Richmond. Den I tink I dropped off to sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{playing for}} {{points in the}} game of party {{advantage}} Evesham displayed at times a quite wicked unscrupulousness in the use of his subtle mind. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> on the Liberal benches and watch him, and listen to his urbane voice, fascinated by him. Did he really care? Did anything matter to him? And if it really mattered nothing, why did he trouble to serve the narrowness and passion of his side? Or did he see far beyond my scope, so that this petty iniquity was justified by greater, remoter ends of which I had no intimation? ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{would be}} a merman bold; [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> and sing {{the whole of the}} day; [...] I would fill the sea-halls with a voice of power; [...] But at night I would roam abroad and play [...] With the mermaids {{in and out of the}} rocks, [...] Dressing their hair with the white sea-flower; [...] And holding them back by their flowing locks [...] I would kiss them often under the sea, [...] And kiss them again till they kiss'd me [...] Laughingly, laughingly; [...] And then we would wander away, away [...] To the pale-green sea-groves {{straight}} and high, [...] Chasing each other merrily.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{have never}} regretted what I said in 'the last press conference.' I {{believe that it}} gave the media a warning that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> back and take {{whatever}} biased coverage was dished out to me. I think the episode was partially responsible for the much fairer treatment I received from the press {{during the next few}} years. From that point of view alone, it was worth it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{asked me}} if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> down, and he offered me one of the camp-stools {{at the door of}} the marquee, and I did sit down for a moment, while he flitted about the {{interior}} doing various little things. At last I said, [...] "How is this, Robert? I thought you had been assigned to a place in the communal refectory. You're not here on the old terms?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I could {{convince}} you," [...] he said, [...] "once and for all, that my refusal springs from no such reasons as {{you seem to}} imagine. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sooner <b>sit</b> here, with a volume of Pater or Meredith, and this west wind blowing in my face, than <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hear myself acclaimed Prime Minister of England. Let us abandon this discussion once and for all, Borrowdean. We have arrived at a cul-de-sac, and I have spoken my last word." ...|$|R
