The text posits that the <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view</b> “imposition or resistance” to the processes of centralisation does not do justice to the different historical experiences.

40|$|Baboon {{social systems}} {{are among the}} most studied in primates. Solid {{knowledge}} of the hamadryas and savannah baboon systems has accumulated, leading to a <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view</b> of baboon social systems. Hamadryas baboons live in multilayered troops based on 1 -male units whereas savannah baboons live in multimale multifemale groups based on a network of related females. Less {{attention has been paid to}} their West African congenerics, the Guinea baboons, Papio papio. To fill this gap, in 2007 we initiated a long-term study of a baboon troop ranging in the Niokolo Koba National Park in southeastern Senegal. Earlier studies suggested a tendency for a multilayered social system in Guinea baboons, similar to the hamadryas baboon organization. Therefore, as a first approach to analyzing variability in party size and composition, we observed members of the troop crossing an open area from a fixed point for 3  mo during the dry and wet seasons. We counted individuals and recorded changes in composition of both arriving and departing parties. Party size and composition were highly variable on both a daily and a seasonal basis; 45. 9 % of the arriving parties changed in composition while crossing the open area, either splitting into smaller parties or fusing into larger ones, suggesting a fluid organization. Our data support the existence of neither a hamadryas baboon-like multilayered social organization nor a stable medium-sized multimale multifemale group as in savannah baboons. In light of our data we may need to revise the <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view</b> of baboon social systems and include space for greater variability of their social systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} intends {{to discuss the}} {{relations}} between learning and development, comparing the perspectives of Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky, as well as analyzing possible compatibility between the two theoretical positions. We demonstrate the different focuses these two authors take when dealing with the relation between learning and development. While Piaget focuses on maturational development, Vygotsky's efforts are centered on the relevance of learning. Their theoretical particularities general lead to the erroneous conclusion {{that there is an}} insoluble conflict between their positions. Without defending any complementarity between the two theories, we argue for a non-excluding or strictly <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view</b> between the two approaches, especially when dealing with reality and, more specifically, intervention practices, {{as is the case in}} school situation...|$|E

Results show that the use of mixed approaches is still low compared to the isolated use of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, denoting a <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view</b> involving the positivist and interpretativist paradigms in the research practice on the discipline. It concludes with suggestions for future studies, such as identifying researchers’ reasons for using, or not, mixed approaches and the respective difficulties, in order to further the debate on the research methods employed in the science of Administration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The use of contextual {{information}} in mobile devices is receiving increasing attention in mobile and ubiquitous computing research. An important requirement for mobile development {{today is that}} devices {{should be able to}} interact with the context. In this paper we present a series of contributions regarding previous work on context-awareness. In the first place, we describe a client-server architecture that provides a mechanism for preparing target non context-aware applications in order to be delivered as context-aware applications in a semiautomatic way. Secondly, the framework used in the server to instantiate specific components for context-awareness, the Implicit Plasticity Framework, provides independence from the underlying mobile technology used in client device, as it is shown in the case studies presented. Finally, proposed infrastructure deals with the interaction among different context constraints provided by diverse sensors. All of these contributions are extensions to the infrastructure based on the <b>Dichotomic</b> <b>View</b> of plasticity, which now offers multi-purpose support...|$|E

40|$|Maltreating {{and foster}} {{families}} belong to different research areas and have rarely been considered together. This exploratory study compared maltreating and foster families to demonstrate an integrated approach that overcomes the <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view</b> that often separates problematic families {{from those who}} have resources. This study had 81 participants: 48 maltreating parents and 33 foster parents and the children who were in foster care. We examined family functioning (FES), adult attachment styles (ASQ) and foster children’s strengths and difficulties (SDQ) in maltreating and foster families to examine the differences and similarities between families. Both types of families had significant differences on the FES and ASQ scales. Maltreating families had a stronger orientation to succeed and a family profile that was more orientated towards independence. Maltreating parents had higher scores on the scale that measured discomfort with closeness than foster families. However, both family types had a high level of confidence. Many foster children had SDQ scores that were in the borderline and problem categories. These components may promote a theoretical view of an integrated model for family and children’s problems that promotes children’s welfare and supports maltreating parents. Practitioners can build on parent’s strengths or protective factors and provide services to address less developed areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{submitted}} thesis {{deals with}} the <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view</b> on the integration of children, pupils and students with impaired hearing. It is mainly focused on {{the cooperation of the}} special pedagogues from special pedagogical centers for the hearing impaired with the pedagogues who integrate children, pupils and students with hearing impairment on the process of integrative education. The work is divided into five chapters. The first four chapters are concerned with the limitation of the basic concepts, the education of children, pupils and students with hearing impairment; further it {{deals with the}} school integration {{from the point of view}} of its development, with the integration of children, pupils and students with hearing impairment, with the significance of advisory workplaces in the process of the school education and with the cooperation of the special pedagogues from special pedagogical centers for the hearing impaired, and the pedagogues integrating children, pupils and students with hearing impairment. The fifth chapter is focused on the practical part and it occupies itself with the analysis of the questionnaire survey, which aim is to map the quality of cooperation of the special pedagogues from special pedagogical centers for hearing impaired with the pedagogues integrating children, pupils and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that ongoing {{activity}} fluctuations influence trial-by-trial perception of identical stimuli. Some brain systems seem to bias toward better perceptual performance and others toward worse. We tested whether these observations generalize to another as of yet unassessed sensory modality, audition, and a nonspatial but memory-dependent paradigm. In a sparse event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging design, we investigated detection of auditory near-threshold stimuli as a function of prestimulus baseline activity in early auditory cortex as well as several distributed networks that were defined on the basis of resting state functional connectivity. In accord with previous studies, hits were associated with higher prestimulus activity in related early sensory cortex as well as in a system comprising anterior insula, anterior cingulate, and thalamus, which other studies have related to processing salience and maintaining task set. In contrast to previous studies, however, higher prestimulus activity in the so-called dorsal attention system of frontal and parietal cortex biased toward misses, whereas higher activity in the so-called default mode network that includes posterior cingulate and precuneus biased toward hits. These results contradict a simple <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view</b> on the function of these two latter brain systems where higher ongoing activity in the dorsal attention network would facilitate perceptual performance, and higher activity in the defaul...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the works of}} V. S. Naipaul (1932 [...] ), a Trinidad born writer who has been settled in England since 1950. Naipaul is dislocated both from his ancestral motherland of India and from his home, Trinidad. Because of this doubly uprooted condition, the idea of rootlessness is essential to discussion of the author. This theme of rootlessness {{is one of the}} main subjects in my argument. In pursuing my argument, I will be particularly attentive to issues of space, which has inspired burgeoning interest and debate since the late 1960 s in the humanities and social sciences.;The first three chapters deal with Naipaul's fictional narratives, examining his differing treatments of the settings of Trinidad, metropolitan cities, and the former colonies. The fourth chapter will discuss Naipaul's two narratives about Trinidad's history, which reveal his skilful manoeuvring of spatial concepts for the benefit of the West Indies or Trinidad Indians. The fifth chapter will discuss Naipaul's narrative in his travelogues and his accounts of his travel. Naipaul's travelogues cover locations worldwide. However, because of his particular way of looking, his travelogues show some recurrence of observation and themes. Consequently, there emerges a geographical pattern in his presentation of the world. The sixth chapter will pay attention to the autobiographical aspects of Naipaul's writing. It will discuss the relationship between Naipaul's works and his own movements as a rootless writer. Overall, the argument reveals Naipaul's ambiguity as due to being caught in the tension between the <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view</b> of the world created by the ideology of imperialism and the counter disposition of hybridity fostered by his own rootless experience...|$|E

Programa de Pós-graduação em Letras/Inglês e {{literatura}} CorrespondenteMinorites have, {{during the}} last decades, manifested their dissatisfaction towards unequal civil rights all over the world. Homosexuals inparticular, both gay and lesbian, constitute groups that have fewer privileges than the heterosexual majority in society. Thus, homosexuals have pursued their civil rights and struggled, above all, for freedom of expression. Some out homosexuals participate in political activism as they pursue legal rights, and {{such is the case}} of Derek Jarman (1942 - 1994), an artist who used film as a medium to ideologically reflect upon the condition of gay males. Jarman appropriated Christopher Marlowe´s play Edward II and produced the screenplay Queer Edward II. The main point of this thesis is that Jarman´s choices imply a different cinematic perspective, namely, that of gays in contemporary society. Thus, what I have defined as queer aesthetics emerges if the visual effects of the film are considered. Nevertheless, Jarman´s Edward II does not actually offer a new form of social system, where gays might achieve power by being accepeted competitively in society. Jarman´s version ultimately restates the same prejudiced behaviour we find in Marlowe´s play, as he replaces the homophobic order by a heterophobic one. Moreover, Jarman ignores thart the formation of desire {{is a result of the}} social, historical, political and cultural variables. He appears to be ´trapped´ in the conventional <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view</b> of the genders which establishes difference so as to create social strratification where heterosexual white men are superior and women and gays are inferior. So, although Jarman´s Edward II shows the homosexuals´ strife for equal civil rights, it re-esrtablishes the prevailing socio-political system which in Jarman´s view should oppress heterosexuals...|$|E
40|$|The current {{dominant}} view of {{the visual}} system is marked by the functional and anatomical dissociation between a ventral stream specialised for perception and a dorsal stream specialised for action. The "double-dissociation" between visual agnosia (VA), a deficit of visual recognition, and optic ataxia (OA), a deficit of visuo-manual guidance, considered as consecutive to ventral and dorsal damage, respectively, has provided the main argument for this <b>dichotomic</b> <b>view.</b> In {{the first part of}} this paper, we show that the currently available empirical data do not suffice to support a double-dissociation between OA and VA. In the second part, we review evidence coming from human neuropsychology and monkey data, which cast further doubts on the validity of a simple double-dissociation between perception and action because they argue for a far more complex organisation with multiple parallel visual-to-motor connections: 1. A dorso-dorsal pathway (involving the most dorsal part of the parietal and pre-motor cortices) : for immediate visuo-motor control-with OA as typical disturbance. The latest research about OA is reviewed, showing how these patients exhibit deficits restricted to the most direct and fast visuo-motor transformations. We also propose that mild mirror ataxia, consisting of misreaching errors when the controlesional hand is guided to a visual goal though a mirror, could correspond to OA with an isolated "hand effect". 2. A ventral stream-prefrontal pathway (connections from the ventral visual stream to pre-frontal areas, by-passing the parietal areas) : for "mediate" control (involving spatial or temporal transpositions [Rossetti, Y., & Pisella, L. (2003). Mediate responses as direct evidence for intention: Neuropsychology of Not to-, Not now- and Not there-tasks. In S. Johnson (Ed.), Cognitive Neuroscience perspectives on the problem of intentional action (pp. 67 - 105). MIT Press. ]) -with VA as typical disturbance. Preserved visuo-manual guidance in patients with VA is restricted to immediate goal-directed guidance, they exhibit deficits for delayed or pantomimed actions. 3. A ventro-dorsal pathway (involving the more ventral part of the parietal lobe and the pre-motor and pre-frontal areas) : for complex planning and programming relying on high representational levels with a more bilateral organisation or an hemispheric lateralisation-with mirror apraxia, limb apraxia and spatial neglect as representatives. Mirror apraxia is a deficit that affects both hands after unilateral inferior parietal lesion with the patients reaching systematically and repeatedly toward the virtual image in the mirror. Limb apraxia is localized on a more advanced conceptual level of object-related actions and results from deficient integrative, computational and "working memory" capacities of the left inferior parietal lobule. A component of spatial working memory has recently been revealed also in spatial neglect consecutive to lesion involving the network of the right inferior parietal lobule and the right frontal areas. We conclude by pointing to the differential temporal constraints and integrative capabilities of these parallel visuo-motor pathways as keys to interpret the neuropsychological deficits...|$|E
