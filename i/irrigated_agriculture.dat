5|$|The Amorite Mari {{maintained}} the older {{aspects of the}} economy, which was still largely based on <b>irrigated</b> <b>agriculture</b> along the Euphrates valley. The city kept its trading role and was a center for merchants from Babylonia and other kingdoms, it received goods {{from the south and}} east through riverboats and distributed them north, north west and west. The main merchandises handled by Mari were metals and tin imported from the Iranian Plateau and then exported west as far as Crete. Other goods included copper from Cyprus, silver from Anatolia, woods from Lebanon, gold from Egypt, olive oil, wine, and textiles in addition to precious stones from modern Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the model}} by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it {{possible}} for the Chinese to develop <b>irrigated</b> <b>agriculture</b> early on. Although this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore {{to keep track of the}} income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural runoff {{containing}} {{pesticide residues}} {{has also been}} concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts. Toxins derived from pesticides have led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the Imperial Irrigation District with Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the New and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea {{are among the most}} polluted bodies of water in the United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds. Pollution from agricultural runoff {{is not limited to the}} lower river; the issue is also significant in upstream reaches such as Colorado's Grand Valley, also a major center of <b>irrigated</b> <b>agriculture.</b>|$|E

5|$|When the California Republic was assimilated {{into the}} United States in 1848, American {{settlers}} {{began to move}} into the Santa Ana River region in great numbers. The Mexican ranchos were divided into smaller individual properties, and <b>irrigated</b> <b>agriculture</b> began on a large scale. The city of Santa Ana Viejo, the original location of Santa Ana, was founded in this period. In 1854, Mormons settled in the upper Inland Empire area and started the city of San Bernardino, gaining prosperity by using water from the river, as well as Lytle Creek and Mill Creek, to irrigate crops. The cattle industry began to decline as farms began to replace ranches. Soon, white settlers in the region were more numerous than Hispanics as well. The California Gold Rush around this time was responsible for attracting many of these people to the state, but many remained in Southern California afterwards.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, barring {{intermittent}} passes and valleys (the major one being the corridor through Zhangjiakou and the Juyong Pass), the North China Plain remained shielded from the Mongolian steppe by the Yin Mountains. However, if this defence were breached, China's flat terrain offered no protection {{to the cities}} on the plain, including the imperial capitals of Beijing, Kaifeng, and Luoyang. Heading west along the Yin Mountains, the range ends where the Yellow River circles northwards upstream in the area known as the Ordos Looptechnically part of the steppe, but capable of <b>irrigated</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Although the Yellow River formed a theoretical natural boundary with the north, such a border so far into the steppe was difficult to maintain. The lands south of the Yellow River—the Hetao, the Ordos Desert, and the Loess Plateau—provided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley, the oft-called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi'an lay. As such, control of the Ordos remained extremely important for the rulers of China: not only for potential influence over the steppe, {{but also for the}} security of China proper. The region's strategic importance combined with its untenability led many dynasties to place their first walls here.|$|E

40|$|This chapter summarises the key {{insights}} {{from the case}} studies included in the book.

Next, it returns to the hypotheses presented in the book, and discusses the key conditioning factors in the technology-deforestation link. A number of factors determine the outcome. Among those, labour market effects and migration are critical in {{a majority of the}} cases. Another critical effect is that new technologies can help relax farmers' capital constraints, which may lead to higher or lower deforestation depending on how they invest their additional funds. The scale of adoption and the policy context are also critical conditioning factors...|$|R

30|$|Throughout history, {{cities have}} been at the heart of human {{development}} and technological advancements [1]. Although an element of planning can be discerned even in the earliest cities they have often evolved in response to the changing needs and aspirations of their inhabitants. Some cities have survived for millennia, including Rome, Athens, Cairo, Alexandra, Baghdad and Beijing, and are still flourishing. Other, once mighty, cities have disappeared, their ruins being unearthed by present-day archaeologists. A fascinating example, built by the Khmer civilisation, is Ankor Wat [2] in present day Cambodia, which boasted features very relevant to the design of future cities. Notable achievements by the ancient Khmer engineers were the control and distribution of water through a sophisticated canal system <b>irrigating</b> <b>agriculture</b> within the city bounds supplying citizens with ample food. The fundamental problems that the Khmer solved were the prevention of flooding by Monsoon rains, and storing water for the subsequent periods of drought. Despite its success over 8 centuries, AnkorWat collapsed in 1431 [3]. Climate change resulting in extended droughts {{is considered to be a}} contributory factor, which even the excellence of Khmer engineering was unable to counter.|$|R

25|$|Vietnam {{is one of}} {{the largest}} rice {{exporter}} since the late 1980s and early 1990s. Previous to the Doi Moi reforms initiated in 1986, the country was dependent on net imports of rice. After having changed the policies and opened the market, Vietnam was finally able to earn foreign exchange within these years and hence gain financial power. The domestic economy grew rapidly. Nowadays, <b>irrigated</b> <b>agriculture</b> is by far the largest water user and although the country is developing very fast, agriculture which is predicted to grow moderately remains to be an important employer in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Georgia has {{abundant}} water resources. Among {{the total}} water resources of 63 billion m3/year (long-term average) only 1.6 billion m3/year or about 2% are being abstracted. About {{two thirds of}} the abstracted water is used for <b>irrigated</b> <b>agriculture,</b> and the other third for municipal and industrial uses. Despite the abundance of water resources, the Eastern part of Georgia is relatively dry and is regularly affected by droughts. The country's major river, the Kura River, rises in Turkey and receives half of its flow from snowmelt and glaciers. The river, which flows from Georgia to Azerbaijan, is increasingly polluted downstream of Tbilisi.|$|E
25|$|The Strategy aims at {{increasing}} the profitability and competitiveness of <b>irrigated</b> <b>agriculture</b> through sustainable {{use of land}} and efficient water use.
