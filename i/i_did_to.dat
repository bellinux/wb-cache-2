500|$|With all appeal avenues {{exhausted}} and no further motivation to deny his crimes, Bundy agreed to speak frankly with investigators. To Keppel, {{he confessed to}} all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides {{for which he was}} the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities). He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain, but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of all the things <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> ," [...] he told Keppel, [...] "this is probably the one she is least likely to forgive me for. Poor Liz.") ...|$|E
500|$|The long-held view is {{that the}} Empress {{accepted}} the circumscribed role in which she found herself, and that her life, duty and purpose were tied to her position as the Emperor's wife. However, her personal letters reveal that she could be strongheaded, sometimes at odds with her husband, and had a life of her own—albeit somewhat restricted. In a letter written on 2 May 1845 she stated: [...] "I wait for the moment when we will meet, good Pedro, and seek forgiveness for all that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> you during these days." [...] In another letter of 24 January 1851, she acknowledged her difficult temperament: [...] "I am not irritated at you [...] and you should forgive me because this is my character." ...|$|E
500|$|The filming {{was done}} rather discreetly, fearing {{opposition}} against the film's underlying {{subject matter of}} homosexuality. Among the crew members, only a core group {{were aware of the}} details of the plot, and {{to the rest of the}} crew it was a road trip film, one identical to Dil Chahta Hai (2001). During the filming of a scene where Pandit kisses Ganesh in the outdoors, the crew members were taken aback as most of them were unaware of any romantic involvement among the two lead characters. Pandit especially found the rape scene difficult to shoot, because of the emotional weight that it carried: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> overcome my revulsion was to not stand judgment over my character Jai's action. I just went with how Jai reacted to the given situation." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming {{involving}} the reptiles frequently {{proved to be}} hazardous. During a promotional shoot with Supermarionation puppets, one of the crocodiles suddenly grabbed the Lady Penelope marionette (which {{does not appear in}} the episode) and, to the upset of Glanville, ripped apart one the legs. During the filming of a scene in which an alligator swims after a boat, Meddings was using a rope to guide the crocodile forwards when it was discovered that the animal had slipped out of its harness; in his book, 21st–Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: [...] "My crew never saw me move as fast as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> get out of the tank when I pulled the rope and realised the creature was free." [...] Of the largest crocodile, which was wetted with damp strips {{at the back of the}} stage while un-used, Wingrove recalls: [...] "You would forget that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and we turned round to see this big crocodile walking across the stage – which cleared of people very quickly!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1968 three-term US Representative Edward Gurney {{sought the}} Florida U.S. Senate seat vacated by the {{retirement}} of Democrat George Smathers. Former Governor LeRoy Collins, an ally of retiring President Lyndon B. Johnson, was the Democratic nominee. Cramer and Gurney were prospective primary opponents until Cramer yielded to Gurney. They based this on an understanding that Gurney would thereafter back Cramer for the other Senate seat, which {{was expected to be}} vacated by Spessard Holland in 1970. According to Cramer, Gurney [...] "pledged his support to me, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> him, and we shook hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{participated in}} the Titan's Training Camp in Clarksville & Nashville, Tennessee which started July 25. Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ... (It's) just making sure I let him know some of the things <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> learn the playbook quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{interested}} {{to hear him}} express as his opinion what I had written him some time ago {{in one of my}} letters, to the effect that if Germany won it would change the course of our civilization and make the United States a military nation. He also spoke of his deep regret, as indeed <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>to</b> him in that same letter, that it would check his policy for a better international ethical code. [...] He felt deeply the destruction of Louvain , and I found him as unsympathetic with the German attitude as is the balance of America. He goes even further than I in his condemnation of Germany's part in this war, and almost allows his feeling to include the German people as a whole rather than the leaders alone. He said German philosophy was essentially selfish and lacking in spirituality. When I spoke of the Kaiser building up the German machine as a means of maintaining peace, he said, [...] "What a foolish thing it was to create a powder magazine and risk someone's dropping a spark into it!" [...] He thought the war would throw the world back three or four centuries. I did not agree with him. He was particularly scornful of Germany’s disregard of treaty obligations, and was indignant at the German Chancellor’s designation of the Belgian Treaty as being [...] "only a scrap of paper"....But although the personal feeling of the President was with the Allies, he insisted then and for many months after, that this ought not to affect his political attitude, which he intended should be one of strict neutrality. [...] He felt that he owed it to the world to prevent the spreading of the conflagration, that he owed it to the country to save it from the horrors of war.|$|E
