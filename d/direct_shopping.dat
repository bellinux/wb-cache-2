40|$|Electronic {{shopping}} {{will be a}} large industry {{within a}} few years. Both the interactive TV and on-line service providers are rushing to bring this application to the home. Systems that have been built so far {{have a number of}} serious flaws that will limit their success. They are designed to support only a few vendors when vigorous competition to produce innovative "virtual " store design is needed. They are meant for efficient <b>directed</b> <b>shopping,</b> while many shoppers prefer to browse. The social component of shopping has been completely ignored by these systems. To be more interesting to browse we need to include not only vendors but also information providers. This thesis will describe the INFOBazaar system designed to solve these deficiencies and others. The INFOBazaar is a free-form, ever changing collection of vendors of goods, information, and services that encourages <b>directed</b> <b>shopping</b> and browsing that introduces socializing to electronic shopping...|$|R

A quantitative survey with a sample of 300 consumers living in south Italy was conducted to explore consumers' knowledge and attitudes toward labelling of organic and fair trade products.

The results indicate significant differences in consumer attitudes and behavior for ethical products and show the importance of new variables, other than demographics characteristics, that can influence the purchasing behavior and label information use...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{examines}} {{the role of}} labelling and certification schemes {{in the pursuit of}} policies to make production and consumption processes more sustainable. From a logical point of view, labels are conceived as claims put forward by sellers to inform buyers about certain characteristics of their products. In the case of sustainability, labels might identify relevant ‘ideals ’ to approach and/or significant ‘ills ’ to escape. Toulmin’s argumentation theory is used to show how claims can be substantiated and challenged. Based on literature on the behaviour of the main stakeholders, the author discusses what labelling means for producers, consumers, policymakers and other groups in society. In the conclusions, attention is drawn {{to the way in which}} societal pressure might interact with market forces to shape the information environment for products and services. As a result, the role of sustainability labels might become more differentiated, varying from <b>direct</b> <b>shopping</b> aids to background qualit...|$|E

Labels may be an instrument for establishing product differentiation, differentiation across food categories and within a specific category. The objectives for this study are to quantify the extent of consumer awareness, knowledge and behaviour in relation to food labelling, in order to analyse if labelling is a valid tool of <b>direct</b> <b>shopping</b> aid and what are the limits of labelling effects. To collect data a questionnaire was administered to a sample of 400 consumers living in Campania. Data generated in this way are submitted to exploratory and segmentation analysis in order to understand what drives high or low label element use.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine {{the role of}} {{labelling}} and certification schemes {{in the pursuit of}} policies to make production and consumption processes more sustainable. I combine a logical analysis of labels with a behavioural analysis of their functions for stakeholders. From a logical point of view, labels are conceived as claims put forward by sellers to in-form buyers and other economic agents about certain characteristics of their products or services. In the case of sustainability, labels might identify relevant 'ideals ' to approach (e. g., eco-efficiency) and/or significant 'ills ' to escape (e. g., dependence on pesticide use or labour in sweatshops). I use Toulmin's argumentation theory to show how claims can be substantiated and challenged. Based on literature on the behaviour of the main stakeholders, I discuss what labelling means for producers, consumers, policymakers and other groups in society. In my conclusions, I draw attention {{to the way in which}} societal pressure might interact with market forces to shape the information environment for products and services.

40|$|Journal articleWhile {{international}} studies show ample evidence of information privacy concerns, {{there is a}} lack of knowledge on South African consumers’ opinion on information privacy and their shopping behaviour, especially within a direct marketing context. The objectives of the study included the dependency between age and level of education and knowledge about information protection practices; the privacy concerns of direct and non-direct shoppers; and the <b>direct</b> <b>shopping</b> behaviour of victims versus non-victims. A probability (systematic) sampling design was used to draw a representative sample of households with listed telephone numbers in the different provincial Telkom telephone directories. The sample units were randomly selected, after which 800 telephone interviews were conducted with adults from these households. Findings include that: the level of awareness of name removal procedures is not dependent on age or educational level; direct shoppers and non-direct shoppers differ in terms of their concern for solicitation practices and victims and non-victims differ in terms of their Internet shopping behaviour. The results from the study suggest that the ability to gather and maintain personal information does not necessarily imply that direct marketers are successful in establishing meaningful relationships with consumers. Direct marketing organisations need to be cautious of how they use consumers’ collected information and attend to several privacy issues if they want to facilitate relational exchanges between themselves and consumers...|$|E
