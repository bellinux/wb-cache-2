The Secretary and I dined to-day at Parson's Green, at my Lord Peterborow's house, who has left it and his gardens to the Secretary during his absence. It is the finest garden I have ever seen about this town; and {{abundance}} of hot walls for grapes, where they are in great plenty, and ripening fast. I durst not eat any fruit but one fig; but I brought a basket full to my friend Lewis here at Windsor. Does Stella never eat any? what, no apricots at Donnybrook! nothing but claret and ombre! I envy people maunching and maunching peaches and grapes, and I not daring to eat a bit. My head is pretty well, only a sudden turn any time makes me giddy for a moment, and sometimes it feels very stuffed; but if it grows no worse, I can bear it very well. I take all opportunities of walking; and we have a delicious park here <b>just</b> <b>joining</b> to the Castle, and an avenue in the great park very wide and two miles long, set with a double row of elms on each side. Were you ever at Windsor? I was once, a great while ago; but had quite forgotten it.|$|E

5000|$|Others have defended him. Driver and {{commentator}} Anthony Davidson {{said that}} Tilke [...] "understands {{the demands of}} the modern cars...he gives us run-off areas and it's all well thought out. They are enjoyable to race on because they suit modern F1 cars. At a track like Silverstone you do not get as much overtaking because it was designed for cars that were slower and did not depend on downforce for speed. But the circuits designed in recent years have a long straight and bigger braking zone." [...] He particularly praised Turn Eight of Istanbul Park. Similar praise has come from Clive Bowen, the managing director of Apex Circuit Design (Tilke's business partner in several large projects including Sepang International Circuit and Bahrain International Circuit), who called Istanbul [...] "a technical and aesthetic tour de force". He also defended Tilke's safety-enforced changes to existing tracks, noting: [...] "By cutting off that long blast down through the woods at Hockenheim he was <b>just</b> <b>joining</b> the dots - he did not have much room for manoeuvre." ...|$|E

5000|$|Focusing on the {{internal}} aspect of communications, will allow external networks to trust the business by having the right perspective on the processes which may occur. This {{is due to the}} fact that communication is vital to sustain, especially when partnering with another company; whether its through merging or <b>just</b> <b>joining</b> a particular project. Therefore, the ability of associating with the right businesses is relevant in order to keep the company more innovative; as networks allow for [...] " [...] an effective transfer of information". In addition, by gaining connections through networks; it can provide employee's, managers or owners to develop personal networks that can benefit oneself in the long term whether its towards a new entrepreneurial business plan, a project or even an incident that may occur within the business. An example is an entrepreneurial designer who used his personal connections in the industry to seek a potential supplier in China to continue developing his new business plan. This emphasizes on why obtaining and sustaining relations is beneficial for a business. Moreover, communication links with relationship marketing perfectly as both focus towards activities directed as establishing, developing and maintaining successful exchanges with customers and other constituents.

5000|$|From Bob Dyer's column [...] "Dyer Streets" [...] in the Akron Beacon Journal..."Victory for Vern" [...] We {{have lost}} our Vodom.Unlike losing your mojo, losing your Vodom {{is a good}} thing.For those of you <b>just</b> <b>joining</b> us, Akron City Council voted in 2002 to rename Wooster Avenue to honor a legendary local civil rights leader named Vernon Odom.But the bill's sponsor, Marco Sommerville — {{operating}} {{on the assumption that}} everyone who worked for the city was familiar with the man — scrawled out a quick Post-It Note to the street department requesting signs for the new V Odom Boulevard.The street department took him literally and created V Odom street signs, then passed along his request, verbatim, to the Ohio Department of Transportation, which is responsible for the big signs on the interstates.Thus, we were Vodomized.The word Vodom entered the local lexicon, turning the honor into a joke.Fortunately, Odom's first name wasn't Sam, Stu or Stan. But still — this certainly wasn't what his friends and colleagues had in mind.Now, finally, freeway drivers have been fully introduced to Vernon Odom.Unfortunately, a few signshere and there have retained their Vodomism — including one marking the boulevard's exit off of another boulevard named for one of Odom's college classmates — Martin Luther King Jr.But perhaps in another six years we can fix those, too.|$|E

40|$|This Essay {{examines}} {{the debate over}} how the WTO and the public interact. Since the mass public is cacophonous, the debate centers on what role NGOs should play in the WTO.

Part I provides background for readers <b>just</b> <b>joining</b> the debate. Part II gives {{an overview of the}} major developments {{over the past three years}} (1998 - 2000). Parts III and IV offer a synthesis of the key issues. Part III presents the Statist perspective for why the WTO should deny deeper participation to NGOs. Part IV counters with the Individualist perspective for why the WTO should broaden its participation beyond governments to include NGOs. (Part IV reflects the author 2 ̆ 7 s own views.)

40|$|The homolosine projection, {{popular in}} atlases, was first {{described}} by Professor J. P. Goode in 1925. This projection uses {{a combination of}} the homolographic (Mollweide 1805) and the sinusoidal (variously attributed to Mercator, Sanson, or Flamsteed) projections. Goode's procedure was to use the sinusoidal projection, because of its supposedly superior properties, in the latitude interval from 40. 93. degrees south to 40. 7366 degrees north, and to use Mollweide's projection, from there as far as the poles, for a comparable reason. The particular latitude chosen is where the two projections coincide if the maps are laid on top of each other, or as Professor Goode states "have the same scale". The resulting pseudocylindrical projection has a discontinuity in the first derivatives at the join, and this can be seen by the user as a small kink in the curvature of the meridians. The kink can be avoided by blending the projections instead of <b>just</b> <b>joining</b> them. This blending is achieved by using a tapered weighted average of the two projections causing them t...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the factors that affected the implementation of ACCESS PA, a technological innovation, in forty-seven high school libraries in Pennsylvania. The researcher sent a fifteen-item questionnaire to forty-seven high school librarians in each high school in two intermediate units in south central Pennsylvania. After the data from questionnaires were analyzed a focus group was formed in each intermediate unit to discuss how broadly accepted ACCESS PA was by the faculty and the learners. Also, discussed were recommendations to librarians <b>just</b> <b>joining</b> the ACCESS PA project. ^ The researcher found {{that the quality of}} relationships that high school librarians had with their faculties and learners was an important factor in how successfully they implemented the ACCESS PA project. The quality of their relationships also effected how well they networked with other librarians in their consortiums. The opportunity to network with other librarians was of great help in the successful implementation of ACCESS PA. The ACCESS PA project expanded the resources available to the faculty and learners. The ease with which learners can now obtain resource materials has improved the quality of their research. The continuation of the project has focused attention on the need to provide regular training and staff development for project participants. ...|$|E
