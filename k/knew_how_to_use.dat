5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with {{a common set of}} tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E

The study, by ACER Research Fellow Ms Catherine Underwood, examined the extent <b>to</b> which knowing <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mobile phone is correlated with children’s physical activity and ability to move through their neighbourhood without adult supervision, also known as independent mobility. More than 800 Victorian primary school children aged between 8 and 12 years participated in the research, of which 84 per cent reported they <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mobile phone. The study revealed that 70 per cent of children who <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mobile phone reported that they are allowed to go outside and play with other children, compared to only 51 per cent of children who do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mobile phone...|$|R
25|$|Over time, Blaichman's unit {{increased}} in size. They {{were joined by}} refugees from Markuszow and expanded to sixty fighters. In the spring of 1943, Blaichman encountered Samuel Gruber. Gruber's group consisted of men who had fought in the Polish Army and <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> explosives and mines. The two groups joined together and became a more effective fighting force. By September 1943, the Polish People's Army realized that the Blaichman and Gruber groups could be a dependable ally {{in the fight against}} the Germans and provided them with supplies that had been parachuted in by the Soviet air force. Now equipped with hand grenades, explosives, land mines, machine guns, and ammunition, the group could be even more successful in fighting the Germans.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} factors {{influenced}} the opera's very favourable reception. The initial cast contained leading singers of the period and, as it changed, equally brilliant stars (e.g. Falcon) were introduced as replacements. The sensational plot and the notoriety of the Nuns' ballet ensured that the opera was a hot topic in journals and reviews. This was assisted by the marketing skills of the director Véron and the publisher Schlesinger. The scenery was of exceptional quality: [...] "This was as much an opera to see as to hear, {{and it has been}} argued that the real hero behind Robert le diable was Cicéri, the designer." [...] Meyerbeer was keen to keep influential persons on his side. For example, he sent free tickets for 'a good box' to Heinrich Heine. And of course the businessman Véron <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> (and pay) the claque and its leader Augustin Levasseur.|$|E
500|$|Homework success brought {{worldwide}} {{attention to}} French progressive house music, and {{drew attention to}} French house music. According to The Village Voice, the album revived house music and departed from the Euro dance formula. In the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, critic Alex Rayner stated that Homework tied the established club styles to the [...] "burgeoning eclecticism" [...] of big beat. He contended that it served as a proof that [...] "there was more to dance music than pills and keyboard presets." [...] Clash described Homework as an entry point of accessibility for a [...] "burgeoning movement {{on the cusp of}} splitting the mainstream seam." [...] In 2009, Brian Linder of IGN described Homework as the duo's third-best album. He catalogued as a [...] "groundbreaking achievement" [...] the way they used their unique skills to craft the house, techno, acid and punk music styles into the record. Hua Hsu of eMusic agreed, applauding Homework for how it captured a [...] "feeling of discovery and exploration" [...] as a result of [...] "years of careful study of the finest house, techno, electro and hip-hop records." [...] David Browne, writing in Entertainment Weekly, stated that the duo <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> [...] "their playful, hip-hopping ambient techno" [...] to craft the album. He named Homework the [...] "ideal disco for androids". Sean Cooper of AllMusic called the album [...] "an almost certain classic" [...] and [...] "essential".|$|E

The prince accepted the challenge until he learned he would be fighting one not of royal blood and so killed himself rather than having to “soil his hands”. Fernao Nunes and the Persian envoy Adbur Razzak relate that Deva Raya II survived an assassination attempt “as {{he was a man who}} <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> both sword and dagger better than anyone in his kingdom, avoided by twists and turns of his body the thrusts aimed at him, freed himself from him, and slew him with a short sword that he had.” ...|$|E

[...] He was accused by the FBI of improperly copying computer source code that performs [...] "sophisticated, high-speed and high-volume trades on various stock and commodity markets", as described by Goldman. The events leading to his arrest are covered by Michael Lewis in his 2014 book Flash Boys. According to Assistant United States Attorney Joseph Facciponti, [...] "the bank has raised {{the possibility that there}} is a danger that somebody who <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways." [...] Aleynikov acknowledged downloading some source code, but maintained that his intent was to collect exclusively open-source software that is not proprietary to his then-employer.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent {{attempts}} to replicate Bailén proved particularly dangerous for Spanish units recruited and equipped {{in the chaos}} of French military occupation and counterinsurgency: [...] "The raw levies that formed {{the bulk of the}} Spanish forces proved incapable of manoeuvring {{in the face of the}} enemy, whilst many of them barely <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> their weapons, having sometimes only been issued with muskets the day before they went into action." [...] These untrained recruits typically broke ranks when assaulted by the French regulars, [...] "accusing their commanders of treason and leaving the few [...] regulars involved to fend for themselves as best they could. Having run away, meanwhile, the levies invariably exposed themselves to the French cavalry, which were unleashed amongst them with terrible effect, sabring them unmercifully and taking hundreds of them prisoner." [...] Wellington, as allied commander, would inherit this [...] "Bailén syndrome" [...] and attempt to restrain the ardour of the Spanish under his command: ...|$|E

2500|$|Compared to most {{domestic}} dogs, {{the bark}} of a dingo is short and monosyllabic. During observations, the barking of Australian dingoes was shown to have a relatively small variability; sub-groups of bark types, common among domestic dogs, could not be found. Furthermore, only 5% of the observed vocalisations were made up of barking. Australian dingoes bark only in swooshing noises or in a mixture atonal/tonal. Also, barking is almost exclusively used for giving warnings. Warn-barking in a homotypical sequence {{and a kind of}} [...] "warn-howling" [...] in a heterotypical sequence has also been observed. The bark-howling starts with several barks and then fades into a rising and ebbing howl and is probably, similarly to coughing, used to warn the puppies and members of the pack. Additionally, dingoes emit a sort of [...] "wailing" [...] sound, which they mostly use when approaching a water hole, probably to warn already present dingoes. According to the present state of knowledge, {{it is not possible to}} get Australian dingoes to bark more frequently by making them associate with other domestic dogs. However, Alfred Brehm reported a dingo that completely learned the more [...] "typical" [...] form of barking and <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it, while its brother did not. Whether dingoes bark or bark-howl less frequently in general is not sure.|$|E
2500|$|Moore also {{analyzed}} the case under the precedents {{set by the}} [...] "dissemination" [...] cases. In discussing the pertinence of In re Klopfenstein, Moore analyzed each of that case's four requirements for patent invalidity due to public disseminations. According to Moore, the Live Traffic paper was available on the FTP server 24 hours per day for seven days, longer than the three days during which the posters from In re Klopfenstein were displayed. Thus, the Live Traffic paper met the first requirement of being available for longer than a transient period. Moreover, SRI had admitted during oral arguments that the target audience of the paper was members of the Internet security community. The defendants showed that this community included people who <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> SRI's FTP server and actually used it to share information. Thus, the FTP server met the second requirement of being accessible to experts in the field. Furthermore, neither Porras nor SRI took any {{steps to ensure that}} the paper would not be copied. Porras emailed links to the paper to many people outside of SRI and failed to take protective measures such as non-disclosure agreements or even disclaimers. Thus, the Live Traffic paper met the third requirement of failing to create a reasonable expectation that the work would not be copied. Finally, {{the very nature of the}} Live Traffic paper as an electronic document forced it to meet the fourth requirement that the document be easy to copy. Thus, Moore held that the [...] "dissemination" [...] cases clearly showed that the Live Traffic paper was publicly accessible.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1942 Gale was {{promoted}} to Deputy Director of Staff Duties at the War Office, and he passed command of the brigade over to Flavell. Flavell, promoted to brigadier, transferred command of 2nd Parachute Battalion to Major Gofton-Salmond, and {{in the beginning of}} November the brigade was sent to North Africa as part of Operation Torch. Because of a shortage of aircraft, the 3rd Parachute Battalion was forced to travel separately from the brigade, arriving on 11 November; the rest of the brigade, including Flavell, arrived the next day. He commanded the brigade for the whole of the period that it fought in North Africa, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order {{at the end of the}} brigade's service in the theatre; the citation stated that Flavell and the brigade had [...] "fought magnificently and set a standard to the 1st Army difficult to emulate." [...] Under his command the brigade had sustained 1,700 casualties and taken more than 3,500 Axis prisoners, as well as winning eight Distinguished Service Orders, fifteen Military Crosses, nine Distinguished Conduct Medals and twenty-two Military Medals. Flavell had a difficult time commanding the brigade while it was in North Africa. He was hampered by the fact that there were no senior officers who <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> airborne forces properly and efficiently, meaning that the airborne missions that were given to the brigade were often unsuitable to its abilities. The same problems occurred when it was used in a ground role, for which it was considered to be unsuited, and Flavell found it difficult to prevent this occurring.|$|E
