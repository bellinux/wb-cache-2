5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>true!</b> (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E
25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>true</b> of me? Sure.

2500|$|The mood of Arnold's poetry {{tends to}} be of plaintive reflection, and he is {{restrained}} in expressing emotion. He felt that poetry should be the 'criticism of life' and express a philosophy. Arnold's philosophy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>true</b> happiness comes from within, and that people should seek within themselves for good, while being resigned in acceptance of outward things and avoiding the pointless turmoil of the world. However, he argues {{that we should not}} live in the belief that we shall one day inherit eternal bliss. If we are not happy on earth, we should moderate our desires rather than live in dreams of something that may never be attained.

2500|$|A {{number of}} criticisms {{surrounding}} the Confucius Institutes stem from {{their relationships with}} the Chinese government, through the Office of Chinese Language Council International or [...] "Hanban". The Hanban website states that Confucius Institutes and Classrooms are non-profit educational institutions, but they have close ties to several senior Communist Party officials, including the current Hanban chair and Politburo member Liu Yandong, who was formerly head of the United Front Work Department. The Hanban members encompass twelve Chinese government institutions, from the Ministry of Education to the State Council Information Office (or [...] "Office of Foreign Propaganda") and the National Development and Reform Commission, [...] "through organizations dealing with Finance, Overseas Chinese, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade, Culture and all the media organizations." [...] "United Front Work" [...] {{is a concept that}} harks back to the Chinese civil war and refers to [...] "Beijing’s efforts to identify friends and isolate enemies.

Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute, testified the United Front Work Department's purpose [...] "is subversion, cooption and control," [...] and claimed one of the CI's chief purposes is [...] "to subvert, coopt, and ultimately control Western academic discourse on matters pertaining to China." ...|$|E

60|$|Now such an {{argument}} {{is not hard}} to follow; and if it <b>is</b> granted <b>that</b> its premisses <b>are</b> <b>true</b> in fact, no one will deny that the conclusion must also be true. But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a general logical principle. The logical principle is as follows: 'Suppose it known <b>that</b> if this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> Suppose it also known <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then it follows <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> true.' When it <b>is</b> the case <b>that</b> if this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> we shall say that this 'implies' that, and that that 'follows from' this. Thus our principle states that if this implies <b>that,</b> and this <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> In other words, 'anything implied by a true proposition is true', or 'whatever follows from a true proposition is true'.|$|R
