50|$|In 2008, Hauwanga was {{involved}} in a legal saga with another prominent businessman, Harold Pupkewitz. The legal showdown that erupted was over money that the BH businesses claim to have lost in non-existent orders and deliveries from Pupkewitz: the amount of money in discussion was N$4 947 250.60. The dispute arose from payments that BH Motor Spares alleges to have made to Pupkewitz for goods that they had neither ordered nor received from the motoring mogul. BH claims that Pupkewitz invoiced and collected money for the orders. The sum of N$4 947 250.60 is accordingly <b>due,</b> owing <b>and</b> <b>payable</b> by the defendant to the plaintiff which sum, the defendant, despite demand, fails and/or refuse to pay to the plaintiff.|$|R
5000|$|The small member base of {{the agency}} was elitist-oriented, but {{another reason for the}} lack of a [...] "grass-roots" [...] {{following}} was the organization's insistence on having <b>dues</b> <b>payable,</b> <b>and</b> four reference signatures, to become a member. Moreover, there were different fee scales: two Louis per year for those who lived in Paris, and 24 livres per year for those living in the provinces. Undoubtedly, the membership practices of La Société des Amis des Noirs both hampered its attempt at increasing in size, and affected its ability to become a credible and effective entity. These prerequisites to membership, along with a weak structural foundation and somewhat ill-prepared organization, compromised La Société des Amis des Noirs' contribution to the fight against slavery.|$|R
6000|$|On November 1st, the Chinese Government {{failed to}} meet an [...] {{obligation}} of $5,600,000, <b>due</b> <b>and</b> <b>payable</b> to a large [...] banking-house in Chicago.

In the meantime, the American bankers of the new [...] international consortium had offered {{to advance to the}} Chinese [...] Government an amount which would cover the loan in default, [...] together with other obligations already in arrears, and still [...] others which will fall due on December 1st; and this proposal had [...] also received the full and energetic support of the Department of [...] State. That is to say, American financiers and politicians were [...] at one and the same time the heroes and villains of the piece; [...] having co-operated {{in the creation of a}} dangerous situation, they [...] came forward handsomely in the hour of trial with an offer to [...] save China from themselves as it were, if the Chinese Government [...] would only enter into relations with the consortium, and thus [...] prepare the way for the eventual establishment of an American [...] financial protectorate.|$|E
