The source behind the myth {{was a study}} from the 1930s which misplaced a decimal point and thus made it appear as if spinach contained ten times as much iron as <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

Lee Strasberg hasn't been given the credit he deserves... Next to Charlie, it sort of launched me. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>did.</b> That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting." ...|$|E

"I {{tried to}} put {{different}} things in the video {{that made me feel}} under pressure and <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>did!</b> It was the hardest video I`ve ever done so I kept thinking, why on earth did I come up with this concept? People don’t realise but I definitely have that Australian tomboy side to me. I love snakes and sharks and jumping out of planes and stuff. Growing up {{it never occurred to me}} that it wasn’t a girly thing to ride a bike, covered in mud holding frogs and collecting lizards!".|$|E

500|$|The Gestapo {{investigated}} the 20 July plot thoroughly, so filmmakers {{had access to}} much documentation as they integrated the historical account with [...] "Hollywood factors" [...] in producing Valkyrie. Peter Hoffmann, {{professor of history at}} McGill University and a leading authority on the German Resistance, was a consultant for the filmmakers. Hoffmann spoke of the film's accuracy, [...] " [...] gives a fundamentally accurate portrait of Stauffenberg and the conspirators. There are details which must be counted as liberties. But, fundamentally, the film is decent, respectful and represents the spirit of the conspiracy." [...] The Scotsman reported of the film's accuracy, [...] "Valkyrie ... sticks pretty closely to the story of the failed conspiracy to topple the Nazi regime ... it implies that the plot came closer to success than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>did.</b> But the basic facts are all present and correct." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Exit" [...] {{was created}} {{on the final}} day of {{recording}} for The Joshua Tree. It developed from a lengthy jam that the band recorded in a single take. Producer Daniel Lanois said, [...] "it was a long jam, and there was just this one section of it that had some kind of magic to it, and we just decided to turn it into something." [...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room... and sometimes things get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control in the sense that you don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and it makes people do things." ...|$|E
500|$|Slay Tracks found {{unexpected}} attention {{after the}} Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present covered [...] "Box Elder" [...] {{on their own}} 1990 EP, Brassneck. The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to Slay Tracks by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present cover {{is different from the}} original in that the line [...] "that I had to {{get the fuck out of}} this town" [...] was changed to [...] "that I had to get right out of this town". The [...] "Box Elder" [...] cover received radio airplay from influential English disc jockey John Peel, which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered [...] "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people could do that, so I was all offended." [...] However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: [...] "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, but <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>did,</b> and I'll always be grateful to them for that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013 Ella {{reflected}} on her time with Killing Heidi {{and the likelihood}} of any reunion, [...] "I don't think I could sing such youthful, and youth based songs convincingly any more. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> just run its natural course and I {{think it would be very}} unnatural to start it up again now." [...] Aside from the Verses, Ella has a career as a solo performer, radio presenter and TV personality.

2500|$|Hill was a Peace Corps {{volunteer}} in Cameroon from 1974 to 1976. Hill credits {{his work with}} the Peace Corps for teaching him his first lessons in diplomacy. As a volunteer, Hill worked with credit unions and when he discovered that one board of directors had stolen 60 percent of their members' money, he reported on the malfeasance to their members, who promptly re-elected them because the board reflected carefully balanced tribal interests and <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not matter to the members if the board directors ran a good credit union or not. Hill said the lesson was that [...] "When something's happened, it's happened for a reason and you do your best to understand that reason. But don't necessarily think you can change it."
