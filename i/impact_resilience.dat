40|$|As {{the final}} {{empirical}} {{contribution to this}} book, this Chapter 11 adds to the insights developed in Chapter 10 on how international policy and politics shape, either positively or negatively, resilience to the environmental dangers posed by armed conflict. Building on the preceding chapter, we further scrutinize the assumption that development aid depends on socioeconomic, rather than political, considerations. We find that overseas development aid per capita in Lebanon is positively linked to not merely GDP, {{but also to the}} occurrence of armed conflict. This highlights the importance of political factors in aid allocation. Thus, it could be suggested, conflict itself generates the aid that can contribute to the resilience that is needed to minimize the effects of the conflict. Exploring this thesis, the chapter offers an in-depth examination of the motivations that drive aid allocation and absorption and, as such, <b>impact</b> <b>resilience.</b> In particular, we explore how the idea, and the practical interpretation and implementation, of a social contract determine the effect of international aid and hence the contribution such aid might make to a country’s resilience to conflict-generated environmental hazards...|$|E

40|$|Resilience {{is usually}} {{considered}} {{as the ability}} of network fault tolerance. To improve the resilience of MANET, fault tolerance strategies such as routing protocols are usually employed which will <b>impact</b> <b>resilience</b> of MANET. For resilience measurement and fault tolerance strategies’ efficiency evaluation, the impact of fault tolerance strategies deserves a detailed study. However, the general MANET resilience measurement methods do not consider the fault tolerance strategies as individual resilience influence factors, let alone reflecting the interplay among strategies that deployed on different network layers. Thus, it results in a limitation on efficiency assessment of fault tolerance strategies. In this paper, it models fault tolerance strategies for MANET resilience measurement with considering strategies as individual resilience influence factors. Firstly, through analyzing the features of fault tolerance strategies that deployed on physical and logical layers of network, we built a hierarchical network model to describe the resilience impact of strategies. Then, based on this network model, we proposed fault tolerance strategies model to measure resilience of MANET. Particularly, the model can well support the interplay study among different strategies through contrasting the quantitative value defined by strategy model. At last, a case study was given for verification and analysis...|$|E
30|$|As {{a general}} lesson for {{applying}} {{this type of}} resilience assessment, one should note that the overall resilience score (medians, aggregated over the participants and the six resilience principles) averages {{out some of the}} more interesting differentiations that can be spotted among the disaggregated scores (cf. Wilk and Jonsson 2013). The overall resilience scores are good at distinguishing options that have a broad positive impact on resilience (i.e. positive on multiple principles) from those that have a broad negative impact. Those that are more tailored, and have a more narrow impact (i.e. influence only one or two principles) show up as ‘neutral’, which may not do justice to their actual impact. The scores on individual resilience principles provide a better diagnostic of the mechanisms that the options use to <b>impact</b> <b>resilience.</b> Since specific resilience principles influence resilience in different ways (described as ‘Primary Mechanisms’ in Table  2), this can provide important insights into any gaps or weaknesses in the package of options. For instance, some principles focus on absorbing impacts, while others enhance recovery, self-organisation, and (autonomous) adaptation. It can be telling (and possibly undesirable—but this is an interpretation that is up to the local decision-makers) if specific principles or even specific mechanisms are uncovered.|$|E

Beach geomorphology affects calculated vulnerability by influencing process’s intensity and the ability of the beach to cope the <b>impacts</b> (<b>resilience).</b> Results showed that regarding wave-induced inundation, the highest vulnerable area is the Ebro delta (Catalan coast) due to a combination of storm properties and the existence of a very low-lying profile. On the other hand, when considering the storm-induced erosion, Lido di Dante (Italy) is the highest vulnerable area because although the estimated erosion is not the largest one, the beach width is narrower than in the other sites. In any case, actual beach width at the three sites exceeds the estimated shoreline retreat. According to the obtained results the main induced process affecting coastal vulnerability is inundation...|$|R

To generalize previous results, we accommodate general utility functions, {{as well as}} general order book shapes and volume <b>impact</b> <b>resilience</b> function. By using Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP), the problem is formulated as a singular stochastic control problem. The theory of viscosity solutions of second-order PDEs helps us to identify the value function as the unique solution of a variational inequality, and {{we are able to}} numerically calculate it and the corresponding optimal strategy. The generality of the stochastic control approach makes it relatively simple to extend our results to the same problem with an additional budget constraint. Several examples of numerical calculations are presented to show the qualitative behavior of the optimal strategy and how they relate to human intuition. As an aside, we discovered an innovative way to apply the Dynamic Programming Prin-ciple to singular stochastic control problems, and obtained an equation different from the traditional variational inequality. In particular, this new equation leads us to a closed-form solution of the value function in a special case. The arguments leading to the equation are heuristic and we still do not have a general proof to justify the validity of the equation. iii Acknowledgement...|$|E

40|$|Aim. To {{describe}} a research protocol designed {{to formulate a}} conceptual framework of informal caregiver resilience in palliative care. Background. Resilience {{is the ability to}} adapt or to improve one’s own conditions following experiences of adversity. The end-of-life care provided by informal caregivers is a form of adversity because it entails objective difficulties, emotional involvement and deep levels of introspection that have been stimulated by the death event. Resilience has not yet been addressed in association with end-of-life care. Design. This is a multicentre cross-sectional study. Methods. We will administer a questionnaire to a sample of informal end-of-life caregivers to collect data about the main psychological, behavioural and healthcare factors that <b>impact</b> <b>resilience.</b> Data analysis will include descriptive and correlational statistical techniques, multiple linear regressions and structural equation modelling. Data will be collected in multiple palliative care centres and statistical analysis will be carried out using software: SPSS version 19. 0 and MPlus version 7. 3.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Commercial {{fishing is}} a {{culturally}} and economically significant industry on the Oregon coast. The {{importance of this}} industry to human communities is often neglected in fisheries research, with economic and ecological data being favored by managers and decision makers. Recent observations in many coastal communities have indicated aging of fishermen {{and a lack of}} young people entering the industry, causing a “graying effect” in commercial fishing fleets. This phenomenon could have significant implications for commercial fishing participants as well as the larger communities this industry supports. This qualitative study uses oral history data to examine the graying phenomenon and implications for the resilience of the commercial fishing industry in two coastal communities in Oregon. Extensive research has been conducted on the graying of the fleet in Alaska but research on the phenomenon in the Pacific Northwest is lacking. Results reveal that commercial fishermen, fishing family members, and fishing support industry representatives perceive graying as a threat. This threat was specifically referenced in relation to changing fisheries management such as catch share implementation, as well as shifting motivations to fish and dynamic social influences. Such changes may <b>impact</b> <b>resilience</b> through lost local ecological knowledge, diminished connection to place, and a loss of financial capital that has historically been brought into coastal communities through commercial fishing. This research offers insight into the relationship between fisheries management and community perception, and provides potential strategies {{that can be used to}} combat current regulations favoring larger corporate fishing enterprises. The results of this study also add to the literature on the graying of the fleet phenomenon providing much needed background and context for more extensive graying projects into the future...|$|E
40|$|Background In 2008, 5 {{years after}} the Liberian civil war ended, there were an {{estimated}} 340, 000 orphans in Liberia, 18 % of the total child population of the country. Given that children make up half the population and that these children experienced significant trauma and loss both through direct exposure to the war {{and then to the}} Ebola epidemic, and indirectly {{as a result of the}} trauma experienced by their parents, the recovery of these children is essential to the recovery of the nation as a whole. The goal of this research was to identify factors contributing to resilience among youth in post-conflict Liberia. Resilience was defined as evidence of adaptive functioning and psychological health. Methods Seventy-five young people (age 13 – 18) in the capital city of Monrovia, Liberia were recruited in 2012. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and demographic data were collected. Interviews were then transcribed and coded thematically. Results Forty-six of the participants were attending school, and 29 were not enrolled in school. Youth enrolled in school demonstrated greater adaptive functioning. This was particularly true for boys in any school setting and girls attending private school. Youth not attending school were more likely to have lost family members or become estranged from them, and many were also engaging in substance use. Emotion regulation, cognitive flexibility, agency, social intelligence and, in some cases, meaning-making were found in participants who showed resilient outcomes. Conclusions Caregiver relationships mediate the development of psychological capacities that <b>impact</b> <b>resilience.</b> These findings suggest that youth who have lost a caregiver, many of whom are not attending school, are experiencing a significant ongoing burden in terms of their daily functioning and psychological health in the post-war period and should be the focus of further study and intervention targeting substance use and community reintegration...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{phenomenon}} of resilience in adults who have experienced the loss of a parent during childhood. A qualitative method within a theoretical framework of life course perspective was used for this study. The specific objectives were to explore: (a) How individual characteristics influence resilience after the death of a parent, (b) how an individual's family conditions influence resilience, (c) how external influences <b>impact</b> <b>resilience</b> after the death of a parent, and (d) how participants perceive the death of a parent as a part of resilience in adulthood. This study was restricted to adult women and men whose parent died when the participant was between the ages of 3 and 12 years. Using a phenomenological approach, in-depth interviews were utilized to gather data. A total of 19 women and men were interviewed. Based on the information extracted from the four research questions, seven emergent themes were identified: disposition of the child, parental influence on self-concept, influence of death on family dynamics, understanding and coping with loss, social support, impact of loss on adult relationships, and increased independence at an early age. In addition, analysis of the interview data revealed sub-themes of the importance of sibling relationships, the relationship with the surviving parent, support from extended family, the funeral as a sense of closure, religious beliefs and cultural traditions, family communication about the deceased, and education as protective factors for resilience. Implications for professionals who work with individuals and families are noted, as well as areas for further research. This study supports the need for additional research conducted among children and their family members who experienced the death of a parent. In addition, further investigation should be undertaken from a resilience perspective with families overcoming adversity. Jennings, Glen Dr. Chenoweth Dr...|$|E

40|$|Psychological {{resiliency}} to disasters {{has been}} a growing focus of emergency management in recent years. The major psychosocial impacts of disasters include stress-induced psychological disorders, relational problems, increased substance abuse, and the disruption of beneficial social networks. These outcomes negatively <b>impact</b> <b>resilience</b> at individual and community levels. Demands for mental health interventions following disaster can rapidly overwhelm mental health providers’ ability to meet mental health needs. Recent literature has proposed training unlicensed mental health providers to augment the services of licensed mental health providers and chaplains. This paper describes an effort to strengthen disaster mental health response capacity through the integration of faith-based organizations as providers of disaster mental health and Spiritual Care services. This project was sponsored through collaboration between Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania and the Allegheny County Department of Human Services. Outreach was conducted in eight communities in Eastern Allegheny County over a one-year period. Outreach activities involved interviewing faith leaders, presenting to ministerial associations, and organizing informational meetings. The three goals of the community outreach were to educate faith-based organizations {{about the role of}} faith-based organizations in disasters, to provide a point of contact for further information, and to encourage participation with the Allegheny County Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD). At the end of the outreach period, fifty-seven organizations were contacted, a total of four congregations expressed an interest in becoming active in disaster response, and four ministerial organizations began discussing their role in disaster preparedness and response. Outreach activities resulted in marginal success in promoting continued participation. Four primary barriers became apparent: frequent leadership turnover, funding limitations, competing time commitments, and volunteer liability concerns. Additionally, a major finding suggests that an active VOAD is a crucial component of sustaining a well-organized reserve of volunteer personnel with a readiness to respond. This community organizing effort holds public health significance by identifying how faith-based organizations may potentially be a community resource to help alleviate the burden of psychiatric stress...|$|E

It is widely believed that increasing rainfall variability is likely to affect the livelihoods of millions of small and marginal farmers in the years to come. The National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) was initiated in 2011 to primarily strengthen research to address climate change and to demonstrate proven resilient practices in most climate vulnerable parts of the country. Farmer participatory technology demonstrations are being carried out since 2011 - 12 in 100 vulnerable districts prone to recurrent drought, floods, and extreme weather events like cyclone, heat and cold wave. Interventions broadly fall into four modules related to natural resource management (NRM), crop, livestock and fisheries production systems and capacity building. During these three years, rainfall variability such as delayed onset and prolonged breaks in monsoon was experienced in several parts of the country. A total of 1259 NRM interventions to <b>impact</b> <b>resilience</b> through in situ soil moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting and efficient recycling were demonstrated, which resulted in a significant increase in crop yields by about 20 - 40 % even under variable rainfall situations.

40|$|Resilience is {{a complex}} {{interaction}} of risk factors and protective factors that lead to positive developmental outcomes. The transition {{from high school to}} college introduces new risk factors (e. g., loneliness, financial) and the need for new or altered protective factors (e. g., social and problem solving skills). Reasons for dropping out are many, ranging from lack of long-term goals and commitments to a sense of isolation and not belonging. Two factors that have been found to promote persistence in college are academic and social engagement (Tinto, 1993). Both constructs have also been linked to increasing long-term goals, problem solving and social skills in students (Pascarella, 1989). ^ This dissertation describes the development and initial validation of the College Resilience Questionnaire (CRQ), an instrument designed to predict students 2 ̆ 7 resilience via the two constructs of academic and social engagement. Because of the exploratory nature of this research, three separate studies were conducted. The common goals of each study were to determine the factor structure of the CRQ and to evaluate the internal consistency of each factor. The intent of Study 1 was to validate the CRQ by testing the convergent and discriminate validity of the instrument. The intent of Study 2 was to look at the relationship of the CRQ to a number of behaviors in which students engage in an attempt to view the aspects of the classroom environment that <b>impact</b> <b>resilience.</b> The intent of Study 3 was to test the predictive validity of the CRQ with intent to persist in college.
