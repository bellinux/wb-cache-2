25|$|Live copepods {{are used}} in the {{saltwater}} aquarium hobby as a food source and are generally considered beneficial in most reef tanks. They are scavengers and also may feed on algae, including coralline algae. Live copepods are popular among hobbyists who are attempting to keep particularly difficult species such as the mandarin <b>dragonet</b> or scooter blenny. They are also popular to hobbyists who want to breed marine species in captivity. In a saltwater aquarium, copepods are typically stocked in the refugium.|$|E
25|$|Planktonic copepods are {{important}} to global ecology and the carbon cycle. They are usually the dominant members of the zooplankton, and are major food organisms for small fish such as the <b>dragonet,</b> banded killifish, whales, seabirds, Alaska pollock, and other crustaceans such as krill in the ocean and in fresh water. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on earth. Copepods compete for this title with Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). C. glacialis inhabits {{the edge of the}} Arctic icepack, especially in polynyas where light (and photosynthesis) is present, in which they alone comprise up to 80% of zooplankton biomass. They bloom as the ice recedes each spring. The ongoing large reductions in the annual minimum of recent years may force them to compete in the open ocean with the much less nourishing C. finmarchicus, which is spreading from the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea into the Barents Sea.|$|E

60|$|In {{many species}} the male alone is ornamented with bright colours; or these are much {{brighter}} {{in the male}} than the female. The male, also, is sometimes provided with appendages which appear to be of no more use to him for the ordinary purposes of life than are the tail-feathers to the peacock. I am indebted {{for most of the}} following facts to the great kindness of Dr. Günther. There is reason to suspect that many tropical fishes differ sexually in colour and structure; and there are some striking cases with our British fishes. The male Callionymus lyra has been called the gemmeous <b>dragonet</b> “from its brilliant gem-like colours.” When freshly taken from the sea the body is yellow of various shades, striped and spotted with vivid blue on the head; the dorsal fins are pale brown with dark longitudinal bands; the ventral, caudal and anal fins being bluish-black. The female, or sordid <b>dragonet,</b> was considered by Linnæus and by many subsequent naturalists as a distinct species; it is of a dingy reddish-brown, with the dorsal fin brown and the other fins white. The sexes differ also in the proportional size of the head and mouth, and in the position of the eyes;[11] but the most striking difference is the extraordinary elongation in the male (fig. 28) of the dorsal fin. The young males resemble in structure and colour the adult females. Throughout the genus Callionymus,[12] the male is generally much more brightly spotted than the female, and in several species, not only the dorsal, but the anal fin of the male is much elongated.|$|E
60|$|The higher animals display like {{evidence}} of the same slow selective action. The courtship of the stickleback, who dances 'mad with delight' around the mate he has allured into the nest he prepares for her, has been observed by dozens of observers both before and since in the domestic aquarium. The gem-like colours of the male <b>dragonet,</b> the butterfly wings of certain gurnards, and the decorated tails of some exotic carps all point in the same direction. Our own larger newt is adorned during the breeding season with a serrated crest edged with orange; while in the smaller kind the colours of the body acquire at the same critical period of love-making a vivid brilliancy. The strange horns and luridly coloured throat-pouches of tropical lizards are familiar to all visitors in equatorial climates, and they are confined exclusively to the male sex. Among birds, the superior beauty of the male plumage is known to everybody; and their greatest glory invariably coincides with the special season for the selection of mates. In the spring, as even our poets have told us, the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest. The law of battle produces {{the spur of the}} game-birds and the still stranger wing-spurs of certain species of the plover kind. Æsthetic rivalry is answerable rather for vocal music, and for the plumage of the umbrella-bird, the lyre-bird, the humming-birds, and the cock of the rocks. Among mammals, strength rather than beauty seems to have carried the day; horns, and tusks, and spikes, and antlers are here the special guerdon of the victorious males. Yet even mammals show occasional signs of distinctly æsthetic and artistic preferences, as in the gracefully twisted horns of the koodoo, the scent-glands of the musk-deer or of certain antelopes, the brilliant hues of the male mandrill, and the tufts and moustaches of so many monkeys.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the first}} book in the series, {{published}} July 1, 2012. It is written in third-person from the view of Clay. A war is going on between the seven dragon tribes over who will take the throne of the SandWings. A dragon named Morrowseer has a prophecy that five <b>dragonets</b> will stop the war. The <b>dragonets</b> (Clay, Tsunami, Glory, Starflight, Sunny) are raised in a cave under a mountain by three guardians. One day, they make a plan to escape. However, they get captured by the SkyWing queen, Scarlet, and are taken to the SkyWing prison. There, the <b>dragonets</b> are forced {{to fight in the}} arena. Clay meets Peril, a dragon with fire-hot scales. Scarlet plans to give Sunny to Burn, one of the contenders for the SandWing throne. Clay, Tsunami, Starflight, and Peril try to stop her, but Peril betrays them and they get captured. Later, Clay is set to fight against Peril.|$|R
