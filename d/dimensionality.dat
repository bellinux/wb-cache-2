40|$|Abstract — The {{nonlinear}} independent {{component analysis}} method introduced by Lappalainen and Honkela in 2000 uses a truncated Taylor series representation to approximate the nonlinear transformation from sources to observations. The approach uses information {{only at the}} single point of input mean and can produce poor results if the input variance is large. This feature has recently been identified to {{be the cause of}} instability of the algorithm with large source <b>dimensionalities.</b> In this paper, an improved approximation is presented. The derivatives used in the Taylor scheme are replaced with slopes evaluated by global Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The resulting approximation is more accurate under high input variance and the new learning algorithm more stable with high source <b>dimensionalities.</b> I...|$|R
