This was done to explicate the two writers’ reading-into-writing processes in relation to graphic time-based analysis of the overall text production patterns, quantitative measures of writing fluency and pauses, and reading-into-writing sub-processes (i.e. task representation, transforming ideas from sources and revisions).

5000|$|The {{classical}} Japanese language ( [...] bungo, [...] "literary language"), {{also called}} [...] "old writing" [...] ( [...] kobun), is the literary {{form of the}} Japanese language that was the standard until the early Shōwa period (1926-89). It is based on Early Middle Japanese, the language as spoken during the Heian period (794-1185), but exhibits some later influences. Its use started to decline during the late Meiji period (1868-1912) when novelists started writing their works in the spoken form. Eventually, the spoken style came into widespread use, including in major newspapers, but many official documents were still written in the old style.

30|$|Keystroke logging {{not only}} has the {{advantage}} of being relatively unobtrusive but it also allows researchers to collect a complete and accurate record of writers’ external text production process with accuracy to seconds or even to milliseconds (Leijten & Van Waes, 2013). A range of measures such as writing fluency, pauses and <b>document</b> <b>switches</b> is now made available to researchers. Some of these measurements might be used to predict the performances produced by test takers. For example, it is found that frequency of pauses discriminated writers at different proficiency levels (Spelman Miller, 2000; Wengelin & Strömqvist 2004). Fluency is also reported to be a useful measure to discriminate skilled writers from L 2 writers (Spelman Miller, 2000). However, these data points are largely quantitative and might not directly reflect writers’ writing processes. An important question that still needs addressing is how to interpret reading-into-writing processes from keystroke logging. Furthermore, little has been done to investigate how test takers’ reading-into-writing processes may impact their final products.|$|R

New interpretations of their role in temperate ecosystems have, however, reactivated a debate suggesting generalist predators may have a destabilizing effect under certain conditions (e. g. landscape homogeneity, low prey diversity, temporary dominance of 1 prey species associated {{with a high degree}} of dietary specialization). We studied a rich predator community dominated by generalist carnivores (Martes spp., Vulpes vulpes, Felis catus) over a 6 yr period in farmland and woodland in France. The most frequent prey were small rodents (mostly Microtus arvalis, a grassland species, and Apodemus spp., a woodland species). Alternative prey were diverse and dominated by lagomorphs (Oryctolagus cuniculus, Lepus europeus). We detected a numerical response among specialist carnivores but not among generalist predators. The dietary responses of generalist predators were fairly complex and most often dependent on variation in density of at least 1 prey species. These results support the generalist predation hypothesis. We <b>document</b> a <b>switch</b> to alternative prey, an increase of diet diversity, and a decrease of diet overlap between small and medium-sized generalists during the low density phase of M. arvalis.

Economic agents form expectations from simple models and update the parameters through constant-gain learning. I estimate the model by Bayesian methods. The constant gain coefficient is jointly estimated with the structural and policy parameters of the system. I find that the feedback coefficient to inflation was well above 1 also in the 1960 s and 1970 s and therefore policy was not leading to macroeconomic instability.

This protein plays a pivotal role in liver development and hepatocellular differentiation. Nine splice variants have been identified, some of which are specifically regulated in disease. The role of HNF 4 a splice variants in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) is unknown. Here, we report an identification of novel candidate genes targeted by splice variants of HNF 4 a. Methods: We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by cloning and sequencing of DNA. Expression of HNF 4 a P 1 and P 2 promoter-driven isoforms and of genes targeted by HNF 4 a were analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and immunohistochemistry. Results: We observed a remarkable switch in gene and protein expression from P 1 to P 2 promoter-driven fetal isoforms of HNF 4 a in transgenic livers and HCCs of epidermal growth factor (EGF) over-expressing mice and in human HCCs. We further identified EGF-receptor substrate (EPS 15 R), related EPS 15, the premessenger RNA processing factor 3 (PRPF 3), and taspase 1 (TASP 1) as novel HNF 4 a disease regulated genes with induced expression in mouse and in human HCCs.

By using a small inoculum to preclude the introduction of variants that had already switched during in vitro propagation, we demonstrated that in vivo switching to a mucoid phenotype occurred in two mice strains and was associated with a lethal outcome. Phenotypic switching resulted in changes of the capsular polysaccharide that inhibited phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. This promoted a more vigorous inflammatory response and rapid demise. These data <b>document</b> in vivo <b>switching</b> in a fungus and associate this phenomenon with enhanced virulence and a lethal outcome. The importance of this finding is underscored by the increased likelihood of phenotypic switching in chronic cryptococcosis; thus this mechanism may account for the inability to eradicate the organism in immunocompromised hosts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the current}} study, we {{dynamically}} analyze unlisted firms' voluntary disclosure decisions around private equity (PE) participation. First, we disentangle {{the role of}} disclosure in attracting PE investments. In addition, we examine {{the extent to which}} a firm's disclosure policy is affected by the changing corporate setting and intensified corporate governance after having received PE. We find no evidence that firms would employ increased disclosure to signal their quality in the years preceding the PE financing. However, we <b>document</b> a significant <b>switch</b> to increased financial disclosure from the PE investment year onwards, consistent with the hypothesis that PE investor presence positively affects portfolio firms' disclosure decisions. Further, we show that the proportional PE ownership stake is positively related to increased disclosure, but only at very high ownership levels. We explain these results in that both internal and external information demands call for higher public disclosure in PE firms. We conclude that the changing information environment resulting from a PE investment stimulates increased public financial disclosure. Our results contribute to illustrate how an indisputable change in governance resulting from a PE investment affects inter-temporal corporate disclosure decisions in unlisted firms...|$|R
40|$|When {{most of us}} use a {{computer}} we use the standard interface of a keyboard and mouse. However, {{what do you do}} if you cannot use a keyboard or mouse? A number of alternative access systems exist, for example: alternative keyboards, tracker balls, touchscreens, head pointers etc. But for some people these devices are also an impossibility, and this is where switches 'kick in'. The main subject of this <b>document</b> is the <b>switch</b> user. For completeness we have include a brief mention of other input devices, which may be grouped together as 'alternative access systems'. We aim to: - Encourage developers to include switch access into their products - Standardise practice and terminology. This document explains some of the issues involved for people with severe physical difficulties who access computers and other electronic devices with switches. It details the ways in which switch users interact with computer programs and other technology designed to be directly accessible to them. The document includes some precise definitions of terms. It also attempts to survey the whole range of issues associated with switch use. As such it should be useful to professionals working or entering the field, those software developers considering switch users for the first time and also for those already developing in this area...|$|R
