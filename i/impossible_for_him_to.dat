5|$|On November 11, 2009, Cook was {{diagnosed}} with a parathyroid tumor in his neck. Doctors assessed that the tumor was pressing against his vocal cords making it virtually <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> perform. He was treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|As Griffith stopped portraying {{some of the}} sheriff's more unsophisticated {{character}} traits and mannerisms, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> create his own problems and troubles {{in the manner of}} other central sitcom characters such as Lucy in I Love Lucy or Archie Bunker in All in the Family, whose problems were the result of their temperaments, philosophies and attitudes. Consequently, the characters around Taylor were employed to create the problems and troubles, with rock-solid Taylor stepping in as problem solver, mediator, advisor, disciplinarian and counselor.|$|E

They both said that that sort o’ thing wouldn’t look well in writing, not if anybody else {{happened}} to see it, that is; besides which Ginger said it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>’im</b> <b>to</b> say ’ow much money he would ’ave the handling of.

5000|$|Offered an OBE by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Raistrick wrote {{a letter}} declining the honour, which started, characteristically, [...] "Dear Harold, I am deeply {{disappointed}} in you…". His lifelong dislike of privilege made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> even <b>to</b> consider accepting Wilson's offer.|$|R
5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do so in all cases, {{and most of the}} time these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E
5|$|Until 1954, the Scotland {{team was}} managed by a SFA {{selection}} committee. The role of manager was first established in May 1954 with {{the appointment of}} Andy Beattie, who took charge on a part-time basis while continuing as manager of Huddersfield Town. Beattie took the team to the 1954 FIFA World Cup, but the SFA only allowed him to select a travelling party of 13 players. Beattie, who felt this restriction made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> perform his duties well, resigned during the tournament. Scotland were eliminated from the tournament after a 7–0 defeat by Uruguay.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years Clark's {{mounting}} debts made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> retain ownership of his land, since it became subject to seizure due to his debts. Clark deeded much of his land to friends or transferred ownership to family members so his creditors could not seize it. Lenders and their assignees eventually deprived the veteran of {{nearly all of the}} property that remained in his name. Clark, who was at one time the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory, was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville. In 1803 Clark built a cabin overlooking the Falls of the Ohio, where he lived until his health failed in 1809. He also operated a small gristmill, which he worked with two African American slaves.|$|E
6000|$|Dwight {{remembered how}} kindly and pleasantly {{he had felt}} towards Caleb at that time, and he {{thought that it would}} have been <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> then <b>to</b> have found any {{pleasure}} in tormenting him; and so he said, [...] "No, mother, I could not." ...|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after this}} the snow fell thicker than ever, {{and it became}} evident that an unusually early winter was about to set in among the mountains. This was a terrible calamity, for, if the regular snow of winter set in, it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> either <b>to</b> advance or retreat.|$|R
50|$|Pepperberg countered critics' {{claims that}} Alex {{had been taught}} a script by {{explaining}} that the controls and tests she used made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> simply <b>to</b> recite words when she asked questions. The Clever Hans effect did not apply, she argued, as Alex would talk to anyone, not just to her.|$|R
5|$|Lefebvre was {{increasingly}} criticized by influential {{members of his}} large religious congregation who considered him to be out-of-step with modern Church leaders and the demand of the bishops' conferences, particularly in France, for modernization and reforms. An Extraordinary General Chapter of the Holy Ghost Fathers was convened in Rome in September 1968 to debate {{the direction of the}} congregation after the changes of the Second Vatican Council. The first action of the chapter was to name several moderators to lead the chapter's sessions instead of Lefebvre. Lefebvre then handed in his resignation as Superior General to Pope Paul VI. He would later say that it had become <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> remain superior of an institute that no longer wanted or listened to him.|$|E
5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Gregory's Chronicle, the Chronicle of London, or MS Edgerton 1995, is {{the name}} given to a fifteenth-century English chronicle. It {{takes its name from}} its {{supposed}} author, William Gregory, who started as a skinner in London. Greogory {{went on to become a}} London Alderman, Sheriff from 1436 to 1437, and eventually Mayor from 1450 to 1451. The name 'Gregory' for the manuscript is, however, merely a convenience, as its actual authorship is unknown. Indeed, since the chronicle spans the period 1189 to 1470, and William Gregory died in 1467, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have composed it in its entirety. Other fifteenth-century authors have been proposed, ranging from a contemporary poet to an Ecclesiast, but since even the exact dates of its composition are also debated it has been impossible for historians to definitively attribute the authorship to any known individual.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had made}} up his mind to spend the Christmas with Lord Brentford and Lady Laura Kennedy at Dresden, and had already fixed the day of his arrival there. But this had been {{postponed}} by another invitation which had surprised him much, but which it had been <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> accept. It had come as follows:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Adam {{could not}} help being moved: it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> feel {{that this was the}} voice of the honest warm-hearted Arthur whom he had loved and been proud of in old days; but nearer {{memories}} would not be thrust away. He was silent; yet Arthur saw an answer in his face that induced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go on, with growing earnestness.|$|R
6000|$|... 232. But {{between him}} and Tintoret there is a {{separation}} deeper than all these, when we examine their treatment of the face. Michael Angelo's vanity of surgical science rendered it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> ever <b>to</b> treat the body {{as well as the}} Greeks treated it; but it left him wholly at liberty to treat the face as ill; and he did: and in some respects very curiously worse.|$|R
5|$|The rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{at the end of}} 1989, when the title was to be decided between Senna and Prost at Suzuka. The two McLarens {{collided}} at the Casio Triangle chicane when Prost blocked an attempted pass by Senna. Prost walked away while Senna returned to the track. Senna {{went on to win the}} race, but was later disqualified in a highly controversial ruling over his path back to the track, as his car was pushed through the road around the chicane. After an unsuccessful appeal by McLaren, the Brazilian received a further US$100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, leading Senna to accuse FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre of favoring his compatriot Prost. Senna's disqualification meant that it was mathematically <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> overhaul Prost's points total, and so the 1989 Championship went to the Frenchman. There has been much debate as to whether Senna was overambitious in his overtaking manoeuver, whether Prost intentionally ran into Senna, or whether the collision was simply a racing incident between two teammates who were embittered with each other.|$|E
5|$|During the {{criminal}} trial, {{all the major}} figures in the case were called on to give evidence. Le Gris and Carrouges began proceedings and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite {{and at least one}} of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel. As people of low birth, Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test the veracity of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion. Le Gris' case involved several strategies; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges' infamous temper and describing the case against him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations. Le Gris then provided alibis for the entire week in question, establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre. Finally he attempted to demonstrate in court that it was physically <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil, where the crime supposedly took place, in a single day, a round trip of approximately 50miles (80km).|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the lack}} of control of the Turkish {{authorities}} for farther provinces, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> complete his work.|$|E
5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine. According to Brown, these injuries made it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> assault V. N. {{as described in the}} police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|R
60|$|No {{third person}} {{listening}} could have thoroughly understood the impetuosity of Will's repulse or {{the bitterness of}} his words. No one but himself then knew how everything connected with the sentiment of his own dignity had an immediate bearing <b>for</b> <b>him</b> on his relation to Dorothea and to Mr. Casaubon's treatment of him. And in the rush of impulses by which he flung back that offer of Bulstrode's there was mingled {{the sense that it}} would have been <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> ever <b>to</b> tell Dorothea that he had accepted it.|$|R
60|$|It {{was while}} things {{were in this}} state that Mamba arrived at Antananarivo with his {{precious}} New Testament and Psalms {{in the folds of}} his lamba. Although well aware of what had taken place, he recklessly visited his friends in the city. From them he learned more particulars, and saw, when too late, that it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> now <b>to</b> pass out of the gates with the Testament on his person, as the guards had been cautioned to search every one whom they had the slightest reason to suspect.|$|R
25|$|Those {{who heard}} Pigott's claim {{initially}} immediately reacted {{with anger and}} violence, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> remain in London. Pigott then moved to Spaxton, in Somerset.|$|E
25|$|On the {{day before}} the jury retired, a {{forensic}} pathologist said that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> determine whether the fatal strike had been inflicted late on the evening of 8 September, around the time that Hannigan's assault had taken place, or at a later date.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, Joffe, {{freed from}} the Siberian exile by the February Revolution, {{returned}} to the Crimea. Crimean social democrats {{sent him to the}} capital, Petrograd, to represent them, but he soon moved to an internationalist revolutionary position, which made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> remain in an organization dominated by less radical Mensheviks. Instead, he joined forces with Trotsky, who had just returned from abroad.|$|E
60|$|He walked back, {{trying to}} look through the {{dazzling}} haze of joy so as to see his situation clearly. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> perceive that there had been an absolute declaration of affection, and that he had established a private understanding with his cousin. It was not, however, an engagement, nor did he at present desire to make it so. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as yet <b>to</b> marry, and he was content to wait without a promise, since that could not add to his entire reliance on Laura. He could not bear to be rejected by her parents: he knew his poverty would be the sole ground of objection, and he was not asking her to share it. He believed sincerely that a long, lingering attachment to himself would be more for her good than a marriage with one who would have been a high prize for worldly aims, and was satisfied that by winning her heart he had taken the only sure means of securing her from becoming attached to Guy, while secrecy was the only way of preserving his intercourse with her on the same footing, and exerting his influence over the family.|$|R
60|$|But in this he was unjust to Halidome, forgetting how <b>impossible</b> it was <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{believe that}} a woman could not stand him. He reached his rooms, and, the more freely to enjoy the clear lamplight, the soft, gusty breeze, and waning turmoil of the streets, waited a moment before entering.|$|R
60|$|This man, who sat {{all day in}} a big rolling-chair, and {{who knew}} {{everything}} {{that was going on}} in the hotel, the farm, and the forest about him, had been a hunter and a guide in his youth, an Indian-fighter in later years, and when he had been wounded in both legs, so that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> ever <b>to</b> walk again, he came back to the scenes of his youth and established an inn for sportsmen--a poor little house at first, which grew and grew and grew, until it was the large, well-kept hotel so widely known by his name.|$|R
25|$|In {{the twelfth}} stage, Heusghem {{attacked}} Alavoine again. Alavoine punctured {{six times in}} that stage, which made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> keep up with Heusghem. Heusghem won over 35 minutes on Alavoine, and more than 10 minutes on second-placed Lambot, which was enough {{to take over the}} lead. Heusghem was at that point the strongest rider in the race, and seemed to be {{on the way to the}} overall victory in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The applause, {{by which}} the orator had been {{frequently}} interrupted, at this point became so vociferous and long continued that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> proceed. He at last desisted from his attempts {{to do so and}} descended from the platform. He had been speaking more than three-quarters of an hour, and the students, tired of listening to his rambling and incoherent remarks, had adopted the most efficacious method of bringing his address to its conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Anderson was {{represented}} by Anchorage attorney Paul Stockler, a former state prosecutor who usually handles civil litigation. Stockler successfully defended an Anchorage aviation company against federal weapons charges in a prominent case in 2006. Anderson had originally hoped to be represented by attorney Jeff Feldman, but Feldman's case load, which included representation of BP in an investigation and prosecution arising out of an oil spill on Alaska's North Slope in 2006 made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take on Anderson's defense as well.|$|E
60|$|The {{court at}} Westminster during the few months which {{followed}} {{the capture of}} Calais was the most brilliant in Europe. Tournaments and fetes followed each other in rapid succession, and to these knights came from all parts. So great was the reputation of King Edward that deputies came from Germany, where the throne was now vacant, to offer the crown of that kingdom <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> The king declined the offer, for {{it would have been}} <b>impossible</b> indeed <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have united the German crown with that of England, which he already held, and that of France, which he claimed.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} legend centres on the Princess’ {{response to}} Sultan Mahmud’s proposal. During {{the time of}} the old Malay Sultanates the Sultans were believed to have ‘daulat’, a divine right bestowed from God that gives them absolute power over the land and its people. It is because of this that the Princess, though she was not interested in his proposal, did not refuse him outright. Instead she set <b>for</b> <b>him</b> seven <b>impossible</b> tasks <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fulfil, but Sultan Mahmud was either too proud or too blind to realize that the tasks were her way of turning him down, and when he attempted to fulfil them Malacca fell into ruin.|$|R
