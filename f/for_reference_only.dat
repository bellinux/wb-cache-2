25|$|On May 21, DPP legislators {{criticized the}} Mainland Affairs Council for {{classifying}} the disadvantages {{of the trade}} accord and releasing only information it considers favorable to the agreement. Responding to the questions, former Mainland Affairs Council Minister Wang Yu-chi said that the classified information was to be used <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> <b>only</b> within the government. Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Cho Shih-chao said that research produced by academics is only used for internal reference for decision making. However, neither official explained why only poll numbers favorable to the government's position have been released to the public, while others were not.|$|E

60|$|With {{the long}} strain gone, I am {{in a sort}} of {{physical}} collapse today, but it will be gone tomorrow. I judged that this end of the book would be hard work, and it turned out so. I have never done any work before that cost so much thinking and weighing and measuring and planning and cramming, or so much cautious and painstaking execution. For I wanted the whole Rouen trial in, if it could be got in {{in such a way that}} the reader's interest would not flag--in fact I wanted the reader's interest to increase; and so I stuck to it with that determination in view--with the result that I have left nothing out but unimportant repetitions. Although it is mere history--history pure and simple--history stripped naked of flowers, embroideries, colorings, exaggerations, invention--the family agree that I have succeeded. It was a perilous thing to try in a tale, but I never believed it a doubtful one--provided I stuck strictly to business and didn't weaken and give up: or didn't get lazy and skimp the work. The first two-thirds of the book were easy; for I only needed to keep my historical road straight; therefore I used <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> <b>only</b> one French history and one English one--and shoveled in as much fancy work and invention on both sides of the historical road as I pleased. But on this last third I have constantly used five French sources and five English ones and I think no telling historical nugget in any of them has escaped me.|$|E
