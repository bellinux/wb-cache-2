40|$|The {{propagation}} of harmonic pressure waves through a Newtonian fluid contained within a thick-walled, viscoelastic tube is {{considered as a}} model of arterial blood flow. The fluid is assumed to be homogeneous and Newtonian, and its motion to be laminar and axisymmetric. The wall is assumed to be isotropic, incompressible, linear, and viscoelastic. It is also assumed that the motion is such that the convective acceleration is negligible. The motion of the fluid is described by the linearized form of the Navier-Stokes equations and the motion of the wall by classical elasticity theory. The frequency dependence of the wall mechanical properties are represented by a three parameter, relaxation-type model. Using boundary conditions describing the continuity of stress and velocity components in the fluid and the wall, explicit solutions for the system of equations of the model have been obtained. The longitudinal <b>fluid</b> <b>impedance</b> has been expressed in terms of frequency and the system parameters. The frequency equation has been solved and the propagation constant also expressed in terms of frequency and system parameters. The results indicate that the <b>fluid</b> <b>impedance</b> is smaller than predicted by the rigid tube model or by Womersley's constrained elastic tube model. Also, the velocity of propagation is generally slower and the transmission per wavelength less than predicted by Womersley's elastic tube model.

40|$|AUTHORS ’ SYNOPSIS The <b>fluid</b> <b>impedance</b> of the {{abdominal}} aorta {{was measured in}} anaesthetized dogs {{before and during the}} occlusion of the central branch of the aortic/external iliac junction. Aortic impedance increased during the occlusion due to a change in the terminal impedance of the peripheral beds and an increase in reflection from the aortic junction. The higher harmonics of impedance were relatively unaffected by changes in the terminal impedance and hence the increase found for these harmonics may be attributed to reflection from the junction alone. The reflection coefficient calculated from the impedance values of the higher harmonics (> 3 rd) agreed well with the theoretical value from the Womersley model of a junction set in an infinite line. The concept of input impedance which describes the ratio of oscillatory pressure to oscillatory flow in amplitude and phase, has proved useful in vascular studies and methods for its measure-ment at a number of arterial sites have been described in detail (McDonald, 1960; Bergel an...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} a stable partitioned algorithm that overcomes the added mass instability arising in fluid-structure interactions of light rigid bodies and inviscid compressible flow. The new algorithm is stable even for bodies with zero mass and zero moments of inertia.

Tests were conducted {{for a range of}} cavitation numbers and for Reynolds numbers in the range of Re = 4. 4 x 10 ^ 5 and 4. 8 x 10 ^ 5. Partially stable cavities were observed. The steady and dynamic volume fluctuations of the cavities were recorded through measurements of the local <b>fluid</b> <b>impedance</b> near the cavitating surface [us]ing a series of flush mounted electrodes. These data were combined with photographic observations. On the Schiebe body, the cavitation was observed to form a series of incipient spot cavities which developed into a single cavity as the cavitation number was lowered. The incipient cavities were observed to fluctuate at distinct frequencies. Cavities on the I. T. T. C. started as a single patch on the upper surface of the body which grew to envelope the entire circumference of the body as the cavitation number was lowered. These cavitites also fluctuated at distinct frequencies associated with oscillations of the cavity closure region. The cavities fluctuated with Strouhal numbers (based on the mean cavity thickness) in the range of St = 0. 002 to 0. 02, which are approximately one tenth the value of Strouhal numbers associated with Karman vortex shredding. The fluctuation of these stabilized partial cavities may be related to periodic break off and filling in the cavity closure region and to periodic entrainment of the cavity vapor. Cavities on both headforms exhibited surface striations in the streamwise direction near the point of cavity formation, and a frothy mixture of vapor and liquid was detected under the turbulent cavity surface.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 797 on 14. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) In {{order to determine}} the effects of aeration on wave impacts, both model scale and field measurement of pressure and aeration were conducted over a period of three years. Aeration quantification techniques deployed in laboratory experiments included <b>fluid</b> <b>impedance</b> measurement which were also used in the field and acoustic methods. The most common form of impact observed was due to hydrostatic pressure variation, referred to as Class I impacts in the text. Apart from this, two distinct impact classifications have been identified. The first of these classifications is referred to as Class 11 impacts in the text and arises due to water wave action. Two discrete categories occur within Class II impacts: compression waves and shock waves. Compression type impacts have long rise times, typically hundreds of milliseconds, and are produced by waves which tend to have much lower impact velocities and present much larger contact angles upon impact. These waves tend to be spilling breakers which may transport much entrained air due to interfacial turbulence. Rise times are a strong function of both void fraction and mean bubble size. Shock waves, with rise times typically less than 20 milliseconds, occur when conditions are such that the local velocity of sound is exceeded. Appropriate conditions for shock waves exist when water impacts on structures with a high velocity and narrow approach angle. Although shock wave generation requires the presence of some air in a wave in order that the local speed of sound might be exceeded, in practice void fractions of less than 20 % are needed. When characterising Class II shock waves there is strong correlation between the bubbly shock wave theory and Taylor's incompressible jet impact theory. The final class of impact is referred to as Class III in the text. Such impacts result from compression and oscillation, or direct collapse of trapped bubbles/air pockets alone. Class III impacts arise when air pockets, trapped as waves break at the wall or at some distance from a structure, collapse and transmit shock waves through the water. Class III impacts may accompany Class I or Class II impacts but it is more likely for the direct collapse of air pockets to accompany Class II shock waves and for the air pocket oscillations to accompany Class II adiabatic compression waves. The resultant impact pressure magnitudes are functions of wave height and velocity for hydrostatic events whilst pressure magnitudes are functions of impact velocity, mean bubble size and void fraction for Class II compression waves. Peak pressure levels for Class II shock waves are dependent upon impact velocity and void fraction. Class II shock waves and Class III bubble impacts generate the highest peak pressures (typically in excess of 30 kPa) whereas Class II compression wave impacts are of smaller magnitude but larger duration. Aeration does affect peak pressures and pressure rise times but relationships between impact pressure, rise times and aeration are also dependent upon the impact regime and wave type...|$|E

Retrograde transport was observed mainly in antral phase I (54 % of fluid movements, compared with 2. 5 % in phase II and 18. 5 % in phase III, P < 0. 05). During phase II, 80 +/- 13 % of the impedance changes were associated with manometric events and 72 +/- 9 % of the antral contractions were associated with transpyloric fluid transport. Prolonged assessment of interdigestive transpyloric fluid transport events using intraluminal measurement of impedance is possible. Manometrically detectable contractions are the most frequent, but not the only, driving forces of these event...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} record {{signals from the}} brain has wide {{reaching}} applications in medicine {{and the study of}} the brain. Currently long term neural recording is precluded by the formation of scar tissue around the electrodes inserted into the brain. Conducting polymers present a possible solution to this problem as their biocompatibility and low stiffness could improve the quality of the interface between the electrode and the brain. In order to assess the long term stability of conducting polymers, electrodes are fabricated from polypyrrole using a variety of dopants to improve conductivity. These electrodes are then immersed in artificial cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> while <b>impedance</b> measurements are taken over a period of days. The impedance of the electrodes increases rapidly for the first 40 hours before leveling off with only a slow increase in impedance being observed over the next 80 hours. When the ends of the electrodes are trimmed the impedance drops and then undergoes an accelerated rise and levels off. An experiment on the dimensional changes of the polypyrrole reveals that the polymer shrinks when placed into the solution. This may affect the integrity of the electrode and contribute to the increasing impedance. Further research will be necessary to understand the mechanism of the impedance increase and the electromechanical behavior of polymers with different biocompatible dopants. by Ross J. Wendell.

30|$|We {{introduce}} a more reliable fluid identification method using nonlinear elastic impedance inversion {{based on the}} fast MCMC in this paper, and the fast MCMC method is the key of foundation for the nonlinear elastic impedance inversion algorithm. Based on the Bayesian framework, we can identify the reservoir hydrocarbon more accurately owing to the more sensitive reservoir fluid indicator, that is the effective pore-fluid bulk modulus, and this method may improve the reliability and stability of fluid identification. Application research based on actual logging and seismic data shows that the nonlinear elastic <b>impedance</b> <b>fluid</b> identification method based on the fast MCMC is a practical method for reservoir fluid identification. However, the method has a limitation of obtaining only one inverted result of the effective pore-fluid bulk modulus, and may lack the uncertainty evaluation about reservoir fluid identification. So further in-depth research and analysis is needed, and we are intending to continue our research in this field.|$|R
40|$|AVO {{inversion}} analysis (Amplitude Versus Offset) {{has been}} done on DBT- 12 field to identify and map the distribution of hydrocarbons in conglomerat layer, Jatibarang formation, northern part of West Java basin. Sensitiv physical parameters to separate conglomerate with other litology (lava) are λ/μ, σ and Vp/Vs. Intercept which is obtained is positive while gradient is negative. AVO anomaly class obtained is IIp {{can be used as a}} first indicator content of the <b>fluid</b> is low <b>impedance</b> sand. This reservoir impedance values decrease for the increasing of incidence angle. Besides intercept and gradient AVO attributes which obtained is fluid factor and Poisson reflectivity. Both of these attributes is negative which means changes value of Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio is quite large from high to low. Changes in Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s Ratio can indicate the existence of a hydrocarbon.
