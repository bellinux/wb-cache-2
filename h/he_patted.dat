500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. <b>He</b> <b>patted</b> me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E
500|$|During the season, Scott {{played in}} 12 of 13games, {{including}} 11starts, and recorded 1,133rushing yards and eight touchdowns. In {{the first game}} of the 2008 season against Delaware, Scott ran for 197yards in his first career start, which was enough to place sixteenth on the list for school all-time single-game rushing. The following week, underdog Middle Tennessee stunned Maryland, 24–14, but Scott set the game-high for rushing with 123yards. He tallied his career-first rushing touchdown with a 63-yard run on the second play of the game. Scott [...] "dominated early" [...] against 23rd-ranked California with 19carries for 87yards and two touchdowns, but in the third quarter, he suffered a game-ending shoulder injury. His first-half effort helped Maryland take a quick lead and eventually upset California, 35–27. Scott sat out the next game against Eastern Michigan, but returned for the road game at 20th-ranked Clemson. Scott made 23carries but gained only 39yards, a mark that was surpassed by receiver Heyward-Bey on one reverse that gained 76yards to spark a second-half comeback. Head coach Friedgen said:"I told Da'Rel he needed to run a little more north–south. Clemson has such good team speed. If you go east–west on them, you're not going to go very far. I thought he had a couple runs when he tried to bounce it outside. Normally, Da'Rel can do that. Not against this team... I told him this is a game where three yards is a good running play... I don't know if Da'Rel has been in a game like this, playing the whole game that way in a tough environment. He came out in the second half and said 'I'm going to go, coach.' <b>He</b> <b>patted</b> me on the butt. 'Just get me the ball.'" ...|$|E
