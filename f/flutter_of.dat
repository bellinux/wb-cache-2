25|$|It is an {{interesting}} butterfly in {{that it has a}} number of modes of flight. In the cool of the morning, the flight is slow considering that it is an edible and unprotected swallowtail. As the day progresses, it flies fast, straight and low. In the hotter part of the day, it may be found settling on damp patches where it will remain motionless, except for an occasional <b>flutter</b> <b>of</b> wings, if not disturbed.|$|E
25|$|For {{the much}} talked about opening shot in which Hrithik Roshan {{is sitting on}} a {{wheelchair}} and trying to flick a fly off of his nose, a lot of research was done by the artists to understand the details of a fly's texture, look and feel, movement, the <b>flutter</b> <b>of</b> its wings, etc. The detailing went to the extent of casting the shadow of the fly when it sits on Hrithik's nose.|$|E

Two more short flights were made, {{a total of}} 45 minutes airborne, one each on the same days as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki occurred, before the war's end. Flights were successful, but showed a marked torque pull to starboard (due to the powerful engine), some <b>flutter</b> <b>of</b> the propeller blades, and vibration in the extended drive shaft.|$|E
25|$|Wakefield pitched {{with what}} {{is said to be}} a slow sidearm motion, but is {{actually}} a ¾-overhand motion. This also revealed some of his pitches to hitters, because they can see his hand. Wakefield's primary pitch, the knuckleball, is normally thrown about 64–68mph and has a great deal of variance in how much it 'flutters'. The <b>flutter</b> <b>of</b> his knuckleball depended on a variety of factors including temperature, humidity, precipitation (both type and intensity), air resistance, wind speed, wind direction, the condition of the ball, and very small changes in his grip or the orientation of the seams. Wakefield also featured a 71–75mph fastball, a slow curve (57-61mph), and a slower version of his knuckleball (59-62mph).|$|E
25|$|Peggy and Joe Appiah {{took their}} honeymoon in France and {{returned}} to England where Joe was to finish his legal training at the Middle Temple. In May 1954 their first son, Kwame Anthony Appiah, was born (amid another <b>flutter</b> <b>of</b> newspaper publicity) and in November the young family arrived in the Gold Coast to begin their new life. During this period, while Joe was developing a legal career and beginning {{his life as a}} politician, Peggy focused most of her energy on her young family —- Ama was born in 1955, Adwoa in 1960 and Abena in 1962 —- and on working as a secretary and legal assistant in his law office and for his constituents, supporting her husband as she had supported her father. She learned to wear cloth, started attending funerals, and got to know her husband's family and his father's family as well. They built themselves a home in Mbrom, where their neighbours were Victor Owusu, another senior NLM politician, John Brew, and, across the street, Joe Appiah's father, J. W. K. Appiah and his wife, Aunty Jane.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigates the}} {{application}} of laminated composite patches for enhance-ment <b>of</b> <b>flutter</b> behavior <b>of</b> perforated metallic plates repaired with an external composite patch. Due to material anisotropy and discontinuity in geometry involved in <b>flutter</b> analysis <b>of</b> repaired plates, closed form solutions are practically unobtainable. Numerical studies using commercial fi-nite element software were conducted to investigate the effects of variation in lamination parame-ters on the <b>flutter</b> boundary <b>of</b> perforated plates repaired with cross-ply composite patches. Both ply-level and sub-laminate level configurations are investigated. Presented results illustrate that <b>flutter</b> boundaries <b>of</b> perforated plates can be changed by choosing proper stacking sequence for composite patches...|$|R
500|$|The soundtrack was a {{critical}} and commercial success. In his review for Telugu Swatantra magazine, writer Aarudhra praised the film's sound designing by Krishnan and Koteswara Rao stating, [...] "Heavy rain with winds lashed outside as 's mother converses with her husband Nagappa. Their conversation is clearly audible along {{with the sound of}} the rain and the wind. Even the <b>flutter</b> <b>of</b> the towel on Nagappa's shoulder is heard clearly". In The Hans India, Aruna Ravikumar surmised that, for the song [...] "Akasha Veedhilo", Krishnasastri had borrowed the image of a cloud as messenger between lovers from the poem [...] "Meghasandesam" [...] by Indian Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa. Rajeswara Rao considered Malliswari to be his best work after S. S. Vasan Chandralekha (1948). He especially liked [...] "Akasha Veedhilo" [...] and performed it numerous times at events he attended.|$|E
500|$|Nimoy, in {{addition}} to his directing duties, appears {{towards the end of the}} film as Spock, but only appears in the opening credits as the director. Nimoy found the most difficult scene to direct was one in which Leonard McCoy talks to the unconscious Spock in sickbay, en route to Vulcan. Nimoy recalled that not only was he in the scene, but his eyes are closed, making it difficult to judge the quality of the shot or the actor's performance: [...] "It drove DeForest Kelley crazy. He swears that I was trying to direct him with the movement and <b>flutter</b> <b>of</b> my eyelids." [...] Nimoy was thankful the story required him to appear in a minimal number of scenes. The rapidly aging Spock, at the ages of 9, 13, 17, and 25, was portrayed successively by Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley and Joe W. Davis. Frank Welker provided Spock's screams, and Steve Blalock doubled for Nimoy, so that a total of seven actors contributed to the role.|$|E

500|$|It {{begins with}} Jackson in {{what seems to}} be a hotel, singing about his girlfriend. He is distressed because he found a silver card in with the name [...] "Alex" [...] on it. To him, it implies that [...] "Alex" [...] is another man who his girlfriend is with; thus, she is {{cheating}} on Jackson. However, as the story in the video unfolds, this is not true, because the girl takes on different identities (I.e. Eve, Diana, etc.) for her job as a high class call girl. [...] "Alex" [...] (which is also a girl's name), just happens to be one of them. The video alternates scenes from where Jackson is singing about his pain, to where the girl is being changed into her different identities and taking care of her jobs (mostly meeting with other men and even some women and sleeping with them). Towards the end of the video, Jackson has packed up his bags to leave town, because of his distress. A helicopter comes to pick him up from his house. The girl comes to Jackson's house and she asks his assistant (who knows the situation and aided Jackson in his departure) to let her in. It is likely she quit the job for him and wants to stay. The assistant shakes his head, implying that he left. When she asks why, he drops a <b>flutter</b> <b>of</b> silver nameplates (including the one that said [...] "Alex") from a slot in the door. After that scene, Jackson is seen sleeping and smoke floats out the side of the screen. Having lost her love and without any alternative, the girl turns to her callgirl existence again. Her employer slaps her in the face and she is then seen being prepared for a new identity.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013, The Dream Chaser Engineering Test Article (ETA) {{was shipped}} to the Dryden Flight Research Center in California {{for a series of}} ground tests and {{aerodynamic}} flight tests. This move to Dryden came about a year after a captive carry test that was conducted near the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport on May 29, 2012. During that test, an Erickson Skycrane was used to lift the Dream Chaser to better determine its aerodynamic properties. [...] "The testing at Dryden will include tow, captive-carry and free-flight tests of the Dream Chaser. A truck will tow the vehicle down a runway to validate performance of the nose strut, brakes and tires. The captive-carry flights will further examine the loads the vehicle will encounter during flight and test the performance and <b>flutter</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle up to release from an Erickson Skycrane helicopter. The free-flight tests are designed to validate the Dream Chaser's aerodynamics as well as test the flight control surfaces to verify flight characteristics for approach, flare and landing."

2500|$|In {{the mixed}} reviews critics {{generally}} praised Lewis's voice but criticised the music. Lyndsey Winship from BBC Music complimented Lewis's vocal ability but perceived {{a lack of}} [...] "hooks, innovation and personality". On Lewis's vocals Robert Christgau commented [...] "The subtle <b>flutter</b> <b>of</b> her finest melismatics could give an open-minded person goose bumps. Her coarser melismatics, however, are the usual showoff BS and probably also a commercial prerequisite, like not having a harelip." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised Lewis's voice but criticised the mixture of styles within the album. The New York Timess Nate Chinen felt the album did {{not live up to}} the standards of lead single [...] "Bleeding Love", but was successful in showcasing Lewis's vocal capabilities. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian was disappointed, saying [...] " [...] has clearly invested every scrap of energy into these songs [...] but being able to belt 'em out is only half the story, and if there's a personality here, it's well hidden." [...] Victoria Segal of The Times praised Lewis's voice, but criticised the music, saying [...] " [...] has a powerful voice but on Spirit it seems to have paralysed her collaborators creatively. Instead of taking the opportunity to craft it into new and exciting shapes, it has been stuck in a big spotlit display case, revolving slowly and rather boringly on a velvet cushion of overstuffed balladry." [...] She concluded by saying, [...] "If Lewis is looking for the greatest love of all – public adoration – she will have to do better than this." ...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Acute aortic {{regurgitation}} {{was created}} experimentally in 21 mongrel dogs {{to examine the}} relationship of the regurgitant jet to observed echocardiographic findings. The direction of the regurgitant jet was studied by echo contrast injections in the aortic root. Diastolic <b>fluttering</b> <b>of</b> the anterior mitral leaflet (AML) was noted in all 21 dogs irrespective of direction of the jet. Diastolic <b>fluttering</b> <b>of</b> the interventricular septum (IVS) was noted in six of the seven dogs with a tear of the noncoronary cusp and in one of seven dogs with lesions in the left coronary cusp. In all seven dogs with echocardiographically demonstrated IVS fluttering, a regurgitant jet impinged on the anterior part of the IVS. Amplitude of the AML excursion was not significantly different from control when the lesions involved the noncoronary or the left coronary cusps. However, all seven dogs that had a lesion in the right coronary cusp demonstrated a significant reduction in the amplitude of the AML excursion. The regurgitant jet in these dogs impinged uniformly on the AML. We conclude that diastolic <b>fluttering</b> <b>of</b> the AML is uniformly observed and unrelated to the direction of the regurgitant jet, diastolic <b>fluttering</b> <b>of</b> the IVS is caused by the regurgitant jet impinging upon the IVS, and amplitude of the AML may be reduced {{as a result of a}} jet impingement of the AML.
