5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E

5|$|The left-handed Darling was {{a strong}} driver of the ball who showed the batsman the full face of the bat. When necessary, he was a dour defender of his wicket. His fellow players thought that was {{sometimes}} unnecessarily defensive in his approach to batting and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best when driving hard. His South Australian and Australian team mate George Giffen thought that no Australian's cut shots travelled faster past point.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall {{began his}} celebrated opening {{partnership}} with Miller during the 1946–47 season which {{saw the first}} Ashes series against England. Lindwall brought up his maiden Test century in the Second Test and was the leading wicket-taker as Australia established its ascendancy in the post-war era. He topped the bowling the following season against India and then led the Australian attack during its celebrated Invincibles tour of England. He took 86 wickets for the tour, including 27 in the Tests, the most by any bowler. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best in the Fifth Test at The Oval, when England were skittled for only 52, taking 6/20 as the hosts were unable to cope with his high-pace swing. Lindwall's efforts saw him named {{as one of the}} five Wisden Cricketers of the Year.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 1994, State Judicial Police arrested Puentes Pizaña in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on a {{car theft}} charge. In an {{interview}} the following day, {{he said he was}} not guilty of Fischer's murder, and claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> mother's house in Matamoros when the murder occurred. He insisted that neither he nor Olivarez were gun owners or users. U.S. officials noted that it was unlikely for Mexico to extradite Puentes Pizaña since the extradition treaty between both countries did not cover Mexican nationals, and because Texas has the death penalty, which is outlawed in Mexico. Reynosa officials stated that Puentes Pizaña would have to face charges in Mexico before an extradition could be considered. Car theft sentences ranged from three to ten years in prison. Puentes Pizaña, on the other hand, argued that facing trial in the U.S. would not guarantee a fair trial. South Texas officials stated that there was a possibility for Puentes Pizaña to be tried in Mexico for Fischer's murder if an agreement was made between Texan and Tamaulipas state officials, though they said that trying him in the U.S. was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana's {{total of}} seven tournament championships by {{the start of}} 1995 was the same as the total won by Akebono, who had reached the yokozuna rank two years before him. However, Takanohana now pulled ahead of his rival. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> peak as a yokozuna between 1995 and 1997, during which time he won 11 of the 17 tournaments he entered, {{finishing}} runner-up in the other six. He produced two more perfect scores of 15–0, in September 1995 and September 1996. Overall he won 80 out of 90 bouts he fought in 1995, 70 out of 75 in 1996, and 78 out 90 in 1997, far ahead of any other wrestler. In three of the tournaments Takanohana did not win during this period, he was defeated by stablemates in playoffs: once to Wakanohana and twice to ōzeki Takanonami. Sumo rules prevent wrestlers from the same heya meeting in regular tournament bouts (playoffs excepted) which meant Takanohana avoided not only his brother and Takanonami but also sekiwake Akinoshima and Takatōriki. The merger of his father's Fujishima stable with his uncle's Futagoyama stable in 1993 had added even more top division wrestlers to this list, giving him an advantage over Akebono, who had to face them all. By September 1996 Takanohana had won 15 tournament championships, and was still only 24 years old. However, after sitting out the first tournament of his career in November 1996 due to a back injury suffered on a regional tour, he put on more weight and began to be more susceptible to injury and illness.|$|E

25|$|On 21 February 2001, the Jesus priest Avery Dulles, {{an internationally}} known author, lecturer, and theologian, was created a Cardinal of the Catholic Church by Pope John Paul II. The {{son of former}} Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, Avery Dulles was long known for his {{carefully}} reasoned argumentation and fidelity to the teaching office of the church. An author of 22 books and over 700 theological articles, Dulles died on 12 December 2008 at Fordham University, where he taught for twenty years as the Laurence J. McGinley Professor of Religion and Society. <b>He</b> <b>was,</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> passing, one of ten Jesuit cardinals in the Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|While {{his sexual}} {{orientation}} {{was known to}} friends, colleagues and constituents, in 1987 the News of the World ran an issue that attempted to 'out' Mandelson as gay. Mandelson preferred to keep his personal life private, and did not respond. In 1998, again, Mandelson was outed by Matthew Parris in 1998 on the BBC programme Newsnight. This led to press harassment of his partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, with the Daily Express sending a reporter {{to take pictures of}} him while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> languages course. An internal investigation later found that the photos had been obtained without Avila da Silva's consent, and images of him attempting to cover his face had been secretly deleted.|$|E
25|$|In Avalonia, Avalon Centrifuge (Colin McFarlane) takes Sackboy on a {{training}} course to learn combat using his machines. Half-way through, though, the Negativitron attacks Avalonia and spreads Meanies throughout. After rescuing the Sackbots among {{the wreckage of}} the facility, they get loaded back onto Huge Spaceship and prepare to leave Avalonia, but a Meanie warship attacks the ship. Even though Sackboy defeats the warship, Huge Spaceship crashes and is in need of repair, but only one creator can make it fly again. Victoria suggests the great inventor Dr. Herbert Higginbotham (Ewan Bailey), but Clive tells them that when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> factory, he was infected by a Meanie during the Negativitron attack.

25|$|His {{last years}} were saddened not merely {{by the death}} of many of his closest friends, but by {{increasing}} ill-health. This did not interfere with the quality of his literary work; he was rarely idle and some of his latest work is among his best. But he indulged the temptation to alter his work repeatedly, and many of his later alterations are not improvements. Towards the end of 1585 his health deteriorated, and he seems to have moved restlessly from one of his houses to another for some months. When the end came, which, though in great pain, he met in a resolute and religious manner, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> priory of Saint-Cosme in Touraine, and he was buried in the church of that name on Friday, 27 December 1585.|$|E

He was 87 years old. Siddiqi's funeral took place on 28 July 2004.

Soon, Inspector Davies arrives and, by questioning, finds out that Flora must have been the last person to see Sir Roger alive. Flora insists that Poirot is called in to investigate and little time passes before the French detective arrives.|$|E
