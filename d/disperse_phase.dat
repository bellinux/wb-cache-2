Due to the totally different morphologies of these membranes, the fraction of active pores is I for a microsieve and is very low for the other membranes. The choice of the optimal membrane did not depend on the production strategy: either to produce large quantities or to produce monodisperse emulsions, the best suitable was a microsieve with an area requirement of around I m(2). In general, the total membrane resistance should be low to obtain a large <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> flux.

Mixing in micro channel network utilizing chaos theory {{has shown that the}} potential but optimum mixing efficiency only can be achieved when Re~ 70, while usually microfluidic flow has Re~ 10. The most important advantages of liquid-liquid slug flow operation in micro channel are the absolute control volume and well mixing behaviour. Preliminary result shows that the synnge pump operating with a synnge above total nominal flowrate of 1 OO~lJhr, giving infusion accuracy of ~ 1. 5 %. When operating with two syringes simultaneously, average deviation of flow fraction is ~ 5 %. From qualitative analysis from experimental images, <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> slug break up at T-junction is driven by a combination of hydrodynamic force and capillary force as well as shear force. Hydrodynamic force is developed from Hagen Poiseulle equation while capillary force is developed from Young-Laplace equation. During slug formation, magnitudes of shear forces were exerted on the interface by the continuous phase because of varying volume in the T-junction available for the continuous phase flow. However, shear force generated just before break up is the most important force. For designing purpose, if the clean snap off of slug break up at the T-junction is desired, narrower micro channel is required. At low Weeff, the <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> slug break up occurs at the T-junction with a clean snap off, dominated by a combination of continuous phase upstream pressure and capillary force. At intermediate Weeff, the slug was broken from a <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> connecting neck, driven by both combination of forces and shear force. A <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> laminar flow region was formed in the micro channel at high Weeffi in which slug break up {{from the front of the}} laminar flow region. The break up is dominated by shear force applied by the continuous phase flow on the laminar flow region. A dimensionless number, Rj, which is the ratio of shear force to the combination of hydrodynamic force and capillary force is used for characterizing the importance of forces during slug break up. For Acetonitrile/tetradecane system, slug break up from the front of the <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> laminar flow region when Rj> 3. 5 e- 6. The role of shear force in break up becoming more important as Weeff increases, this is because of increasing contact area available for shear. However, estimation of area available for shear from 2 D experimental images is difficult. Empirical equations were developed in relating the <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> slug length to the frequency of slug formation, in which the threshold slug length is equivalent to <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> channel width. The properties of the immisible liquid-liquid systems are more important in characterizing slug break up operation in the micro channel network.

Flow parameter assessments in cyclones by different correlation of flow areas at the input and output have been conducted. Differences of flow parameters in conical and cylindrical cyclones have been explored. The analysis and causes of unsatisfied work of industrial battery separator with cyclone elements have been carried out. Battery devices with cyclone elements are extensively used in {{oil and gas industry}} for extraction of liquid and solid impurities from natural and petroleum gas [1]. There {{are a lot of different}} battery separators, characterized by geometric correlations of cyclone elements, their arrangements, elements of flow stabilization, acquisition of <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> from the flow and refined gas. In most cases these separators operate on gas-liquid flow. The concentration of <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> in refined gases is within the acceptable limit in this case. In operating of these separators on dry gases with abundance of dust th...|$|E
40|$|Liquid sprays {{are governed}} by a {{multitude}} of fluid- and thermodynamic transport processes between the liquid droplets and the continuous gas phase. At the phase boundary, interfacial transport processes lead to liquid atomization, droplet deformation and breakup, turbulent dispersion and modulation, air entrainment and vaporization into the gas phase. Within the <b>disperse</b> <b>phase,</b> droplet collisions make a major contribution to momentum transport and energy dissipation, and interfere with spray dynamics to great extent. Numerical simulations of disperse multiphase flows are based on sub-models for all significant transport processes. For collisional transport processes within the <b>disperse</b> <b>phase,</b> various collision algorithms and models have been developed, which predict collision incidents and the collision outcomes. However, existing algorithms are restricted to isotropic flows with small velocity gradients, which are not found in typical applications such as high-velocity engine sprays. To describe collisional transport processes under such conditions, a new collision algorithm has been derived in the present work, which accounts for anisotropic droplet dispersions and velocity gradients in the <b>disperse</b> <b>phase,</b> and increases the order of accuracy significantly over benchmark collision algorithms. The new algorithm is validated by synthetic validation cases, and tested with exemplary simulations of turbulent engine sprays. The simulations give an insight into the physics of collisional transport processes and their contribution to spray dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Dispersion of liquids {{are often}} {{encountered}} in industrial applications. For instance, plastics manufacturers frequently blend immiscible polymers to achieve desired mechanical properties. There are two problems {{central to the}} engineering of dispersions. One considers the influence of <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> microstructure, or morphology, on material properties [...] in many applications, the smallest <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> morphology is best. The other addresses achieving a particular morphology. The morphology in a blend results from the interaction between a frequently complex or chaotic flow, and coalescence and breakup. The mixing is crucial, and, in some cases, {{it is possible to}} tailor a morphology with a flow. However, the modeling of this process is incomplete. Presently, no model can predict the spatial statistics of <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> morphology. A further complication is that t! he <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> influences the macroscopic rheology of the blend. Einstein first demonstrated this behavior by showing that the effective viscosity of a system increased with <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> volume fraction of solids. Later, Taylor extended Einstein's results to allow for a <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> of spherical liquid droplets. Other researchers have improved upon Taylor's work, accounting for small deformations of the droplets, and shown that droplet deformation gives the dispersion an elasticity, resulting from surface tension. More recent developments in this area, allow for larger deformations, and coal escence and breakup. However, this area is relatively new with many inconsistencies in the literature. Furthermore, these newer phenomenological models contain a variety of adjustable parameters. The two inter-related goals of our work are a model for the spatial evolution of <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> microstructure, and a rheological description of liquidliquid systems. The ! former is accomplished by coupling pre-existing models of coalescence and breakup with the kinematics of mixing processes. We develop the latter by unifying the theory of the present phenomenological models for rheology, and by applying the description of the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> microstructure provided by our model to remove the adjustable parameters presently in the rheology models...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of a new regime of monodisperse micro-droplet generation that we named the balloon regime. A dispersion of oil in water in a T-junction microfluidic system was studied. Several microfluidic devices having different cross-sections of the continuous and the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phases</b> micro-channels were tested. This new regime appears only for low- <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> velocity. The micro-droplet size is mainly related to the geometry of the T-junction micro-channels especially its width and depth, and independent of the continuous and <b>dispersed</b> <b>phases</b> velocities. In our experiments, the velocities of the continuous and the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phases</b> vc and vd respectively, have been varied in a wide range: vc from 0. 5 to 500 mm/s, and vd from 0. 01 to 30 mm/s. We show that the continuous phase only controls the micro-droplet density, while the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> linearly changes {{the frequency of the}} micro-droplet generation. Another particularity of the present regime, which differentiates it from all other known regimes, is that the micro-droplet retains its circular shape throughout its formation at the T junction, and undergoes no deformation due to the drag forces. We propose a mechanism to explain the formation of microdroplets in this new regime...|$|R
30|$|The <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> of {{microemulsion}} {{can act as}} {{a potential}} drug reservoir, and the drug is partitioned between the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> and dispersion medium and can get transported through the membrane, e.g., skin, mucous membrane, etc. Another important point about using microemulsion is that the same medium could be used both for hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs [5].|$|R
