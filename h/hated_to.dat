His parents were {{dedicated}} to their family, {{and his mother was}} especially protective of her children; it was through her that Fox developed his stubborn dedication to whatever task he committed to do. His father recalled that he was extremely competitive, noting that Terry <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> lose so much that he would continue at any activity until he succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced {{her in that}} direction and she ended up getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E

25|$|The {{cannonball}} or {{round shot}} was the projectile used most often. Both direct and ricochet fire {{might be used}} to strike a target. Round shot was most effective when used against formed troops, particularly those in column and to a lesser degree against those in line. Most soldiers <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> be under long-range artillery fire because they were unable to shoot back at their tormentors with shorter-ranged muskets. The British avoided exposing their troops to round shot by placing them behind crests when possible, but all other nations customarily deployed their soldiers in the open. At closer ranges, the gunners switched to canister, an anti-personnel weapon. A canister round consisted {{of a large number of}} musket balls that, when fired, spread out and flew in the direction of the target. When supporting an attack, the cannons advanced with the infantry. Half the guns moved forward, covered by the remaining guns, then the other half moved, repeating the process. The battalion pieces, usually 4-pounders, fired at the enemy foot soldiers while the heavier guns targeted the enemy artillery. When under attack by enemy infantry, the cannons first fired at the enemy artillery. As the range closed, the guns aimed at the enemy foot soldiers.|$|E

500|$|Again, the Heath {{tendency}} for resentment and trouble {{led to the}} Browns trade. Washington had a utility infielder, Sherry Robertson, who was the nephew of owner Clark Griffith. During games, Heath would ride Robertson on the bench, calling him [...] "owner's pet", {{in reference to the}} possibility that Robertson was only on the team due to that relationship, and the possibility that Robertson was better paid than Heath. This {{was the subject of a}} column in the Washington Post after Heath was gone by longtime sports writer Shirley Povich, who <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> see the Heath bat leave Washington.|$|E
500|$|By early 1970, Nixon {{had decided}} he wanted Romney removed from his position. Nixon, who <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> fire people and was, as Ehrlichman later described, [...] "notoriously inadept" [...] at it, instead hatched a plot to get Romney {{to run in the}} 1970 U.S. Senate race in Michigan. Instead, Romney {{proposed}} that his wife Lenore run, and she received the backing of some state Republicans. [...] There was also resistance to her candidacy and an initial suspicion that it was just a stalking horse for keeping his options open. She barely survived a primary against a conservative opponent, then lost badly in the general election to incumbent Democrat Philip A. Hart. [...] Romney blamed others for his wife having entered the race, when he had been the major force behind it.|$|E
500|$|In {{her last}} years, Bond entertained wounded World War I servicemen, {{playing the piano}} and singing at a south coast home for {{disabled}} soldiers and sailors. [...] An obituary in The Evening Standard reported: [...] "Every day {{for more than a}} year, until just recently, she was taken out in her wheelchair. [...] After a breath of sea air ... she would always go into her favourite hotel for a drink and would often sit down at the piano and entertain the company with some of her old Gilbert and Sullivan tunes. [...] She often used to go to a home for wounded ex-servicemen of the last war [...] would give an impromptu entertainment, playing and singing her old songs. [...] She liked to go to parties and would always play and sing." [...] The Worthing Gazette stated that Bond continued to be much loved in her later years, and people came to see her from all over Britain to pay homage in her old age. The Worthing Herald wrote: [...] "Despite her great age, Miss Bond preserved a quick and active mind, and <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> be fussed over." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 1747, the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily. Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in Leicester Square. When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, Prince George, became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the Dowager Princess of Wales and wept with her. As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death. The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover. After {{the death of his}} daughter Louisa {{at the end of the}} year, George lamented, [...] "This has been a fatal year for my family. I lost my eldest son– but I am glad of it... Now [...] is gone. I know I did not love my children when they were young: I <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{preceding}} 1951 season, he reimposed {{the blackout}} rule on all {{teams in the}} league. The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted, [...] "You can't give fans a game for free on TV and also expect {{them to go to}} the ballpark"; nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952. After the 1951 season ended, he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL. He negotiated a deal with DuMont, which granted it the rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week, and he directed that the income from this contract was to be shared equally between all the teams. In the DOJ's case, the judge ruled that the blackout policy was legal, but both Bell, and the franchises collectively, were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract; Bell was ecstatic. Later that year, Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had bet on Browns' football games. Although he <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> fly, at some indeterminate point, he visited the training camps of every team and lectured on the danger gamblers posed to the league.|$|E

His parents were Gerald Joseph, a roofer, and veteran in the United States Army (1944–2007) and Pauline Cyr Nadeau. Nadeau's {{ancestors}} originate from St. John's Valley, Maine. He has one sister, Debbie. Nadeau was educated at Henry Abbott Technical High School and studied automotive technology. His family had connections to auto racing; Gerald raced modifieds at the Danbury Race Arena. Nadeau was given a go-kart by his father when he was four and one-half years old. He also worked with his father in the construction industry to support his career. Speaking about his father's role in his career, Nadeau said, [...] "I learned a lot from my dad, Gerry, while I was growing up. He wasn't afraid to yell and get on my toes to do my job because he <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> lose and I <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> lose. He made me the hungriest guy on the race track." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bruins volleyball {{team had}} an [...] "A" [...] squad and a {{developmental}} squad. A large blue curtain separated the two practice courts. Players were in constant competition {{to stay on}} the [...] "A" [...] squad. Scates used a scoring system for his players during the practices, and their position on the team depended on the points they were scoring in practice. The coaches with the development squad could recommend players to move up, and Scates would check scores and move an [...] "A" [...] court player down. The scoring system allowed the players to know there was nothing personal in the choices being made. John Speraw, a former player and current head coach at UCLA, commented [...] "the way he managed to make objective decisions was to stay fairly separate from the players. It was never personal. And once you graduated, he enjoyed the relationship that developed with his players." [...] He highly valued competitiveness in a player, and wanted to go into matches with players that <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> lose. UCLA alumnus Karch Kiraly noted a common thread in the players around him at UCLA: [...] "He recruited people that were like I was. We absolutely <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> lose and loved to win, and that's what the Bruins were like. They were a reflection of Al, and Al wanted to win every single match, every single season." ...|$|E
