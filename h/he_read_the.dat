5|$|Aston {{commented that}} {{throughout}} his life he suffered from poor health; he was afflicted with aspergillosis from the early 1980s, and was also asthmatic. He suffered a brain haemorrhage in March 2003, and was hospitalised for two weeks. The experience sent him into depression for eighteen months, during which time <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> autobiography of actress Jane Lapotaire, who {{had gone through the}} same experience, something which he believed aided his recovery more than anything else.|$|E

5|$|Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton. Kevin Spacey met Byrne at a {{party and}} asked him to do the film. <b>He</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> {{screenplay}} and turned it down, thinking that the filmmakers could not pull it off. Byrne met screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie and Singer and was impressed by the latter's vision for the film. However, Byrne was also dealing with some personal problems at the time and backed out for 24 hours until the filmmakers agreed to shoot the film in Los Angeles, where the actor lived, and make it in five weeks.|$|E
5|$|He had {{intended}} {{to go to the}} bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear Charles Simeon speaking of the good done in India by a single missionary, William Carey, and some time afterwards <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> life of David Brainerd, a missionary to the Native Americans. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On 22 October 1803, he was ordained deacon at Ely, and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon's curate at the Church of Holy Trinity, taking charge of the neighbouring parish of Lolworth.|$|E

5|$|Strong winds {{prevented}} Mawson {{from continuing}} for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for the stove, he boiled {{the remainder of}} the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> burial service.|$|E
5|$|Aburish {{asserts that}} Nasser was not distressed by his {{frequent}} relocations, which broadened his horizons {{and showed him}} Egyptian society's class divisions. His own social status was well below the wealthy Egyptian elite, and his discontent with those born into wealth and power grew throughout his lifetime. Nasser {{spent most of his}} spare time reading, particularly in 1933 when he lived near the National Library of Egypt. <b>He</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an, the sayings of Muhammad, the lives of the Sahaba (Muhammad's companions), and the biographies of nationalist leaders Napoleon, Atatürk, Otto von Bismarck, and Garibaldi and the autobiography of Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} summer of 1855, Gray made his third trip to Europe. This was an {{emergency}} trip to bring home his ill brother-in-law from Paris. Gray spent only three weeks in London and Paris, {{and on the way}} back <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> newly published Géographie botanique raisonnée by Alphonse deCandolle. This was a ground-breaking book {{that for the first time}} brought together the large mass of data being collected by the expeditions of the time. The natural sciences had become highly specialized, yet this book synthesized them to explain living organisms within their environment and why plants were distributed the way they were, all upon a geologic scale. Gray instantly saw that this brought taxonomic botany into focus.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Wilder {{relocated}} to Paris, accepting {{a leading role}} in Bud Yorkin's Start the Revolution Without Me, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but {{he would not be able}} to do the film for at least a year, so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|In early October 1944, Landis {{checked into}} St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, {{where his wife}} Winifred had been hospitalized, with a severe cold. While in the hospital, {{he had a heart}} attack, causing him to miss the World Series {{for the first time in}} his commissionership. He {{remained}} fully alert, and as usual signed the World Series share checks to players. His contract was due to expire in January 1946; on November 17, 1944, baseball's owners voted him another seven-year term. However, on November 25, he died surrounded by family, five days after his 78thbirthday. His longtime assistant, Leslie O'Connor, wept as <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> announcement for the press. Landis is buried at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{first began}} to {{consider}} the possibility of reaching the North Pole by using the natural drift of the polar ice when, in 1884, <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> theories of Henrik Mohn, the distinguished Norwegian meteorologist. Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel Jeannette, which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 {{on the opposite side of}} the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean current, flowing from east to west all the way across the polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.|$|E

5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} some conservative readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. <b>He</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. <b>He</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|The biogeographical {{patterns}} Charles Darwin {{observed in}} places such as the Galápagos Islands during the second voyage of HMS Beagle caused him to doubt the fixity of species, and in 1837 Darwin started {{the first of a series}} of secret notebooks on transmutation. Darwin's observations led him to view transmutation as a process of divergence and branching, rather than the ladder-like progression envisioned by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and others. In 1838 <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> new 6th edition of An Essay on the Principle of Population, written in the late 18th century by Thomas Robert Malthus. Malthus' idea of population growth leading to a struggle for survival combined with Darwin's knowledge on how breeders selected traits, led to the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin did not publish his ideas on evolution for 20 years. However, he did share them with certain other naturalists and friends, starting with Joseph Dalton Hooker, with whom he discussed his unpublished 1844 essay on natural selection. During this period he used the time he could spare from his other scientific work to slowly refine his ideas and, aware of the intense controversy around transmutation, amass evidence to support them. In September 1854 he began full-time work on writing his book on natural selection.|$|E

5|$|The two {{discussed}} {{the matter at}} a meeting in early 1952 in Palm Beach, Florida, where Rodgers was vacationing as he worked on melodic sketches for the television documentary Victory at Sea. Rodgers suggested dispensing with the overture, reserving that for the overture of the show-within-the-show. Following another meeting in mid-1952, they called in long-time Rodgers and Hammerstein stage designer Jo Mielziner and hired him to design the sets. Mielziner confirmed that a scene could be played part onstage and part in the backstage world, but that this would be expensive. In August 1952, Hammerstein began a sketch of the plot; by early October he had a near-complete first draft. As the show was to be musical comedy, the pair hired one of the top musical comedy directors, George Abbott, who accepted the position without reading the script. He regretted the haste of this decision as soon as <b>he</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script, finding it sentimental and melodramatic. He confided his concerns to the pair; in response, Hammerstein told him to make whatever changes in the script he thought best. With Hammerstein's permission, Abbott made major changes to the plot.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to focus}} on {{research}} problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating disk as it is moving through the air, inspired by an incident in the cafeteria at Cornell when someone tossed a dinner plate in the air. <b>He</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on quaternions, and attempted unsuccessfully {{to use them to}} formulate a relativistic theory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley.|$|E
