5|$|It is a big, strong cat, {{similar to}} the Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and a sturdy body. The breed <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> climbing, since they have strong claws. The {{lifespan}} is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases {{have been reported in}} the breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.|$|E
5|$|The game {{does not}} go well for Homer, who is {{obviously}} still jealous of Ned. Meanwhile, Bart and Todd find out about an upcoming children's miniature golf tournament, with the first prize of $50. They enter it, and although Todd <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> miniature golf, Homer becomes confident that Bart will win. He tells Bart {{that it is not}} okay to lose and forces him to stare angrily at a picture of Todd for 15 minutes every day. Later, when Bart looks at his meager collection of trophies in his room, Lisa offers to help him practice. Utilizing spiritual books that calm Bart's mind, they meditate. Meanwhile, Homer makes a bet with Ned on whose boy is a better golfer: the father of the boy who does not win the tournament will mow the other father's lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.|$|E

He is heavily indebted throughout most of the book, not so much for his own expenses as for Becky's. Not particularly talented as a military officer, he is content to let Becky manage his career.|$|E

Her friends in the musical ensemble tell her this, and ask her if she changed due to someone she likes, and Yasuna affirms this. Yasuna has shown herself to be very devoted to Hazumu, and in a conversation to Tomari, Yasuna tells her that she wants Hazumu all to herself.|$|E
25|$|Assessing the {{accuracy}} of CT pulmonary angiography is hindered by the rapid changes {{in the number of}} rows of detectors available in multidetector CT (MDCT) machines. According to a cohort study, single-slice spiral CT may help diagnose detection among people with suspected pulmonary embolism. In this study, the sensitivity was 69% and specificity was 84%. In this study which had a prevalence of detection was 32%, the positive predictive value of 67.0% and negative predictive value of 85.2%. However, this study's results may be biased due to possible incorporation bias, since the CT scan was the final diagnostic tool in people with pulmonary embolism. The authors noted that a negative single slice CT scan is insufficient to rule out pulmonary embolism on its own. A separate study with a mixture of 4 slice and 16 slice scanners reported a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96%, which means that it is a good test for ruling out a pulmonary embolism if it is not seen on imaging and that it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> confirming a pulmonary embolism is present if it is seen. This study noted that additional testing is necessary when the clinical probability is inconsistent with the imaging results. CTPA is non-inferior to VQ scanning, and identifies more emboli (without necessarily improving the outcome) compared to VQ scanning.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} {{five years}} were mixed for Trescothick. Averaging about 30 runs per innings, {{he was often}} criticised {{for a lack of}} foot movement. David Gower described Trescothick's technique by saying [...] "he does not need to move a long way but needs to move enough. When he is playing well ... he <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> transferring weight. When he is not playing well, his feet get stuck". However, Trescothick was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award for Somerset's most promising young county player in the 1996 and 1997 seasons. In 1997, Somerset Second XI were set 612 to win by Warwickshire Second XI, and Trescothick scored 322 to bring the Seconds to 605.|$|E

It'll often send its hero to convert your mines, to draw your units away from your town to chase {{him back to his}} city hall, while other units invade your area. It'll send minor units to hack at your buildings, and it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> hiding its numbers using the Fog of War.

2500|$|Foragers collect {{food that}} {{is around the}} nesting area {{and bring it back}} to the colony to share with the other ants. [...] T. sessile has polydomous colonies, meaning that one colony has {{multiple}} nests. Because of this, T. sessile <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> foraging for food when there is great variance in the distribution of resources. Instead of going back to a faraway nest to deliver food, they move workers, queens, and the brood to be closer to the food, so that they can reduce food transport cost. This is called 'dispersed central-place foraging'. It was also found that the nest half-life was about 12.9 days.|$|E

2500|$|Cindy was {{designed}} by designers Roberto Ferrari and Yusaku Nakaaki, among others. A character crucial to the story and gameplay, Cindy was first introduced in the Episode Duscae demo. Tabata described her as [...] "the kind of girl who <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> dealing with men". In response to negative comments about her appearance in player feedback for Episode Duscae, Nakaaki stated {{she had not been}} deliberately sexualized, but that the team had perhaps put too much [...] "heart and soul" [...] into her design. They chose to make adjustments so players would be more comfortable with her. Originally, Cindy's breasts jiggled so much that Tabata had to ask the team to tone it down.|$|E
2500|$|Preventing {{stolen bases}} by {{throwing}} to second base or third base to allow an infielder to tag a baserunner attempting {{to reach the}} base. A catcher who <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> preventing stolen bases {{is said to have}} a low stolen-base percentage; a poor one has many bases stolen while he catches. (A pitcher who is slow to deliver is often more at fault for stolen bases than the catcher is.) Ideally, a catcher {{should be able to get}} the ball from his glove to that of the player covering second base in under two seconds. This is referred to as a catcher's [...] "pop time", the time elapsing between the popping sound of the pitch striking the catcher's mitt and the similar pop when the ball arrives at the glove of the fielder covering second base.|$|E

[...] Of the myths Dawkins uses Hawcock writes: [...] "These, straw gods set up for Dawkins to knock down, are {{not up to the}} job of accounting for reality but at least give McKean some great subject matter." [...] Meghan Cox Gurdon writing for the Wall Street Journal says: [...] "His tone throughout alternates between real delight over how things work and avuncular pity for the people who persist in seeing an author behind the machinery of the universe... There is no plan, winks Mr. Dawkins, nor any divinity. There is just the 'magic' of the universe unfolding. If that is the view you wish your children to have of the cosmos, then The Magic of Reality will suit you very well." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the 1994 book Reinventing Politics, the Romanian author {{looked into}} the European {{revolutions}} of the previous decade, exploring the shades of repression, the differences in political culture, and how they related to {{the fall of communism}} in various countries. Calling it [...] "a significant contribution", New School sociologist Jeffrey C. Goldfarb argues: [...] "Tismăneanu <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> ordering the often confusing details of what he calls 'the birth pangs of democracy.' [...] " [...] Goldfarb objects to the text being [...] "long on historical detail and short on social theory", arguing that: [...] "As a result, [...] attempts at generalization often miss the mark." [...] According to Goldfarb, although Reinventing Politics cautions that the former communist societies risked folding into nationalism, xenophobia and antisemitism, its author [...] "does not provide a clear sense of how [...] can be avoided." [...] Goldfarb contends that, while the book expresses support for embarking on the road to an [...] "open society", it fails to explain how the goal is supposed to be reached. In his review of a 2007 reprint, Romanian cultural historian Cristian Cercel comments on Vladimir Tismăneanu's belief in politics being [...] "reinvented", which implied that power in former communist countries could be shifted to [...] "the powerless" [...] by following the example of Czechoslovak writer and activist Václav Havel. Cercel, who sees this as proof of [...] "well-balanced idealism", writes: [...] "Instead of an absolute critical distance, Tismăneanu presents us with a critical engagement {{at the core of the}} problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tour notably {{promoted}} Justin Timberlake and Usher when Jackson selected both as {{its opening}} acts during their early careers, exposing {{them to a}} wider audience. Both artists credit Jackson as a major showmanship influence from both [...] "an entertainment and evolution perspective." [...] While Timberlake was part of 'N Sync, Jackson personally selected them to open for the tour, helping to introduce the relatively unknown group to the public. Timberlake said [...] "I had her poster on my wall so I'm psyched", later describing the experience as [...] "fulfilling." [...] Jackson performed with the group on several dates, including joining them for a live a cappella rendition of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Overjoyed." [...] A biography stated it was a [...] "highlight" [...] moment for Timberlake which [...] "gave Justin {{a chance to show}} his family and friends how far he had come." [...] The tour was the largest audience the group performed for at the time; JC Chasez commenting [...] "That was great because we got to see how a real professional tours. And not only that she is really sweet. We really enjoyed it." [...] Chris Kirkpatrick added, [...] "She <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> entertaining. We learned a lot — that if people want to hear just the music, they can buy the CD. But it's the whole live aspect of changing the songs every night or the whole theatrical performance that she puts on. She's definitely one of our mentors when it comes to touring and the stage show. Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see." [...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't just stand there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is not even the most influential member of the Jackson clan. That accolade firmly belongs to Janet Jackson", who was [...] "one of the most successful artists of the last twenty years." [...] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became [...] "good friends", ultimately leading to Timberlake performing alongside Jackson during a segment of Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher described opening for Jackson as [...] "the biggest event" [...] of his career and an [...] "honor", saying [...] "She's a definite entertainer, works hard and sweats every night. I learned a lot about how to make an artist look like a star." [...] Nick Lachey and group 98 Degrees opened for several dates and experienced increased commercial success following the tour. Upon the release of Never Gone, AJ McLean of the Backstreet Boys described his hair as resembling [...] "Janet Jackson on the Velvet Rope Tour." ...|$|E

Therefore they take unto themselves the homage of the men's 'bella, bella!' that follows the sobs: it is due recognition of their hard wrongs: 'the woman pays.'
