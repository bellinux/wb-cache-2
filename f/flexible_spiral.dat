50|$|A simple {{development}} of the single-stroke bell was the sprung bell. This had previously been used, mechanically actuated, for servant-call bells in large houses. Instead of working a clapper, the electromagnet shook the whole bell, which was mounted on a <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> spring. The inertia of the heavy bell on the light spring would continue ringing for some seconds after the stroke. Although the sound would rapidly die away, the visible trembling of the bell could indicate which bell had been rung, amongst a panel of several.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1890s, a lighter, shorter style of corset was {{becoming}} popular, which had simpler shapes and which used much less boning {{than the previous}} decade. This style of corset quickly evolved into the beautifully complex early Edwardian style corsets. These corsets from 1901-1908 relied heavily on the complex cut of the pattern to create and accentuate the shape. Boning was used wholly {{for the support of}} the shape created by the cut of the fabric. Bones were most commonly made of steel by this time, and often placed in pairs within casings that did not follow the placement of the corset's seams. By the 1910s, the cut of corsets had become longer though less complex, and boning in corsets became merely a means to keep the corset's fabric taut. By the mid 1910s to 1930s, the emphasis was placed on comfort and the rigid steel boning was almost completely replaced by the more <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> steel boning.|$|E

40|$|Bonding a <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> wire {{retainer}} to the lingual {{surfaces of}} all 6 anterior mandibular teeth is a commonly used type of retention. Complications are rare {{but can be}} serious enough to produce biologic damage. This article presents a serious complication of a lingual <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> wire retainer. Four years after the orthodontic treatment, a 20 -year-old man sought treatment for a broken <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> wire retainer. The clinical examination showed about 35 ° of buccal root torque of that tooth. A cone-beam computed tomography image showed that the root and {{the apex of the}} tooth were almost completely out of the bone on its buccal side. Surprisingly, the tooth's vitality was preserved. The tooth was moved back, nearly to its original position; clinically, only a gingival recession remained. Orthodontists and dentists should be aware of possible complications of bonded retainers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} hybrid spiral-dynamic bacteria-chemotaxis algorithms {{for global}} optimisation and their application to {{control of a}} <b>flexible</b> manipulator system. <b>Spiral</b> dynamic algorithm (SDA) has faster convergence speed and good exploitation strategy. However, the incorporation of constant radius and angular displacement in its spiral model causes the exploration strategy to be less effective hence result- ing in low accurate solution. Bacteria chemotaxis on the other hand, is the most prominent strategy in bacterial foraging algorithm. However, the incorporation of a constant step-size for the bacteria move- ment affects the algorithm performance. Defining a large step-size results in faster convergence speed but produces low accuracy while defining a small step-size gives high accuracy but produces slower con- vergence speed. The hybrid algorithms proposed in this paper synergise SDA and bacteria chemotaxis and thus introduce more effective exploration strategy leading to higher accuracy, faster convergence speed and low computation time. The proposed algorithms are tested with several benchmark functions and statistically analysed via nonparametric Friedman and Wilcoxon signed rank tests as well as para- metric t-test in comparison to their predecessor algorithms. Moreover, {{they are used to}} optimise hybrid Proportional-Derivative-like fuzzy-logic controller for position tracking of a flexible manipulator system.

30|$|Apparently, in the {{patients}} with failed retainers, a greater increase in incisor irregularity could be measured[23]; therefore, {{the best method}} for long-term fixed retention should be selected.

This prospective randomized clinical study aimed to compare the mean survival time and the failure rate of two fixing methods: the <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> wire retainer and the ribbon reinforced retainer.

30|$|The {{stability}} of orthodontic treatment outcome {{is a major}} clinical concern, since many cases especially mandibular anterior teeth relapse after aligning [1, 2]. Permanent or long-term retention {{seems to be the}} only way to provide a proper post-treatment alignment [2, 3]. A proper method for this purpose is to use fixed retainers that remain permanently in the mouth and are invisible, compliance-free, and well tolerated [2, 4]. Fixed retainers were commonly made of stainless steel round wires and later thinner coaxial or braided round wires; among various fixed retainers of different metals, diameters, and designs, the <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> wire (twisted steel wire) is very popular between orthodontists for providing acceptable long-term retention [1, 2, 4 – 8].|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> wire (FSW) {{retainer}} is {{the most}} frequently used type of fixed retainer bonded on all 6 anterior teeth. Our aim in this article was to demonstrate unexpected posttreatment changes in the labiolingual position of the mandibular anterior teeth {{associated with the use of}} FSW retainers. METHODS: During a 3 -year period, patients attending the postgraduate orthodontic clinic of the Department of Orthodontics and Oral Biology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, for regular, posttreatment follow-up appointments were screened for unexpected posttreatment changes in the mandibular anterior region. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with FSW retainers bonded on all 6 mandibular anterior teeth presented unexpected posttreatment changes in that region. Almost half of these patients were assessed as needing retreatment. Two patients are presented to illustrate the 2 distinct patterns of posttreatment changes: torque difference between 2 adjacent mandibular incisors and increased buccal inclination and movement of one mandibular canine. CONCLUSIONS: FSW retainers bonded on the 6 mandibular anterior teeth might cause unexpected movements of anterior teeth to such an extent that retreatment is necessary. Clinicians should consider this possibility when planning the retention strategy...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of {{intracranial}} pressure (ICP) {{is of great}} importance in management of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). The existing clinically established ICP measurement methods require catheter insertion in the cranial cavity. This {{increases the risk of}} infection and hemorrhage.

The implants comprise ultrathin (50 [*]μm) <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> coils connected in parallel to a capacitive microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) pressure sensor. The implantable sensors are inductively coupled to an external on-body reader antenna. The ICP variation can be detected wirelessly through measuring the reader antenna’s input impedance.

In this study, the performance of the proposed telemetry system was evaluated in a hydrostatic pressure measurement setup.

The results showed that the available published references tend to underestimate the effects of compression. The study demonstrated that moderate compression in flexible ducts, typical of that often seen in field installations, could increase the pressure drop by a factor of four, while further compression could increase the pressure drop by factors close to ten. The results proved that the pressure drop correction factor for compressed ducts cannot be independent of the duct size, as suggested by ASHRAE Fundamentals, and therefore a new relationship was developed for better quantification of the pressure drop in flexible ducts. This study also suggests potential improvements to ASHRAE Standard 120 - 1999 and provides new data for duct design...|$|E

Preconcentration {{is achieved by}} {{a new type of}} centrifugal hydroclassifier with adjustable slope of the various revolutions of a <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral,</b> and remarkably well by an ”autopulsating hydroclassifier”, which treats up to 3 tons of ill-sorted material per hour with a recuperation of up to 90 % in an apparatus weighing 40 kg and driven by a current of (sea) water with a pressure of 1 atm. Electrostatic separation into conductive and isolating minerals was made more selective by using a high-tension generator equipped with an oscillator of variable frequency and by installing a generator of radiation with controlled wave-length between inducing and deflecting electrodes in the electrostatic separator. In this way it is possible, e. g., to separate zircon from quartz. Magnetic separation was improved by the development of a ”magnetic vibroclassifier” in which the grains are transported on a vibrating metallic plate through a magnetic field generated between a stationnary electromagnet and a rotating disc.

40|$|Introduction: The <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> wire (FSW) canine-to-canine lingual {{retainer}} {{bonded to}} all 6 anterior teeth is a frequently used type of mandibular fixed retainer. This study aimed {{to assess the}} long-term effectiveness of FSW canine-to-canine lingual retainers in maintaining the alignment of the mandibular anterior teeth after orthodontic treatment. Methods: The sample consisted of dental casts of 221 consecutively treated patients (75 girls, 146 boys) from {{the archives of the}} Department of Orthodontics and Craniofacial Biology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, The Netherlands, who received a FSW canine-to-canine lingual retainer bonded to all 6 anterior teeth after active orthodontic treatment. The casts were studied before treatment (Ts), immediately after treatment (T 0), 2 years (T 2), and 5 years (T 5) posttreatment. Results: The main irregularity index decreased significantly from 5. 40 mm (SD, 3. 47) at Ts to 0. 07 mm (SD, 0. 23) at T 0. At T 5, the alignment of the mandibular anterior teeth was stable in 200 patients (90. 5 %); in 21 patients (9. 5 %), a mean increase of 0. 81 mm (SD, 0. 47) was observed. The increase of irregularity was strongly related to the bonding failures of the retainer. In 6 patients (2. 7 %), unexpected posttreatment complications (torque differences of the incisors, increased buccal canine inclination) were observed. Conclusions: The FSW canine-to-canine lingual retainer is very effective in maintaining the alignment of the mandibular anterior region after active orthodontic treatment. However, regular checkups are necessary to determine bonding failures, posttreatment changes, and complications as early as possible. (Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop 2011; 139 : 614 - 21...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in teaching and learning of reading and writing skills to/by children with hearing impairment in an inclusive school in Karachi, Pakistan. In order to achieve this purpose, the research question that guided the course of the research was, 2 ̆ 7 what are the ways in which ICT might be used for teaching and learning of reading and writing skills to/by children with hearing impairment in an inclusive school in Karachi, Pakistan 2 ̆ 7. Embedded in the qualitative paradigm, action research was used to explore my research question. Action research is a <b>flexible</b> <b>spiral</b> process which allows action for change and improvement and research for understanding and knowledge to be achieved at the same time (Dick, 2002). The Kemmis, McTaggart and Retallick 2 ̆ 7 s (2004) model of action research was implemented in the study. However, only two cycles of action research could be completed. Classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, document analysis, reflective journal, video recording of classroom teaching, field notes were used as data collection methods. Four students (two with hearing impairment and two without hearing impairment) from a private inclusive school of Karachi, Pakistan, were selected as participants {{on the basis of a}} criteria. Moreover, the class teacher and assistant teacher acted as my critical friends. It was found that in order to address the learning needs of children with Special Education Needs (SEN), the use of multiple pedagogies and methodologies were helpful in keeping all the students engaged in the learning process. The use of ICT allowed the teacher to enrich the curriculum with relevant and interesting activities downloaded from the internet. However, the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge and skills of teaching children with hearing impairment posed several challenges. Thus, the professional development of teachers and their capabilities, in using ICT in an inclusive setting was found to be critical. It was found that children with SEN needed more input for improving their vocabulary. It was found that the overall low reading level of children with hearing impairment hinders them in participating in the reading activities and discussion processes even when multimedia were used. The written instructions, along with verbal instructions, projected through multimedia projector were found helpful to include children with hearing impairment in the classroom discourse. The features of power point presentation like hypertext, hypermedia and animations, use of digital stories and colourful pictures helped in gaining students 2 ̆ 7 attention for the reading and writing activities of children, particularly of those with hearing impairment. The above findings have implications as to how ICT can be used in teaching/learning of reading and writing in an inclusive setting in Pakistan. Further exploration of this innovation in education in special schools has been recommended. Lastly, it is recommended that the study could be replicated in a special school for children with hearing impairment in order to gain in depth information about the use of ICT in developing reading and writing skills of children with hearing impairment, An exploratory study could be conducted to see how children with hearing impairment communicate in schools and home, without using any standardised sign language...|$|E
