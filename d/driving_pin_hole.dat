The HPTR disc had developed a crack from one of the <b>pinning</b> <b>hole.</b> It was a through thickness crack and had propagated about 50 mm in the radial direction.

40|$|Gas {{turbines}} casings {{are susceptible}} to cracking {{at the edge of}} eccentric <b>pin</b> <b>hole,</b> which is the most likely position for crack initiation and propagation. This paper describes the improvement of transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life of gas turbines casings through the application of additional holes. The crack position and direction was determined using non-destructive tests. A series of finite element patterns were developed and tested in ASTM-A 395 elastic perfectly-plastic ductile cast iron. The effect of arrangement of additional holes on transient thermal fatigue behavior of gas turbines casings containing hole edge cracks was investigated. ABAQUS finite element package and Zencrack fracture mechanics code were used for modeling. The effect of the reduction of transient thermal stress distribution around the eccentric <b>pin</b> <b>hole</b> on the transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life of the gas turbines casings was discussed. The result shows that transient thermal fatigue crack propagation life could be extended by applying additional holes of larger diameter and decreased by increasing the vertical distance, angle, and distance between the eccentric <b>pin</b> <b>hole</b> and the additional holes. The results from the numerical predictions were compared with experimental data...|$|R

40|$|To {{overcome}} {{the failure of}} adhesive bridge due to release of the adhesive bond cement between teeth and metal, preparation modification was performed with a <b>pin</b> <b>hole</b> in the teeth cingulum. This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of thread on a <b>pin</b> <b>hole</b> to shear strength adhesion of adhesive bridge. Forty maxillary incisors were prepared at their palatinal surfaces 0. 3 mm thick, and were divided into four treatments (threaded hole+threaded pin, threaded holes+ non-threaded pin, non-threaded holes+threaded pin, non-threaded holes+non-threaded pin). Casted-plates made from nickel chromium alloy were cemented to the palatal surface of the tooth with adhesive cement (Panavia TMF 2. 0), and then adhesion shear strength tested. The test and evaluation of the residual cement on the surface were performed in Laboratory Metallurgy, Department of Engineering ITB. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test (p= 0. 05). Adhesion shear strength of plate with threaded holes+threaded pin has the highest retention. Residual cement on threaded hole+threaded pin plates similar to threaded hole+non-threaded pin, but more than any other groups. the conclusions were, the adhesion shear strength depends on the design of <b>pin</b> <b>hole.</b> The wider surface of cement remaining on the plates, the greater adhesion shear strength...|$|R
