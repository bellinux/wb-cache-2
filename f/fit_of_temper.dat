5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan {{to stand}} as a {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing his head against the wall of his stable in a <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper.</b> Tristan was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. Other good winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E
25|$|Another {{incident}} occurred in 1958 {{in a game}} against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and as he stepped from the batter's box swung his bat violently in anger. The bat slipped from his hands, was launched into the stands and struck a 60-year-old woman— one {{who turned out to be}} the housekeeper of the Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin. While the incident was an accident and Williams apologized to the woman personally, to all appearances it seemed at the time that Williams had hurled the bat in a <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper.</b>|$|E
25|$|Born into {{a family}} with {{powerful}} political connections, Pye used these to rise rapidly through the ranks, and to receive employments in periods of peace. He commanded a number of ships during the War of the Austrian Succession, and was appointed commander-in-chief in the Leeward Islands, but a <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper</b> when he was superseded almost cost him his career. Charged with disobeying orders and other infractions, Pye returned to Britain, where {{he was able to}} use his connections, and the absence of the experienced naval officers, to ensure a lenient outcome to his court martial. Despite this he remained unemployed during the Seven Years' War, though he reached flag rank.|$|E

But, strangely to Cytherea, Miss Aldclyffe looked delighted. The usual cross-examination followed.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{account of}} Douglas's murder {{comes from the}} Auchinleck Chronicle, a near {{contemporary}} but fragmentary source. According to its account, the king accused the Earl (probably with justification) of forging links with John Macdonald, 11th Earl of Ross (also Lord of the Isles), and Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Crawford. This bond, if it existed, created a dangerous axis of power of independently-minded men, forming a major rival to royal authority. When Douglas refused to break the bond with Ross, James broke into a <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper</b> and stabbed Douglas 26 times and threw his body out of a window. [...] His court officials (many of whom would rise to great influence in later years, often in former Douglas lands) then joined in the bloodbath, one allegedly striking out the Earl's brain with an axe.|$|E
2500|$|Following the resignation, {{there was}} great {{controversy}} about {{who was in the}} right and who was in the wrong. The Sydney Morning Herald initially opined: [...] "No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon. Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper</b> on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other." [...] On 17 March 1966, the Herald offered the view that: [...] "It was not his [...] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project .... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step .... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon the Just was so {{skeptical of}} the reasons for which nazirites might have {{interrupted}} their status that he found only one that he really trusted. He said that only once in his life had he eaten of the trespass-offering brought by a defiled tear in connection with an interrupted nazirite vow. On that occasion a nazirite came from the South country, and Simeon the Just saw that he had beautiful eyes, was of handsome appearance, and with thick locks of hair symmetrically arranged. Simeon the Just asked him what reason the nazirite had seen to destroy this beautiful hair by shaving it for the nazirite vow. The nazirite replied that he was a shepherd for his father and once he went to draw water from a well and gazed upon his reflection in the water, and his evil desires rushed upon him and sought to drive him from the world through sin. But the shepherd swore that day that he would shave his beautiful hair off for the sake of Heaven. Simeon the Just immediately arose and kissed the nazirite's head, praying that there would be many nazirites such as him in Israel. And Simeon the Just said that it was of this nazirite that [...] says, [...] "When either {{a man or a woman}} shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazirite, to separate themselves unto the Lord ..." [...] Rabbi Mani inquired why Simeon the Just did not eat of the guilt-offering of a nazirite. If it was because the nazirite was a sinner because he tormented himself, depriving himself of wine, that would be inconsistent with ever eating of the sin-offering (for example) for tasting forbidden fat or of the sin-offering for tasting blood. Simeon the Just thought that people made the nazirite vow in a <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper,</b> and since they vowed in a <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper</b> they would ultimately come to regret it. And once they regretted it, their sacrifices become like those of people who slaughtered unconsecrated animals in the Temple court (which would be disrespectful and forbidden). This nazirite, however, vowed after due mental deliberation and his mouth and heart were in agreement.|$|E

2500|$|Schopenhauer had a notably {{strained}} {{relationship with}} his mother Johanna. He wrote his first book, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, while at university. His mother informed him that the book was incomprehensible and {{it was unlikely that}} anyone would ever buy a copy. In a <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper</b> Arthur Schopenhauer told her that his work would be read long after the [...] "rubbish" [...] she wrote would have been totally forgotten. In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the Brockhaus publishing firm held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well. Hans Brockhaus later recalled that, when she brought them some of her son's work, his predecessors [...] "saw nothing in this manuscript, but wanted to please one of our best-selling authors by publishing her son's work. We published more and more of her son Arthur's work and today nobody remembers Johanna, but her son's works are in steady demand and contribute to Brockhaus' reputation." [...] He kept large portraits of the pair in his office in Leipzig for the edification of his new editors.|$|E

50|$|This low-budget film's {{unexpected}} box-office success {{resulted in}} a sequel, Mexican Spitfire, and eventually a film serie of seven films all together. All eight were directed by Goodwins, used venerable comedian Leon Errol as a comic foil, and showcased Vélez's comic persona, indulging in broken-English malapropisms, troublemaking ideas, sudden <b>fits</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper,</b> occasional songs, and bursts of Spanish invective.
