40|$|ABSTRACT: Fat blends, {{formulated}} by mixing a highly satu-rated fat (palm stearin or fully hydrogenated soybean oil) with a native vegetable oil (soybean oil) in different ratios from 10 : 90 to 75 : 25 (wt%), {{were subjected to}} chemical interesterification reactions on laboratory scale (0. 2 % sodium methoxide catalyst, time = 90 min, temperature = 90 °C). Starting and interesterified blends were investigated for triglyceride composition, solid fat content, free fatty acid content, and trans fatty acid (TFA) levels. Obtained values were compared to those of low- and high-trans commercial food fats. The interesterified blends with 30 – 50 % of <b>hard</b> <b>stock</b> had plasticity curves {{in the range of}} commercial shortenings and stick-type margarines, while interesterified blends with 20 % <b>hard</b> <b>stock</b> were suitable for use in soft tub-type margarines. Confectionery fat basestocks could be pre-pared from interesterified fat blends with 40 % palm stearin or 25 % fully hydrogenated soybean oil.

40|$|Palm oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{consumed}} vegetable oils in the world because of its unique physical properties. It imparts a very high stability to the β’ crystal form, yielding relatively small crystals which give a smooth texture and due to its naturally balanced fatty acid composition palm oil is semi-solid at room temperature. As such, it forms an ideal <b>hard</b> <b>stock</b> to be used in trans free food products. However from a nutritional point of view, palm oil contains too much saturated fatty acids, since their presence in the diet is among the factors contributing to cardio-vascular diseases. When using more unsaturated fats as <b>hard</b> <b>stock,</b> minor components (including structuring agents like lecithin) can be added in order to avoid compromising the functionality of the food product. Therefore, industry’s interest in the use of emulsifiers as minor components in the production of edible fat products to give them desirable melting and crystallization properties is continuously increasing. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of commercially available monoglycerides (M), polyglycerol esters (P) and lecithin (L) on the crystallization behavior of bulk fat as a function of the added concentration. Not only a single type of emulsifier, but also binary and ternary mixtures of M, P and L were added to the two different ‘host’ fats. The first was a palm based margarine fat, while the other was a non-hydrogenated vegetable fat, not based on palm oil which is used in fat rich products with a low amount of saturated fatty acids. A statistically sound mixture design was used to obtain as much information as possible. The obtained mixtures were analyzed for their non-isothermal crystallization and melting behavior by DSC. If a single type of emulsifier was added, the crystallization is accelerated due to heterogenous nucleation by adding M or P, while L addition has no significant effect on the crystallization rate. Furthermore it was shown that the minimum concentration necessary to provoke a crystallization accelerating effect is lower for P than for M. Antagonistic effects between M and L were suggested by the coefficient estimates of the special cubic model. When mixing the three emulsifiers a slight synergistic effect is observed, but the onset of crystallization is never higher than when pure M or P are added. When focusing on the melting behavior, emulsifiers (pure and in mixtures) reduce the offset of melting of both ‘host’ fats. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|African wild mango (Irvingia gabonensis) is {{recognized}} for its numerous food and medicinal uses (Leakey et al., 2005). This plant produces seeds rich in fat, which is traditionally {{used as a}} soup thickener (Adeyeye & Kenni, 2011; Kayode et al., 2010; Leakey et al., 2005). In the present study, fat from I. gabonensis seeds was solvent extracted and characterized. Melting and crystallization behaviour of the extracted fat was studied by pNMR, DSC and X-ray diffraction {{in order to get}} basic information regarding its physical properties and more particularly, about its polymorphism and its applicability in food industries. Results of this investigation showed that this seed represent an important source of lipids (69 - 75 g/ 100 g), rich in myristic (49. 8 g/ 100 g) and lauric acid (37 g/ 100 g). Due to his high saturated fatty acids content, I. gabonensis fat (IGF) presents a high SFC (solid fat content) at room temperature. The melting profiles of IGF can be compared to that of cocoa butter, but the melting point of IGF is higher, even after tempering, which has moreover no effect on IGF properties. This fat remains solid at temperatures up to 30 °C and the complete melting was detected at around 40 °C. The most stable polymorph of this fat is the β’ 1 -form, even after tempering and storage. Due to this high melting point, IGF could be used in fat blends, as <b>hard</b> <b>stock,</b> for structured product formulation (i. e margarine, shortenings and cacao butter substitute) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use enzyme interesterification to produce two hard stocks which were based on hard stocks used in the manufacture of margarine and pastry fats. Both of these two hard stocks produced need to be fast crystallizers; one with a low melting point for spreadable margarine whiles the other with a higher melting point for pastry fats. Commercial hard stocks were provided by Bakels Edible oil (BEO) Ltd. The study was divided into three stages. In the first stage, three commercial lipase enzymes supplied by Novozymes, including Novozyme 435, Lipozyme RM IM and Lipozyme TL IM, were used to interesterify tallow stearin, palm stearin and fully hardened coconut oil mixed in different ratios. The most promising fat blend with the lipase enzyme was selected for optimisation trials in stage two of the study. In stage two, the amount of lipase enzyme was investigated along with the time required to process these fats in order to optimise the interesterification method as both enzymes and production time are cost factors associated with the successful application of this <b>hard</b> <b>stock.</b> The commercial lipase enzymes are the key to the interesterification process and are expensive hence in stage three of this study, the reusability of the enzymes was looked into in order to determine the maximum number of uses that can take place for one dose of enzyme during batch processing. The resulting interesterified fats at the end of each stage were tested for physical properties such as melting point, solid fat content, rate of crystallization, and change in specific heat during crystallization and chemical composition of triglyceride content. The best result for spreadable margarine was a blend of palm stearin and fully hardened coconut oil at 50 %: 50 % and interesterified with 4 % of Lipozyme TL IM at 65 °C for 8 hours to achieve a melting point of 44 C. The best processing method for pastry margarine was blend of tallow stearin and fully hardened coconut oil at 70 %: 30 % interesterified with 4 % of Lipozyme RM IM at 65 °C for 8 hours to achieve a melting point of 44 C.

40|$|Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum; cv. Monaro and Alpine), {{zigzag clover}} (Trifolium medium; seed lines, Kentucky and Porters Pass) and white clover (Trifolium repens), were {{evaluated}} in a sheep grazing trial on a lowland medium fertility soil (Templeton silt loam) at Lincoln University, Canterbury. Each rhizomatous clover cultivar / seed line was sown (March, 1989) in plots with four rows 0. 75 m apart, 80 m long. There were three replicates of these plots (1. 5 m apart), each replicate arranged as randomised blocks. The site was oversown with Marsden high endophyte ryegrass (Lalium perenne) {{in the spring}} of 1992. Volunteer white clover Huia was present throughout the trial site. The 80 * 3 m plots were split into eight grazing plots 10 * 56 m rows in August 1993 by fencing, at right angles across the original plots. This resulted in 12 clover subplots in each main grazing plot. The eight main plots were divided into two replicates of four grazing treatments: two levels of grazing intensity (Lax (L) and Hard (H)) and two levels of grazing frequency (Set stocked (S) and Rotational grazing (R)). The four grazing treatments were first applied in September 1993, and then continued in early-February 1995 after having not been grazed since late December 1994. Set stocked lax pastures were grazed for 2. 5 days after an interval between grazing of 4. 5 days to maintain a pasture mass of about 1700 kg DM/ha. <b>Hard</b> set <b>stocked</b> pastures were maintained at between 600 to 800 kg DM/ha by grazing every 4. 5 days with a 2. 5 day interval between grazing. Hard rotational grazed treatments aimed to have a pre-graze herbage mass of between 1500 to 2000 kg DM/ha 25 days after grazing and a post herbage mass of 600 to 800 kg DM/ha after 5 days grazing. Lax rotational grazed paddocks were spelled for 25 days to achieve a pre-grazed herbage mass of 2000 to 3000 kg DM/ha then grazed for 3 to 4 days to a post-herbage mass of 1500 to 2000 kg DM/ha. Botanical analysis, clover morphology and grass characteristics were measured in all grazing treatments prior to grazing of the rotational grazed pastures in April, May, June and in early October after plots were grazed approximately every six weeks to a herbage mass of about 800 kg DM/ha. The intensity of the <b>hard</b> set <b>stocking</b> treatment was indicated by reduced ryegrass tiller populations, tiller weight and length by 50 % compared to the lax set stocked treatment. Infrequent grazing favoured ryegrass growth and tillering. The hexaploid Monaro Caucasian was the superior clover in the lax rotational grazed treatment covering 14. 3 to 29. 3 % of the subplots. Swards dominated by Monaro reduced other sward components. <b>Hard</b> set <b>stocking</b> of pasture reduced the percentage cover of all rhizomatous clover species; only white clover (8. 4 to 18 % cover) and weeds (16 to 24 % cover) increased under the extreme grazing pressure. Hexaploid Monaro Caucasian cover was superior to the diploid Caucasian cv. Alpine in cover and all growth characteristics. Hard rotational grazing treatments increased the number of clover growing points more than the other treatments for Caucasian and white clover species. Clovers in lax grazing treatments had longer petioles, but petiole growth potential may have been reduced by declining soil and air temperatures. Zigzgag clover generally had a very low cover and growing point populations, but lax infrequent grazing favoured zigzag most. An assessment of underground biomass in early August 1995, showed that the root weight of Monaro Caucasian (202 g DM/m³) far exceeded that of white clover (9 g DM/ m³). Rotationally grazed treatments had significantly (P< 0. 007) more Monaro underground biomass (330 g DM) than set stocked treatments (78 gDM/m³). This may reflect the preferential grazing of clover in reference to the high endophyte ryegrass. A supplementary study conducted on old seed plots beside the main trial site, was grazed to a herbage mass of 450 kg DM/ha on the 5 th of May and used to evaluate the regrowth of clover over 50 days. Monaro Caucasian clover and white clover produced far more growing points than any other of the clovers measured (5280 and 4790 growing points/m² respectively). Petiole length of all clovers increased during the 50 day period, particularly Monaro Caucasian and stoloniferous white clover (up to 73 mm). Growth of all but white clover slowed from 24 to 50 days indicating that the other rhizomatous species were becoming dormant due to low temperatures (Mean air temperature in May 9. 7 °C and June 6. 2 °C). Results from the experiment confirm the choice of hexaploid Caucasian clover for commercial pastoral development. Zigzag clovers were very low producing and uncompetitive with ryegrass under the range of treatments used. Alpine Caucasian (2 n) was less productive than Monaro (6 n). The reduced underground biomass of set stocked Monaro suggests that the rhizomatous habit may not be the ultimate response to continuous hard grazing and that some autumn spelling and or rotational grazing may be necessary to maintain root and rhizome reserves...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new understanding}} of equity-based compensation schemes, such as employee stock option plans. Current literature views such schemes as a measure aimed at motivating the recipient employees to work harder for the firm. Under such a view, this remuneration method either complements or substitutes other measures used to monitor the performance of the recipient employees. In contrast, this paper proposes that the recipient employee be viewed as the potential monitor of other employees and that stock options (or similar types of compensation) motivate her to fulfill this task.

Cet article presente une approche pour determiner un "ensemble approprie " de parametres du materiau pour decrire le comportement deviateur du materiau de revdtement. Les modele constitutifs de Johnson-Cook et Steinberg-Guinan sont evalues avec le modele de Steinberg mis en evidence comme etant le mieux adapte eq raison de sa limite superieure sur la contrainte d'Ccoulement. Un ensamble de parameters de durcissement par contrainte d'ecoulement est defiftni, fournissant une excellente correllente correlation avec les quatre configurations differentes d'ogives EFP. Abstrack The {{determination of}} liner material constitutive modeling parameters {{based on the}} results of four EFP tests, with different liner geometry's, is described in this paper. This paper presents an approach for determining an "appropriate set " of materiai parameters to describe the deviatoric behavior of the liner material. The Johnson-Cook and Steinberg-Guinan constitutive models are evaluated with the Steinberg model shown to be more suitable because of its upper limit on the flow stress. A set of flow stress hardening parameters are found that provide excellent correlation to the four different EFP warhead design configurations. 1. GENERIC WARHEAD DESCRIPTION The generic EFP warhead used in this study has an 89 mm diameter, LID of 0. 5, contains 300 g of LX- 14, and an 82 g copper liner. The EFP projectile created by the warhead is shown in Figure 1 [I]. It has a velocity of 2520 m/s, length of 58 mm, with nose and tail diameters of 18 mm and 24 mm respectively. The liner material used in the warhead is fabricated using a multi-step forge/anneal/coin process. The starting OFHC copper materiai is a thick disk machined from ASTM-B- 153 half <b>hard</b> bar <b>stock.</b> Th...|$|R
