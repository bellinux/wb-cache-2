I doubt whether the inhabitants themselves could do so. They are either too lazy or too sensible to worry themselves about abstract points of religious belief. While I was among them, they never held any synods or councils to settle the principles of their faith by agitating them. An unbounded liberty of conscience seemed to prevail. Those who pleased to do so were allowed to repose implicit faith in an ill-favoured god, with a large bottle-nose, and fat shapeless arms crossed upon his breast; whilst others worshipped an image which, having no likeness either in heaven or on earth, could hardly be called an idol. As the islanders always maintained a discreet reserve with regard to my own peculiar views on religion, I thought it would be excessively ill-bred in me to pry into theirs.|$|E

Whereas, from a global perspective, the international community seem to face the problems of regional equilibrium, which sometimes are caused by the trade liberalisation itself, mainly by negotiating regional trade agreements and free trade agreements, in that way creating areas of free trade and economic integration, often based on the EC experience as a model...|$|E

Building upon Durkheim's (1912) theory of collective rituals, we predicted that participation to the gacaca would involve a reactivation of negative emotions in both groups and would also impact negatively on perceived emotional climate. In contrast, we expected positive consequences for intergroup perception under {{the form of a}} reduction of (1) the prejudicial reactions of survivors and prisoners toward each other and (2) the perceived homogeneity of outgroup members.

40|$|People tend {{to believe}} that their {{internal}} states are transparent to others (e. g. illusion of transparency), and even more when they are self-centred. Would it be the case for narcissistic individuals who are highly self-centred? Three studies investigated whether narcissists feel more transparent because they are egocentric, or whether they feel less transparent because they are socially skilled. Using a vignette method, Study 1 showed that the more participants were narcissists, the less they <b>felt</b> transparent <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> their emotions, values and behaviour. Study 2 further showed that this association was stronger when narcissistic characteristics were valorised. In addition, the negative link between narcissism and felt transparency was mediated by self-monitoring. Using a face-to-face interaction, Study 3 provided evidence that participants high on narcissism were less prone to illusion of transparency. Overall our studies suggest that narcissists’ meta-perception is more accurate, less egocentric because they are socially skilled. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Moreover, instances had come to his knowledge in which harm had been done to both teachers and taught by their becoming aware that they were shown off to the public in print. Such things had happened even where they would have seemed not only unlikely, but impossible; and this rendered him particularly cautious in writing of his work, so that his reports were often dry, while he insisted strongly on his letters to his family being kept private.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{difficulties}} and needs of elderly Japanese cancer patients undergoing outpatient chemotherapy in regional cities with limited information and human recourses, for outpatient nursing care. An inductive, qualitative research design was utilized, involving interviews with cancer patients ≥ 65 -year-old who were continuing outpatient chemotherapy at hospitals in a regional city for three or more cycles. All of the patients provided their informed consent to participate in this study. The present study was approved by the ethics committee of both the participating university and hospital. There were 16 subjects, with a mean age, of 73. 2 years. The treatment period of the outpatient chemotherapy ranged from three months to eight years. The participants identified the difficulties were classified into six groups; Treatment related side effects associated with various types of pain; A decrease in physical strength which was not expected to recover easily; Shock of cancer diagnosis and relapse, etc. And the needs were classified into five groups; Continuing of therapy and their own life; Preparation for providing the information and the medical system to facilitate their in-home care; Providing for an accurate medical care and nursing, etc. This research clarified the difficulties and needs of elderly cancer patients who continued chemotherapy on an outpatient basis in regional cities. The patients were affected by symptoms which included the side effects of the chemotherapy. In addition, they <b>felt</b> insecurity <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> their social isolation, slow restoration of strength, and the problems of living alone. Improvements in the outpatient nursing support for such elderly cancer patients are therefore required...|$|R

[...] Beyond the band's own repertoire, it was described as [...] "metal played at its arresting best", and Andrew Rennie of NOW went as far as declaring it [...] "close to perfect". Not all reviews were so glowing, as the NME characterized it as [...] "45 minutes of awesomeness stretched out to a slightly bloated hour [...] the unsettling Toolisms of 'Ghost Key' meander just too long and 'Hand of the Host' spends half of its 11 minutes repeating itself without really juddering into the granite riff golem it threatens to be." [...] Similarly, Chris Norton of Tiny Mix Tapes feels that the album [...] "isn't the band's best by a really long shot, even if it ain't bad." [...] Accessibility was a similarly divisive issue, with the album being characterized as [...] "perhaps their most rewarding yet, but simultaneously their hardest to immediately access given its prioritising of subtle nuances over senses-numbing assaults" [...] and [...] "a slow-burning success".

40|$|Total joint {{arthroplasty}} (TJA) is {{a cost-effective}} and generally accepted treatment {{for patients with}} end stage OA. However, variation in provision and also satisfaction with outcomes has emerged within the NHS. Shared decision-making (SDM) could potentially counteract these problems by helping shape realistic expectations. In order to incorporate SDM into the decision-making process {{it is important to}} understand what influences patients’ decisions to go ahead with the TJA. In addition, literature is lacking regarding differences in this process between patients from different SES, which could also contribute to the SDM process. As such, this study sought to investigate what influences patients’ decisions to go ahead with TJA. In addition, this study aimed to examine whether there were differences between socio-economic status in this decision making process. Data were collected using in depth semi-structured interviews with a purposeful sample of participants (n= 7) with OA awaiting TJA. A two-part analysis of the data was undertaken using an Interpretative Phenomenological Approach. Five main themes, along with associated subthemes emerged from the first part of the data analysis. These were: symptoms, opinions of others, experiences of surgery, social impact and the surgery itself. Preliminary differences also emerged from the second part of the data analysis <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> the effect of SES on decision-making. These were the level of activation of the individual within the decision- making process and also the level to which the participants <b>felt</b> informed <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> the surgery. The results support current understanding that the decision-making process is very individual and complex. They provide evidence that there are many factors that healthcare professionals must be aware of in terms of incorporating SDM into the decision-making process. In addition, tentative conclusions can be made that there are preliminary differences in the decision-making process that are dependent on SES. Further research in this area is indicated by these findings. However, healthcare professionals need to be aware of these in order to provide appropriate information and support to shape realistic expectations and therefore improve satisfaction with outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Informing lay {{citizens}} about complex health-related {{issues and}} their related ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA) is one {{important component of}} democratic health care/research governance. Public information activities may be especially valuable when they are used in multi-staged processes that also include elements of information and deliberation. Objectives: This paper presents a new model for a public involvement activity on ELSA (ethics university) and evaluation data for a pilot event. Methods: The ethics university is structurally based on the ‘patient university’, an already established institution in some German medical schools, and the newly developed concept of ‘ethics literacy’. The concept of ‘ethics literacy’ consists of three levels: information, interaction, and reflection. The pilot project consisted of two series of events (lasting four days each). Results: The thematic focus of the ethics university pilot was ELSA of regenerative medicine. In this pilot the concept of ‘ethics literacy’ could be validated as its components were clearly visible in discussions with participants {{at the end of}} the event. The participants reacted favorably to the ethics university by stating that they <b>felt</b> more educated <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> the ELSA of regenerative medicine and <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> their own abilities in normative reasoning on this topic. Conclusion: The ethics university is an innovative model for public involvement and empowerment activities on ELSA theoretically underpinned by a concept for ‘ethics literacy’. This model deserves further refinement, testing in other ELSA topics and evaluation in outcome research...|$|R

Métodos: Estudio observacional de series de casos clínicos, multicéntrico, prospectivo y abierto, en pacientes afectos de úlceras agudas y crónicas. La duración del estudio fue de hasta 20 cambios de apósito o hasta la curación. En la visita inicial se valoraron las características clínico-morfológicas de la lesión, en todas las visitas sucesivas de cambio de apósito se valoró la evolución de la lesión y el grado de satisfacción del paciente, y en la visita final se valoraron las características finales de la lesión y el comportamiento del apósito, así como la valoración global del grado de satisfacción, tanto por parte del paciente como por el del investigador. Resultados: Se incluyeron 428 pacientes con una edad media de 74 años. Al final del estudio el tamaño de la úlcera disminuyó significativamente, desde el inicio del tratamiento hasta su finalización. La epitelización aumentó del 35, 2 % al 86, 8 %. Se encontraron diferencias estadísticamente significativas (p Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the degree of}} patient satisfaction and overall behaviour using a hydrocolloid dressing (Sureskin®II) {{in the treatment of}} acute and chronic ulcers in daily clinical practice. Methods: By means of an observational, multicentric, prospective, open study of a series of clinical cases on patients afflicted with acute and chronic ulcers. This study lasted through 20 dressing changes or until the ulcers were cured. During the initial visit, the clinical-morphological characteristics of the lesion were evaluated, on all subsequent visits and as dressings were changed, the evolution of the lesion and the degree of patient satisfaction was evaluated, and during the final visit, the final lesion characteristics and behaviour of the dressing were evaluated, along with the overall degree of satisfaction of both the patient and the investigators. Results: This study evaluated 428 patients whose average age was 74. At {{the end of the study}} the size of these ulcers had significantly reduced from the start to the end of the treatment. Epithelisation increased from 35. 2 % to 86. 8 %. Statistically significant differences were found (p< 0. 0001) in pain intensity (reduced by 60 %), exudates level (reduced by 50 %), perilesional erythema (reduced by 65. 2 %) and skin maceration (reduced by 57. 2 %) between the initial and the final visit. The investigators' degree of satisfaction reached 95 % mainly due to how adaptable and easy to remove the dressing was, as well as its overall behaviour. The overall patient satisfaction was over 8 on an ordinal scale from 0 to 10; 90 % of patients <b>felt</b> very satisfied <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> ease of use (dressing change) and 87 % stated that Sureskin®II allowed them to carry on their daily activities more comfortably. Conclusion: Sureskin®II provided a high degree of satisfaction for the patients being treated, proving effective in healing and accelerating this process...|$|R
