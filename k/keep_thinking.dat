Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) cheerfully withstands her colleagues' teasing over her speech from [...] "Beach Games," [...] and tells Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) {{that she is not}} sorry about what she said but regrets putting Karen in an awkward position.

500|$|According to Peter Shapiro of Relix, {{some fans}} of Phish debated {{whether or not}} there had been any {{references}} to the band before [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's". While the band was mentioned by name in the season12 episode [...] "Lisa the Tree Hugger", there had not been any conscious attempts to reference the band before [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's". This includes a scene in the season11 episode [...] "Saddlesore Galactica", which shows Duncan the diving horse hanging from a hoist; some Phish fans argued that the scene was a [...] "blatant" [...] reference to the cover of the band's seventh studio album, Hoist. [...] "That was a total coincidence", Jean said. [...] "It reminds me of the whole Wizard of Oz/Pink Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon) hook-up. I haven't done it and I'm sure it works, but I just <b>keep</b> <b>thinking</b> that it must be a coincidence. Before there was the invention of video, I don't know how Pink Floyd would have done a whole album to a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|All four episodes were {{directed}} by Lee Salisbury, who learned {{three weeks before}} filming {{that he would be}} working on the episodes, and said he was [...] "a bit dumbstruck" [...] to discover he would be directing the fire episodes and Windsor's departure, but that he was proud to do so. He said his main aim for the fire was to show the fear, panic and pandemonium that comes when a fire starts and quickly spreads. He wanted the story to be character-led rather than led by the fire, saying that the fire [...] "almost becomes a backdrop". Salisbury said it was hard to make the fire look real because [...] "you can't actually set fire to stuff". As the fire lasted for some time, characters' scenes could be divided up into small sections. Salisbury commented: [...] "Bryan Kirkwood, the writer [...] and myself also wanted it to be an episode where things kept happening and the audience would <b>keep</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Wow, that must have been the explosion' or 'That must have been the stunt'. But more things keep happening and happening, and I think that's what people will find really shocking." [...] The production team had several production meetings for the weeks' worth of episodes, whereas there is usually just one.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973 she was {{a student}} at the University of the Witwatersrand when she met her first husband, the finance magnate and art collector, Gordon Schachat. They married in Mauritius in 1982 and shared a home {{together}} in Linksfield Ridge, an upscale Jewish area in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Their two-year marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Allan attributed her burgeoning career as a factor: [...] "I was obsessed with my column. I was intent on becoming the best journalist in the country." [...] They remained friends and Schachat supported Allan's testimony in the 1992 libel suit she brought against Channel 4 in London. Allan told a London court that eight years after their marriage breakup, Schachat was her closest friend and described their union as [...] "the right people at the wrong time." [...] Allan writes about the marriage to Schachat in her 2015 memoir, Jani Confidential: [...] "I <b>keep</b> <b>thinking</b> about what happened and what I would have done differently. Pretty much everything I suppose. Gordon had to live through the weekly angst about the column. It was like reinventing the wheel every week. My validity as a partner hinged - or so I thought - on my success as a columnist. I couldn't have got it more wrong. The column was the all-consuming Moloch, when it had been put to bed, there was nothing left of me." ...|$|E
