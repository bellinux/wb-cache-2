500|$|Based on the {{positive}} response he had received in San Francisco, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town (1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town, was a role Tracy took seriously: [...] "I'm so anxious {{to do a good}} job as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me awake at night." [...] Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: [...] "I <b>honestly</b> <b>do</b> not feel that I can accept this award... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man—Father Flanagan". He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money-making star of 1938.|$|E
500|$|Keenor's {{abilities}} {{were described}} as scant. A 'terrible' shot and unable to reliably run with the ball, his strength lay in {{his commitment to the}} cause and in his uncompromising tackling. Fred Stewart, who coached Keenor for over 15 years at Cardiff City stated [...] "I <b>honestly</b> <b>do</b> not believe the word [...] "beaten" [...] is in his vocabulary." [...] Former team mate, Ernie Curtis said of him: [...] "He was one of the hardest tacklers in the game, some said he was dirty but he was just hard. Nobody took liberties with old Fred... could run all night, he couldn't run with the ball mind you, but he could run all day." [...] Charlie Buchan, captain of the opposing Arsenal side in the 1927 FA Cup final, described Keenor as having [...] "a store of energy (that) seemed inexhaustible in defending his goal". His hard tackling style made him a target for opposition fans, even being assaulted after a match for Crewe Alexandra during the later years of his career after a physical performance against an opposition side angered some of their fans.|$|E

No, I'm not at all sure about that. For one thing, if they really wanted to do something useful, they could devote their prayer time and energy to some pressing project that they can do something about.|$|E

2500|$|Duff McKagan {{praised the}} album, saying that [...] "Axl sounds amazing" [...] and [...] "I think Axl's finally made the record {{he always wanted}} to". Slash reacted {{positively}} to the title track, stating [...] "That sounds cool. It's good to hear Axl's voice again, y'know?" [...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And {{at the same time it}} just shows you how brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations. Izzy Stradlin, soon after the album was released, said [...] "I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them" [...] and [...] "I like what I've heard." [...] Steven Adler said he [...] "didn't like the album, not one bit." [...] Gilby Clarke stated [...] "I think it's a really good record – I <b>honestly</b> <b>do.</b> I think it's a great record... Knowing what I know what direction he wanted to take the band, I think he hit the nail on the head; I think he did a great job" [...] Matt Sorum called the album a 'toe-tapper'. Early Guns N' Roses guitarist Tracii Guns said he thought the album was [...] "over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting." ...|$|E
