25|$|In 1984/85 Marshall {{had another}} {{successful}} series {{at home against}} New Zealand, although there were calls for his bouncers to be ruled as intimidatory beyond what was acceptable, and that Marshall should have been admonished by the umpires. A rising delivery broke the nose of Mike Gatting, England's captain, in a one-day match in February 1986; Marshall later found bone fragments embedded in the leather of the ball. As well as the bouncer, however, Marshall succeeded in swinging the ball in both directions. He also used an in-swinging yorker as well as developing an effective leg-cutter, and {{with the exception of}} the 1986/87 New Zealanders, against whom he could only manage nine wickets at 32.11, no side seemed to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to him.|$|E

500|$|In 2015, Willamette Week {{described}} the establishment as a [...] "patioed mountain chalet with homestyle food that seems as domestic as Grandpa's house, with busy Thursday karaoke, 'bottomless' mimosas at its essential Sunday brunch, and a charmingly dirty-avuncular bartender {{who seems to}} <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> for everything". Following its closure, the newspaper's Matthew Korfage called Starky's a [...] "little mountain chalet" [...] and [...] "friendly little neighborhood bar catering to longtime regulars in the gay community with raucous karaoke, home-style food and a Sunday brunch that offered up bottomless cheap-bubbly mimosas unless you misbehaved".|$|E

500|$|Reinfeldt {{has said}} that he left the Church of Sweden when he was {{eighteen}} years old, critical of the left-leaning perspectives of the church. In an interview as Prime Minister he however said that he could not state if he believed in God, discussing his belief [...] "that something exist that is not just about the scientific explanation for how the Earth was created. But exactly what it is I don't <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> for, I am both searching and wondering." [...] He was however married, and had his children baptized in the Church of Sweden.|$|E
500|$|Morrissey had {{specific}} {{instructions on how}} he wanted the [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] single to be packaged. He told Rough Trade's art department that the single should have a paper label centre with four vents encircling the middle, in homage to singles from the 1960s. The cover to the single features a photograph of George O'Mara by Jim French, taken from Margaret Walters' history The Nude Male. The sleeve's homoerotic undertones elicited the reaction Morrissey was hoping for of unease and outrage. Rourke said when he showed the recording to his parents his father was [...] "mortified. He said to me, 'that's a bloke's bum' and I said, 'yeah' but when he asked me why I just didn't <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> for him".|$|E
500|$|In England, Wenger {{has used}} his {{extensive}} {{knowledge of the}} European transfer market and rulings – particularly in his native France – to recruit players. His first purchase as Arsenal manager was Anelka from Paris Saint-Germain for £500,000, a deal which upset the French club as they received little remuneration. The player's subsequent sale to Real Madrid just two years later for £23.5million highlighted Wenger's shrewdness in the transfer market. He remained in contact with Guillou's Abidjan-based academy, where he discovered future Arsenal players Touré and Emmanuel Eboué, and successfully persuaded Fàbregas and Hector Bellerín, amongst other La Masia graduates, to leave Barcelona and join him. Wenger's recruitment of young players came under criticism from Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who disputed it was tantamount to child trafficking. Wenger refuted the analogy and said: [...] "Look at Santa Cruz at Blackburn. Ask him what age he came to Bayern Munich. Then you <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> for Rummenigge." ...|$|E

2500|$|In atomic physics, {{spectroscopy}} gave observational data on atomic transitions {{arising from}} the interactions of atoms with light quanta. The Bohr school required that only those quantities which were in principle measurable by spectroscopy should appear in the theory. These quantities include the energy levels and their intensities [...] {{but they do not}} include the exact location of a particle in its Bohr orbit. It is very hard to imagine an experiment which could determine whether an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom is to the right or {{to the left of the}} nucleus. It was a deep conviction that such questions did not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, then-Representative Nathan Deal {{replied to}} a {{question}} about whether he believed that Obama [...] "is a native-born American citizen who is eligible to serve as president" [...] with a statement that [...] "I am joining several of my colleagues in the House in writing a letter to the President asking that he release a copy of his birth certificate so we can <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to this question." [...] Contrasting the differing fates of Deal, who won the 2010 gubernatorial election in Georgia, and former Democratic Representative Cynthia McKinney, who lost her primary after endorsing 9/11 conspiracy theories, David Weigel of Slate noted: [...] "Dipping a toe into the birtherism fever swamp didn't stop Deal from winning a statewide primary." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, on January 23, the Supreme Court {{decided to}} hear the case, staying the {{surviving}} petitioners' executions. [...] The proceeding was then renamed, with Richard Glossip as lead petitioner. One hour of arguments were heard on April 29. [...] At oral arguments, four conservative justices expressed impatience with obstructionist unavailability caused, Justice Scalia said, [...] "by the abolitionists putting pressure on the companies that manufacture" [...] the drugs. Justice Alito called this [...] "guerrilla war against the death penalty", and Justice Kennedy insisted to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> from the petitioners on whether the court should take this element into account. Four liberal justices, conversely, harshly questioned the Oklahoma Solicitor General, with Justice Kagan describing the execution protocol as [...] "burning alive, from the inside." [...] Justice Thomas, as is usual, said nothing.|$|E
2500|$|Stefani {{believed}} {{that some of}} the fans of No Doubt would be upset with her solo effort, commenting, [...] " [...] were probably like, 'Why is she doing this record? She's going to ruin everything'." [...] She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album. For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Williams incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became [...] "Hollaback Girl". The two decided that Stefani did not have to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right. On its creation, Stefani said, [...] "To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long." [...] Williams was pleased with the song, commenting, [...] "Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Commission opened {{negotiations}} with the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache at Fort Sill on September 26, 1892. Jerome made an opening presentation, and Quanah Parker asked specifically how much money per acre, and what were the terms offered. Jerome stalled {{on the details of}} money. Other tribal members preferred to defer the negotiations until the Treaty of Medicine Lodge expired. [...] At the next day's session, Parker continued to press Jerome for financial details, as Jerome avoided discussing the money. Sayre detailed the overall offer of $2,000,000 and per capita distribution. Parker once again asked how much per acre. Sayre didn't <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> and Parker asked him how he arrived at $2,000,000. To that, Sayre replied, [...] "...we just guess at it." [...] Parker stated that he had heard about price per acre differential between the various tribal agreements. Lone Wolf added that many wanted to defer until the expiration of the Medicine Lodge treaty.|$|E

2500|$|The plan {{moved forward}} after {{confirmation}} that O'Brien's contract did not guarantee a strict 11:35 start time (a loophole included primarily to accommodate sports preemptions and specials {{such as the}} network's New Year coverage). Gaspin planned to disclose the news to Leno first, and then, if all went well, report it to O'Brien the next week. When Gaspin met with Leno and Vickers and laid out the proposal, the response was positive, although they questioned how such a plan would work. Gaspin reasoned {{that the company was}} in a desperate position, and he indicated his confidence that O'Brien would too go along with the changes. While Leno embraced the plan, Vickers was unnerved; without a guest or music act she might have no studio audience, which could have disastrous consequences for Leno. In order to meet with O'Brien the following Monday, Gaspin was forced to cancel a meeting with the affiliate board, but promised them that by doing so, he would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to the 10pm problem that [...] "will likely be something they're happy with". Following his Wednesday, January 6 show, O'Brien met with manager Gavin Polone and lamented his anxiety with the ratings: [...] "I just think [...] is going to hurt me in some way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tensions at Mercedes {{increased}} {{following the}} qualifying session in which Hamilton felt Rosberg had deliberately driven {{off the track}} {{in a bid to}} disrupt his effort of taking pole position which caused their relationship to deteriorate. Hamilton refused to accept Rosberg's apology for the incident and the two did not communicate with each other on the podium. The incident upset the team's non-executive chairman Niki Lauda who stated that while Hamilton was not happy finishing second, he had to accept that Rosberg was quicker, and did not like the lack of communication between the two drivers on the podium. Lauda revealed that he would speak to the drivers before Canada. Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, stated the incident between Rosberg and Hamilton {{would not be allowed to}} occur again in the future and affirmed the drivers would be allowed to do what they wished as long it was not performed in a deceitful manner. Hamilton said he did not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> and was surprised on how quickly the situation escalated. After Hamilton spoke with Rosberg, he posted a picture on Twitter with him and Rosberg in their youth to ease anxiety over their relationship, saying: [...] "We've been friends a long time, and as friends we have our ups and downs. [...] "Today we spoke and we're cool, still friends, no problem." [...] FIA race director Charlie Whiting suggested that qualifying be extended by one minute to enable any drivers affected by yellow flags another attempt at a timed lap to prevent similar incidents in the future.|$|E
