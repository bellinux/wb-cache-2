In addition, 13 patients with bird fancier's lung (11 of the original group) were tested at least one year after avoiding exposure to the causal antigen. Five antigens (candidine, staphylococcal toxoid, tuberculin purified protein derivative, trichophyton, and streptokinase-streptodornase) were injected intradermally (0. 1 ml) and the mean weal diameter was measured at 48 hours. The mean weal size was significantly less in the subjects with bird fancier's lung at the time of diagnosis than in the control group (2. 23 v 5. 66 mm) but did not differ significantly from that of the subjects with sarcoidosis (2. 80 mm) or from that of the bird fanciers with no exposure to the causal antigen for one year (2. 75 mm).

40|$|Background: <b>Delayed</b> <b>cutaneous</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> {{tests are}} a {{globally}} accepted test to assess cellular immunity in vivo. The {{quality and quantity}} of the response to these type of tests, varies in different populations. Aim: To study <b>delayed</b> <b>cutaneous</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in a group of healthy Chilean elders. Material and methods: Forty two elders (32 male), aged 60 to 76 years old were studied. Multitest-CMI® was applied in the left forearm. This test allows the subcutaneous administration of seven antigens and a glycerin control. Results were compared with those of a group of young adults studied by the authors. Results: Among males there was a mean of 2. 7 ± 1. 4 positive responses compared with women, that had 1. 7 ± 1 positive responses (p= 0. 016). The sum of response diameters was 4. 2 ± 1. 5 and 3. 6 ± 1. 9 mm in men and women respectively (p = NS). Compared to young adults, elderly women had a lower response to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and men had a lower response to diphtheria and Proteus mirabilis. Conclusions: Elderly people have a less intense response to <b>delayed</b> <b>cutaneous</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> tests than young adults. This response must be assessed in each population to account for regional variability. (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128 : 379 - 86) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} 24 week {{study of}} 31 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (18 women, 13 men) was undertaken {{to determine whether}} weekly intramuscular sodium aurothiomalate (gold) would influence <b>delayed</b> type <b>cutaneous</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> (DTH) and other indices of cell mediated immunity. DTH to seven recall antigens was measured by Multitest on three occasions during the study. Twenty five patients completed the study. At entry 13 patients (12 female) were anergic, and no significant correlations were found between DTH and other clinical and immunological indices. Women showed a significantly greater depression of DTH than men. At week 24 {{only three of the}} patients were anergic with significant increase in mean DTH score being noted particularly to tuberculin, candida, and streptococcus. Improvement in DTH was observed in both gold responders and non-responders. In conclusion, patients with active rheumatoid arthritis show impairment of DTH, which is reversed by chrysotherapy. This effect is most apparent in women and appears to be relatively independent of the clinical response...|$|R

40|$|A {{patient with}} {{intestinal}} lymphangiectasia (IL) was studied for his immunological abnormalities. The patient had hypoproteinaemia with severe hypogammaglobulinaemia. The results of lymphocyte subpopulation studies revealed {{a decrease of}} CD 4 + cells and a decrease of surface immunoglobulin (sIg) -positive B lymphocytes. T cell functions determined by the proliferative responses against Concanavalin A (Con A) or phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and by <b>delayed</b> type <b>cutaneous</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> (DTH) response to purified protein derivatives (PPD) and PHA were normal. No immunoglobulin (Ig) -secreting cells were induced when his peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were cultured with pokeweed mitogen (PWM). His T cells showed suppressor function to the PWM-induced differentiation of normal B cells. This suppressor activity was sensitive to 3000 rads irradiation. His B cells also failed to differentiate into Ig-producing cells {{with the help of}} normal T cells and PWM. Thus, in this patient, the decrease of Ig-synthesis in vitro could be attributed to suppressor T cells, lack of T helper cells and an intrinsic B cell defect. Therefore, this patient appears to have immunological abnormalities which differ from previously reported IL patients...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The {{presence}} of anergy {{and its relationship}} to malnutrition was investigated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in controls. A generalised reduction in <b>delayed</b> <b>cutaneous</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> to 7 recall antigens were found in 104 RA patients compared with 67 controls. No measure of the disease was capable of predicting cutaneous anergy, which was present in 36 % of patients but none of the controls. A detailed dietary assessment in 30 RA patients and 30 controls revealed little evidence of clinically important malnutrition. It is therefore concluded that the cutaneous anergy of rheumatoid arthritis is not a consequence of nutritional factors. Abnormalities of cell mediated immunity (CMI) are thought to be of fundamental importance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ' <b>Delayed</b> <b>cutaneous</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> (DCH) has been used as an in-vitro measure of CMI, and both normal and depressed DCH have been reported in RA, 23 the more recent studies concluding that a depression of DCH does exist but without agreement over its relevance o...|$|E
40|$|In part 2 {{peripheral}} lymphocyte count, {{the total number}} of spleen cells, the weight and histology of the spleen, in vitro proliferative response of spleen cells to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and <b>delayed</b> <b>cutaneous</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> to picryl chloride were studied to see the effects of a new antileukemic agent, Neocarzinostatin (NCS), on the cellular immunity of mice. A single administration of NCS decreased the {{peripheral lymphocyte}} count, the spleen weight, {{the total number of}} spleen cells and in vitro proliferative response to PHA on the 4 (th) and 8 (th) day after NCS administration but its suppressive effects on these factors almost disappeared on the 12 (th) day. NCS suppressed the <b>delayed</b> <b>cutaneous</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> to picryl chloride and its suppressive effect was dependent on the daily dose of NCS. But its suppressive effect weakened after 10 days of drug free interval. The above data suggest that NCS suppresses the cellular immunity of mice to a certain degree and its immunosuppressive effects are dependent on the daily dose and the number of consecutive days of NCS administration, and on the days of drug free interval...|$|E

40|$|Lymphokine {{was tested}} for fungal growth {{inhibitory}} activity against the filamentous fungus Trichophyton menthagrophytes. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes from a donor exhibiting <b>delayed</b> type <b>cutaneous</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> to a trichophytin skin test were cultured with trichophytin and PHA-P. Culture supernatants were assayed for lymphokine activity using the lymphotoxin sensitive mouse L- 929 alpha fibroblast. Lymphocyte activation to PHA-P and trichophytin {{was confirmed by}} monitoring 3 H-thymidine incorporation. Supernatants from 2 -day PHA-P and 6 -day trichophytin activated cultures were found to contain potent lymphokine activity.

Undiluted lymphokine containing supernatants and nonlymphokine containing control supernatants were evaluated for fungal growth inhibitory activity using a sensitive radiometric growth assay. Iron supplemented supernatants retaining potent lymphokine activity did not inhibit fungal growth. Non-iron supplemented supernatants and fresh medium containing serum inhibited fungal growth. Our data suggest that lymphokine active against mammalian cells is not directly antagonistic to the growth of the filamentous fungus T. mentagrophytes but does not exclude the possibility that activated lymphocytes release a chelator such as transferrin that can inhibit fungal growth...|$|R

40|$|After the {{observations}} of Pearmain, Lycette, and Fitzgerald (1) and Schrek (2), that tuberculin could stimulate some lymphocytes from tuberculin sensitive individuals to enlarge and divide in vitro, many similar systems have been studied using bacterial and viral products as stimulants.
