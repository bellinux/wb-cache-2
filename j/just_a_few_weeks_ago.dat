Having lost to Zvonareva in straight sets <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> in Tokyo, Kvitová had her {{work cut out for}} her, but this time it was different - Kvitová hadn't lost an indoor match all year and her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and strong net play were working like a charm as she raced out to a 6–2, 4–1 lead. Things got tougher as the unforced errors began to creep into Kvitová's game, and Zvonareva closed the gap to 4–all in the second set; but the No.3-seeded Kvitová broke again for 5–4 and served it out, getting two errors in a row from the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to get to match point then knifing a forehand volley. The series between the two is now knotted at 3–3. Kvitová ended with an even differential, 24 winners to 24 errors; she won 17 of 23 net points (including match point). Zvonareva was −9 (eight winners, 17 errors).|$|E

Also, a football match was preponed by a day because of the storm's proximity to the island. The game was played during strong winds caused by Roke. On September 18, The national weather agency of Japan warned the residents of wide areas across the Japanese archipelago of heavy rainfall, landslides and flash flooding that the strengthening storm can trigger in Japan, after in changed course from heading towards the Okinawa Islands to mainland Japan. Also, concerns grew as the storm was heading towards the same area which was devastated by Talas, an unusually large but weak tropical cyclone that hit the region <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago.</b> Parts of the Kii Peninsula which were still in ruins were in a great danger as water levels of the mud dam rose to 70 centimeters, just below its maximum capacity. It was feared that as the storm brushes the southern coast, it could worsen the conditions caused by Typhoon Talas. Hundreds of thousands of people in Japan were asked to evacuate their homes and move to safer places as Typhoon Roke neared southwestern Japan, on its way to hit the main island of Honshu with winds of over 100 kn. It was reported that a further 23,000 people in western Japan were advised to seek shelter from flood and landslide prone areas. Over a million people, more than double the numbers for typhoon Talas, living in Nagoya were also forced to evacuate. The typhoon was expected to batter the island nation for three continuous days, as it moved through the tsunami ravaged Fukushima Prefecture. Rainwater may leak into the basements of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant's reactors. City officials in Nagoya upgraded the evacuation advisory to the strongest level available and doubled the number of people who are subjected to the notice as local rivers brimmed with heavy rain.|$|E

50|$|When Andi Fritzsche returns {{after two}} years to Düsseldorf, he meets the young and {{beautiful}} Helena von Lahnstein. By chance she shows him a photo from her supposedly dead father. Andi is shocked, because he thinks he knows {{the man in the}} picture and that he isn't dead for fifteen years but alive and in jail in Patagonia. Andi shows Helena a drawing from the man, who once was his cellmate and looks like Ludwig von Lahnstein. Helena is confused and isn't sure what to believe. But since no body was found after his sailing boat accident, Helena gets in to Andi's idea and the both decide to fly to Brazil to find the man Andi is thinking must be Ludwig. Helena's twin-brother Tristan finds out about their traveling plans and follows them. When Tristan finds out the reason for Andi and Helena's trip, he thinks that Andi is lying, but later has to see for himself that the possibility is there. The trio tries {{to find out more about}} Andi's cellmate as they speak with the prison director. He confesses that the man in the cell would be Ludwig von Lahnstein, but the man died <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago.</b> Helena and Tristan are shocked and confused as the director has no idea where the body was buried, if at all. Andi does a little digging and finds out that the prison director was lying. Ludwig is still alive. As Tristan tries to pay the director off, he gets imprisoned himself. Now Helena tries everything to get her brother free and find out the truth about her father by making a dangerous deal with the prison director. If she wins a game of chess, he has to let her brother and father go. If he wins, he can spend one night with Helena. She eventually can make him lose and they return with Ludwig to Königsbrunn. With his return, the identity of the mysterious Maria Galdi, who's posing as Johannes' late wife Francesca, is discovered as Ludwig tells his family that the woman claiming to be Francesca is her mentally ill sister Maria di Balbi. After first not wanting to have anything to do with the family business, his niece Carla and Johannes' widow Elisabeth can convince Ludwig to join the company, much to the anger of his nephew Ansgar.|$|E

40|$|<b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> {{there was}} a frenzy of {{activity}} {{leading up to the}} release of long-awaited resource estimates for shale gas in the north of England. The event placed geology right in the centre of the debate about what shale gas might mean for Britain. Suddenly geology really mattered to the ordinary man in the street. The question in many minds was: is there enough of this gas to make a difference to Britain? Or are we making a big fuss about nothing? Previous gas company resource or ‘gas-in-place’ estimates had been on the large side, but other institutions (for example the American Energy Information Administration, EIA) put the figures lower. Some large oil and gas companies had basically written Britain off as a shale gas player. Environmentalists and industrialists alike complained: how could the figures vary so much? Confusion reigned. What we needed were reliable numbers...|$|E

In fact, our work is foreshadowed in an entry in Banting’s notebook on June 9, 1921, in which he documents a de-tailed experimental plan to study transplantation of non-as-cularized grafts of the pancreas in dogs, placed either “fre...|$|E
40|$|Every year fire {{evacuation}} {{exercises are}} organized through out CERN and our facility's Kindergarten is no exception. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> a fire simulation {{was carried out}} in the Kindergarten kitchen facility using synthetic smoke. The purpose of the exercise was to teach staff to react in a disciplined and professional manner when in the presence of danger. The simulation is always carried out at a random time so as to ensure that people in the area under the test are not aware of the exercise. For the Kindergarten the exercise was held early in the school year so as to train those who are new to the establishment. The evacuation was a complete success and all went as it was supposed to. When the children and teachers smelt smoke they followed the prescribed evacuation routes and left the building immediately. Once outside the situation was revealed as an exercise and everyone went back to business as usual, everyone that is, except the fire brigade and fire inspector. The fire brigade checked that the building was smoke free and the fire inspector sat down with the school staff for a debriefing to determine how (if at all) the evacuation procedures could be improved and run even more smoothly next time...|$|E
40|$|With LHC {{commissioned}} <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> {{all sorts}} of ideas about physics beyond the standard model are being explored. A strong-coupling chiral theory appearing at TeV scale remains a possibility but also a very hard scenario to study. When it comes to strongly coupled theories, lattice regularization {{is by far the}} most reliable method. But defining exact chiral gauge theory on the lattice remains a difficult problem on its own. We show that the idea to use additional non-gauge, high-scale mirror-sector dynamics to decouple the mirror fermions without breaking the gauge symmetry might lead to a practically manageable solution. We demonstrate, using the exact lattice chirality, that partition functions of lattice gauge theories with vector like fermion representations can be split into "light " and "mirror " parts, each containing a chiral representation. We show that such a splitting is only well defined when both sectors are separately anomaly free. We also prove that, the generating function and therefore the spectrum of an arbitrary chiral gauge theory is a smooth function of the background gauge field, if and only if the anomaly free condition is satisfied. We reached this conclusion by proving some very general properties of an arbitrary chiral gauge theory on lattice, and the results should be of importance for further studies in this field...|$|E
