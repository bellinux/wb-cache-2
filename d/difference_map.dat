5000|$|Although it {{has been}} shown that the method of error {{reduction}} converges to a limit (but usually not to the correct or optimal solution) [...] there is no limit to how long this process can take. Moreover, the error reduction algorithm will almost certainly find a local minima instead of the global. The HIO differs from error reduction only in one step but this is enough to reduce this problem significantly. Whereas the error reduction approach iteratively improves solutions over time the HIO remodels the previous solution in Fourier space applying negative feedback. By minimizing the mean square error in the Fourier space from the previous solution, the HIO provides a better candidate solution for inverse transforming. Although being both faster and more powerful, the HIO does have a uniqueness problem.Depending on how strong the negative feedback is there can more often be more than one solution for any set of diffraction data. This might seem like a big problem but {{it has been}} shown that many of these possible solutions stem from the fact that HIO allows for mirror images taken in any plane to arise as solutions. In crystallography, the scientist is seldom interested in the atomic coordinates relative to any other reference than the molecule itself and is therefore more than happy with a solution that is upside-down of flipped from the actual image. On the downside, HIO does have a tendency to be able to escape both global and local maxima. This is probably also depending on the strength of the feedback parameter and a good solution to this problem is to switch algorithm when the error reaches its minimum. Other methods of phasing a coherent diffraction pattern include <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> algorithm and [...] "relaxed averaged alternating reflections" [...] or RAAR.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} {{the application of a}} new search algorithm, the <b>difference</b> <b>map,</b> to the problem of protein structure prediction. First a short review of protein structure is given to explain the terms and concepts used in the following chapters. A brief description of the current structure determination techniques (x-ray diffraction, NMR) are given, but the bulk of this dissertation is focused on ab initio structure prediction. Using ab initio methods, the native fold of a protein is assumed to be the global minimum of a high dimensional energy function. The current methods for minimizing this energy function are reviewed. The next chapter introduces a new search algorithm, the <b>difference</b> <b>map.</b> The <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> has been applied to many fields and problems where an exhaustive search is not feasible. A brief description of its historical development is given. Following this is an explanation of how the algorithm efficiently searches a high dimensional search space. A program called the <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> explorer was created to explore the effects of various <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> parameters on the search dynamics of the algorithm. The application of the <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> to the problem of protein energy minimization is demonstrated in chapter 3. In this chapter, {{the rate at which the}} <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> produces low energy protein conformations is compared with that of a Monte Carlo based search algorithm, parallel tempering. It is shown that the <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> finds low energy protein conformations at a significantly higher rate than parallel tempering.

30|$|By {{comparing}} the group map {{with the goal}} map, the group-goal <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> was generated. The group-goal <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> showed 61 differences, that is, 26 kinds of excessive links (63 links in the learner maps), 31 kinds of lacking links (69 in the learner maps), and 4 kinds of leaving links (6 links in the learner maps). Then, we examined all of the detected differences and corresponding portions in the learning material. As {{the results of the}} examination, we judged that 4 kinds of differences, that is 2 excessive links and 2 lacking links, should be accepted as alternative interpretations of the learning material. These activates could not be carried out without building the group map and the group-goal <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> that are original maps in this framework. Besides, as mentioned in the “Results of learner map building activities” section, all modified links were high-appearance ratio links in the group-goal <b>difference</b> <b>map.</b> This result suggests that the filtering function of detected links was also useful to this modification phase. Therefore, as for the second assumption, we concluded that we could conduct Group Map Building and Modification of Goal Map phase following the framework of KB map.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a new algorithm for finding protein conformations that minimize a non-bonded energy function. The new algorithm, called the <b>difference</b> <b>map,</b> seeks {{to find an}} atomic configuration that is simultaneously in two constraint spaces. The first constraint space is the space of atomic configurations that have a valid peptide geometry, while {{the second is the}} space of configurations that have a non-bonded energy below a given target. These two constraint spaces are used to define a deterministic dynamical system, whose fixed points produce atomic configurations in the intersection of the two constraint spaces. The rate at which the <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> produces low energy protein conformations is compared with that of a contemporary search algorithm, parallel tempering.

We derive exact voxelwise statistics describing the behavior of lesion overlap <b>difference</b> <b>maps</b> and lesion proportion <b>difference</b> <b>maps</b> under the null hypothesis of no association between lesion and deficit, and we apply the statistics to a large subset of the subjects previously reported in (Damasio et al., 2004), in order to reassess the lesion correlates of deficits in naming and recognition for five categories of concrete entities. The thresholded maps confirmed many of the results reported previously, but also revealed some differences. Differences in spatial distribution of the lesion correlates of impaired naming of unique versus nonunique entities were confirmed in the inferotemporal region (IT), although overlapping components across categories became apparent in left IT. Additionally, the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was implicated in naming both categories of nonunique natural entities (animals and fruits/vegetables) ...|$|R

40|$|Several {{strategies}} in phase retrieval are unified by an iterative "difference map" constructed {{from a pair}} of elementary projections and a single real parameter β. For the standard application in optics, where the two projections implement Fourier modulus and object support constraints respectively, the <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> reproduces the "hybrid" form of Fienup's input-output map for β = 1. Other values of β are equally effective in retrieving phases but have no input-output counterparts.

Each learner tried to improve his/her maps individually for 20  min. Afterward, the subjects answered the questionnaires.|$|E
40|$|Brute force {{alignment}} method The usual alignment in IMAGIC-V {{is carried}} out sequentially, i. e. first a translational alignment is done followed by a rotational alignment. Here {{we have used a}} modified brute force approach that works much better for noisy data sets, as it performs a full translational alignment at every rotation along a user specified sampling (typically ~ 5 º). The program then searches for the highest cross correlation peak over all rotations, and finally refines both the rotational and translational parameters around the “best ” rotation. This is done for each reference, and the overall best solution is taken in the end as the true alignment. Bad particles (like touching, misspicked or pieces of ‘junk ’ on the edge of images) can readily be removed based on the maximum alignment shift and were rejected if the pixel shift was larger than half the box size {{at the outset of the}} refinement procedure.

40|$|Abstract — The {{environment}} {{representation is}} one of the main challenges of autonomous navigation. In the case of complex driving environments such as crowded city traffic scenarios, achieving satisfactory results becomes even more difficult. In this paper we propose a real-time solution for two main issues of advanced driver assistance systems: unstructured environment representation and extraction of dynamic properties of traffic participants. For the real-time environment representation we propose a solution to extract object delimiters from the traffic scenes and represent them as polygonal models. In order to track dynamic entities, an intermediate evidence map named “Stereo Temporal <b>Difference</b> <b>Map</b> ” is proposed. This <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> is computed by comparing the occupancy of a cell between two consecutive frames. Based on the Stereo Temporal <b>Difference</b> <b>Map</b> information, difference fronts are extracted and are subjected to a particle based filtering mechanism. Finally, the provided dynamic features are associated to the extracted polygonal models. The result is a more compact representation of the dynamic environment...|$|E
40|$|Iterative phase {{retrieval}} algorithms typically employ projections onto constraint subspaces {{to recover}} the unknown phases in the Fourier transform of an image, or, {{in the case of}} x-ray crystallography, the electron density of a molecule. For a general class of algorithms, where the basic iteration is specified by the <b>difference</b> <b>map,</b> solutions are associated with fixed points of the map, the attractive character of which determines the effectiveness of the algorithm. The behavior of the <b>difference</b> <b>map</b> near fixed points is controlled by the relative orientation of the tangent spaces of the two constraint subspaces employed by the map. Since the dimensionalities involved are always large in practical applications, it is appropriate to use random matrix theory ideas to analyze the average-case convergence at fixed points.

METHODS 4 D flow MRI data of four patients with aortic coarctation either before or after repair (mean age 17 years, age range 3 - 28, one female, three males) and four young healthy volunteers without history of cardiovascular disease (mean age 24 years, age range 20 - 27, one female, three males) was acquired using a 1. 5 -T clinical MR scanner. Image analysis was performed with in-house developed image processing software. Relative pressures were computed based on the Navier-Stokes equation. RESULTS A standardized method for intuitive visualization of pressure <b>difference</b> <b>maps</b> was developed and successfully applied to all included patients and volunteers. Young healthy volunteers exhibited smooth and regular distribution of relative pressures in the thoracic aorta at mid systole with very similar distribution in all analyzed volunteers. Patients demonstrated disturbed pressures compared to volunteers. Changes included a pressure drop at the aortic isthmus in all patients, increased relative pressures in the aortic arch in patients with residual narrowing after repair, and increased relative pressures in the descending aorta in a patient after patch aortoplasty.
