5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters.

50|$|<b>Fluorinated</b> <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> or FEP is a {{copolymer}} of hexafluoropropylene and tetrafluoroethylene.

50|$|Perfluoroalkoxy alkanes or PFA are fluoropolymers. They are {{copolymers}} of tetrafluoroethylene (C2F4) and perfluoroethers (C2F3ORf, where Rf is a perfluorinated group such as trifluoromethyl (CF3)). In {{terms of}} their properties, these polymers are similar to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The big {{difference is that the}} alkoxy substituents allow the polymer to be melt-processed. On a molecular level, PFA has a smaller chain length, and higher chain entanglement than other fluoropolymers. It also contains an oxygen atom at the branches. This results in a material that is more translucent and has improved flow, creep resistance, and thermal stability close to or exceeding PTFE.

50|$|Polymerization of {{tetrafluoroethylene}} produces polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymers such as Teflon and Fluon. PTFE {{is one of}} the two {{fluorocarbon resins}} composed wholly of fluorine and carbon. The other resin composed purely of carbon and fluorine is the copolymer of TFE with typically 6-9% hexafluoropropene (HFP), which is known as FEP (<b>fluorinated</b> <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> copolymer). TFE is also used in the preparation of numerous copolymers that also include hydrogen and/or oxygen, including both fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers. Typical TFE-based fluoroplastics include ETFE, the alternating 1:1 copolymer with ethylene, and PFA, which is a random copolymer similar to FEP but with a minor amount of a perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether (PAVE) rather than HFP. DuPont uses primarily perfluoro(methylvinylether), whereas Daikin uses primarily perfluoro(propylvinylether) in manufacturing PFA. There are numerous other fluoropolymers that contain tetrafluoroethylene, but usually not at greater than 50% by weight.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} fluoroplastic is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, DuPont brand Teflon), {{which is}} a simple linear chain polymer with the repeating structural unit:-CF2-. PTFE has a backbone of carbons single bonded in a long chain, with all side bonds to fluorines. It contains no hydrogens and {{can be thought of}} as the perfluoro analog of polyethylene (structural unit: -CH2-). PTFE has high chemical and thermal stability, as expected for a perfluorocarbon, much stronger than polyethylene. Its resistance to van der Waals forces makes PTFE the only known surface to which a gecko cannot stick. The compound, however, lacks an ability to transform upon melting, which is not a problem for various PTFE deratives, namely FEP (<b>fluorinated</b> <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene,</b> with some fluorines replaced with the-CF3 group) or PFA (perfluoroalkoxy, some fluorines replaced with -OCF3). They share most properties with PTFE, but there are still differences, namely maximum usage temperature (highest for the non-flexible PTFE).|$|E
5000|$|To {{be able to}} {{transfer}} heat well, the tube material should have good thermal conductivity. Because heat is transferred from a hot to a cold side through the tubes, there is a temperature difference through {{the width of the}} tubes. Because of the tendency of the tube material to thermally expand differently at various temperatures, thermal stresses occur during operation. This is in addition to any stress from high pressures from the fluids themselves. The tube material also should be compatible with both the shell and tube side fluids for long periods under the operating conditions (temperatures, pressures, pH, etc.) to minimize deterioration such as corrosion. All of these requirements call for careful selection of strong, thermally-conductive, corrosion-resistant, high quality tube materials, typically metals, including aluminium, copper alloy, stainless steel, carbon steel, non-ferrous copper alloy, Inconel, nickel, Hastelloy and titanium. [...] Fluoropolymers such as Perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) and <b>Fluorinated</b> <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> (FEP) are also used to produce the tubing material due to their high resistance to extreme temperatures. Poor choice of tube material could result in a leak through a tube between the shell and tube sides causing fluid cross-contamination and possibly loss of pressure.|$|E

40|$|The {{aluminized}} Teflon <b>fluorinated</b> <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> outer most {{layer of}} the multilayer insulation blankets on the Hubble Space Telescope has become embrittled resulting in severe on-orbit cracking.
