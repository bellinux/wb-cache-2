5|$|In 516 BCE, Darius {{embarked}} on a campaign to Central Asia, Aria and Bactria and then marched into Afghanistan to Taxila in modern-day Pakistan. Darius spent the winter of 516–515 BCE in Gandhara, preparing to conquer the <b>Indus</b> Valley. Darius conquered the lands surrounding the <b>Indus</b> River in 515 BCE. Darius I controlled the <b>Indus</b> Valley from Gandhara to modern Karachi and appointed the Greek Scylax of Caryanda to explore the Indian Ocean {{from the mouth of}} the <b>Indus</b> to Suez. Darius then marched through the Bolan Pass and returned through Arachosia and Drangiana back to Persia.|$|E

5|$|The Sind sparrow has a {{restricted}} distribution, primarily occurring within the <b>Indus</b> valley of Pakistan, {{and the lower}} parts of the tributaries of the <b>Indus</b> in the Punjab region. Its distribution extends from the <b>Indus</b> Delta north to the Kabul River near Nowshera and the Jhelum near Nurpur Noon, extending east into India {{as far as the}} Delhi area. It also breeds locally in parts of Pakistan's western province of Balochistan, and has been recorded several times in south-eastern Iran. The Sind sparrow is somewhat common in its restricted breeding range, and no threats are known to the survival of the species, so it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{of musical}} {{instruments}} in use by early civilizations of India is almost completely lacking, {{making it impossible}} to reliably attribute instruments to the Munda and Dravidian language-speaking cultures that first settled the area. Rather, the history of musical instruments in the area begins with the <b>Indus</b> Valley Civilization that emerged around 3000 BC. Various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of musical instruments. A clay statuette indicates the use of drums, and examination of the <b>Indus</b> script has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts. This discovery is among many indications that the <b>Indus</b> Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained cultural contact. Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India occurred with the Rigveda, or hymns. These songs used various drums, shell trumpets, harps, and flutes. Other prominent instruments in use during the early centuries AD were the snake charmer's double clarinet, bagpipes, barrel drums, cross flutes, and short lutes. In all, India had no unique musical instruments until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|From his {{extensive}} fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of South Indian culture on the <b>Indus</b> Valley Civilization. Using a geographic {{perspective of the}} socio-political systems and cultural distribution of the <b>Indus</b> Basin and surrounding hinterland, he observed that the Indo-Gangetic Plain did not play any {{significant role in the}} development of <b>Indus</b> Valley culture. Nor was there any invasion from the seaside during the Bronze Age, although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western borderland that appears as a boundary to the external eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local people have always moved freely. He therefore argued that the cultural history of Pakistan is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, Persian and later Sufi influences. He strove to revive this relationship by promoting organisations such as the Pak-Central Asia Friendship Association.|$|E

5|$|The {{converted}} Victorious {{was commissioned}} as a repair ship on 22 February 1916 {{and arrived at}} Scapa Flow to replace the converted merchant ship Caribbean, which had been lost in September 1915, as repair ship for the Grand Fleet. Victorious performed this role there until March 1920 when she was renamed <b>Indus</b> II and transferred to Devonport for a refit to prepare her for service with the <b>Indus</b> Establishment. She arrived at Devonport on 28 March 1920 and paid off into a care and maintenance status while she awaited {{the beginning of her}} refit. Plans for the refit, however, were cancelled; work began to convert her into a harbor depot ship but, in April 1922, that conversion was cancelled before it could be completed and she was placed on the disposal list that month. <b>Indus</b> II was sold for scrapping on 19 December 1922, but the sale was cancelled on 1 March 1923. She was again sold on 9 April 1923 and was towed from Devonport to Dover to be scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of female}} statuettes dated {{as early as}} c. 5500 BCE have been {{recovered}} at Mehrgarh, {{one of the most}} important Neolithic sites in world archeology, and a precursor to the great <b>Indus</b> Valley Civilization. In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, major cities of the <b>Indus</b> valley civilization, female figurines were found in almost all households indicating the presence of cults of goddess worship. Most figurines are naked and have elaborate coiffures. Some figurines have ornaments or horns on the head and a few are in poses that expose the genitals. Several small circular objects with holes in middle, possibly representing yoni, were also found. The objects and images found suggest that the goddess cults of <b>Indus</b> valley civilization were associated with fertility. A seal shows a male figure standing over a seated female figure with a sickle. It probably suggests an association between the female figure and crops, and possibly implies a ritual sacrifice where the blood of the victim was offered to the goddess for ensuring agricultural productivity.|$|E
5|$|Valiant {{was paid}} off in 1885, and she was {{assigned}} to the HMS <b>Indus</b> stoker training establishment in 1897, briefly losing her name, before being renamed as <b>Indus</b> IV in 1904. The ship was converted to a kite balloon storeship in 1915, during World War I, and her name was changed to HMS Valiant III. She was offered for sale in 1922, but there were no takers so the ship was converted into a floating oil tank in 1926 and towed to Hamoaze.|$|E

Chandru vehemently denies it and finding <b>Indu's</b> {{presence}} an embarrassment tries to ferret out the truth. After many scenes of forced comedy, we learn that the girl is the illegitimate daughter of Chandru's much-married brother, who had seduced <b>Indu's</b> sister. After his brother's futile attempt to play the villain, Chandru latches on to <b>Indu</b> fast enough with no apology to Rekha. But {{it is not really}} Chandru's fault.

5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the <b>Indus</b> Valley civilization. Seals with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) speaks of a group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata is rooted in the group of seven females depicted on <b>Indus</b> valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E
5|$|Buttons have {{traditionally}} been made {{from a variety of}} freshwater and marine shells. At first they were used decoratively rather than as fasteners and the earliest known example dates back five thousand years and was found at Mohenjo-daro in the <b>Indus</b> Valley.|$|E

5|$|Bal Gangadhar Tilak has {{credited}} Jainism {{with the}} cessation of slaughter of animals in the brahamanical religion. Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of <b>Indus</b> Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. This particular image might suggest that all the animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of <b>Indus</b> river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E
