50|$|A <b>fishbone</b> <b>diagram</b> is a {{graphical}} {{means for}} finding possible {{problems in a}} chain of processes. By collecting the different data related to the problem, and inputting them into the diagram, it becomes easier {{to analyze the data}} in the order it used and hence determine the root of the problem. This is commonly used to find the bottleneck in a chain of processes due to being able to pinpoint the machine precisely responsible for the delay in production.|$|E
5000|$|Kaoru Ishikawa (July 13, 1915 - April 16, 1989) was a Japanese {{organizational}} theorist, Professor at the Faculty of Engineering at The University of Tokyo, {{noted for}} his quality management innovations. He {{is considered a}} key figure in the development of quality initiatives in Japan, particularly the quality circle. [...] He is best known outside Japan for the Ishikawa or cause and effect diagram (also known as <b>fishbone</b> <b>diagram)</b> often used in the analysis of industrial processes.|$|E
5000|$|For {{quality control}} in {{manufacturing}} in the 1960s, Kaoru Ishikawa developed a {{cause and effect}} diagram, known as an Ishikawa diagram or <b>fishbone</b> <b>diagram.</b> The diagram categorizes causes, such as into the six main categories shown here. These categories are then sub-divided. Ishikawa's method identifies [...] "causes" [...] in brainstorming sessions conducted among various groups involved in the manufacturing process. These groups can then be labeled as categories in the diagrams. The use of these diagrams has now spread beyond quality control, and they are used {{in other areas of}} management and in design and engineering. Ishikawa diagrams have been criticized for failing to make the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. It seems that Ishikawa was not even aware of this distinction.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} this step is to identify, {{validate}} and select root cause for elimination. A large number of potential root causes (process inputs, X) of the project problem are identified via root cause analysis (for example a <b>fishbone</b> <b>diagram).</b> The top 3-4 potential root causes are selected using multi-voting or other consensus tool for further validation. A data collection plan is created and data are collected to establish the relative contribution of each root causes to the project metric, Y.

5000|$|A {{recurring}} theme in a lean or six-sigma transformation is removing the clutter {{to allow you}} to see waste or opportunities for improvement. A <b>fishbone</b> <b>diagram</b> aims to break down and organise the Causes of an issue to reveal what elements have the greatest impact. Grouping the “causes” means you can think about the different elements of the problem as separate from the overall process. One or two of these “causes” will have a greater effect than the others and will guide you to the root of the problem. This structure also allows you to tackle smaller chunks which have a large impact on the problem. Looking at elements of the problem and not the whole process will likely make finding your solution less daunting and problem solving more manageable.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fishbone</b> <b>diagram</b> (also {{known as}} Ishikawa diagram) was created {{with the goal}} of {{identifying}} and grouping the causes which generate a quality problem.

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{a new approach}} for constructing causal maps called the Collective Causal Mapping Methodology (CCMM). This methodology collects information asynchronously {{from a group of}} dispersed and diverse subject-matter experts via Web technologies. Through three rounds of data collection, analysis, mapping, and interpretation, CCMM constructs a parsimonious collective causal map. The article illustrates the CCMM by constructing a causal map as a teaching tool for the field of operations management. Causal maps are an essential tool for managers who seek to improve complex systems in the areas of quality, strategy, and information systems. These causal maps are known by many names, including Ishikawa (<b>fishbone)</b> <b>diagrams,</b> cause-and-effect diagrams, impact wheels, issue trees, strategy maps, and risk-assessment mapping tools. Causal maps can be used by managers to focus attention on the root causes of a problem, find critical control points, guide risk management and risk mitigation efforts, formulate and communicate strategy, and teach the fundamental causal relationships in a complex system. Only two basic methods for creating causal maps are available to managers today-brainstorming and interviews. However, these methods are limited, particularly when the subject-matter experts cannot easily meet in the same place at the same time. Managers working with complex systems across large, geographically dispersed organizations can employ the CCMM presented here to efficiently and effectively construct causal maps to facilitate improving their systems...|$|R
