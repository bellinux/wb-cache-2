40|$|M Development and Management [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2015. The study {{evaluated}} {{the training and}} development in Vereeniging cluster. The South African Police Service is the principal law enforcement institution and has {{a crucial role in}} contributing to the safety and security of South African citizens, including those who visit the country. Based on this it is essential that the organisation has skilled employees who will be able to meet the objectives and future challenges of the organisation. Training and development, therefore, is regarded as an important tool by an organisation, to facilitate the learning and development of all employees of the South African Police Service. Training and development identify, assure and develop individual competencies that will assist them to perform their current and future jobs. The research was conducted in the Vereeniging cluster. Only six stations were considered part of the target population. The respondents were randomly selected from the following stations: Heidelberg, Meyerton, Kliprivier, DeDeur, Ratanda and Vaal Marina. The systematic sampling method was used, where each unit had a chance of being selected. The <b>duty</b> <b>list</b> was utilised to obtain the sample. Structured questionnaires were utilised to obtain the responses from the respondents. The results of the findings indicated that employees were not satisfied about the recruitment and selection procedure and need assessment is not done before employees are sent for training. Respondents indicated that training equipment is not sufficient to assist them to acquire more knowledge during the facilitation of the learning programme. The results also highlighted that post-training appraisal is not done after each learning programme, which is important to determine the need for re-training, if any. The study concludes and recommends that the SAPS should focus on ensuring that the skills development facilitators understand the primary role of skills development. Training practices should be in line with the training standards and requirements and should be systematic and transparentMaster...|$|E

50|$|The {{findings}} of MacDonell and Keith {{are similar to}} Witzel, and differ from Tambiah; they cite ancient Indian literature suggesting bridewealth was paid even in brahma- and daiva-types of marriage associated with the Brahmanic (priestly) upper caste.

50|$|The second {{avenue of}} {{promotion}} from rating to commissioned officer {{was to the}} Special <b>Duties</b> (SD) <b>List.</b> Petty officers and chief petty officers could, {{with the approval of}} their commanding officer, become a CW candidate (an 'SD candidate') and such supply branch senior ratings were similarly specially reported on with a view to promotion to officer, generally between the ages of 28 and 35, though most were in their early 30s when promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on the Special <b>Duties</b> <b>List.</b> Unlike GL and SL (see below) officers, SD officers retained their former rating branch specialisation; for example the supply officer (cash) of a large warship or shore establishment would typically be a lieutenant (SD)(S)(W), the (W) indicating that he is a commissioned officer from the Writer branch of ratings. SD officers were, of course, promoted from all supply branches - writer (W), stores assistant/accountant (S) or (V), cook (CK), officer's steward/steward or caterer (CA). Once confirmed as a Sub-lieutenant, an SD officer was promoted lieutenant after three years; promotion to lieutenant-commander (SD) was by selection and, from these, a very small number were promoted to commander from 1966 onwards. Retirement was generally compulsory at age 50. A few SD officers were further selected for transfer to the General List, seniority being adjusted on transfer, so as to level the promotion opportunities (generally these officers were earmarked as likely to reach the rank of commander). In the 1970s, to make up for certain branch shortages, some chief petty officers, age over 35, from the supply branch were selected and promoted temporary acting sub-lieutenant (SD), a few of whom were later promoted to temporary lieutenant (SD). By the 1980s, supply officers were no longer necessarily being appointed according to the List they were on (GL, SD or SL); it was not uncommon to find, in different ships in the same squadron or flotilla, a pusser in supply charge from each List.|$|R
