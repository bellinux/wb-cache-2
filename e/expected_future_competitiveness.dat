Evolving industry structure and new firm investment portend changes in <b>future</b> firm <b>competitiveness</b> and performance. This research describes how large food-manufacturing and retail firm performance has shifted and how firm valuation signals <b>expected</b> <b>future</b> change in performance. While there have been expectations that return on investment of large food retailers would increase relative to large packaged-food manufacturers, we find that this has not yet happened and that market valuations imply that retailers {{are not likely to}} gain on manufacturers in the future.

40|$|Diversified {{firms have}} {{different}} values from comparable portfolios of singlesegment firms. These value differences must {{be due to}} differences in either future cash flows or <b>future</b> returns. <b>Expected</b> security returns on diversified firms vary systematically with relative value. Discount firms have significantly higher subsequent returns than premium firms. Slightly {{more than half of the}} cross-sectional variation in excess values is due to variation in <b>expected</b> <b>future</b> cash flows, with the remainder due to variation in <b>expected</b> <b>future</b> returns and to covariation between cash flows and returns. THE VALUE OF ANY ASSET DEPENDS mechanically on the asset’s future cash flows and future returns. This fact is, by definition, true both for actual future cash flows and returns and for <b>expected</b> <b>future</b> cash flows and returns. High future cash flows imply high value today, and high future returns imply low value today. Thus, to explain the value of an asset, one needs to examine <b>expected</b> <b>future</b> cash flows and <b>expected</b> <b>future</b> returns...|$|R

40|$|Do <b>expected</b> <b>future</b> {{exchange}} rate fluctuations affect current social welfare? In the third-generation approach to currency crises, financial fragility can trigger devaluation and default. <b>Expected</b> <b>future</b> depreciation is costly if it raises ex ante real interest rates. Given the strong violation of uncovered interest parity, <b>expected</b> <b>future</b> outcomes' current cost/benefit depends on the currency risk premium. I extend the static one-period Barro-Gordon welfare loss function to include <b>expected</b> <b>future</b> depreciation and show that, when foreign investors are risk-averse, depreciation bias {{is higher than the}} static case if aggregate demand is a function of ex ante real rates. If demand depends on the ex post real interest rate, average depreciation can be zero if current welfare is sufficiently sensitive to the state of the financial sector. In this stylised framework, depreciation bias can be mitigated even in the presence of time-inconsistency, and expected welfare may be higher...|$|R
