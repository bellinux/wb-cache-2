40|$|Background The {{developmental}} <b>delays</b> <b>of</b> children, {{is one of}} {{the most}} important sources of information to detect the developmental <b>delays</b> <b>of</b> children. The aim of this study was to investigate the developmental delays and its relationship with anthropometric indices in Urmia city, Iran. Materials and Methods This is a descriptive analytical study that conducted on 422 children who had 6 - 12 months old and were selected randomly with cluster sampling from 10 Health Center. Anthropometric indices (weight, height and head circumstance) were collected from recorded files, and development of children was measured using developmental test of Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ). The data were analyzed using SPSS version 18. 0 software. Results The results showed that the prevalence <b>of</b> the developmental <b>delays</b> <b>of</b> children was 18. 8 % and the highest and the lowest prevalence was related to the area of communication (7. 1 %), and the area of gross motor (0. 9 %), respectively. The developmental <b>delays</b> <b>of</b> children in boys, was more than girls (P 0. 05). Conclusion Considering the significant number <b>of</b> the developmental <b>delays</b> <b>of</b> children and its relationship with birth weight in this study, it is recommended to consider appropriate interventions at pregnancy period for the prevention of low birth weight and the constant programs about the developmental delays...|$|R

5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E
5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game {{is measured by the}} game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on the direction of the appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E

It takes into account the different unit costs <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> <b>of</b> individual orders and the amount <b>of</b> allowable <b>delays</b> <b>of</b> orders involving no delay costs. The optimum sequence of orders, in the single-machine problem, in view of the sum of the costs <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> may be significantly different from the optimal order, taking into account the sum <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> times...|$|R

40|$|Background: High-dose {{methotrexate}} (HD-MTX) with {{folinic acid}} (leucovorin) rescue is “gold standard” therapy for osteosarcoma. Plasma concentrations of methotrexate (MTX) {{are closely related}} to its efficacy and toxicity. <b>Delayed</b> excretion <b>of</b> MTX can lead to serious adverse reactions that may result in treatment cessation, irreversible organ damage, and death. This study focused on the incidence <b>of</b> <b>delayed</b> excretion <b>of</b> MTX in Chinese osteosarcoma patients. Methods: A total of 1277 osteosarcoma patients were treated with HD-MTX chemotherapy (4291 cycles) from 2010 to 2015. Factors that could influence <b>delayed</b> excretion <b>of</b> MTX (gender, age, number of chemotherapy cycles, and serum concentration of MTX) were analyzed. Results: The incidence <b>of</b> <b>delayed</b> excretion <b>of</b> MTX (serum concentrations at 24 h [C 24 h] > 5 μmol/L) and severe <b>delayed</b> excretion <b>of</b> MTX (C 24 h > 20 μmol/L) were 6. 19 % and 0. 86 % per patient, and 2. 31 % and 0. 26 % per cycle of treatment, respectively. The incidence <b>of</b> severe <b>delayed</b> excretion <b>of</b> MTX was associated with gender, age, and C 24 h. Conclusions: Precaution <b>of</b> <b>delayed</b> excretion <b>of</b> MTX is needed during osteosarcoma treatment using HD-MTX. An optimal individualized rescue strategy can be created with consideration of gender, age, and C 24 h...|$|R
