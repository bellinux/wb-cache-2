40|$|ABSTRACT: W e have {{obtained}} the oxygen- 17 {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (N M R) spectra {{of a variety of}} CI 70 -labeled heme proteins, including sperm whale (Physeter cutodon) myoglobin, two synthetic sperm whale myoglobin mutants (His E 7 - Val E 7; His E 7 - Phe E 7), adult human hemoglobin, rabbit (Or-yctolagus cuniculus) hemoglobin, <b>horseradish</b> (<b>Cochlearia</b> <b>armoracia)</b> peroxidase (E. C. 1. 1 1. 1. 7) isoenzymes A and C, and Culduriomyces fumago chloroperoxidase (E. C. 1. 1 1. 1. lo), in some cases as a function of pH, and have determined their isotropic I 7 O N M R chemical shifts, ai, and spin-lattice relaxation times, T I. W e have also obtained similar results on a picket fence prophyrin, [5, 10, 15, 20 -tetrakis(a,a,a,a-pivalamido-phenyl) porphyrinato]iron(lI) (l-MeIm) CO, both in solution and in the solid state. Our results show an excellent correlation between the infrared C- 0 vibrational frequencies, v(C- 0), and ai, between u(C- 0) and the I 7 O nuclear quadrupole coupling constant ($qQ/h, derived from T I), and as expected between $qQ/h and ai. Taken together with the work of others on the I 3 C N M R of I 3 CO-labeled proteins, where we find an excellent correlation between Bi(13 C) and u(Fe-C), our results suggest that I R and N M R measurements reflect the same interaction, which is thought to be primarily the degree of n-back-bonding from Fe d t...|$|E
