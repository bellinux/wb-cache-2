In a troop-transport capacity, the cabin can accommodate up to 20 fully equipped soldiers, or up to 12 stretchers in a medical evacuation role, some light vehicles may also be transported; the main cabin is equipped with environmental control systems and sound proofing measures to improve passenger conditions.|$|E
25|$|The first type is mold erosion, {{which is}} the wearing away of the mold as the liquid metal fills the mold. This type of defect usually only occurs in sand {{castings}} because most other casting processes have more robust molds. The castings produced have rough spots and excess material. The molding sand becomes incorporated into the casting metal and decreases the ductility, <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength,</b> and fracture toughness of the casting. This {{can be caused by}} a sand with too little strength or a pouring velocity that is too fast. The pouring velocity can be reduced by redesigning the gating system to use larger runners or multiple gates. A related source of defects are drops, in which part of the molding sand from the cope drops into the casting while it is still a liquid. This also occurs when the mold is not properly rammed.|$|E

The nanocomposite specimens with various CNT contents (0., 0. 5, and 1. 0 wt. %) were statically and fatigue-tested under three different hygrothermal conditions (25 °C/ 60 % RH, 25 ° C/ 85 % RH, and 40 °C/ 85 % RH) to investigate the influences of hygrothermal conditions and CNT contents on the tensile static and <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> of the studied nanocomposites. The {{results show that the}} static and <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> decreased slightly at 25 °C/ 85 % RH environments compared with those tested under the 25 °C/ 60 % RH condition. However, the static and <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> of the studied nanocomposites decreased substantially under the 40 °C/ 85 % RH condition. The combined temperature and humidity environments weaken the interfacial adhesion between the CNT surfaces and the epoxy matrix. Moreover, the experimental results show that the addition of 0. 5 wt. % of carbon nanotubes improved the static and <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> considerably under the same hygrothermal environments. However, when an excessive amount of CNTs was used (1. 0 wt. %), the nanocomposite exhibited the lowest strengths compared with the specimens with 0 and 0. 5 wt. % CNTs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ametal–composite {{bonded joint}} with a PMMA {{adhesive}} material was fabricated and tested under various loading conditions {{to help a}} short-term and long-term design of the bonded-jointed structures. The bonded joint is composed of a cast-iron rod and a GFRP composite pipe as adherends, and ductile PMMA as adhesive material (Plexus AO 425). Tubular-lap bonded joints were fabricated conveniently and consistently with a devised mold and a curing condition to yield a reliable test data set. Experiment was performed to measure creep compliances of the PMMA material, and constant strain rate (CSR) and <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> of the bonded joint under various loading and temperature conditions. We observed the CSR and <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> significantly depended on time and temperature, but little on direction of loadings and size of joints. The bonded joints failed under consistent damage mechanism in {{the combination of the}} cohesive and interfacial failure modes, which mainly occurred in the adhesive material and at the interface between the cast-iron rod and the adhesive material, respectively. In order to further substantiate the utility of the time–temperature superposition principle that has been extended to describe destructive behavior of composite materials, we made the first attempt to apply the superposition principle to failure behavior of the bonded joints. The superpostion principle yielded smooth master curves for the creep compliance of the adhesive material as well as the CSR and <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> of the bonded joint.

40|$|Abstract The {{design of}} welded {{aluminium}} structures subjected to fatigue loading is usually {{carried out on}} the basis of reference fatigue curves published in design codes. The reference curves are usually relevant to dynamic loading in ambient air and make provision for the presence of a corrosive environment by downgrading the detail category for a particular joint type. This investigation studied the corrosion-fatigue behaviour of Al 5083 -H 111 welded using ER 5356 wire. Comparison between experimentally determined fatigue curves and reference fatigue design curves published in Eurocode 9 confirms that 5083 -H 111 welds display significantly lower reference <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> than unwelded base material. Immersion in a NaCl solution during testing reduced the reference <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> even further.

40|$|Abstract. Cast {{iron and}} steel rolls used in the {{continuous}} pickling line must be changed frequently because the continuous acid wash equipment induces wear on the roll surface in a short period. The damage portions are usually repaired by using the flame spray coating. Recently, ceramics materials are planed to be introduced to prevent the damage because of their high abrasion and corrosion resistances. In this study new roll structure is considered where a ceramics sleeve is connected with steel shafts at both ends by shrink fitting. Here, the ceramics sleeve may provide a longer lifetime and reduces the cost for the maintenance. However, attention should {{be paid to the}} maximum tensile stresses appearing between the ceramics sleeve, spacer rings and steel shafts because the fracture toughness, plasticity and <b>fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> of ceramics are extremely lower than the values of steel. In this study, finite element method analysis is applied to the new structure, and the maximum tensile stress and stress amplitude have been investigated with varying the dimensions of the structure. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>strengths</b> of ceramics are also considered under several geometrical conditions...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} structural {{limitation of}} aluminium alloys is their lower <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> compared to steel. In controlled laboratory conditions, steels display a fatigue limit, which is the stress amplitude below which no failures occur - the metal does not continue to weaken with extended stress cycles. Aluminium alloys do not have this lower fatigue limit {{and will continue to}} weaken with continued stress cycles. Aluminium alloys are therefore sparsely used in parts that require high <b>fatigue</b> <b>strength</b> in the high cycle regime (more than 107 stress cycles).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The gears {{are used}} {{for a wide range}} of {{industrial}} applications. They have varied application starting from textile looms to aviation industries, automobile gear box and machine tool application to transmitting the power. Their function is to convert input provided by prime mover into an output with lower speed and corresponding higher torque. Spur gears are used to transmit the power up to velocity ratio is ten. This phase they induce high stress at the point of contact. A pair of teeth in action is generally subjected to contact stresses causing fatigue failure of gear tooth.
