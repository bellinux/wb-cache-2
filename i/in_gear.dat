25|$|The {{rotation}} of the ring gear is always {{the average of the}} rotations of the side sun gears. This is why if the driven roadwheels are lifted clear of the ground with the engine off, and the drive shaft is held (say, leaving the transmission <b>in</b> <b>gear</b> preventing the ring gear from turning inside the differential), manually rotating one driven roadwheel causes the opposite roadwheel to rotate in the opposite direction by the same amount.|$|E
25|$|Connection is then {{established}} between the attenuated rovings and the spindles. When {{the latter are}} bare, as in a new mule, the spindle-driving motion is put into gear, and the attendants wind upon each spindle a short length of yarn from a cop held in the hand. The drawing-roller motion is placed <b>in</b> <b>gear,</b> and the rollers soon present lengths of attenuated roving. These {{are attached to the}} threads on the spindles, by simply placing the threads in contact with the un-twisted roving. The different parts of the machine are next simultaneously started, when the whole works in harmony together.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} is fitted with soft leather. Bose audio {{system and a}} navigation system were standard. In typical Porsche fashion, the ignition is {{to the left of}} the steering wheel. This placement dates back to the early days of Le Mans racing when drivers were required to make a running start, hop into their cars, start them and begin the race. The placement of the ignition enabled the driver to start the car with the left hand and put it <b>in</b> <b>gear</b> with the right. Originally, the car had a beechwood gearknob, which pays homage to the wooden gearknob used in the Porsche 917 Le Mans racers. In its second year of production, a carbon fibre knob was also made available.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} motor bus tyres (which {{at that time}} were solid rubber) on the road surface was an early issue. Reimbursement for {{repairing}} {{the damage to the}} roads in Holyrood Park by the tour charabancs was laid down as a condition of operating there in the 1921 season. In 1921 the city deputy surveyor found that no undue damage was being done by buses on tarmacked roads, with some not damaged at all, but water-bound macadam surfaces and sett paving without concrete underlay were vulnerable to rutting and other issues. On one hilly route, after residents complained of vibration caused by the buses, various remedies were deployed - limiting the speed to 8mph, descent <b>in</b> <b>gear,</b> and the fitting of super-cushion tyres (Dunlop and North British). The 8mph limit was also necessary in granite paved sections of running, which were extensive in Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|BRM's {{fortunes}} did {{not improve}} in 1967, despite closely contesting the Tasman Series with Jim Clark who probably raced closer and harder with Jackie {{than at any time}} in their careers. While Clark usually won, Stewart won a classic victory in the New Zealand Grand Prix with Clark attempting to run him down in the last laps with bodywork flying off his Lotus. In F1 the BRMs were still struggling with reliability problems and Stewart came no higher than second at Spa, despite having to drive one-handed while holding the car <b>in</b> <b>gear</b> with the other. In F2 he won events at Karlskoga, Enna, Oulton Park, and Albi in a Tyrrell-entered Matra MS5 or MS7.

25|$|Tulsa {{played their}} second {{straight}} Wednesday game on October 21, {{traveling to the}} Sun Bowl {{to take on a}} team they had defeated in a 77–35 shootout the previous season. This time, the Miners were better prepared, building up a 13-0 lead in the first quarter. However, the momentum appeared to shift in the second after Tulsa got on the board with a 19-yard run from A.J. Whitmore and two long UTEP drives were ended by interceptions. The Golden Hurricane continued to roll after halftime, scoring 17 straight to take an 11-point lead. Tulsa appeared set to cruise to another easy win, but the tide of the game turned again {{in the middle of the}} fourth quarter when UTEP finally got their offense back <b>in</b> <b>gear</b> and cut the deficit to 3 with a touchdown and two-point conversion. After Tulsa went three-and-out on their next possession, the Miners drove down the field again to score the game-winning touchdown with 29 seconds remaining.|$|E

Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which he said is [...] "a little disappointing".

One deathblow is allowed per point on the Attack Level gauge. There are three levels for normal gear deathblows and, beyond the third level, an [...] "infinite" [...] level with {{its own set of}} deathblows. To reach [...] "Infinity Mode", a character has to stay at attack level 3 while performing any other action. With each turn, there is a chance that Infinity Mode will be reached.

Daimler was initially interested in the fluid flywheel for use in commercial vehicles, but Martin decided to develop the system for use in passenger cars as well. Martin and Pomeroy originally intended to use the fluid flywheel with a conventional gearbox.
