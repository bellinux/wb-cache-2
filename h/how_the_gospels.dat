40|$|For Martin Scott one of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for the Church of Scotland lies in the integration of the intellectual, practical and spiritual aspects of ministry formation with structured theological reflection that is both ecumenical in outlook and mindful of its Reformed origins. However, theological training patterns of the present and future will be distinctively different in structure – the reflective and formative components will require to be much more collaborative. A theological education of this kind will seek to foster a learning community engaging in education for mission and leadership. There will also be a recognition of the importance of lifelong training as an entitlement. Dr Scott writes of this type of theological reflection as ‘connecting head, hands and heart’ in a seamless integration with ongoing learning and development. This, he argues, is <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> portray Jesus Himself – as offering a foundation in discipleship for His followers and modelling life for those who minister in His footsteps.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{a brief review of}} two main paths of biblical {{scholarship}} with respect to the ‘gospel ’ genre. The NT Gospels appear to be similar to other ancient literature in some ways, yet distinctive enough in content, form, theology and purpose to set them apart from other literature. The analogical approach shows <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> were written in a form similar to other written documents of that time and culture. In contrast, the derivational approach attempts to show that the Gospels are unique and exclusive in all of literature. While the search for the ‘historical Jesus ’ is not over, literary criticism has now set the Gospels within the concept of ‘story’, with all its literary implications. Scholars have suggested that the ‘Gospel of Mark ’ is the first of its kind, becoming the foundational paradigm of the Gospel genre. Further, the discovery of ancient ‘apocryphal gospels ’ has encouraged scholars to compare the NT Gospels to the non-canonical documents. The challenge of clearly identifying the ‘Gospel genre ’ continues, as scholars try {{to understand the nature of}} both canonical and non-canonical stories of Jesus...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with problems arising from liberationist approaches to scriptural interpretation, both in the academy and in religious communities. In recent years the depiction of Jesus as freeing persons from oppressive Jewish purity laws has enjoyed attention in Christian theology and biblical criticism. Of late, however, {{a growing number of}} Jewish and Christian scholars has questioned this depiction, arguing that Jewish purity practices are generally misrepresented in contemporary New Testament interpretation. They contend that such misrepresentations are anti-Jewish. In this thesis I argue that, contrary to popular thought, there is no conclusive evidence that ritual impurity bore a distinct stigma or solely lead to oppression and marginalization. I also argue that Jesus’ attitude to purity law is in line with the Jewish thinking of this time. The thesis examines two case studies which are commonly understood in modern biblical interpretation to illustrate Jesus’ liberating rejection of Jewish purity practices: the healing of the leper in Mk. 1. 40 - 45 and the healing of the bleeding woman in Mk. 5. 25 - 34. Each text is analyzed in light of the broader context of Jewish purity practice and Greco-Roman ideas of purity in 1 st century, as well as notions of illness and human physiology evident in ancient medical literature. The analysis reveals that in many readings of the Markan texts there is an overstating of the laws of purity and, at worst, a distortion of the laws for a contemporary Christian theological agenda. I also argue, however, {{that it is possible to}} interpret both texts in ways that are historically plausible and theologically powerful for the 21 st century reader. Reading the texts from the view of the human body provides such a way. This is demonstrated when both texts are read in light of Greco-Roman notions of the human body as well as the broader Markan narrative framework and Christology. This thesis reveals an anti-Jewish bias in many liberationist readings of the texts concerning the leper and the bleeding woman. Concomitantly, it offers a new way to approach these texts that overcomes this bias. When the interpreter attends carefully to the multiplicity of ancient voices that constitute the 1 st century landscape as well as to contemporary voices that are sensitive to the dignity of 1 st century Judaism, new light is shed on <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>gospels,</b> texts of the past, are potentially transformative texts for the contemporary world...|$|E

This thesis will argue to the contrary that in following one of his sources at a time rather than trying to follow both simultaneously, and in using material from his second (Matthean) source to supplement his main (Markan) source, Farrer’s Luke appears to be following accepted ancient compositional methods, and that he has no demonstrable tendency to remove Markan parallels from his use of Matthew...|$|R
40|$|Religious {{history is}} often {{preserved}} by {{the winners of}} ideological debates. The twenty-seven books composing the New Testament canon were selected by prevailing players {{in the battle for}} ideological supremacy within the early Christian movement and the emerging Catholic Church. The struggle culminated with an accepted definition of orthodoxy and a tradition of apostolic succession for legitimizing religious texts. <b>The</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Mary is an early Christian text deemed unorthodox by the men who shaped the nascent Catholic church, was excluded from the canon, and was subsequently erased from the history of Christianity along with most narratives that demonstrated women’s contributions to the early Christian movement. My thesis explores the intricacies of early canon formation {{within the context of the}} controversy surrounding women’s participation in authoritative roles within early Christianity and <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Mary was labeled as an unorthodox text due to its pro-feminine narrative. I maintain that the motive for excluding <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Mary was not the text’s lack of conformity to the requirements of apostolic succession or orthodoxy, but was grounded within the struggle to suppress the agency and participation of women from the patriarchal hierarchy that defined the developing structure of the Catholic Church.
