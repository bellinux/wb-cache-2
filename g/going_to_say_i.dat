500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am advising every young girl {{to go out and get}} pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 2, 2014, the News Journal {{reported}} that Bevin {{spoke at a}} pro-cockfighting rally in Corbin, Kentucky. Asked about his attendance, Bevin said he understood that the rally was a states' rights event: [...] "I {{was the first person}} to speak and then I left." [...] Organizers of the event, which was closed to the media, said there was [...] "never any ambiguity" [...] regarding its purpose, and WAVE in Louisville published an undercover video from the event showing that Bevin was the third speaker; the speaker who immediately preceded Bevin said the rally was held [...] "for the sole purpose of legalizing gamecock fighting at the state level." [...] Bevin told a WAVE reporter, [...] "I honestly wasn't even paying attention. I was thinking about what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> don't even remember him saying that." [...] The WAVE video also showed an attendee asking Bevin if he would support the legalization of cockfighting in Kentucky, to which he replied, [...] "I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is our right to decide what it is that we want to do, and not the federal government's. Criminalizing behavior, if it's part of the heritage of this state, is in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it." [...] Bevin was referencing the Agricultural Act of 2014, commonly called the [...] "farm bill", which contained a provision that criminalized spectators at cockfighting events.|$|E
2500|$|On October 26, 1981, {{after two}} firebombs damaged the Egyptian tourist office at Rockefeller Center, JDL Chairman Meir Kahane {{said at a}} press conference: [...] "I'm {{not going to say}} that the JDL bombed that office. There are laws against that in this country. But I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> mourn for it either." [...] The next day, after an {{anonymous}} caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the JDL, the group's spokesman later denied his group's involvement, but said, [...] "we support the act." [...] JDL members had often been suspected of involvement in attacks against neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and antisemites.|$|E

In only their second meeting of the year, Federer beat Nadal in the final. After the match, Nadal stated, [...] "Roger is probably the more complete player of the world. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> lost that match because I was tired." [...] This was a reference to his marathon victory over Murray on Saturday. [...] "I tried my best this afternoon, but Roger was simply better than me." ...|$|E
