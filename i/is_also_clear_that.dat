5|$|Portia de Rossi as Veronica Palmer: Veronica is Ted's {{boss and}} {{immediate}} supervisor at Veridian Dynamics. She maintains a fierce and unapproachable workplace demeanor, and many employees {{have a deep}} fear of her. She seems cold and calculating, but it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> she has more than grudging respect for Ted, and often recognizes what moral action is necessary to maintain balance in the workplace. An ongoing subplot touched on sporadically in the first season but more frequently in the second sees Veronica becoming a mentor to Linda and, to a lesser degree, Rose.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E

5000|$|Bazargan {{resigned}} {{along with}} his cabinet on 4 November 1979 following the US Embassy takeover and hostage-taking. His resignation was considered a protest against the hostage-taking and a recognition of his government's inability to free the hostages, but it <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> his hopes for liberal democracy and an accommodation with the West would not prevail.|$|R

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the tomb}} was re-entered {{at a later}} time, almost {{certainly}} during the 20th Dynasty. At this time, any additional, hypothetical occupants of the tomb would have been removed and (possibly) relocated to KV35, while the remaining mummy {{and some of the}} other artefacts were desecrated and abandoned.|$|E
5000|$|Ellison said: [...] "I {{want to make}} it {{absolutely}} <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> I have seen no evidence that Bishop Trevor was ever guilty of a criminal act. He undoubtedly had many enemies in South Africa and England who wanted to denigrate him, indeed, to destroy him."

30|$|Furthermore, {{numerical}} {{results indicated}} that, in 6 PBP test, mode-III and mode-II components {{can be created}} by controlling load and support points. Also, comparison of fracture load showed that fracture load decreased with changing mixed-mode ratio (mode-III to mode-II dominate). Nonetheless, the 6 PBP test for mixed-mode III/II condition inevitably involved the non-uniform distribution of crack growth and it <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> mixed-mode III/II fracture required extensive investigation which should {{lead to the development}} of improved test methods.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{something}} {{must now be}} done to loosen the grip of Ancient Greek on the educational system. Accordingly, in 1881, provision was officially made for the teaching of some katharevousa in Greek primary schools. It {{was the first time}} that anything other than Ancient Greek had been allowed in education. However, change was slow; some Ancient Greek continued to be taught in primary schools until 1917, and secondary schools were allowed nothing else until 1909.|$|R
25|$|Wetti's visions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Frankish perceptions of the afterlife, its appearance, and the punishments reserved for sinners. Furthermore, what explicitly appears in Wetti's visions not only reveals {{a great deal about}} his perspectives on wealth, lust, gender relations and monastic responsibility, but also the degree to which these issues (excluding monasticism) pervaded all levels of lay and religious officialdom in 9th-century Carolingian France. Clearly, he saw these as something debasing and degrading Frankish society, however, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> because of his monastic training in humility, he felt all but unable to speak out against them.|$|E
25|$|Increases in the {{security}} surrounding rich infrastructure targets in Britain also had a major effect on IRA team's ability to conduct operations. The seizure of war material and inability to get newly acquired war material into Britain under wartime restrictions meant increased improvisation, which in turn led to increased exposure to discovery. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the campaign generated {{a good deal of}} anti-Irish sentiment, which increased the British public's suspicion of Irish people in general. All these factors led to attacks tapering off around early to mid-1940. The death of Seán Russell on 14 August 1940, (he had already been effectively incommunicado since April 1939), and the succession of Stephen Hayes as IRA Chief of Staff also contributed to the petering out of the attacks.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{relied on}} depots much less {{frequently}} laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes {{were marked by}} the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking {{they would have been}} able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.|$|E
5000|$|It {{became obvious}} that the Supreme Commander for the attack of Japan would hold an {{enormous}} amount of power and would command an invasion force larger than any seen to date in the Second World War. It <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> whoever this commander was would have direct command authority of not one, but several five-star officers. To that end, a proposal was discussed in the War Department to appoint Douglas MacArthur to the rank of [...] "General of the Armies" [...] and have this position be considered a six-star general rank.|$|R
60|$|He watched Mr. Silk keenly, {{but that}} gentleman went {{about his work}} in his usual quiet and gloomy fashion, and, after a day's leave {{for the purpose of}} {{arranging}} the affairs of a sick aunt in Camberwell, came back only a little less gloomy than before. It <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Swann's complaisance was nearly at an end, and a letter, couched in vigorous, not to say regrettable, terms for a moribund man, expressed such a desire for fresh air and exercise that Hardy was prepared to see him at any moment.|$|R
2500|$|It was <b>clear</b> {{early on}} <b>that</b> a larger {{simulator}} {{was necessary for}} testing procedures with Skylab ( [...] diameter by [...] high) and other hardware in the pipeline. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> its construction would require some creative financing and political maneuvering. [...] In his September 12, 1966 memo to Wernher von Braun, Kuers disclosed, [...] " [...] had apparently been told of our plans regarding the new large neutral buoyancy type simulator, {{and in response to}} his point blank questions regarding this, he was candidly shown the design blueprints by responsible ME personnel.

25|$|Failure of the South Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{to develop an}} effective political narrative and civil/military administration. Some of this failure {{grew out of the}} difficult conditions in which South Vietnam was initially established, with a weak political and military organization that compared poorly with the well-oiled machine of the North. This initial weakness was also reflected in political instability, endemic corruption, inefficient administration and military incompetence. Despite these vulnerabilities however, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> millions of South Vietnamese opposed the takeover of their society by a communist dictatorship and fought resolutely against this outcome. The American failure was marked by its own set of shortcomings and miscalculations, but was inextricably linked to South Vietnamese difficulties, some historians maintain. Ultimate settlement of the conflict was between the Vietnamese.|$|E
25|$|If {{references}} are made, the Court of Justice {{will give a}} preliminary ruling, {{in order for the}} member state court to conclude the case and award a remedy. The right to an effective remedy is a general principle of EU law, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights article 47. Most of the time Regulations and Directives will set out the relevant remedies to be awarded, or they will be construed from the legislation according to the practices of the member state. It could also be that the government is responsible for failure to properly implement a Directive or Regulation, and must therefore pay damages. In Francovich v Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss. The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals, and there is a causal link between a member state's violation of EU and a claimant's loss, damages must be paid. The fact that the incompatible law is an Act of Parliament is no defence. So, in Factortame it was irrelevant that Parliament had legislated to require a quota of British ownership of fishing vessels in primary legislation. Similarly, in was Brasserie du Pêcheur v Germany the German government was liable to a French beer company for damages from prohibiting its imports, which did not comply with the fabled beer purity law. It was not decisive that the German Parliament had not acted willfully or negligently. It was merely necessary that there was (1) a rule intended to confer rights, (2) that a breach was sufficiently serious, and (3) there was a causal link between the breach and damage. The Court of Justice advised a breach is to be regarded as 'sufficiently serious' by weighing a range of factors, such as whether it was voluntary, or persistent. In Köbler v Republik Österreich the Court of Justice added that member state liability could also flow from judges failing to adequately implement the law. On the other hand, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> EU institutions, such as the Commission, may be liable according to the same principles for failure to follow the law. The only institution whose decisions appear incapable of generating a damages claim is the Court of Justice itself.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} the afterlife which the dead person enjoyed is {{difficult}} to define, because of the differing traditions within Ancient Egyptian religion. In the Book of the Dead, the dead were taken into {{the presence of the}} god Osiris, who was confined to the subterranean Duat. There are also spells to enable the ba or akh of the dead to join Ra as he travelled the sky in his sun-barque, and help him fight off Apep. As well as joining the Gods, the Book of the Dead also depicts the dead living on in the 'Field of Reeds', a paradisiac likeness of the real world. The Field of Reeds is depicted as a lush, plentiful version of the Egypt of the living. There are fields, crops, oxen, people and waterways. The deceased person is shown encountering the Great Ennead, a group of gods, as well as his or her own parents. While the depiction of the Field of Reeds is pleasant and plentiful, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> manual labour is required. For this reason burials included a number of statuettes named shabti, or later ushebti. These statuettes were inscribed with a spell, also included in the Book of the Dead, requiring them to undertake any manual labour that might be the owner's duty in the afterlife. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the dead not only went to a place where the gods lived, but that they acquired divine characteristics themselves. In many occasions, the deceased is mentioned as [...] "The Osiris – [...] " [...] in the Book of the Dead.|$|E
30|$|In our study, it <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that,</b> from D 1 to D 6 of {{mechanical}} ventilation, both CRP and CRP ratio increase steadily in VAP group and became significantly higher from D 5 onwards. Of the studied biomarkers, {{the slope of}} CRP was the individual variable most useful in VAP prediction. In addition, the calibration plot nicely separates those patients with low slopes and low probability of VAP from those with higher slopes and higher probability. This is particularly relevant, since monitoring {{the course of a}} single biomarker is much easier to interpret than the calculation of a score.|$|R
5000|$|By 1915 it <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Brazilian elites were {{dedicated}} to making sure Brazil followed a conservative political path, meaning they {{were unwilling to}} embark upon courses of action, whether domestically (i.e. adopting the secret ballot and universal suffrage) or in foreign affairs (making alliances or long-term commitments), that could have unpredictable consequences and potentially risk the social, economic and political positions held by the Brazilian elite. This course of conduct would extend throughout the 20th century, an isolationist foreign policy interspersed with sporadic automatic alignments against [...] "disturbing elements of peace and international trade" ...|$|R

500|$|A women's lodge {{existed in}} Boston {{during the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century. Hannah Mather Crocker, in an apology for Freemasonry written in 1815, claims to have presided over such a lodge, yet her description, [...] "founded on the {{original}} principles of true ancient masonry, as far as was consistent with the female character" [...] leaves the actual constitution open to question. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> St. Anne's lodge was extinct at the time of her writing about it. Crocker’s leadership of this exclusively female Masonic lodge stands as an alternative to historical frameworks that emphasize the formal political exclusion and public silencing of women in the development of republican, liberal political practice in the West.|$|E
500|$|In 1898 {{and again}} in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and {{wrote a book about}} his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, {{enabling}} the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. [...] "For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Nielsen {{wrote the}} music for over 290 songs and hymns, most of them for verses and poems by {{well-known}} Danish authors such as N. F. S. Grundtvig, Ingemann, Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, {{many of them are}} still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as [...] "the most representative part of the country's most representative composer's output". In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, Christian Winther or Drachmann, and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way as we do ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp what it is that brings us to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, the {{government}} of Zimbabwe cited financial restraints and an ongoing drought as the two overriding factors influencing the slow progress of land reform.

40|$|This study, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of John Dewey's (1859 - 1952) communication concept as aneducational evaluation, considers the relevance of communication and evaluation primarily inusing Dewey's works and rubrics of teaching experiments. As a result, it became clear thatcommunication performed by teachers and pupils in the course of collaborative research, as aneducational evaluation which nurtured pupils' evaluational abilities and included the notion of educative assessment, was an educational act. In addition, it <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the empathy of teachers with pupils worked fundamentally on educative assessments and also had the effect of turning educational assessments into educative assessments. 本研究は、デューイ(John Dewey, 1859 - 1952) のコミュニケーション概念を教育評価としてとらえる立場から、デューイの諸著作やルーブリックを用いた授業実践を主な対象として、コミュニケーションと評価のレリヴァンスを考察した。その結果、教師と児童生徒とが協同的な探究活動において行うコミュニケーションは、児童生徒の評価能力を育成することや、教育的アセスメントを含む教育評価としての教育的行為であることを明らかにした。また、児童生徒に対する教師の共感は、原理的に教育的アセスメントにおいて働いていることや、教育上のアセスメントを教育的アセスメントへと移行させる働きをすることを明らかにした...|$|R

500|$|Because {{the first}} forty {{official}} copies {{are made of}} the same alloy as the IPK and are stored under similar conditions, periodic verifications using {{a large number of}} replicas—especially the national primary standards, which are rarely used—can convincingly demonstrate the stability of the IPK. What has become clear after the third periodic verification performed between 1988 and 1992 is that masses of the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes have been slowly but inexorably diverging from each other. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the mass of the IPK lost perhaps 50µg over the last century, and possibly significantly more, in comparison to its official copies. The reason for this drift has eluded physicists who have dedicated their careers to the SI unit of mass. No plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain either a steady decrease in the mass of the IPK, or an increase in that of its replicas dispersed throughout the world. This relative nature of the changes amongst the world's kilogram prototypes is often misreported in the popular press, and even some notable scientific magazines, which often state that the IPK simply [...] "lost 50µg" [...] and omit the very important caveat of [...] "in comparison to its official copies".Even well respected organizations incorrectly represent the relative nature of the mass divergence as being one of mass loss, as exemplified by , and , and [...] The root of the problem is often the reporters' failure to correctly interpret or paraphrase nuanced scientific concepts, as exemplified by [...] by the Associated Press published on PhysOrg.com. In that AP story, Richard Davis—who used to be the NIST's kilogram specialist and now works for the BIPM in France—was correctly quoted by the AP when he stated that the mass change is a relative issue. Then the AP summarized the nature of issue with this lead-in to the story: [...] "A kilogram just isn't what it used to be. The 118-year-old cylinder that is the international prototype for the metric mass, kept tightly under lock and key outside Paris, is mysteriously losing weight— if ever so slightly". Like many of the above-linked sites, the AP also misreported the age of the IPK, using the date of its adoption as the mass prototype, not the date of the cylinder's manufacture. This is a mistake even Scientific American fell victim to in a print edition. Moreover, there are no technical means available {{to determine whether or not}} the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes suffers from even greater long-term trends upwards or downwards because their mass [...] "relative to an invariant of nature is unknown at a level below 1000µg over a period of 100 or even 50 years". Given the lack of data identifying which of the world's kilogram prototypes has been most stable in absolute terms, it is equally valid to state that the first batch of replicas has, as a group, gained an average of about 25µg over one hundred years in comparison to the IPK.|$|E
