5|$|The sociopolitical {{atmosphere}} of Chicago {{was one of}} ethnic tension caused by competition among many new groups. With the Great Migration, thousands of African Americans from the South had settled next to neighborhoods of European immigrants on Chicago's South Side, near jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking plants. The Irish had been established first, and fiercely defended their territory and political power against all newcomers. Post World War I tensions caused <b>frictions</b> between the races, especially in the competitive labor and housing markets. Overcrowding and increased African American militancy by veterans contributed to the visible racial <b>frictions.</b> Also, a combination of ethnic gangs and police neglect strained the racial relationships. According to official reports, the turmoil came to a boil {{after the death of}} an African American youth who had accidentally drifted into a swimming area at an informally segregated beach. Tensions between groups arose in a melee that blew up into days of unrest.|$|E

Several nations known to have been guilty of gross violations of human rights became members of the organization, such as Libya, Cuba, Sudan, Algeria, China, Azerbaijan and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the United States was also angry when it was ejected from the Commission in 2002. While it was re-elected, the election of human rights-abusing nations also caused <b>frictions.</b> It was partly because of these problems that Kofi Annan in the In Larger Freedom report suggested setting up a new Human Rights Council as a subsidiary UN body.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} on <b>friction</b> in robot joints and transmission systems has considered meshing <b>friction</b> a position-dependent <b>friction</b> component. However, {{in this paper}} we show experimental evidence that meshing <b>friction</b> depends highly on joint speed. We identify the meshing <b>friction</b> in the gearboxes of a robotic leg, and we propose a new mathematical model that considers the rate dependency of meshing <b>friction.</b> The resulting model is validated through experimentation. Results show that meshing <b>friction</b> is responsible for <b>friction</b> torque oscillations with an amplitude up to 25 percent of the average <b>friction</b> torque at low speeds.

5|$|War {{broke out}} in 1701 {{following}} the death of King Charles II over who should succeed him to the Spanish throne. The war at first was restricted to a few powers in Europe, but it widened in May 1702 when England declared war on Spain and France. The hostilities in North America were further encouraged by existing <b>frictions</b> along the frontier areas separating the colonies of these powers. This dis-harmony was most pronounced along the northern and southwestern frontiers of the English colonies, which then stretched from the Province of Carolina in the south to the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the north, with additional colonial settlements or trading outposts on Newfoundland and at Hudson Bay.|$|E

This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the <b>frictions</b> and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E

Matilda may have asked Ulger, the Bishop of Angers, to garner support for her claim with the Pope in Rome, but if she did, Ulger was unsuccessful. Geoffrey invaded Normandy in early 1136 and, after a temporary truce, invaded again later the same year, raiding and burning estates rather than trying to hold the territory. Stephen returned to the Duchy in 1137, where he met with Louis VI and Theobald to agree to an informal alliance against Geoffrey and Matilda, to counter the growing Angevin power in the region. Stephen formed an army to retake Matilda's Argentan castles, but <b>frictions</b> between his Flemish mercenary forces and the local Norman barons resulted in a battle between the two halves of his army. The Norman forces then deserted the King, forcing Stephen to give up his campaign.

For dynamic behaviors such as running, the performance limitations of robot are often due to limitations of <b>friction.</b> <b>Friction</b> effects are particularly critical for industrial robots. <b>Friction</b> deteriorates the performance of industrial robots cause’s disturbances such as positioning errors, tracking errors and stick-slip errors in robotics.

5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated <b>frictions</b> between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate {{lack of attention to}} the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until the}} 1890s, the {{government}} had no presence in the far north-west of Canada. In 1894, the rise of gold mining and a growing population led to calls for Ottawa to intervene, both to control whiskey trading {{and to protect the}} local First Nations. In response, the mounted police carried out a survey along the Yukon River and gathered customs duties. Fears grew that the United States might try to seize the mineral-rich region, and a twenty-man police team was established at Forty Mile in 1895. Although there was very little actual crime, <b>frictions</b> soon rose between the police and the Miners' Committees, which had been created to provide informal justice during the previous few years. The police brought the issue to a head in June 1896, sending a team into one of the mining camps to overturn the decisions of the local committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{security}} of Normandy {{was also a}} concern. Geoffrey of Anjou invaded in early 1136 and, after a temporary truce, invaded later the same year, raiding and burning estates {{rather than trying to}} hold the territory. Events in England meant that Stephen was unable to travel to Normandy himself, so Waleran de Beaumont, appointed by Stephen as the lieutenant of Normandy, and Theobald led the efforts to defend the duchy. Stephen himself only returned to the duchy in 1137, where he met with Louis VI and Theobald to agree to an informal regional alliance, probably brokered by Henry, to counter the growing Angevin power in the region. As part of this deal, Louis recognised Stephen's son Eustace as Duke of Normandy in exchange for Eustace giving fealty to the French king. Stephen was less successful, however, in regaining the Argentan province along the Normandy and Anjou border, which Geoffrey had taken at the end of 1135. Stephen formed an army to retake it, but the <b>frictions</b> between his Flemish mercenary forces led by William of Ypres and the local Norman barons resulted in a battle between the two halves of his army.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the issues}} of contact <b>friction</b> {{compensation}} for constrained robots are presented. The proposed design consists of two loops. The inner loop is for the inverse dynamics control which linearizes the system by canceling nonlinear dynamics, while the outer loop is for <b>friction</b> compensation. Although various models of <b>friction</b> have been proposed in many engineer-ing applications, frictional force can be modeled by the Coulomb <b>friction</b> plus the viscous force. Based on such a model, an on-line genetic algorithm is proposed to learn the <b>friction</b> coefficients for <b>friction</b> model. The <b>friction</b> compensation control input is also implemented {{in terms of the}} <b>friction</b> coefficients to cancel the effect of unknown <b>friction.</b> By the guidance of the fitness function, the genetic learning algorithm searches for the best-fit value in a way like the natural surviving laws. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed on-line genetic algorithm can achieve good <b>friction</b> compensation even under the conditions of measurement noise and system uncertainty. Moreover, the proposed control scheme is also found to be feasible for <b>friction</b> compensation of <b>friction</b> model with Stribeck effect and position-dependent <b>friction</b> model.

In this paper, we investigated the <b>friction</b> behavior of nanopatterned silicon surfaces with a periodical rectangular groove array in dry and wear-less single-asperity contact at the nanoscale using molecular dynamics simulations. The synchronous and periodic oscillations of the normal load and <b>friction</b> force with the sliding distance were determined at frequencies defined by the nanopattern period. The linear load dependence of the <b>friction</b> force is always observed for the nanopatterned surface and is independent of the nanopattern geometry. We show that the linear <b>friction</b> law is a formal Amontons’ <b>friction</b> law, while the significant linear dependence of the <b>friction</b> force-versus-real contact area and real contact area-versus-normal load captures the general features of the nanoscale <b>friction</b> for the nanopatterned surface.
