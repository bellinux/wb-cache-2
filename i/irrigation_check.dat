40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{for the period}} of two years (2004 and 2005) to evaluate the effect of various levels of water and N application through drip irrigation on red hot pepper yield, Water Use Efficiency (WUE) and Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE). In this experiment various combination of three irrigation treatments (Drip irrigation at 0. 5 and 1. 0 xEpan, check basin method of irrigation at 1. 0 xEpan) and three nitrogen levels (50, 75 and 100 % of recommended nitrogen) were compared in split plot design having three replications. The results revealed that when the same quantity of water and nitrogen (100 % of recommended) was supplied through drip irrigation system, it increased the red hot pepper yield to 277. 4 q ha - 1 (an increase of 28. 4 %) under check basin method of <b>irrigation.</b> In <b>check</b> basin method of irrigation, the highest red hot pepper yield (216. 1 q ha - 1) obtained at 100 % of recommended N, while in drip irrigation at 1. 0 xEpan, the yield was highest at 75 % of recommended N. When water and nitrogen was supplied through drip at 0. 5 xEpan, the yield remained statistically same at all the levels of nitrogen, however proved superior over drip irrigation at 1. 0 xEpan at all the levels of N. When half the recommended amount of N was supplied through drip at 0. 5 xEpan.,WUE and NUE increased by 232. 1 and 38. 7 % over check basin method of irrigation. At lower level of drip irrigation 0. 5 xEpan, Root length increased significantly with drip irrigation treatments as compared to check basin method of irrigation and found maximum (36. 3 m) at lower level of drip irrigation 0. 5 xEpan. Thus drip irrigation at 0. 5 x Epan is beneficial for red hot pepper in term of yield, better morphological characters, viz, plant height, number of branches, root length, size and weight of fruits along with 58. 6 % saving of <b>irrigation</b> water over <b>check</b> basin method of irrigation...|$|R

Hybrid maize [SC 301], {{with the use of}} a randomized complete block design with three replications. Studied treatments were including drought stress in 3 growth stages as before silking, during silking and in seed filling period in compare with normal <b>irrigation</b> as <b>check.</b> Water stress at before silking, silking or grain filling growth stages caused a significant reduction in the different growth parameters studied at 90 days after planting as compared with the normal irrigation regime. Data showed that water deficit significantly decreased yield. Water deficit at before silking, silking and filling growth stage decrease yield by 12. 5, 42. 0 and 22. 5 % respectively. Data indicated that the most sensitive growth stage to water stress is silking growth stage and should be attention that to avoid of yield decreasing, contraception of water stress in this growth stage is necessary.

40|$|As {{agricultural}} water resources in Asia become increasingly scarce, the irrigation efficiency of rice must be improved. However, {{in this region}} there is very limited information available about water use efficiency across spatial levels in irrigation systems. This study quantifies the volume of water reuse and its related cost-benefits at five different spatial levels, ranging from 1500 ha to 18, 000 ha, under gravity-fed irrigation system in Upper Pumpanga River Integrated Irrigation System (UPRIIS), Philippines. The major sources of water reuse are considered, namely groundwater pumping, pumping from creeks, combined use and <b>irrigation</b> supplies from <b>check</b> dams. The volume of water available from all four sources of water reuse was quantified through extensive measurements. Production functions were developed to quantify water-yield relationships and to measure the economic value of water reuse.

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{practice}} patterns pertaining to pre-cataract screening for nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) among oculoplastic surgeons in India. The survey {{was aimed at}} obtaining data on the current screening and treatment strategies for NLDO and the interval between lacrimal surgery and subsequent cataract surgery. Methods: An online survey was sent to all members of Oculoplastic Association of India. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. Results: Majority of the respondents (92 %) felt that nasolacrimal duct patency should be checked prior to performing cataract surgery: 59. 6 % felt that checking for regurgitation on pressure over the lacrimal sac (ROPLAS) was sufficient and 32. 6 % preferred to perform lacrimal <b>irrigation</b> to <b>check</b> for NLD patency. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) was the preferred surgery for NLDO thus detected. The preferred interval between a DCR and subsequent cataract surgery was 4  weeks (48. 9 %). A small minority (7. 9 %) of the respondents felt that pre-cataract screening for NLDO was not required. Also, a small but significant number (12. 6 %) felt that no treatment was required for NLDO in such patients and that to could go ahead with cataract surgery even {{in the presence of}} coexisting NLDO. Conclusions: There is a general agreement on the need for pre-cataract screening for NLDO and a majority indicated that checking for ROPLAS was sufficient. Most surgeons prefer to perform a DCR in cases of NLDO and wait for 4  weeks before intraocular surgery. There is however, a lacuna in the literature on guidelines regarding the optimal interval between lacrimal surgery and subsequent intraocular surgery...|$|R
40|$|Bay (border <b>check)</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{systems are}} {{utilised}} extensively throughout the Goulburn Murray Irrigation District (GMID). However, {{the performance of}} these systems have rarely been assessed, {{in part due to}} the difficulty in determining the soil intake function. The CRC for Irrigation Futures has recently completed a project to demonstrate the Irrimate™ performance evaluation process in bay irrigation through on-farm trials. The Irrimate™ approach originally developed for furrow irrigation has already provided real benefits to farmers and has been accepted across the cotton industry. Bay irrigation has a number of unique characteristics which presented a number of challenges for the tools used to evaluate furrow irrigation. Informed by field trials, new monitoring strategies were tested and new modelling approaches developed in order to provide the same robust evaluation procedure for bay systems. Evaluations provide objective information to irrigators both quantifying efficiencies of current practices and providing strategies to improve performance. Trials were conducted across 11 sites in order to benchmark current performance and to examine the potential advantages of higher flow rates. Performance varied widely between sites with application efficiencies ranging from 45. 9...|$|R
40|$|Many {{producers}} use drippers for trickle {{irrigation systems}} for flower {{production in the}} field and in protected environments. A frequent problem in this type of irrigation system is the clogging of drippers, which is directly related to water quality and filtering system efficiency. The objective {{of this study was to}} conduct an experimental investigation to evaluate the efficiency of using nitric acid and sodium hypochlorite to unclogg drippers due to the use of water with high algae content. The evaluation was conducted in six, 4216 m² greenhouses, each with two sectors comprised of ten spaces or lines, totaling 12 sectors of a dripper irrigation system in a rose producing property of Holambra, State of SP, Brazil. Chemical and physical analyses and the bacteriological count in water were carried out in the three water sources that supply the <b>irrigation</b> system to <b>check</b> the factors causing the clogging. Evaluations were carried out on water distribution uniformity in all sectors before and after chemical treatment in order to evaluate efficiency. The treatment improved water distribution uniformity and a lead to a reduction in the coefficient of variation (CV) for dripper flow in all sectors. There was a good correlation between CV and the water distribution uniformity index. Therefore, this is an excellent method to be used to unclogg drippers due to biological problems...|$|R
40|$|Beginning in the 1800 s, {{sheep and}} cattle {{ranching}} have caused significant erosion and devegetation of Santa Rosa Island, Channel Islands National Park. In {{an effort to}} contain what little soil is left and rebuild the native chaparral, the Cloud Forest Restoration Project is testing erosion control structures such as wattles, leaf litter fences and silt dams. This summer a drip irrigation system was installed along with fog capturing fences to supply water to native plants transplanted near the erosion control structures. As the project has grown, more irrigation {{has been added to}} increase the area available for transplanting. This irrigation system varies in elevation, slope, and diameter and lengths of irrigation lines. Because this project is experimentally monitored, it is important that all the transplants obtain the same amount of water. To check the efficiency of this system, the flow rates of 1. 9 L/hr rated pressure-compensating emitters along ¾” diameter polyethylene <b>irrigation</b> tubing were <b>checked.</b> Flow rates were relatively consistent at 1. 53 L/hr, 1. 60 L/hr and 1. 59 L/hr for 1 / 3, 2 / 3 and the whole system turned on, respectively. Although one might expect the addition of more irrigation line and emitters to decrease water pressure and thus the flow rate of individual emitters, the flow rates of emitters were found to be unaffected, indicating the effectiveness of the pressure-compensation. However, the flow rates of emitters were consistently lower than their 1. 9 L/hr rating. In conclusion, the irrigation system is currently providing equal water to each of the transplants, but at a rate lower than expected...|$|R
30|$|Groundwater {{samples from}} {{alluvial}} aquifers of Bathinda district, southwest Punjab were measured for physicochemical parameters {{as well as}} major ion chemistry to evaluate the groundwater suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes and to present the current hydrochemical status of groundwater of this district. Temporal variations were analyzed by comparing the pre- and post-monsoon groundwater chemistry. Most of the samples showed contamination: F− (72  %), Mg 2 + (22  %), SO 4 2 − (28  %), TH (25  %), NO 3 − (22  %), HCO 3 − (22  %) and TDS (11  %) during pre-monsoon and F− (50  %), Mg 2 + (39  %), SO 4 2 − (22  %), TH (28  %), NO 3 − (22  %) and TDS (28  %) during post-monsoon above permissible limits for drinking, while rest of the parameters fall within the limits. <b>Irrigation</b> suitability was <b>checked</b> using sodium absorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), percent sodium (Na%) and permeability index (PI). Most of the samples fall under good to suitable category during pre-monsoon period, but fall under doubtful to unsuitable category during post-monsoon period. Presence of high salt content in groundwater during post-monsoon season reflects leaching of salts present in the unsaturated zone by infiltrating precipitation. Hydrochemical data was interpreted using Piper’s trilinear plot and Chadha’s plot to understand the various geochemical processes affecting the groundwater quality. The {{results indicate that the}} order of cation dominance is Na+ > Mg 2 + > Ca 2 +, while anion dominance is in the order Cl− > HCO 3 − > SO 4 2 −. The geochemistry of groundwater of this district is mainly controlled by the carbonate and silicate mineral dissolution and ion exchange during pre-monsoon and leaching from the salts deposited in vadose zone during post-monsoon. The main sources of contamination are soluble fertilizers and livestock wastes. This study is significant as the surface water resources are limited and {{the quality and quantity of}} groundwater are deteriorating with time due to anthropogenic inputs.|$|R

While elaborating the situation analysis, emphasis is given to quantification of water re-use and its related economic benefits under gravity-fed irrigation systems. This irrigation system presents a distinct geophysical feature which provides opportunities for capturing irrigation outflows from rice fields of upstream areas through a network of natural creeks.

In UPRIIS area, the major sources of re-use system include groundwater pumping, lifting surface water from creeks and <b>irrigation</b> supplies from <b>check</b> dams. Specifically, this study aimed to: a) quantify {{the current level of}} water re-use from creeks, groundwater and check dams; and b) to estimate the economic benefits of water re-use from pumping groundwater and creeks in District 1 of UPRIIS. This study was conducted during the dry season of 2001, (19 November 2000 - 18 May 2001). During this period, the average rainfall was only 190 mm (long term average of 170 mm). A comprehensive survey was carried out in District 1 {{with the help of the}} National Irrigation Administration (NIA). This survey focused on obtaining information regarding pumping technologies, sources of re-use water (groundwater or creek), existing cropping patterns and pumped water sharing practices. An additional 50 pump owners, from a total of 1154 pumps, were selected for detailed investigation and monitoring of total water with drawl from different sources of water. The geographic information system (GIS) was developed to characterize the study area. To quantify the amount of water re-use, pumps were calibrated 7 - 9 times with a V-notch weir to determine the actual discharge for different sizes of pump. The total amount of water being pumped by each monitored farm was determined by multiplying the actual discharge with the total pumping times/hectare. Water and yield relations were determined by developing production functions, and economic benefits were determined by estimating the water productivity (economics) and calculating the marginal value of water. In the study area, it was found that 22 % of the farmers use pumps to draw water from shallow tube wells for supplementary irrigation. The pump density ranged from 0. 13 - 0. 2 pumps/ha, showing that the majority of the farmers depend on groundwater. The estimated total volume pumped per ha ranged from 0. 39 - 6. 93 m 3 /ha during the dry season. Overall, this is equivalent to 30 % of the water lost through seasonal actual evapotranspiration from the rice crop. There was no difference in pumping cost between the creek (0. 012 $/m 3) and shallow pumps (0. 012 $/m 3). Overall marginal value product (MVP) of water re-use was 0. 0406 $/m 3. The MVP of water re-use from creek (0. 0438 $/m 3) was slightly higher than the water re-use through the pumping ground water (0. 0388 $/m 3). The results showed that water re-use plays a dominant role in the growth of a rice crop during the dry season. The results clearly indicate that the quantification of volumes of water re-use is crucial for understanding and finding real water saving possibilities at the irrigation system level. The results also revealed that rice production systems are still profitable despite high pumping costs and other associated expenses in District 1. These findings would lead to an improvement in the water use efficiency and water productivity of irrigated rice systems. ...|$|R
