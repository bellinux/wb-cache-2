5|$|Many {{butterflies}} {{are sexually}} dimorphic. Most butterflies have the ZW sex-determination system where females are the <b>heterogametic</b> sex (ZW) and males homogametic (ZZ).|$|E
25|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{common for}} achieving equal X-related genetic expression {{between males and}} females involves two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome. Thus, <b>heterogametic</b> male organisms with one X chromosome may match the level of expression achieved in homogametic females with two active X chromosomes. This mechanism is observed in Drosophila.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{explanation of}} how the inheritance of gens works is as follows. The egg colour is inherited by sex chromosome. In birds sex determination is ZZ/ZW, and unlike mammals, the <b>heterogametic</b> sex is the female. The determining gene (or super-gene) for the inheritance of egg colour {{is believed to be}} carried on the W chromosome, which is directly transmitted in the female line. The female behaviour in choosing the host species is set by imprinting after birth, a common mechanism in bird behaviour.|$|E
25|$|While the {{epigenetic}} mechanisms behind {{dosage compensation}} in birds are poorly understood, especially {{in comparison to}} the well-studied mechanisms of dosage compensation in humans and Drosophila, several recent studies have revealed promising sequences. One example is MHM (male hypermethylated) RNA, an Xist-like long noncoding RNA that is expressed only in female chickens (ZW). It is associated with female-specific hyper-acetylation of lysine 16 on histone 4 near the MHM locus on the Z chromosome. This MHM locus is heavily studied as a site of dosage compensation because male Z chromosomes are hypermethylated and thus underexpress genes in this area in comparison to female Z chromosomes which are hyperacetylated and overexpress these genes. There has been debate on whether the MHM locus constitutes dosage compensation, however, since scientists claim that even if the MHM locus has been found to have significantly greater expression in females than in males, it could not even be considered to be a dosage compensation mechanism since it does not balance gene dose between the Z chromosome and autosomes in the <b>heterogametic</b> sex.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of their}} {{ambiguous}} evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an XY sex-determination system, with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the homogametic sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the <b>heterogametic</b> sex. Because the entire genome of the platypus {{has yet to}} be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.|$|E
25|$|The sex {{chromosomes}} {{of birds}} evolved separately {{from those of}} mammals and share very little sequence homology with the XY chromosomes. As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male <b>heterogametic</b> sex, similar to the system observed in the two male X chromosomes of Drosophila. However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as “less effective” at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more {{recent studies have shown}} that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may {{play an important role in}} recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans. Thus, the function of the selective silencing may be to spare dosage compensation of genes crucial for sex determination of homologous pairing.|$|E
2500|$|Y-linked {{disorders}} {{are caused by}} mutations on the Y chromosome. [...] These conditions display may only be transmitted from the <b>heterogametic</b> sex (e.g. male humans) to offspring of the same sex. More simply, this means that Y-linked disorders in humans can only be passed from men to their sons; females can never be affected {{because they do not}} possess Y-allosomes.|$|E
50|$|However, in birds, {{and some}} reptiles, males have two Z sex {{chromosomes}} {{and so are}} the homogametic sex, while females, with one Z and one W chromosome, are the <b>heterogametic</b> sex. Among the insects, Lepidopterans (butterflies and moths) have <b>heterogametic</b> females, but in Drosophila, males are the <b>heterogametic</b> sex.|$|E
5000|$|Differential selection: Hybrid {{incompatibilities}} {{affecting the}} <b>heterogametic</b> sex and homogametic sex are fundamentally different isolating mechanisms, which makes <b>heterogametic</b> inferiority (sterility/inviability) more visible or preserved in nature.|$|E
50|$|The rule {{includes}} both male <b>heterogametic</b> (XY or XO-type sex determination, such {{as found in}} mammals and Drosophila fruit flies) and female <b>heterogametic</b> (ZW-type sex determination, as found in birds and butterflies), and some dioecious plants such as campions.|$|E
5000|$|Dominance: <b>Heterogametic</b> hybrids are {{affected}} by all X-linked alleles (be they recessive or dominant) causing incompatibilities due to divergent alleles being brought together. However, homogametic hybrids are only affected by dominant deleterious X-linked alleles. <b>Heterogametic</b> hybrids, which carry only a single copy of a given X-linked gene, {{will be affected by}} mutations regardless of dominance. Thus, an X-linked incompatibility between diverging populations {{is more likely to be}} expressed in the <b>heterogametic</b> sex than in the homogametic sex.|$|E
50|$|Haldane's rule {{states that}} if in a species hybrid only one sex is sterile, {{that sex is}} usually the <b>heterogametic</b> sex. The <b>heterogametic</b> sex is the one with two {{different}} sex chromosomes; in mammals, this is the male, with XY chromosomes. It is named after J.B.S. Haldane.|$|E
5000|$|Females, {{rather than}} males, are <b>heterogametic</b> (i.e. their sex {{chromosomes}} differ).|$|E
50|$|<b>Heterogametic</b> sex (digametic sex) {{refers to}} the sex of a species in which the sex {{chromosomes}} are not the same. For example, in humans, males, with an X and a Y sex chromosome, would {{be referred to as}} the <b>heterogametic</b> sex, and females having two X sex chromosomes would be referred to as the homogametic sex.|$|E
50|$|Where the A gene is sex linked, the <b>heterogametic</b> sex (e.g., {{mammalian}} males; avian females) {{have only}} one copy of the gene (and are termed hemizygous), while the homogametic sex (e.g., human females) have two copies. The genotype frequencies at equilibrium are p and q for the <b>heterogametic</b> sex but p2, 2pq and q2 for the homogametic sex.|$|E
50|$|In mammals, {{the female}} is homogametic, with two X {{chromosomes}} (XX), while the male is the <b>heterogametic</b> sex, with one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Genes on the X or Y chromosome are called sex-linked. In ZW sex-determination system used by birds {{the opposite is}} true: the male is the homogametic sex (ZZ), and the female is <b>heterogametic</b> (ZW).|$|E
50|$|Haldane's rule is an {{observation}} {{about the early}} stage of speciation, formulated in 1922 by the British evolutionary biologist J.B.S. Haldane, that states that if in a species hybrid only one sex is inviable or sterile, that sex {{is more likely to}} be the <b>heterogametic</b> sex. The <b>heterogametic</b> sex is the one with two different sex chromosomes; in mammals, for example, this is the male.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: In humans, barring {{intersex}} {{conditions and}} other unusual states, {{it is the}} male that is <b>heterogametic,</b> with XY sex chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Many {{butterflies}} {{are sexually}} dimorphic. Most butterflies have the ZW sex-determination system where females are the <b>heterogametic</b> sex (ZW) and males homogametic (ZZ).|$|E
50|$|Birds {{and many}} insects {{have a similar}} system of sex {{determination}} (ZW sex-determination system), {{in which it is}} the females that are <b>heterogametic</b> (ZW), while males are homogametic (ZZ).|$|E
50|$|There are notable {{exceptions}} to Haldane's rule, where the homogametic sex {{turns out to}} be inviable while the <b>heterogametic</b> sex is viable and fertile. This is seen in Drosophila fruit flies.|$|E
5000|$|Haldane himself {{described}} the rule as: When in the F1 offspring {{of two different}} animal races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterozygous sex (<b>heterogametic</b> sex).|$|E
5000|$|If {{in either}} {{monoecious}} or dioecious organisms, either the allele or genotype proportions are initially unequal in either sex, {{it can be}} shown that constant proportions are obtained after one generation of random mating. If dioecious organisms are <b>heterogametic</b> and the gene locus {{is located on the}} X chromosome, it can be shown that if the allele frequencies are initially unequal in the two sexes XX females and XY males, as in humans, [...] in the <b>heterogametic</b> sex ‘chases’ [...] in the homogametic sex of the previous generation, until an equilibrium is reached at the weighted average of the two initial frequencies.|$|E
50|$|Haldane's rule {{applies to}} the vast {{majority}} of <b>heterogametic</b> organisms. This includes the case where two species make secondary contact in an area of sympatry and form hybrids after allopatric speciation has occurred.|$|E
50|$|This {{happens because}} female birds {{have a single}} Z sexual chromosome, while males carry two, {{contrarily}} to what happens in humans, where the male is the <b>heterogametic</b> sex, as occurs in most diploid species.|$|E
50|$|In {{reproductive}} biology, heterogamy or heterogamous {{is often}} used as a synonym of <b>heterogametic,</b> meaning the presence of two unlike chromosomes in a sex. For example, XY males and ZW females are called the heterogamous sex.|$|E
50|$|Lepidoptera and Trichoptera (caddisflies) {{are more}} closely related than any other taxa, sharing many {{similarities}} that are lacking in other insect orders; for example the females of both orders are <b>heterogametic,</b> meaning they have two different sex chromosomes, whereas in most species the males are <b>heterogametic</b> and the females have two identical sex chromosomes. The adults in both orders display a particular wing venation pattern on their forewings. The larvae of both orders have mouth structures and a gland with which they make and manipulate silk. Willi Hennig grouped the two orders into the Amphiesmenoptera superorder; they are sisters, and together are sister to the extinct order Tarachoptera.|$|E

Lepidoptera descend from a diurnal moth-like common ancestor that either fed on dead or living plants.|$|E
50|$|In birds, female is the <b>heterogametic</b> sex, that is, {{it has one}} Z and one W sexual {{chromosome}} (genotype ZW), while male (the homogametic sex) carries two Z chromosomes (genotype ZZ). Thus, reciprocal crosses between normal and dwarf specimens may give rather different results.|$|E
50|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{common for}} achieving equal X-related genetic expression {{between males and}} females involves two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome. Thus, <b>heterogametic</b> male organisms with one X chromosome may match the level of expression achieved in homogametic females with two active X chromosomes. This mechanism is observed in Drosophila.|$|E
50|$|The {{fertility}} {{of hybrid}} big cat females {{is well documented}} across {{a number of different}} hybrids. This is in accordance with Haldane's rule: in hybrids of animals whose sex is determined by sex chromosomes, if one sex is absent, rare or sterile, it is the <b>heterogametic</b> sex (the one with two different sex chromosomes e.g. X and Y).|$|E
50|$|Y-linked {{disorders}} {{are caused by}} mutations on the Y chromosome.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the XY sex-determination system and the X0 sex-determination system, where the sperm determines the sex, in the ZW system, the ovum determines {{the sex of the}} offspring. Males are the homogametic sex (ZZ), while females are the <b>heterogametic</b> sex (ZW). The Z chromosome is larger and has more genes, like the X chromosome in the XY system.|$|E
50|$|Normal {{females are}} always of {{genotype}} Dw/-, while dwarf females are always of genotype dw/-, because female is the <b>heterogametic</b> sex having only one Z chromosome. That is, females carrying a sex-linked gene of dwarfism are always pure and exhibit the trait. On the other hand, normal males may be either homozygous Dw/Dw or heterozygous Dw/dw, but dwarf males are always homozygous dw/dw.|$|E
50|$|A {{chromosome}} in a diploid organism is hemizygous {{when only}} one copy is present. The cell or organism {{is called a}} hemizygote. Hemizygosity is also observed when one copy of a gene is deleted, or in the <b>heterogametic</b> sex when a gene is located on a sex chromosome. Hemizygosity must {{not be confused with}} haploinsufficiency, which describes a mechanism for producing a phenotype. For organisms in which the male is <b>heterogametic,</b> such as humans, almost all X-linked genes are hemizygous in males with normal chromosomes because they have only one X chromosome and few of the same genes are on the Y chromosome. Transgenic mice generated through exogenous DNA microinjection of an embryo's pronucleus are also considered to be hemizygous because the introduced allele is expected to be incorporated into only one copy of any locus. A transgenic can later be bred to homozygosity and maintained as an inbred line to reduce the need to confirm the genotypes of each litter.|$|E
50|$|Haldane's rule {{states that}} {{when one of the}} two sexes is absent in {{interspecific}} hybrids between two specific species, then the sex that is not produced, is rare or is sterile is the heterozygous (or <b>heterogametic)</b> sex. In mammals, at least, there is growing evidence to suggest that this is due to high rates of mutation of the genes determining masculinity in the Y chromosome.|$|E
