40|$|We {{compare the}} ground {{state of the}} random-field Ising model with Gaussian {{distributed}} random fields, with its non-equilibrium hysteretic counterpart, the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state.</b> This is a low energy state obtained by a sequence of slow magnetic field oscillations with decreasing amplitude. The main concern is how optimized the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state</b> is {{with respect to the}} best-possible ground state. Exact results for the energy in d= 1 show that in a paramagnet, with finite spin-spin correlations, there is {{a significant difference in the}} energies if the disorder is not so strong that the states are trivially almost alike. We use numerical simulations to better characterize the difference between the ground state and the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state.</b> For d>= 3 the random-field Ising model displays a disorder induced phase transition between a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic state. The locations of the critical points R_c(DS), R_c(GS) differ for the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state</b> and ground state. Consequently, it is in this regime that the optimization of the demagnetized stat is the worst whereas both deep in the paramagnetic regime and in the ferromagnetic one the states resemble each other to a great extent. We argue based on the numerics that in d= 3 the scaling at the transition is the same in the demagnetized and ground states. This claim is corroborated by the exact solution of the model on the Bethe lattice, where the R_c's are also different. Comment: 13 figs. Submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|E

40|$|Annealing short {{very low}} {{magnetostriction}} amorphous ribbons in the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state</b> {{results in a}} Perminvar-like reentrant hysteresis loop due to domain wall stabilization by the induced anisotropy. After a hard saturation, the loop changes to that of an unprocessed ribbon. In this investigation, ribbons are annealed in the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state</b> with one wall along the ribbon middle. This wall becomes pinned during the heat treatment. Reentrant reversal occurs when reverse domains are nucleated at the ribbon edge with a threshold field larger than the demagnetizing field, this wall does not annihilate when it meets the pinned wall but leaves a line of reverse domains stabilized by ripple in the anisotropy. These domains enable a regular smooth reversal for the demagnetization process until the ribbon returns to the pinned configuration. The regular loop appears when the ribbon has been completely saturated by a large field. Mobile walls are nucleated {{on both sides of}} the pinned wall so that the ribbon does not return to the pinned configuration. Reversal now follows the usual demagnetization curve over the entire cycle. Kerr magnetooptical domain and domain wall observations are used in this investigation.

In the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state</b> at 290 K, a (110) oriented surface contains many non- 180 ° walls, oriented along crystallographic directions, typically 50 µm in width. Synchrotron X-radiation topographs have been taken sequentially in increasing magnetic fields up to 3 kOe oriented in various directions in the specimen plane. After signifiant reorganization of the structures in low fields, an immobile domain structure formed which persisted up to the highest fields available. Application of a field parallel to [1 [MATH] 1] resulted in immobile walls parallel to [1 [MATH] 1]. From consideration of the X-ray diffraction contrast in the synchrotron topographs we suggest that in the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state</b> closure structures exist between domains magnetized {{in one of the}} [111] easy directions in the surface and an inclined [111] easy direction. The immobile structures consist of 109 ° walls between the two [111] easy directions inclined to the surface. From magnetostatic considerations we see that such walls can lie in any plane containing [110] and as the component of magnetization in the specimen plane is equal in sense and magnitude in both domains, the structure is immobile.

40|$|International audienceAnisotropy of low-field {{magnetic}} susceptibility (AMS) of basaltic lava flows can give some clues about post-emplacement tilting occurring in volcanic sequences. Such a {{study has been}} carried out on a sequence of 19 successive lava flows from Kerguelen Archipelago. Surprisingly, two different patterns were observed. The first one - herein called normal fabric - is consistent with the lava-flow direction inferred from geological observations, whereas the second one observed for about 70 per cent of the analysed samples - herein called abnormal fabric - appears to be unrelated to the shear history of the lava flows during their emplacements. These abnormal fabrics are not strictly inverse fabric but seem to have a more complex origin. The unusual nature of these abnormal fabrics has been confirmed by lattice preferred orientation of plagioclases obtained from high-resolution electron backscattered diffraction measurements. The aim {{of this study is to}} propose a physical interpretation of these fabrics. A first step in our understanding was to clearly identify the nature and the magnetic properties of the Fe-Ti oxides assemblage. Thus, we present a comprehensive rock magnetic analysis relying on low- and high-temperature thermomagnetic curves (K-T), crossover diagrams, first-order reversal curves, ore-microscopy, Mössbauer measurements and electron backscattered images. We found that in the present case the abnormal fabrics are probably linked to a mixture of prevailing single domain (SD) strongly interacting grains population and a subsidiary multidomain grains population. SD grains are identified as small magnetite crystallized within the interstitial glass in globular aggregates along the silicate framework. Then a question arises: to what extent such SD interacting grains in globular aggregates can affect the {{magnetic susceptibility}} and its anisotropy? To answer this question, we developed a physical model in which the total energy density of an SD grain with an uniaxial anisotropy is minimized. In this model, the distribution function of the direction of the magnetic interaction field is comprised between two boundary states. It is either isotropic, which formally corresponds to the thermal <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state,</b> or it is ordered, which formally corresponds to the Alternative Field <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state.</b> We show that in both cases the degree of anisotropy decreases as the interaction field increases. Thus, we conclude that the abnormal fabric encountered in this study can be simply explained by strong magnetostatic interactions that would explain the large scattering of AMS often observed in basaltic lava flows...|$|E

The magnetization dependence of the ΔE effect in nickel crystals was observed in a peculiar behavior (two steps, except [111]), {{similar to those of}} iron crystals, replacing [100] in iron to [111] in nickel. (ΔE/E_s) _r, the value at the residual point, {{as a function of the}} orientation function was on a straight line but for [110]. The elastic constants of nickel were estimated at the saturated state and well coincident with the value at 10 Mc. The values were C_ = 2. 53, C_ = 1. 55, C_ = 1. 24, all in units of 10 ^ dyne/cm^ 2. In the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state</b> the elastic constants were distributed at random, as expected...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Polycrystalline NiZn ferrites with {{different}} grain sizes (1 × 2 mm to 10 × 2 mm) were {{prepared by the}} usual ceramic method. The magnetic properties were measured at room temperature. The ultrasonic velocity and attenuation were measured on Ni–Zn ferrite by using the pulse transmission method at 1 MHz, in the temperature range 300 – 600 K. The velocity {{was found to be}} slightly sample dependent at room temperature and decreased with increasing temperature, except near the Curie temperature, Tc, where a small anomaly was observed. The longitudinal attenuation (al) at room temperature was found to be more sample dependent. The temperature variation of ultrasonic longitudinal attenuation exhibited a broad maximum around 400 K nd a sharp maximum just below Curie temperature (Tc). The above observations were carried out in the <b>demagnetized</b> <b>state.</b> The application of a 380 mT magnetic field allowed us to reach the saturated state of the sample at all the measuring temperatures. The anomaly observed in the thermal variation of velocities (longitudinal and transverse) and attenuaio has been qualitatively explained {{with the help of the}} temperature variation of the magneto-crystalline anisotropy constant...|$|E
