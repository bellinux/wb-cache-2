500|$|Attendance at Gay Pride marches {{during the}} summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> And I want you to talk about it. You must come out. Come out to your parents, your relatives.|$|E

6000|$|Paul said argumentatively, [...] "Now, don't go {{jumping on}} Zilla. I've been thinking; maybe she hasn't had any too easy a time. Just after I shot her--I didn't hardly mean to, {{but she got}} to {{deviling}} me so I went crazy, just for a second, and pulled out that old revolver you and I used to shoot rabbits with, and took a crack at her. Didn't hardly mean to--After that, when I was {{trying to stop the}} blood--It was terrible what it did to her shoulder, and she had beautiful skin--Maybe she won't die. I hope it won't leave her skin all scarred. But just afterward, when I was hunting through the bathroom for some cotton to stop the blood, I ran onto a little fuzzy yellow duck we hung on the tree one Christmas, and I remembered she and I'd been awfully happy then--Hell. I can't hardly believe it's me here." [...] As Babbitt's arm tightened about his shoulder, Paul sighed, [...] "I'm glad you came. But I thought maybe you'd lecture me, and when you've committed a murder, and been brought here and everything--there was a big crowd outside the apartment house, all staring, and the cops took me through it--Oh, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> any more." ...|$|E

[...] "Give {{a lot of credit}} to Adam Wachtel. He came to me {{a few years ago and}} wanted to purchase half of this horse for Gary (Barber) and himself.

5000|$|Newmarket Racecourse's Guineas Festival on 30 April and 1 May {{threw up}} three winners with {{possible}} Derby hopes. The 2000 Guineas was won by Galileo Gold, owned by Sheikh Joaan Al Thani's Al Shaqab Racing. Galileo Gold was quoted {{after the race}} at odds of 6 to 1 for the Derby by the bookmakers William Hill and 10 to 1 by Ladbrokes. The same afternoon's Listed Newmarket Stakes was won by Godolphin's Hawkbill, trained by Charlie Appleby. Hawkbill won by a length and a quarter from Abdon with the favourite, Sky Kingdom, a further length away in third. Godolphin's racing manager, John Ferguson, said after the race that Hawkbill {{would be able to}} run over longer distances than the ten-furlong Newmarket Stakes, and that the Derby and its French equivalent the Prix du Jockey-Club were possible targets. The third race with an impact on the Derby betting was the 1000 Guineas, restricted to fillies, which was won by Minding, owned by Coolmore and trained in Ireland by Aidan O'Brien. Minding's three-and-a-half length win prompted the Ladbrokes bookmaking company to quote her at odds of 5 to 2 for the Derby [...] "with a run", allowing gamblers to back her at those odds and have their stake refunded if she does not run in the race. O'Brien was non-commital when asked about future plans for Minding, stating that the Irish 1,000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks were also possible targets, and saying that [...] "“Obviously owners will talk about that but all those things are open to her. I suppose they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and see what everyone wants to do.” ...|$|E

What I propose to do is to cover some of our recent less-than-satisfying experiences in the real world of NDE applications {{from the point of view}} of the Air Force Systems Support Division at the Materials Lab. I realized that the work that is going to be done here at the NDE Science Center is not really similar to what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It</b> is a more sophisticated and exotic type work than the kind of work we do in the everyday, mundane world at the laboratory where we have to do jobs for everybody and anybody.
