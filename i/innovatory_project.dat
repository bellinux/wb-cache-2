40|$|The {{subject of}} this article is the problem of rights and freedom in Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski’s "Commentariorum de Republica emendanda libri quinque". It sets out to show how the author sets out the two {{categories}} and construes the relations between them. Initially, it aims to highlight the general sources of thinking about rights and freedom in Central Europe, {{while at the same time}} offering a broad profile of Modrzewski in the light of his epoch. The main part of the article then presents a selection of ideas taken from his well-known work. It presents his conception of custom as the ground of law, and his furnishing of arguments for the existence of written laws. It distinguishes two criteria by means of which Modrzewski sought to evaluate laws: reason and justice. It outlines the negative aspects of certain acts, the worst of which is murder and its associated problems. His view concerning the incorrect treatment of serfs is also presented, together with his criteria for the selection of officials. This is followed by his <b>innovatory</b> <b>project</b> for reform of the judicial system, in which the key point is the establishment of permanent courts. Modrzewski’s attitude to the issue of freedom, with its distinction between inner and outer freedom, is then explored, emphasizing the inseparable character of the connection between the two concepts. Finally, the distinctively Polish character of the perspective presented is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{intensification}} of innovatory {{activities in the}} organizations has been unleashing the appearance of projects of high risk and with determined level of complexity and when the search was stimulated by models that could they make manageable the uncertainties and risks of these projects. Traditional methodologies are already not sufficient for they secure {{the success of these}} projects. The premise of which a set of tools and standardized techniques could be applicable to all the types of projects has been strongly questioned, given to the basic existent differences between them. This article is focused in <b>innovatory</b> <b>projects</b> present a revision and analysis of the literature of risk management from a cotangential perspective. Articles were lifted in the scientific bases of data thinking - if two great slopes: tipology of projects and methodologies for management of risks of projects inovativos and complex. On basis of the critical analysis of the literature, there happened a proposition of a structured model...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to emphasise the point that {{curriculum}} development in schools is determined as much by political considerations as by purely educational principles. Such a reminder might make class teachers more effective in presenting their views towards the initiators of education policy. The experience of the Shef-field History Curriculum Group (SHCG) in encouraging a number of <b>innovatory</b> <b>projects</b> provides the fieldwork data linked to specific developments in schools. One of the fundamental problems in trying to design an appropriate cur-riculum is that there is often only limited agreement on what should be covered. There is endless debate about the content and strategy for implementation so that what might suit one school will not necessarily suit another. Somehow a set of teach-ing aims and objectives emerges out of a multiplicity of parameters: availability of resources, pressures from exam boards, personal whim and a naive belief that there are some fundamental certainties which derive from our cultural heritage. This process, taking place as it does against the pressures of a teacher’s day, is assumed to be curriculum development in action. In fact, this is akin to inspire...|$|R
