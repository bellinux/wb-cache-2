He also continued to work part-time in developing new riders for the American team, as well as taking a part-time <b>job</b> <b>coaching</b> the Canadian team for the 1992 Summer Olympics. He {{also served as a}} member of the Three-Day Event Committee for the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI), including serving as a three-day eventing judge with the rank of [...] "O", meaning Official International. He was an eventing judge at the 1994 World Equestrian Games, the 1996 Summer Olympics, and multiple European Championships. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, he served as the chair of the FEI Three-Day Event Committee and as the eventing representative to the Appeal Committee, assisting with supervising equestrian competition at the Games. After his retirement from coaching and judging, he moved between homes in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and France, until he died in France in 2009.|$|E
500|$|By 1922, Kilner's bowling had {{improved}} {{to the point}} where he passed 100 wickets in the season for the first time, taking 122 at an average of 14.72, helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship. Wisden recognised this was the first season when he was a front-line bowler, [...] " [...] his previous form far behind." [...] In the first five games of the campaign, he took 21 wickets for 142 runs. In the match against Essex, he claimed ten wickets in a match for the first time, taking eleven for 51 runs. Against Hampshire, he took ten wickets for 90 runs, including six for 13 in the second innings as Hampshire were bowled out for 44. At the same time, he maintained his batting form, having a similar record to the previous season. He scored 1,198 runs at 27.22 and scored two centuries. This meant he completed the double—regarded as the sign of a quality all-round cricketer—for the first time. Kilner was fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages and fourth in the bowling averages. At the end of the season, he was again selected for CI Thornton's XI, as well as in two games at Eastbourne. Over the English winter, Kilner accepted a <b>job</b> <b>coaching</b> for the Maharaja of Patiala in India. He played in several first-class matches, and enjoyed himself enough to return the following winter.|$|E

40|$|Coworker {{perceptions}} of facilitation strategies pro-vided by <b>job</b> <b>coaches,</b> and needed by coworkers, and discrepancies between facilitation strategies provided by <b>job</b> <b>coaches</b> and those {{perceived as being}} needed by co-workers were analyzed {{in relation to the}} types and fre-quency of problems reported to be exhibited by sup-ported employees (N = 83). The results of this prelimi-nary investigation indicated that when the frequency of work problems was low, the majority of the problems resulted in the need for and provision of less intensive facilitation strategies. Coworkers perceived they needed either low or a mixed level of support, not a high level of support, even when the frequency of work problems was high, except when the problems were related to challeng-ing behaviors such as self-injury and property destruc-tion. The most intriguing finding was that <b>job</b> <b>coaches</b> generally used the level of facilitation strategies that matched coworker needs.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a group configuration {{that is currently}} employed to support the everyday living and working activities of people with cognitive disabilities. A client receiving face-to-face, often one-to-one, assistance from a dedicated human <b>job</b> <b>coach</b> is characteristic of this “traditional ” configuration. We compare it with other group configurations {{that are used in}} cooperative and distributed work practices and propose an alternative configuration titled active distributed support system.

In particular, we assert that the knowledge of how to perform such activities is shared not only among people, but also between people and artifacts. There is a great potential for innovative uses of ubiquitous and mobile technologies to support these activities.

Increased choice provision occurred for both <b>job</b> <b>coaches</b> across a 1 -year period. Results indicate how outcome management can help translate advances in choice research into routine practice. DESCRIPTORS: outcome management, choice, supported work Despite numerous investigations demon-strating the benefits of providing choice-making opportunities to individuals with disabilities, many people with severe disabil-ities are often denied such opportunities in their day-to-day lives. To illustrate, although work-related choices can affect job perfor-mance and overall quality of work life, peo-ple with severe disabilities—and particularly severe multiple disabilities—often experience few on-the-job choices in supported work (Everson & Reid, 1997). One variable that affects the frequency of choice making among people with severe disabilities is whether support personnel have the skills to provide meaningful choice opportunities. Consequently, one potential means of increasing choice making in sup-ported work situations may be to train <b>job</b> <b>coaches</b> in methods of providing choices {{as part of their}} ongoing work activities. Be-cause ample evidence indicates that simply training support staff in new work skills is not likely to result in consistent application Requests for reprints should be sent to Dennis H...|$|R
