40|$|The {{anatomical}} {{position of the}} mandible means that direct visual feedback is not possible. To clarify the role of visual information, several jaw- and finger-positioning tasks were designed, both in a 'free-movement' and an 'isolated' (arm or head fixed) state, {{with or without a}} visual <b>feedback</b> <b>display</b> of the target position. The subjects had to position the mandible or the index finger of the preferred hand on to a movable metal bar and to maintain a defined position coinciding with the target level provided on an oscilloscope screen. The position signal was tape recorded and computer analysed off-line. Digital filtering differentiated between the drift and the oscillations around the target (root mean square). The results demonstrated a lack of precision in the free-movement, finger-positioning task after withdrawal of visual feedback. For jaw opening and closing muscles, position control was less impaired when a visual <b>feedback</b> <b>display</b> was abolished. It was suggested that the efficiency of jaw positioning is not primarily determined by visual feedback. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Medication taking is a self-regulatory {{process that}} {{requires}} individuals to self-monitor their medication taking behaviors, but {{this can be}} difficult because medication taking is such a mundane, unremarkable behavior. Ubiquitous sensing systems {{have the potential to}} sense everyday behaviors and provide the objective feedback necessary for self-regulation of medication taking. We describe an unobtrusive sensing system consisting of a sensor-augmented pillbox and an ambient display that provides near real-time visual feedback about how well medications are being taken. In contrast to other systems that focus on reminding before medication taking, our approach uses feedback after medication taking to allow the individual to develop their own routines through self-regulation. We evaluated this system in the homes of older adults in a 10 -month deployment. Feedback helped improve the consistency of medication-taking behaviors as well as increased ratings of self-efficacy. However, the improved performance did not persist after the <b>feedback</b> <b>display</b> was removed, because individuals had integrated the <b>feedback</b> <b>display</b> into their routines to support their self-awareness, identify mistakes, guide the timing of medication taking, and provide a sense of security that they are taking their medications well.

40|$|In CG community, {{many kinds}} of physical-based (impulse-based) {{approaches}} such as Mirtich’s and Baraff’s ones have been proposed for showing dynamic animation. However, because they generate and calibrate only an impulsive force, i. e., an area of force distribution, the impulsive forces are not always precisely calibrated. Moreover, since they do not deal with any exact impulse (force distribution), they cannot be applicable for dynamic animation with simultaneous contacts between bodies and for tactile <b>feedback</b> <b>display</b> between them. In order to overcome such drawbacks, we proposed {{a new approach to}} generate an arbitrary impulse (force distribution) artificially based on practical time, and tried for dynamic animation with single contact between plastic puck and wall in an air hockey game.

40|$|Objective: We {{distinguish}} outcome {{feedback from}} control feedback {{to show that}} suboptimal performance in a dynamic multitasking system {{may be caused by}} limits inherent to the information provided rather than human resource limits. Background: Tardast is a paradigm for investigating human multitasking behavior, complex system management, and supervisory control. Prior research attributed the suboptimal performance of Tardast operators to poor strategic task management. Methods: We varied the nature of performance feedback in the Tardast paradigm to compare continuous, cumulative feedback (global feedback) on performance outcome with feedback limited to the most recent system state (local feedback). Results: Participants in both conditions improved with practice, but those with local feedback performed better than those with global feedback. An eye gaze analysis showed increased visual attention directed toward the <b>feedback</b> <b>display</b> in the local feedback condition.

This study discusses the effect of different levels of feedback—from minimal to use of a <b>feedback</b> <b>display</b> and coach—on PA over a 4 -week intervention period. PA was measured at baseline, during and immediately after the intervention. Participants (n = 227) were randomly assigned to a Minimal Intervention Group (MIG-no feedback), Pedometer Group (PG-feedback on steps taken), Display Group (DG-feedback on steps, minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity and energy expenditure) or Coaching Group (CoachG-same as DG with need-supportive coaching). Two-way ANCOVA showed no significant Group × Time interaction effect for the different PA variables between the MIG and PG. Also no differences emerged between PG and DG. As hypothesized, CoachG had higher PA values throughout the intervention compared with DG. Self-monitoring using a pedometer resulted in more steps compared with a no-feedback condition {{at the start of the}} intervention.

40|$|Semiconductor lasers with time-delayed optical <b>feedback</b> <b>display</b> a {{wide range}} of {{dynamical}} regimes, which have found various practical applications. They also provide excellent testbeds for data analysis tools for characterizing complex signals. Recently, several of us have analyzed experimental intensity time-traces and quantitatively identified the onset of different dynamical regimes, as the laser current increases. Specifically, we identified the onset of low-frequency fluctuations (LFFs), where the laser intensity displays abrupt dropouts, and the onset of coherence collapse (CC), where the intensity fluctuations are highly irregular. Here we map these regimes when both, the laser current and the feedback strength vary. We show that the shape of the distribution of intensity fluctuations (characterized by the standard deviation, the skewness, and the kurtosis) allows to distinguish among noise, LFFs and CC, and to quantitatively determine (in spite of the gradual nature of the transitions) the boundaries of the three regimes. Ordinal analysis of the interdropout time intervals consistently identifies the three regimes occurring in the same parameter regions as the analysis of the intensity distribution. Simulations of the well-known time-delayed Lang-Kobayashi model are in good qualitative agreement with the observations. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—An {{experiment}} addressing anomalous human/machine interactions {{utilizing a}} <b>feedback</b> <b>display</b> of two competing pictures, the relative dominance {{of which is}} controlled by a microelectronic random generator, has yielded a number of equivocal results. On the one hand, an ingoing hypothesis that such a visually engaging mode of feedback might facilitate larger anomalous effects has not been supported by the composite results of 49 operators performing some 390, 000 experimental trials. Likewise, a smaller ad hoc study of the relative efficacy of a subset of target pictures having religious or spiritual themes, although yielding effect sizes comparable with earlier random event generator (REG) data, has insufficient statistical power to resolve the question. Also, an attempt to assess {{the relative importance of}} the pictorial feedback, vis-à-vis the output of the REG, per se, in facilitating operator performance has not been definitive. Yet, certain secondary anomalies in these databases, such as gender disparities, individual operator performances, and serial position effects, show several characteristics akin to those previously found in other human/machine experiments in this laboratory. Whether these indicators can be used to develop more effective experiments of this class or to achieve a more fundamental understanding of the basic phenomena is the focus of ongoing research...|$|E

Twelve participants practiced navigation/browsing a state-space that was displayed via audio and vibrotactile modalities. We implemented the experiment on a Pocket PC, with an accelerometer attached to the serial port and a headset attached to audio port. Users navigated through the environment by tilting the device. Feedback was provided by audio displayed via a headset, and by vibrotactile information displayed via a vibrotactile unit in the Pocket PC. Users selected targets placed randomly in the state-space, supported by combinations of audio, visual and vibrotactile cues. The speed of target acquisition and error rate were measured, and summary statistics on the acquisition trajectories were calculated.

A circular crank experiment using the MIT MANUS robot was designed in order to test how well subjects can follow a set of simple instructions to rotate the crank at various constant speeds. 10 subjects volunteered to participate in this experiment.

The coefficient of variation (CV) of the velocity for each trial was computed as a measure of performance. Statistical analysis showed that speed significantly affected CV but the direction of turning the crank, clockwise or counterclockwise, did not.

The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize the effects of two real-time feedback displays on locomotor performance during four gait-based tasks ranging in difficulty. Methods Seven subjects with vestibular deficits used a trunk-based vibrotactile feedback system that provided real-time feedback regarding their medial-lateral (M/L) trunk tilt when they exceeded a subject-specific predefined tilt threshold during slow and self-paced walking, walking along a narrow walkway, and walking on a foam surface. Two <b>feedback</b> <b>display</b> configurations were evaluated: the continuous display provided real-time continuous feedback of trunk tilt, and the gated display provided feedback for 200 ms during the period immediately following heel strike. The root-mean-square (RMS) trunk tilt and percentage of time below the tilt thresholds were calculated for all locomotor tasks. Results Use of continuous feedback resulted in significant decreases in M/L trunk tilt and increases in percentage times below the tilt thresholds during narrow and foam trials. The gated display produced generally smaller changes. Conclusions This preliminary study demonstrated that use of continuous vibrotactile feedback during challenging locomotor tasks allowed subjects with vestibular deficits to significantly decrease M/L RMS trunk tilt.
