5|$|Egyptian {{vultures}} {{are mostly}} silent but make high-pitched mewing or <b>hissing</b> notes at the nest and screeching noises when squabbling at a carcass. Young birds {{have been heard}} making a <b>hissing</b> croak in flight. They also hiss or growl when threatened or angry.|$|E
5|$|Some species make a <b>hissing</b> noise {{while other}} {{cockroaches}} make a chirping noise. The Madagascar <b>hissing</b> cockroach produces its sound through the modified spiracles {{on the fourth}} abdominal segment. Several different hisses are produced, including disturbance sounds, produced by adults and larger nymphs, and aggressive, courtship and copulatory sounds produced by adult males.|$|E
5|$|Growling: Often {{accompanied}} by <b>hissing</b> and spitting, the cheetah growls {{to show its}} annoyance, or when faced with danger. A study showed that growls consist of numerous short pulses with a combined duration of up to five seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{seems to}} favor Chambers's {{description of a}} close working relationship between himself and <b>Hiss</b> during the 1930s more than <b>Hiss's</b> account of a casual acquaintanceship. This included <b>Hiss</b> subletting his apartment to Chambers without a formal lease, <b>Hiss</b> giving Chambers use of his car without transferring the title, and evidence that Chambers was in the <b>Hiss</b> home in 1937, a year after <b>Hiss</b> said he broke off contact with Chambers.|$|R

5000|$|In August 1948, Heiner {{was first}} pick for lead {{attorney}} by Alger <b>Hiss,</b> following allegations by Whittaker Chambers earlier that month that <b>Hiss</b> {{had been a}} member of the Ware Group Soviet network. <b>Hiss</b> wrote his longtime friend and attorney, William L. Marbury, Jr., to this effect on August 31, 1948. The letter documents that <b>Hiss</b> was trying to retain Heiner as of August 13 for his executive session with HUAC on August 16. By this time, Heiner and colleague [...] "Jerry Doyle" [...] had advised <b>Hiss</b> that their firm ("Cahill, Gordon") could not represent <b>Hiss,</b> as they faced possible [...] "conflict with another government interest." [...] As a result, <b>Hiss</b> had to scramble to find any lawyer to accompany him for [...] "Confrontation Day" [...] (August 25). <b>Hiss</b> managed to latch onto John F. Davis, an SEC lawyer in Washington (who continued long with the <b>Hiss</b> defense).) ...|$|R
5|$|Some species use {{vibrations}} {{for communicating}} within {{members of the}} same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug Nezara viridula. Vibrations {{can also be used to}} communicate between entirely different species; lycaenid (gossamer-winged butterfly) caterpillars, which are myrmecophilous (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way. The Madagascar <b>hissing</b> cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a <b>hissing</b> noise as a sign of aggression; the death's-head hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{report that}} Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains were considered, {{with varying degrees}} of seriousness, for the role of Frankenstein's mentor, Pretorius; others report that the role was created {{specifically}} for Ernest Thesiger. Because of Mae Clarke's ill health, Valerie Hobson replaced her as Henry Frankenstein's love interest, Elizabeth. Early in production, Whale decided that the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film's prologue, to represent how the story— and horror in general— springs from {{the dark side of the}} imagination. He considered Brigitte Helm and Phyllis Brooks before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband Charles Laughton to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success while Laughton had made a strong impact with several films including The Private Life of Henry VIII (for which he had won an Oscar) and Whale's own The Old Dark House. Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role. Lanchester modeled the Bride's <b>hissing</b> on the <b>hissing</b> of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while filming the <b>hissing</b> sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.|$|E
5|$|Dragon or serpent like demon {{connected}} with the wind, and thunderstorm and hail clouds. It was believed in the Gruža region of central Serbia that the ala is invisible, but that she can be heard— her powerful <b>hissing</b> resonated {{in front of the}} dark hail clouds.|$|E

Phroi and the fairies send Frogger {{to get a}} ride from <b>Hiss</b> {{as part of the}} fourth task. <b>Hiss</b> loves to play chase, and agrees to give Frogger a riddle if he plays and wins...otherwise, <b>Hiss</b> will eat Frogger. After the game, <b>Hiss</b> tells Frogger to follow his heart during his quest. He makes an {{appearance}} at Joy Castle after the final battle.|$|R
5|$|The video {{begins with}} shaky footage showing a figure mostly {{concealed}} {{in the shadow}} between two window-sized openings in a brick wall, through which leaves in trees can be seen blowing in the wind. These images are accompanied by indistinct electronic buzzing and <b>hissing</b> sounds. The figure holds their right hand to the window, signaling with three fingers, then one, and finally two.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum oxide {{is a white}} solid {{that can}} be {{prepared}} by direct reaction of its constituent elements. Due to the large size of the La3+ ion, La2O3 adopts a hexagonal 7-coordinate structure that changes to the 6-coordinate structure of scandium oxide (Sc2O3) and yttrium oxide (Y2O3) at high temperature. When it reacts with water, lanthanum hydroxide is formed: {{a lot of heat}} is evolved in the reaction and a <b>hissing</b> sound is heard. Lanthanum hydroxide will react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the basic carbonate.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or <b>hissing</b> bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
5000|$|In {{arguing for}} <b>Hiss's</b> guilt, the book {{presented}} no major new revelations about the case; the new materials tend to enhance Chambers' credibility and undermine <b>Hiss's.</b> Weinstein noted {{a great many}} points at which Chambers's story, or an assumption of <b>Hiss's</b> guilt, {{seemed to be a}} better fit to documented facts than did <b>Hiss's</b> accounts of events. [...] In his review of Perjury, George Will wrote [...] "the myth of <b>Hiss's</b> innocence suffers the death of a thousand cuts." ...|$|R
40|$|Plasmaspheric <b>hiss</b> is {{broadband}} ELF noise between 100 and 2000 Hz generally occurring {{inside the}} plasmasphere. It is proposed that some plasmaspheric ELF <b>hiss</b> {{is generated by}} ring current protons. The mechanism by which waves are generated is the anisotropic proton instability magnetospheric (APIM) <b>hiss</b> mechanism. APIM <b>hiss</b> (with a frequency close to the lower hybrid resonance frequency) is a loss-cone, flute instability arising from proton velocity space anisotropies. The energy driving the waves comes from the free energy of the 'inverted population' of the proton loss-cone distribution. The APIM <b>hiss</b> mechanism predicts the bandwidth, center frequency, source location, and wave normal angle of some types of plasmaspheric <b>hiss.</b> APIM <b>hiss</b> is suggested as a possible additional loss mechanism for ring current protons...|$|R

5|$|The {{black stork}} has {{a wider range}} of calls than the white stork, its main call being a chee leee, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a <b>hissing</b> call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E
5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and {{the skin of the}} {{head and neck}} is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals. The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few <b>hissing</b> or grunting sounds only heard when very close.|$|E
5|$|The female {{does not}} sing, but when on the wing, both sexes give a short cuick, cuick call, also used when chasing predators. Other calls include {{variations}} on a sharp chuck when alarmed, hisses given by adults when handled or chicks when disturbed, {{and an assortment of}} wuk, wuk, wuk, muffled oak, oak and murmurs given at the nest. Large young have a threat display with the mouth opened wide while <b>hissing</b> loudly.|$|E

5|$|These snakes {{do well in}} captivity, {{but there}} are reports of gluttony. Kauffeld (1969) {{mentions}} that specimens can be maintained for years on only one meal per week, but that when offered all they can eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always <b>hissing</b> and puffing when approached.|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual <b>hissing</b> sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained <b>hissing,</b> hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
5000|$|On August 5, 1948, Marbury took <b>Hiss</b> to {{the offices}} of Covington & Burling (where brother Donald <b>Hiss</b> worked) {{for a meeting with}} <b>Hiss</b> classmate (and Marbury friend) Joe Johnson, helped him prepare his statement, and then [...] "accompanied" [...] (i.e., not {{formally}} as [...] "counsel") <b>Hiss</b> before HUAC.

5000|$|Alger <b>Hiss</b> {{served as}} a legal {{assistant}} (counsel) to the committee from July 1934 to August 1935. [...] (In 1948, <b>Hiss</b> {{was one of several}} members of the Ware Group alleged by Whittaker Chambers to have infiltrated the Federal government on behalf of Soviet intelligence. Alone of those accused, <b>Hiss</b> was indicted in December 1948, tried twice in May and November 1949, and sentenced for perjury in 1952.) Most famously, <b>Hiss</b> [...] "badgered" [...] DuPont officials and questioned and cross-examined Bernard Baruch on March 29, 1935. [...] In 1947, however, Baruch and <b>Hiss</b> both attended the burial of Nicholas Murray Butler. <b>Hiss</b> himself later called Baruch [...] "vain and overrated Polonius much given to trite pronouncements about the nation." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{notice of}} Volkogonov's {{research}} became {{known in the}} West, inquiries came to him from Alger <b>Hiss</b> and his lawyer in the United States. In 1948, <b>Hiss</b> {{had been accused of}} being a spy for the Soviet Union. When <b>Hiss's</b> lawyer contacted Volkogonov to check the KGB archives for record of <b>Hiss</b> as a spy, The New York Times reported: [...] "Not a single document, and a great amount of materials has been studied, substantiates the allegation that Mr. A. <b>Hiss</b> collaborated with the intelligence services of the Soviet Union," [...] the official, Gen. Dmitri A. Volkogonov, chairman of the Russian Government's military intelligence archives, declared. He called the espionage accusations against Mr. <b>Hiss</b> [...] "completely groundless." ...|$|R
5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, <b>hissing,</b> growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{displays}} {{are made}} by insects including the praying mantises (Mantidae) and stick insects (Phasmatodea). While undisturbed, these insects are usually well camouflaged. When disturbed by a potential predator, they suddenly reveal their hind wings, which are brightly coloured. In mantises, the wing display is sometimes reinforced by showing brightly coloured front legs, and accompanied by a loud <b>hissing</b> sound created by stridulation. For example, the grasshopper Phymateus displays red and yellow areas on its hind wings; it is also aposematic, producing a distasteful secretion from its thorax. Similarly the threat display of the walking stick phasmid (Peruphasma schultei) is not a bluff: the insect sprays defensive dolichodial-like monoterpene chemical compounds at attackers.|$|E
5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as <b>hissing</b> pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
40|$|Wave {{propagation}} {{plays an}} important role in linking the chorus source in the plasma trough region and the <b>hiss</b> emission in the plasmasphere. We investigate the dependence of plasmaspheric <b>hiss</b> on the background plasma density, which essentially controls the evolution of chorus after its generation at MLT = 10. The variation of plasma density under study includes variation of the location and width of the plasmapause, and the variation of the density distribution in the trough. We demonstrate that the plasmapause shape does not affect the peak <b>hiss</b> intensity significantly, but it does regulate the <b>hiss</b> intensity near the field-aligned direction. As the plasmasphere contracts or the plasmapause width increases, the field-aligned component of plasmaspheric <b>hiss</b> become relatively more intense, as does the intensity of <b>hiss</b> in the inner region, although the peak <b>hiss</b> intensity remains about the same. The trough density distribution, on the other hand, directly influences the accessibility of chorus rays into plasmasphere, and therefore {{plays an important}} role in the peak <b>hiss</b> intensity. As the density gradient in the plasma trough increases toward the plasmasphere, the resulting peak in the <b>hiss</b> intensity can increase by up to 10 dB...|$|R
40|$|Narrow-band VLF {{electric}} field data at 300 Hz, 1. 5 kHz, 5 kHz, 8 kHz, 16 kHz, and 20 kHz received from ISIS satellites at Syowa station, Antarctica are compared with AE and AL indices between February, 1982 and January, 1983 for investigating substorm effects on magnetospheric VLF <b>hiss.</b> The telemetry coverage for ISIS satellites from Syowa Station is from about 80 ° to about 50 ° in geomagnetic invariant latitude. In geomagnetic quiet and weak substorm recovery phase periods, a narrow-band mid-latitude <b>hiss</b> and a broad-band polar <b>hiss</b> appear, respectively, at invariant latitudes from 50 ° to 63 ° and from 66 ° to 78 ° from the afternoon to the midnight in MLT. In substorm expansion phase, the polar <b>hiss</b> region moves to lower latitudes and approaches the mid-latitude <b>hiss</b> region, and also, a LHR <b>hiss</b> whose intensity peak latitude increases with decreasing frequency (from 20 kHz to 1. 5 kHz) {{appears in the}} mid-latitude <b>hiss</b> region near the plasmapause. Statistical study of VLF <b>hiss</b> shows that the mid-latitude <b>hiss</b> occurs most often in the quiet period and is independent of the substorm activity. While, the occurrence rate of polar <b>hiss</b> is 61 % in the substorm period (200 nT AL ≧ - 583 nT) and 29 % in the quiet period (30 nT AL ≧ - lOOnT).
