5|$|There {{were also}} three {{classification}}s for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, {{the times of}} the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was {{the team with the}} lowest total time; the Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team; and the Fair Play classification rewarded those teams that best avoided penalty points for minor technical <b>infringements.</b>|$|E

50|$|The National Music Publishers Association {{filed this}} {{copyright}} <b>infringement</b> lawsuit in the Southern District of New York on August 6, 2013, accusing Fullscreen of 4 distinct copyright violations: 1) direct copyright <b>infringement,</b> 2) contributory copyright <b>infringement,</b> 3) inducement of copyright <b>infringement,</b> and 4) vicarious copyright <b>infringement.</b> By way of explanation, the plaintiff suggested that Fullscreen 1) copied directly from another's work {{without a license}} (direct <b>infringement),</b> 2) contributed to and supported its partners' <b>infringement</b> (contributory copyright <b>infringement),</b> 3) is liable {{for the actions of}} its partners’ <b>infringement</b> and directly profited financially from the act (vicarious <b>infringement),</b> and 4) aided/induced the act of <b>infringement</b> knowingly.|$|R

5|$|Cardiff {{suffered}} an early setback when their captain, Paul Tito, was injured after nine minutes {{and had to}} be replaced. Ben Blair gave Cardiff the lead with a penalty kick before the 15-minute mark, but Leicester were then awarded three penalties in quick succession due to <b>infringements</b> by Cardiff. For each, Julien Dupuy elected to attempt a kick at goal, but was unsuccessful with all three attempts. Leicester's first score {{came in the form of}} a try from Scott Hamilton after 21 minutes, following a line break by Toby Flood, who then drew two defenders towards him before passing the ball to Hamilton. The try was converted by Dupuy, and a successful Dupuy penalty kick on 24 minutes made the score 10–3 to Leicester. Cardiff hit back with three successful penalty kicks of their own, one from Blair and two from Leigh Halfpenny, before Dupuy successfully kicked another penalty just before half-time to give Leicester a 13–12 lead at the break.|$|E
5|$|In 1092 {{and again}} in 1093 the dispute with Canterbury resurfaced, when Thomas complained about what he felt were <b>infringements</b> of York's rights. The first of these {{occasions}} was over the dedication of Remigius de Fécamp's new cathedral at Lincoln and the second concerned the consecration of Anselm as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas refused to consecrate Anselm if the latter {{was referred to as}} Primate of England. The impasse was finally resolved by naming Anselm the Metropolitan of Canterbury. The medieval chronicler Eadmer, Anselm's biographer and a Canterbury partisan, says that Anselm was consecrated as the primate. Hugh the Chanter, {{who was a member of}} the York community, stated that the metropolitan title was used. Modern historical opinion is divided, with Frank Barlow, author of The English Church 1066–1154 inclined towards the primatial title, but with Richard Southern, in his biography of Anselm, leaning towards the metropolitan title. The whole affair is probably subject to much duplicity and dishonesty, with both sides presenting biased accounts.|$|E
5|$|In 1867 the world's first {{football}} tournament, the Youdan Cup, {{was played}} under the rules. The tournament involved 12 local sides and was played during February and March. The tournament committee {{decided on the}} use of an off-field referee to award free kicks for <b>infringements.</b> The final took place on 5 March and was only the second football match to take place at Bramall Lane. A crowd of 3,000, a world record attendance, watched Hallam F.C. claim the cup by scoring two rouges in the last five minutes to win two rouges to one. The Sheffield Football Association was founded following the tournament. The 12 teams involved in the tournament were joined by Sheffield F.C. to become the founding members. The association adopted the Sheffield Rules without any changes. They were the first of several regional Football Associations that sprung up over the following decade.|$|E

5|$|Interest from {{military}} leaders for an airport at Banak returned in 1955. For {{the air force}} the main concern was {{that they could not}} reach the eastern-most parts of Norway from Bodø Main Air Station. This resulted in several Soviet <b>infringements</b> of Norwegian air space. Alternative locations were considered, such as Kautokeino, were there had been built a radar. NATO supported a reconstruction of Banak, partially raised by increased focus on flanking maneuver strategies, and also to serve {{as a part of the}} nuclear program. NATO was ready to provide funding in 1957, but by the Norwegian authorities wanted to delay its construction, citing lack of personnel to man the station and that it would not be usable in times of war. The government decided in 1957 to not allow nuclear warheads to be stored in Norway during peacetime, thus eliminating NATO's strategic need for Banak. The airport was therefore removed from the investment program.|$|E
5|$|Other awards {{included}} the Combativity classification, {{which was a}} compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Original general classification winner Alberto Contador won this award at the race's conclusion; upon his disqualification it passed to mountains category winner Stefano Garzelli. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. It was originally won, like the closely associated points classification, by Contador, and passed to José Rujano when the Spaniard's results were stripped. Additionally, the Trofeo Fuga Pinarello rewarded riders {{who took part in}} a breakaway {{at the head of the}} field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. 's Yaroslav Popovych was first in this competition. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical <b>infringements.</b> Six different teams– , , , , , and – avoided incurring penalties over the course of the race, and so shared in winning the Fair Play classification.|$|E

The registration process at Norid is fully automated and does not include any steps to ensure that the user has the rights to the name. Disputes regarding the right to a domain name are handled retrospectively, either through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee or court proceedings. Issues which could give the right to take over a domain name include <b>infringements</b> of the Trademarks Act and the Marketing Control Act. Trademark holders will also be awarded the domain if the registration was solely made to sell the domain to the trademark owner. The dispute bodies will also consider the risk of confusion, based on the domain name itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.|$|E

Capitol Records also mentioned that ReDigi also provided 30-second clips on their marketplace without authorization.

5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as <b>infringements</b> on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E
