5|$|Sameer (Salman Khan) is ill-tempered, with anger-management issues {{since his}} parents died during his childhood. When he beats up {{a group of}} goons who tried to assault his girlfriend Roma (Amrita Arora), she breaks up with {{him because of his}} temper. According to his <b>horoscope,</b> Sameer is unlucky in love. To escape further similar issues, he becomes a {{lifeguard}} in Goa.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Yeats {{thought his}} <b>horoscope</b> {{suggested}} {{a return to}} Olivia; he distanced himself from Maud and in June began to see Olivia more frequently. Pound was fond of Olivia, which may have caused Yeats some jealousy as when, for example, Pound met the two at the theatre and took them afterward to tea—an occasion when Yeats was extremely rude to Pound. A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to Georgie Hyde-Lees, her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.|$|E
40|$|Do people treat <b>horoscopes</b> as mere entertainment, or does reading <b>horoscopes</b> {{have more}} {{substantial}} consequences? Based on previous research showing {{the effects of}} expectations {{as well as on}} literature highlighting the influence of astrology on individuals, we hypothesized that reading positive versus negative <b>horoscopes</b> may affect people’s perceptions, emotions, cognitions, and creativity. Across three experiments, reading positive versus negative astrological forecasts increased positive interpretation of ambiguous events (Experiment 1, N = 195), cognitive performance (Experiment 2, N = 189), and creativity (Experiment 3, N = 193). Furthermore, positive (versus negative) <b>horoscopes</b> decreased negative emotions among people who believe in astrology and the effects of <b>horoscopes</b> on cognitive performances and creativity were stronger among people with a low internal locus of control. Opening newspapers and searching for daily <b>horoscopes</b> have more consequences than one may initially think, given the current demonstration that <b>horoscopes</b> influence people’s perceptions and cognitive performances...|$|R
5000|$|He refines and completes Morozov's {{analysis}} of some ancient <b>horoscopes,</b> most notably, the so-called Dendera Zodiacs—two <b>horoscopes</b> {{drawn on the}} ceiling of the temple of Hathor—and comes to the conclusion that they correspond to either the 11th or the 13th century AD. Moreover, in his History: Fiction or Science series finale, he makes computer-aided dating of all 37 Egyptian <b>horoscopes</b> that contain sufficient astronomical data, and claims they all fit into 11th to 19th century timeframe. Traditional history usually either interprets these <b>horoscopes</b> as belonging to the 1st century BC or suggests that they weren't meant to match any date at all.|$|R

5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana says: When Ravana {{wants to}} marry Mandodari, Maya warns him that her <b>horoscope</b> {{indicated}} her first-born would destroy her clan and should be killed. Ignoring Maya's advice, Ravana buries his first child by Mandodari in a casket in Janaka’s city, where it is discovered and grew up as Sita. Jain adaptations of the Ramayana like Vasudevahindi, Uttara-purana, and others also state that Sita {{is the daughter of}} Ravana and Mandodari, and is abandoned when she is prophesied to be the cause of the end of Ravana and his family.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance {{scholars}} commonly practised astrology. Gerolamo Cardano {{cast the}} <b>horoscope</b> of king Edward VI of England, while John Dee was the personal astrologer to queen Elizabeth I of England. Catherine de Medici paid Michael Nostradamus in 1566 {{to verify the}} prediction {{of the death of}} her husband, king Henry II of France made by her astrologer Lucus Gauricus. Major astronomers who practised as court astrologers included Tycho Brahe in the royal court of Denmark, Johannes Kepler to the Habsburgs, Galileo Galilei to the Medici, and Giordano Bruno who was burnt at the stake for heresy in Rome in 1600. The distinction between astrology and astronomy was not entirely clear. Advances in astronomy were often motivated by the desire to improve the accuracy of astrology.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{piece of music}} {{influenced}} by astrology is the orchestral suite The Planets. Written by the British composer Gustav Holst (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework of The Planets {{is based upon the}} astrological symbolism of the planets. Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order of the planets from the Sun. The composer Colin Matthews wrote an eighth movement entitled Pluto, the Renewer, first performed in 2000. In 1937, another British composer, Constant Lambert, wrote a ballet on astrological themes, called <b>Horoscope.</b> In 1974, the New Zealand composer Edwin Carr wrote The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment for orchestra without strings. Camille Paglia acknowledges astrology as an influence on her work of literary criticism Sexual Personae (1990).|$|E

5|$|In 1678, Ashmole {{stood as}} a {{candidate}} in a by-election for the Lichfield borough parliamentary constituency caused {{by the death of}} one of the two incumbent members. During Ashmole's campaign his cousin, Thomas Smalridge, who was acting as a kind of campaign manager, fell ill and died. Ashmole did not visit the constituency, and, as Ashmole's own <b>horoscope</b> had predicted, he lost the election. He also put himself forward {{as a candidate}} in the general election of 1685. Surviving documents indicate that he was the most popular candidate, but after King James II requested he stand down (in an age when monarchs were likely to interfere with parliamentary elections), Ashmole did so. On election day, all the votes cast for Ashmole, instead of being declared invalid, were declared as votes for the King's candidate, and only {{as a result of this}} ruse was the candidate favoured by the Court (Richard Leveson) elected.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{children}} of the king could be born inside the Inner Court. Every detail of the birth of the royal child was recorded, including the time of birth, which was to be used later by court astrologers to cast his or her <b>horoscope.</b> Ceremonies concerning the birth and the rites of passage of the child was performed within the walls of the Inner Court. The birth of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court's streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If the child was a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. The children would live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.|$|E

He performed well and was admitted to Cairo University's Qasr El-Ainy Faculty of Medicine in 1953. He continued in his studies until 1956, by which time Nasser had become president. During this period he also joined the National Guard. Together {{with some of his}} fellow students he founded his college's official magazine, which they printed through the Akhbar el-Yom publishing house. The magazine's first edition was confiscated due to an article Qandil wrote that was critical of university professors and regulations. Shortly after completing his final exams in 1956, Qandil was offered a writing position with Akher Sa'a ("Last Hour") magazine by its owners, the prominent journalists and brothers Mustafa Amin and Ali Amin. Mustafa employed Qandil with a salary of 15 Egyptian pounds and initially tasked him with writing the <b>horoscope</b> and a column that responded to letters from readers. Qandil was asked by Amin to serve as an editor for Akher Sa'a in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Sivaji, an Indian {{software}} architect, {{returns to}} India from the United States. He aims {{to establish a}} non-profit trust called Sivaji Foundation, which includes a network of hospitals and educational institutions that serve the poor free of charge. An influential businessman, Adiseshan, sees Sivaji as his competitor because he runs profit-making educational institutions and hospitals. Sivaji is forced to bribe the corrupt civil service, but eventually, the bribes demanded become so high {{that he has to}} mortgage his house and sell his car to pay them. When Sivaji goes to court, he loses the case filed against him by Adiseshan regarding the methods Sivaji had used to open his foundation as a result of bribing numerous government officials. Simultaneously, Sivaji {{falls in love with a}} girl named Tamizhselvi. However, upon asking for his <b>horoscope,</b> an astrologer warns that their union will result in Sivaji's death. When Tamizhselvi refuses the proposal due to her concern for Sivaji, he calms her fears and convinces her to marry him.|$|E
25|$|Western astrology {{is based}} mainly upon the {{construction}} of a <b>horoscope,</b> which is a map or chart of the heavens at a particular moment. The moment chosen {{is the beginning of the}} existence of the subject of the <b>horoscope,</b> as it is believed that the subject will carry with it the pattern of the heavens from that moment throughout its life. The most common form of <b>horoscope</b> is the natal chart based on the moment of a person's birth; though in theory a <b>horoscope</b> can be drawn up for the beginning of anything, from a business enterprise to the foundation of a nation state.|$|E
25|$|Most horoscopic {{traditions of}} astrology systems divide the <b>horoscope</b> {{into a number}} (usually twelve) of houses whose {{positions}} depend on time and location rather than on date.
