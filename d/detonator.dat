5|$|A {{modified}} Omega Seamaster Quartz Professional watch {{features as}} a major plot device {{several times in the}} film. It is shown to contain a remote <b>detonator</b> and a laser. This was the first time James Bond was shown to be wearing a watch by Omega, and the character has since worn Omega watches in every subsequent production.|$|E
5|$|Project Alberta {{still had}} three test assemblies, F101, F102 and F103, but the damaged F32 was unserviceable, so new {{explosive}} blocks {{would have to}} be flown in from Project Camel. There were also shortages of some components, notably <b>detonator</b> chimneys. These were fabricated on Tinian. Seven B-29s of the 509th Composite Group flew Pumpkin bomb missions on 14 August. Word that Japan had surrendered reached Tinian the following day.|$|E

5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion. After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical <b>detonator.</b>|$|E
5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical <b>detonator</b> had been used to initiate the explosion.|$|E

50|$|In civil mining, {{electronic}} <b>detonators</b> have {{a better}} precision for delays. Electronic <b>detonators</b> are designed to provide the precise control necessary to produce accurate and consistent blasting results {{in a variety of}} blasting applications in the mining, quarrying, and construction industries. Electronic <b>detonators</b> may be programmed in 1-millisecond increments from 1 millisecond to 10,000 milliseconds using the dedicated programming device called the logger.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Diagram of slapper and EBW <b>detonators</b> {{initiating}} detonation. (A) Slapper <b>detonator's</b> pellet or flyer impacts a wider area {{of surface}} on the explosive output charge, {{and even though}} energy is lost {{to the sides of}} the area impacted, a cone of explosive is efficiently compressed. (B) EBW <b>detonators</b> only initiate a single point, and energy is lost in all directions, making the energy transfer less efficient.|$|R
5|$|In the United States, {{polonium}} {{was produced}} {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project during World War II. It was a critical part of the implosion-type nuclear weapon design used in the Fat Man bomb on Nagasaki in 1945. Polonium and beryllium were the key ingredients of the 'urchin' <b>detonator</b> {{at the center of the}} bomb's spherical plutonium pit. The urchin ignited the nuclear chain reaction at the moment of prompt-criticality to ensure the bomb did not fizzle.|$|E
5|$|Later, Danny {{begins to}} date Ana Solis (Maiara Walsh), the fun-loving niece of Gabrielle (Eva Longoria Parker) and Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira). Gabrielle and Carlos overhear Angie and Nick {{fighting}} about their secret, which prompts {{them to send}} Ana to a modeling academy in New York for her safety. Danny follows Ana without his parents' knowledge. Angie and Gabrielle travel to New York to bring Danny home and Angie confesses her past to Gabrielle in confidence. Patrick tracks Angie back to Fairview, where he hits Nick with his car. While Nick is in the hospital, Patrick moves into the Bolen home and takes Angie and Danny hostage and forces Angie to build him a second bomb. He plants the bomb inside the house and activates it with a <b>detonator</b> from down the street. However, the bomb {{in the house was}} a decoy; Angie had planted the actual bomb in the <b>detonator.</b> Patrick dies in the explosion and Angie and Nick, still on the run from the FBI, relocate to Atlanta, Georgia while Danny moves to New York to be closer to his grandmother and Ana.|$|E
5|$|Black {{comes to}} in a {{hospital}} bed, tended to by his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher). She explains to him what has happened, and turns {{on the evening news}} to show him the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote <b>detonator</b> for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, PETN {{was most}} {{importantly}} used in exploding-bridgewire <b>detonators</b> for the atomic bombs. These exploding-bridgewire <b>detonators</b> gave more precise detonation, compared with primacord. PETN {{was used for}} these <b>detonators</b> because it was safer than primary explosives like lead azide: while it was sensitive, it would not detonate below a threshold amount of energy. Exploding bridgewires containing PETN remain used in current nuclear weapons. In spark <b>detonators,</b> PETN is used to avoid the need for primary explosives; the energy needed for a successful direct initiation of PETN by an electric spark ranges between 10-60 mJ.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} is {{a guide to}} explosives firing using exploding bridgewire (EBW) <b>detonators.</b> It details the special equipment and procedures developed in the Weapons Systems Division, Maribyrnong and currently in use in the Division's firing chambers and at field test sites, and discusses {{the relative merits of}} electric <b>detonators</b> and EBW <b>detonators.</b> It serves as a useful guide and reference document to both Firing Officer trainers and trainees...|$|R
50|$|EBWs {{have found}} uses outside nuclear weapons, {{such as the}} Titan IV, safety {{conscious}} applications where stray electrical currents might detonate normal blasting caps, and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries. EBW <b>detonators</b> are much safer than regular electric <b>detonators</b> because unlike regular <b>detonators</b> EBWs do not have primary explosives. Primary explosives such as lead azide {{are very sensitive to}} static electricity, radio frequency, shock etc.|$|R
5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote <b>detonator</b> could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E
5|$|The first {{investigation}} into the explosion, conducted by the U.S. Navy, concluded {{that one of the}} gun turret crew members, Clayton Hartwig, who died in the explosion, had deliberately caused it. During the investigation, numerous leaks to the media, later attributed to U.S. Navy officers and investigators, implied that Hartwig and another sailor, Kendall Truitt, had engaged in a homosexual relationship and that Hartwig had caused the explosion after their relationship had soured. In its report, however, the U.S. Navy concluded that the evidence did not show that Hartwig was homosexual but that he was suicidal and had caused the explosion with either an electronic or chemical <b>detonator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Almost simultaneously, an {{explosion}} devastated the north {{wing of the}} Bath Consolidated School building, killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers. Kehoe had used a timed <b>detonator</b> to ignite hundreds of pounds of dynamite and incendiary pyrotol, which he had secretly planted inside the school {{over the course of}} many months. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and used a rifle to detonate dynamite inside his shrapnel-filled truck, killing himself, the school superintendent, and several others nearby, as well as injuring more bystanders. During rescue efforts at the school, searchers discovered an additional 500pounds (230kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol connected to a timing device set to detonate {{at the same time as}} the first explosions; the material was hidden throughout the basement of the south wing. Kehoe had apparently intended to blow up and destroy the entire school.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>detonators</b> {{has been}} {{superseded}} by radio communications {{since the early}} 1950s. In November 2010, the Taiwan Railway Administration deployed 800 <b>detonators</b> for destruction on maintenance tracks. It received media attention, emitting sounds similar to the culturally significant firecrackers.|$|R
50|$|Defined by the Rule Book, when {{protecting}} a line {{for whatever reason}} (failed train, obstruction fouling the running lines), three <b>detonators</b> must be placed 20 yards apart. These signal an emergency stop to the driver. <b>Detonators</b> are also used to protect engineering works where the line remains open. The controller of the possession will communicate with the operative with the <b>detonators</b> as to when to place them on the track, or lift them to allow a train through.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to firing very quickly when properly activated, EBW <b>detonators</b> are safe from stray static electricity and other electric current. Enough current and the bridgewire may melt, {{but it is}} small enough that it cannot detonate the initiator explosive unless the full, high voltage high current charge passes through the bridgewire. EBW <b>detonators</b> are used in many civilian applications where radio signals, static electricity, or other electrical hazards might cause accidents with conventional electric <b>detonators.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ten of {{the eleven}} gliders {{transporting}} Group Concrete landed next to the Vroenhoven bridge at 05:15, the eleventh glider having been hit by anti-aircraft fire {{en route to the}} bridge and being forced to land prematurely inside Dutch territory. The gliders were engaged by heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, causing one of the gliders to stall in mid-air. The resulting crash severely wounded three airborne troops. The rest of the gliders landed without damage. One of the gliders landed near to the fortification housing the bridge detonators. This allowed the airborne troops to rapidly assault the position. They killed the occupants and tore out the wires connecting the explosives to the <b>detonator</b> set, ensuring the bridge could not be destroyed. The remaining Belgian defenders resisted fiercely by mounting several counter-attacks in an attempt to recapture the bridge. They were repelled with the aid of several machine-guns dropped by parachute to the airborne troops at 06:15. Constant Belgian attacks meant that Group Concrete were not withdrawn and relieved by an infantry battalion until 21:40. They suffered losses of seven dead and twenty-four wounded.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a <b>detonator</b> instead of a cap.|$|E
5|$|Timmy and his fairies {{return to}} the Blue Moon via M.E.R.F.'s escape pod to {{retrieve}} the second wand. A weakened Turbo Thunder reveals the second wand only opens underneath a secret cave, which contains magical wands and the final part of the cave prophecy: to find the ice wand. The group returns to Fairy World with the wands to free the imprisoned fairies before everyone heads back to Earth. The fairies arrive and use their magic to remove the Earth's metal casing. Timmy heads into space with the Destructinator following him; the Destructinator attacks him, which sends him {{back down to the}} Earth, at its north polar region. After Timmy tricks the Destructinator into inhaling the explosives, he reveals that he stole the <b>detonator</b> remote from him back in space and uses it to obliterate him.|$|E

Experimental work is under way using banks of capacitors as power sources for electromagnetic armour and electromagnetic railguns and coilguns.|$|R
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing of the critical <b>detonators</b> was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 <b>detonators</b> each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of <b>detonators</b> manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|R
500|$|The {{design of}} the Fat Man {{required}} {{that a number of}} explosive lenses had to be detonated simultaneously. After learning from Luis Alvarez that the Los Alamos Laboratory had encountered problems with the supply of the exploding bridgewire <b>detonators</b> required for this, Lauritsen found manufacturers in the Los Angeles area that could produce them. Alvarez ordered the <b>detonators</b> [...] by the thousand. They were used in the bomb, but most were expended in various diagnostic tests required to verify that the <b>detonators</b> and the lenses worked perfectly.|$|R
5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion <b>Detonator,</b> capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
5|$|The journalists quickly {{decided they}} needed expert advice on {{ballistics}} and explosives, to which end they engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, GC, a retired British Army {{officer who had}} served as a bomb-disposal officer in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Styles arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March, and immediately went to inspect the car park where Savage had parked the white Renault {{on the day of the}} shootings, after which he walked through the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members' most likely route. When asked his opinion by the journalists, Styles cast doubt on the authorities' stated reasons for the shootings. He explained to the journalists that, had Savage's white Renault contained a substantial bomb, the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs. Styles also felt that the potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote <b>detonator</b> on account of the buildings between the scenes of the shootings and the likelihood that it would be drowned out by other radio signals in the area. Finally, the journalists asked Styles to examine the scenes of the shootings, including ricochet marks that the soldiers' bullets had left on the pumps at the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot.|$|E
