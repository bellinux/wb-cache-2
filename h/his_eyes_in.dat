5|$|Montagu {{was created}} Earl of Salisbury on 16 March 1337. This {{was one of}} six comital {{promotions}} Edward III made that day, in preparation for {{what was to become}} the Hundred Years' War. To allow Montagu to support his new status, the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 marks a year. The money was provided from the royal stannaries of Cornwall. A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl {{on the eve of the}} warshe would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France. The story is probably a satire; the truth was that Montagu had already lost the use of one of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> a tournament.|$|E
5|$|Focusyn, {{the fictional}} psychoactive drug that is {{prominently}} featured throughout the episode, {{is based on}} the real-life medicine Ritalin, which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit serious, incident. A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen. The scene is a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the morning after the Chinese military forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's Tiananmen Square.|$|E
25|$|Indiana {{uses his}} {{knowledge}} of Shiva to defeat Mola Ram. In Raiders, however, he is wise enough to close <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the presence of God in the Ark of the Covenant. By contrast, his rival Rene Belloq is killed for having the audacity to try to communicate directly with God.|$|E
50|$|Abu Sufyan ibn Harb lost <b>his</b> first <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> the Siege of Ta'if. He told Muhammad of {{his loss}} for God to which Muhammad said “Which would you prefer: An <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> heaven or shall I pray to Allah that he brings it back?” To this Abu Sufyan {{said he would}} rather have <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> heaven. He lost <b>his</b> other <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Yarmouk.|$|R

25|$|A {{version of}} the modern Vision {{appeared}} in Earth X. Vision and the Avengers were fighting the Absorbing Man who had absorbed the intelligence of Ultron, giving him enhanced intelligence and better control over his powers. Vision watched as his teammates and wife the Scarlet Witch were slaughtered before <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>In</b> response, the Vision downloaded a computer virus into the Absorbing Man. When the Absorbing Man tried to purge the virus by shrinking and changing into stone, the Vision smashed him into pieces. In order to prevent the Absorbing Man from being reborn, the Vision had the parts of Creel distributed among various loners and reclusive super-heroes. When Tony Stark created a group of Iron Avengers, robots based on Stark technology and modeled after the deceased Avengers, the Vision was tapped as the group's leader. He would lead the Iron Avengers and defend them from such threats as the parasitic Hydra, Asgardian Frost Giants, and the Skull's invading army.|$|E
25|$|Round 3 – Ptolomaea: {{the third}} region of Cocytus {{is named after}} Ptolemy, who invited his {{father-in-law}} Simon Maccabaeus and his sons to a banquet and then killed them (1 Maccabees 16). Traitors to their Guests lie supine in the ice while their tears freeze in their eye sockets, sealing them with small visors of crystal – even the comfort of weeping is denied them. Dante encounters Fra Alberigo, one of the Jovial Friars and a native of Faenza, who asks Dante to remove the visor of ice from <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>In</b> 1285, Alberigo invited his opponents, Manfred (his brother) and Alberghetto (Manfred's son), to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests. He explains that often a living person's soul falls to Ptolomea before he dies ("before dark Atropos has cut their thread"). Then, on earth, a demon inhabits the body until the body's natural death. Fra Alberigo's sin is identical in kind to that of Branca d'Oria, a Genoese Ghibelline who, in 1275, invited his father-in-law, Michel Zanche (seen in the Eighth Circle, Bolgia 5) and had him cut to pieces. Branca (that is, his earthly body) did not die until 1325, but his soul, together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery, fell to Ptolomaea before Michel Zanche's soul arrived at the bolgia of the Barrators. Dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear Fra Alberigo's eyes of ice ("And yet I did not open them for him; / and it was courtesy to show him rudeness").|$|E
500|$|Hitler's vitriolic beer hall speeches began {{attracting}} regular audiences. He became {{adept at}} using populist themes, {{including the use}} of scapegoats, who were blamed for his listeners' economic hardships. Hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to his advantage while engaged in public speaking. Historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences, and of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> small groups. Alfons Heck, {{a former member of the}} Hitler Youth, later recalled: ...|$|E

500|$|Krusty's {{design has}} {{undergone}} several subtle changes {{since the early}} years. For the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Krusty's design was permanently enhanced and {{he was given a}} different shaped mouth muzzle and permanent bags under <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> order to distinguish him from Homer. In the episode [...] "Lisa's Wedding", which is set fifteen years in the future, Krusty's design was significantly altered to make him look considerably older and was based on Groucho Marx.|$|E
500|$|Erin McWhirter of The Daily Telegraph called George's {{character}} [...] "outrageous" [...] {{in response}} to the appendectomy. Former Star-Ledger editor Alan Sepinwall was critical of the character, saying he rolled <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> regard to her letting the interns perform procedures on her, sarcastically writing: [...] "Ooooh, she's damaged! And sexy! She takes off her top and then eagerly cuts herself for the other interns! That's hot!" [...] TV Guide Erin Lulevitch referred to her as a [...] "masochist" [...] due to her self-incision.|$|E
500|$|Olivier's {{dermatomyositis}} {{meant he}} spent {{the last three months}} of 1974 in hospital, and he spent early 1975 slowly recovering and regaining his strength. When strong enough, he was contacted by the director John Schlesinger, who offered him the role of a Nazi torturer in the 1976 film Marathon Man. Olivier shaved his pate and wore oversized glasses to enlarge the look of <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>in</b> a role that the critic David Robinson, writing for The Times, thought was [...] "strongly played", adding that Olivier was [...] "always at his best in roles that call for him to be seedy or nasty or both". Olivier was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and won the Golden Globe of the same category.|$|E

500|$|Luke is beardless and in {{his early}} 40s, [...] close to van der Weyden's age in the mid-1430s. His face is not idealised; he is middle-aged with light stubble and greying hair. [...] The room behind him {{contains}} his attributes including an ox and an open book representing his Gospel. He is painted with more naturalism than Mary; <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> particular are more realistically drawn. Christ's conform to the then idealised form, as simple crescents. Mary's are formed from curved lines typical of late Gothic ideals of feminine beauty. Compared to contemporary paintings of this type, the work is unusually free of inscriptions; they appear only on items in Luke's study, dimly perceived on his right: on a book, on an ink bottle, and on a scroll emanating {{from the mouth of}} his ox, beneath the small desk.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard's {{military}} career has attracted comment {{from a number}} of journalists and writers over the years. The claims made by the Church of Scientology were not challenged by some early writers; C.H. Rolph quoted without comment a 1968 Scientology biographical sketch circulated to British Members of Parliament in which Hubbard's war service was summarized, and in 1971 Paulette Cooper described as [...] "true" [...] the claim that Hubbard [...] "was severely injured in the war (and in fact was in a lifeboat for many days, badly injuring his body and <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> the hot Pacific sun)." [...] Others were more skeptical. George Malko attempted to verify Hubbard's [...] "revealing, anonymously authored, and totally unsubstantiated biography" [...] in 1970 but reported that [...] "I was unable to confirm a single one of [...] critical claims: that he had been crippled and blind, the nature of his 'discoveries,' and the medical records stating he had 'twice been pronounced dead.'" [...] His inquiries were frustrated by the Navy's refusal to provide Hubbard's service record [...] "without the written consent of the person whose records are concerned." ...|$|E
500|$|The protagonists in Argento's giallo films {{almost always}} suffer from vision {{impairment}} of some kind. It is these characters' chronic inability {{to find the}} missing pieces of a puzzle the puzzle being the solution of a murder or series of murders) that generally provides much of the films' narrative thrust. [...] Most obviously is the blind Franco Arno (Karl Malden) in The Cat o' Nine Tails, who must use his heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied {{to him by his}} niece to solve a mystery. [...] In The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that something seems to be [...] "missing"; as the film's surprise ending makes clear, he did not [...] "miss" [...] anything, but simply misinterpreted what happened in front of <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>In</b> Deep Red, Marcus (David Hemmings) has a similar problem in both seeing and not seeing the murderer {{at the scene of the}} crime, and does not realize his mistake until it is almost too late. This recurring theme, according to Douglas E. Winter, creates [...] "a world of danger and deception, where seeing is not believing".|$|E

500|$|Robey {{returned}} to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took {{a leading role in}} another hit revue, Joy Bells. Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: [...] "No, No, No" [...] centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and [...] "The Rest Cure" [...] told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of malpractice from his well-meaning friends who visit him. In the Italian newspaper La Tribuna, the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: [...] "Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We {{do not want to see}} either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> crab-like fashion from one side of the auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic." [...] Joy Bells ran for 723 performances.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to this angle, the IWA began hinting that Colón would be joining a heel stable known as [...] "Capitol Sports" [...] (borrowing the name that WWC used during the 1970s-90s), which in storyline was being covertly operated by González in cooperation with his [...] "business partners" [...] (a reference to Colón, Sr. and Jovica) {{with the intention of}} taking over the promotion. In a segment of their television show, the company ran a script where a surprise arrival was announced, which was promoted as [...] "a young wrestler [...] with a tremendous future in the United States [...] who has Capitol flowing through veins" [...] and with whom González had differences in the past that were overcome when he opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> (<b>in</b> reference to WWC's heel turn) so that he could [...] "complete" [...] an unspecified task in the invasion. The IWA further mocked Colón in a skit where Savio Vega dismissed this revelation, citing that he had video evidence of a match where Flash Flanagan (who was active in the promotion performing as [...] "Slash Venom") pinned him at OVW. This angle was concluded in a segment where González berated an unknown individual during a call for being unable to appear in a card, claiming that [...] "he [...] as mediocre as [...] father and brother".|$|E
