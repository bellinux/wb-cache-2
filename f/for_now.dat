Once she is with the Greeks, Diomedes is immediately struck by her beauty. Although she is not hostile, she cannot accept him as her lover. Meanwhile Calchas tells her to accept for herself that the gods have decreed Troy's fall and that she is safer now she is with the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} performed since the 1990s has extended {{the understanding of}} the relationship between different organisms. It is now clear the brachiopods do not belong to the Deuterostomata (such as echinoderms and chordates) as was hypothesized earlier, but {{should be included in the}} Protostomia (with mollusks and annelid worms), in a subgroup now called Lophotrochozoa. Although their adult morphology seems rather different, the nucleotid sequence of the 18S rRNA indicates that the horseshoe worms are the closest relatives of the inarticulate brachiopods rather than articulate brachiopods. <b>For</b> <b>now,</b> the weight of evidence is inconclusive as to the exact relations within the inarticulates. Consequently, it has been suggested to included horseshoe worms in the Brachiopoda as a class named Phoronata B.L.Cohen in addition to the Craniata and Lingulata, within the subphylum Linguliformea. The other subphylum Rhynchonelliformea only contains one class, which is subdivided in the orders Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida and Thecideida.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo.

I had proven to myself that I could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. <b>For</b> <b>now,</b> that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Joe McEwen of Sire Records {{began to}} pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr and Shawn Colvin to Sire, had been {{interested}} in them since hearing the Not Forever, Just <b>for</b> <b>Now</b> demo tape. At the urging of Gary Louris, McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums, and specified a budget of $150,000 for their first.|$|E

5|$|No Depression is {{the first}} studio album by {{alternative}} country band Uncle Tupelo, released in June 1990. After its formation in the late 1980s, Uncle Tupelo recorded the Not Forever, Just <b>for</b> <b>Now</b> demo tape, which received a positive review by the College Media Journal in 1989. The review led to the band's signing with what would become Rockville Records later that year. The album was recorded with producers Sean Slade and Paul Q.

5|$|Waddington {{licensed}} other editions from 1936 to 1938, and {{the game}} was exported from the UK and resold or reprinted in Switzerland, Belgium, Australia, Chile, The Netherlands, and Sweden. In Italy, under the fascists, the game was changed dramatically {{so that it would}} have an Italian name, locations in Milan, and major changes in the rules. This was for compliance under Italian law of the period. Italian publishers Editrice Giochi produced the game in Italy until 2009, having held a unique licensing agreement from Parker Brothers and their own copyright dating back to 1935/1936. As of 2009, Hasbro has taken over the publishing of the game in Italy, but have also, <b>for</b> <b>now,</b> kept the Milan-based properties.|$|E

5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable <b>for</b> <b>now,</b> stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E
