60|$|P. S. I {{have this}} instant {{received}} an answer from my freind Susan, which I <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> you, and {{on which you}} will make your own reflections.|$|E
6000|$|... 'SIR,--With {{this letter}} I <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> you another which, unaided by any {{explanation}} from me, tells a startling tale. I wish, however, {{to add a}} few words to make your delusion yet more clear to you----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 111. I cannot go on to-day {{with the}} part of my subject I had proposed, for I was {{disturbed}} by receiving a letter last night, which I herewith <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> you, and of which I wish you to print, here following, the parts I have not underlined-- ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the midst}} of {{pressing}} duties I {{have been unable to}} answer it sooner. In the meantime the Provost Marshal-General has had access to yours, and has addressed a communication in relation to it to the Secretary of War, a copy of which communication I herewith <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> you.|$|E
60|$|With {{my present}} views, I must decline to remove General Schofield. In this I decide nothing against General Butler. I {{sincerely}} {{wish it were}} convenient to assign him a suitable command. In order to meet some existing evils I have addressed a letter of instructions to General Schofield, a copy of which I <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> you.|$|E
60|$|Independently of this, I {{addressed}} a letter {{on the same}} subject to the Secretary of War, a copy of which I also <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> you. The Secretary has sent my letter to the Provost-Marshal General, with direction that he adopt and follow the course therein pointed out. It will, of course, overrule any conflicting view of the Provost-Marshal-General, if there be such.|$|E

6000|$|My dearest Isa, let us make {{haste to}} say that of course I shall be glad to let my book be used as is proposed. How will we get a copy to M. Fauvety? I enclose an order to Chapman and Hall which M. Dall' Ongaro[83] may <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> his friend, who must enclose it on to England, with a letter {{conveying}} his address in Paris. Then the book may be sent by the book post. Wouldn't that do? ...|$|E

I will allow you for your journey back to London and for your maintenance in Barchester for a week from this date." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{am afraid}} you will say I have [...] "wound about with circumstance," [...] when I {{should have asked}} plainly--however as I said I am a little maidenish or so, and I feel my virginity come strong upon me, the while I request the loan of a £20 and a £10, which, if you would <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> me, I would {{acknowledge}} and save myself a hot forehead. I am sure you are confident of my responsibility, and {{in the sense of}} squareness that is always in me.|$|E

60|$|Dear Sir,--With perfect {{confidence}} in you I sign the note; {{but is not}} Claughton's delay very strange? let us take care what we are about. I answered his letter, which I <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> you, very cautiously; the wines and China, etc., I will not demur much upon; but the vase and cup (not the skull cup) and some little coffee things brought from the East, or made {{for the purpose of}} containing relics brought from thence, I will not part with, and if he refuses to ratify, I will take such steps as the Law will allow on the form of the contract for compelling him to ratify it.|$|E
60|$|Possessed of this {{unexpected}} wealth, his first act was to <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> honest John Browdie {{the amount of}} his friendly loan, which he accompanied with many expressions of gratitude and esteem, and many cordial wishes for his matrimonial happiness. To Newman Noggs he forwarded {{one half of the}} sum he had realised, entreating him to take an opportunity of handing it to Kate in secret, and conveying to her the warmest assurances of his love and affection. He made no mention {{of the way in which}} he had employed himself; merely informing Newman that a letter addressed to him under his assumed name at the Post Office, Portsmouth, would readily find him, and entreating that worthy friend to write full particulars of the situation of his mother and sister, and an account of all the grand things that Ralph Nickleby had done for them since his departure from London.|$|E
60|$|Creatures {{were in the}} field: one, three, six: creatures {{were moving}} in the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as india-rubber. The malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they moved hither and thither, {{trailing}} their long tails behind them. A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly their old bony faces. One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat, another complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips as they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling {{closer and closer to}} <b>enclose,</b> <b>to</b> enclose, soft language issuing from their lips, their long swishing tails besmeared with stale shite, thrusting upwards their terrific faces...|$|E

[...] "The purport of them was to desire That I would take no farther notice of what had happened, and that the King of Prussia desired I would come and dine with him next day."--Engaged otherwise, your Majesty, next day!" [...] The Answer to these Letters I also <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> your Lordship,"--reader not to be troubled with it. [...] "I excused myself from dining with the King of Prussia, not {{thinking}} myself at liberty to appear any more at Court till I received his Majesty's," [...] my own King's, [...] "commands, and told General Borck that I looked upon myself as indispensably obliged to acquaint the King my Master with everything that had passed, it being to no purpose to think of concealing it, since the thing was already become public, and would soon be known in all the Courts of Europe.|$|E
60|$|My dear Catherine,--Unluckily I was {{confined}} to my room when your last letter came, by a cold which affected my eyes so much as to prevent my reading it myself, so I could not refuse Your father when he offered to read it to me, by which means he became acquainted, to my great vexation, with all your fears about your brother. I had intended to write to Reginald myself {{as soon as my}} eyes would let me, to point out, as well as I could, the danger of an intimate acquaintance, with so artful a woman as Lady Susan, to a young man of his age, and high expectations. I meant, moreover, to have reminded him of our being quite alone now, and very much in need of him to keep up our spirits these long winter evenings. Whether it would have done any good can never be settled now, but I am excessively vexed that Sir Reginald should know anything of a matter which we foresaw would make him so uneasy. He caught all your fears the moment he had read your letter, and I am sure he has not had the business out of his head since. He wrote by the same post to Reginald a long letter full of it all, and particularly asking an explanation of what he may have heard from Lady Susan to contradict the late shocking reports. His answer came this morning, which I shall <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> you, as I think you will like to see it. I wish it was more satisfactory; but it seems written with such a determination to think well of Lady Susan, that his assurances as to marriage, &c., do not set my heart at ease. I say all I can, however, to satisfy your father, and he is certainly less uneasy since Reginald's letter. How provoking it is, my dear Catherine, that this unwelcome guest of yours should not only prevent our meeting this Christmas, but be the occasion of so much vexation and trouble! Kiss the dear children for me.|$|E
60|$|Joe(2) {{will give}} you an account of me till I got into the boat; after which the rogues made a new bargain, and forced me to give them two crowns, and talked as if we should not be able to {{overtake}} any ship: but in half an hour we got to the yacht; for the ships lay by (to) wait for my Lord Lieutenant's steward. We made our voyage in fifteen hours just. Last night I came to this town, and shall leave it, I believe, on Monday. The first man I met in Chester was Dr. Raymond.(3) He and Mrs. Raymond were here about levying a fine, in order to have power to sell their estate. They have found everything answer very well. They both desire to present their humble services to you: they do not think of Ireland till next year. I got a fall off my horse, riding here from Parkgate,(4) but no hurt; the horse understanding falls very well, and lying quietly till I get up. My duty to the Bishop of Clogher.(5) I saw him returning from Dunleary; but he saw not me. I take it ill he was not at Convocation, and that I have not his name to my powers.(6) I beg you will hold your resolution of going to Trim, and riding there as much as you can. Let the Bishop of Clogher remind the Bishop of Killala(7) to send me a letter, with one enclosed to the Bishop of Lichfield.(8) Let all who write to me, <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> Richard Steele, Esq., at his office at the Cockpit, near Whitehall.(9) But not MD; I will pay for their letters at St. James's Coffee-house,(10) that I may have them the sooner. My Lord Mountjoy(11) is now in the humour that we should begin our journey this afternoon; so that I have stole here again to finish this letter, which must be short or long accordingly. I write this post to Mrs. Wesley,(12) and will tell her, that I have taken care she may have her bill of one hundred and fifteen pounds whenever she pleases to send for it; and in that case I desire you will send it her enclosed and sealed, and have it ready so, in case she should send for it: otherwise keep it. I will say no more till I hear whether I go to-day or no: if I do, the letter is almost at an end. My cozen Abigail is grown prodigiously old. God Almighty bless poo dee richar MD; and, for God's sake, be merry, and get oo health. I am perfectly resolved to return as soon as I have done my commission, whether it succeeds or no. I never went to England with so little desire in my life. If Mrs. Curry(13) makes any difficulty about the lodgings, I will quit them and pay her from July 9 last, and Mrs. Brent(14) must write to Parvisol(15) with orders accordingly. The post is come from London, and just going out; so I have only time to pray God to bless poor richr MD FW FW MD MD ME ME ME.|$|E

5000|$|... a {{concentrated}} {{representation of the}} restructured spatiality of the late capitalist city: fragmented and fragmenting, homogeneous and homogenizing, divertingly packaged yet curiously incomprehensible, seemingly open in presenting itself to view but constantly pressing to <b>enclose,</b> <b>to</b> compartmentalize, to circumscribe, to incarcerate. Everything imaginable appears to be available in this micro-urb but real places are difficult to find, its spaces confuse an effective cognitive mapping, its pastiche of superficial reflections bewilder co-ordination and encourage submission instead. Entry by land is forbidding to those who carelessly walk but entrance is nevertheless encouraged at many different levels. Once inside, however, it becomes daunting to get out again without bureaucratic assistance. In so many ways, its architecture recapitulates and reflects the sprawling manufactured spaces of Los Angeles.|$|E
5000|$|On March 25, 1777, General Howe and {{his brother}} Lord Howe wrote to Lord George Germain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, [...] "My Lord, We have the honor to <b>enclose</b> <b>to</b> your Lordship {{a state of the}} Declarations subscribed in {{consequence}} of our Proclamation of the 30th of November. 'Although none of the Leaders, nor principal Instigators and Abettors of the Rebellion, thought fit to avail themselves of the opportunity given them to return to their Duty', we have some satisfaction in observing that so considerable a number of His Majesty's deluded Subjects, of inferior Rank, in those Provinces where the Proclamation could be expect to have Effect, were disposed to relinquish the unjust Cause they had been once induced to support." [...] 4,836 declarations were subscribed but Stockton, as a Signer of the Declaration of Independence and a leading rebel, never did, according to General Howe.|$|E
