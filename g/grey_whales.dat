5|$|Whaling {{decreased}} substantially after 1946 when, {{in response}} to the steep decline in whale populations, the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country; this excluded aboriginal groups up until 2004. As of 2015, aboriginal communities are allowed to take 280 bowhead whales off Alaska and two from the western coast of Greenland, 620 <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> off Washington state, three common minke whales off the eastern coast of Greenland and 178 on their western coast, 10 fin whales from the west coast of Greenland, nine humpback whales from the west coast of Greenland and 20 off St. Vincent and the Grenadines each year. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting, but the North Atlantic population is functionally extinct. Conversely, the North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched across the North Atlantic, and only remains in small fragments along the coast of Canada, Greenland, and is considered functionally extinct along the European coastline.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly hunted sperm whales and right whales, with catches of up to 39,000 right whales by Americans alone. By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American whaling industry. Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic right whales, sperm whales, which were mainly hunted by Americans, bowhead whales, which were mainly hunted by the Dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and <b>grey</b> <b>whales.</b> The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a record of rather {{aggressive}} interspecies interactions between a right whale and a pod of <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> off California, making it the only record of possible interspecies aggression among baleen whales, but there {{have been a}}n observation of social behaviors between the two species on Sakhalin. Furthermore, there is no decent population of <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> existing outside of North Pacific as of 2014, therefore extents of interspecies competitions, if ever happened, or peaceful habitat sharing between these coastal species, prior to whaling, are unknown. A theory of humpback whales to invade and become a dominant species over Hawaiian islands, former wintering ground for right whales, in the past few centuries, corresponding with the timing of right whale hunts across the Pacific Ocean, had been claimed as well.|$|E
50|$|Pentewan {{was likely}} once the {{breeding}} {{site for the}} extinct in the Atlantic <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> (Eschrichtius robustus) as 2 of the 7 European <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> fossils were found here. The <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> prefers shallow seas and the shallow seas over the continental shelf of the South Western Approaches {{is one of the}} widest in north-western Europe. It is possible that the <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> will soon again breed near Pentewan. The first <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> to be seen in the Atlantic in centuries was sighted in 2010. The Northwest Passage was then ice-free and so apparently a <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> from the Pacific Ocean made it to Europe. More whales are likely to follow. In 2005 it was proposed to reintroduce them to Pentewan, which would likely attract throngs of tourists to the beaches during the summer breeding season.|$|R

Occasionally, Steller sea lions haul out on St. Paul, but usually take refuge in the rookery at Walrus Island, some 10 miles northeast of St. Paul. On extremely rare occasions, <b>grey</b> <b>whales,</b> orcas, and walrus are observed offshore.|$|E
25|$|Gulls {{have only}} a limited ability to dive below the water to feed on deeper prey. To obtain prey from deeper down, many species of gulls feed in {{association}} with other animals, where marine hunters drive prey to the surface when hunting. Examples of such associations include four species of gulls feeding around plumes of mud brought to the surface by feeding <b>grey</b> <b>whales,</b> and also between orcas (largest dolphin species) and kelp gulls (and other seabirds).|$|E
25|$|Cetaceans in Baltic Sea {{have been}} {{monitored}} by the ASCOBANS. Critically endangered populations of Atlantic white-sided dolphins and harbor porpoises inhabit the sea where white-colored porpoises have been recorded, and occasionally oceanic and out-of-range species such as minke whales, bottlenose dolphins, beluga whales, orcas, and beaked whales visit the waters. In recent years, very small, but with increasing rates, fin whales and humpback whales migrate into Baltic sea including mother and calf pair. Now extinct Atlantic <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> (remains found from Gräsö along Bothnian Sea/southern Bothnian Gulf and Ystad) and eastern population of North Atlantic right whales that is facing functional extinction once migrated into Baltic Sea.|$|E

25|$|The {{most dynamic}} {{aspect of the}} economy is tourism, with a number of natural {{resources}} which are apt for this purpose, such as the <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> that come to the area to breed and the natural rock arch at Land’s End is frequently photographed. Tourist attractions are divided into three regions: north (Guerrero Negro to Ciudad Constitución), center (La Paz to Todos Santos) and south (Los Barriles to Cabo San Lucas). There are two main resort areas, Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo, both in the southern tip of the peninsula. A highway known as the Corridor links the two towns. Other attractions include deep sea fishing, golf, tennis, motorcycling, scuba diving and snorkeling, with windsurfing at Medano Beach and surfing at Todos Santos, Pescadero East Cape and Scorpion Bay.|$|E
500|$|Aquariums {{have tried}} housing {{other species of}} whales in captivity. The success of belugas turned {{attention}} to maintaining their relative, the narwhal, in captivity. However, in repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, all narwhals kept in captivity died within months. A pair of pygmy right whales were retained in an enclosed area (with nets); they were eventually released in South Africa. There was one attempt to keep a stranded Sowerby's beaked whale calf in captivity; the calf rammed into the tank wall, breaking its rostrum, which resulted in death. It was thought that Sowerby's beaked whale evolved to swim fast in a straight line, and a [...] tank was not big enough. There have been attempts to keep baleen whales in captivity. There were three attempts to keep <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> in captivity. Gigi was a grey whale calf that died in transport. Gigi II was another grey whale calf that was captured in the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, and was transported to SeaWorld. The [...] calf was a popular attraction, and behaved normally, despite being separated from his mother. A year later, the [...] whale grew too big to keep in captivity and was released; {{it was the first}} of two <b>grey</b> <b>whales,</b> the other being another grey whale calf named JJ, to successfully be kept in captivity. There were three attempts to keep minke whales in captivity in Japan. They were kept in a tidal pool with a sea-gate at the Izu Mito Sea Paradise. Another, unsuccessful, attempt was made by the U.S. [...] One stranded humpback whale calf was kept in captivity for rehabilitation, but died days later.|$|E
500|$|Mysticetes {{are also}} known as baleen whales. They have a pair of {{blowholes}} side-by-side and lack teeth, which renders them incapable of catching larger prey; they instead have baleen plates which is a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, which they use to filter plankton and other food from the water; this forces them to follow krill or plankton migrations. Some whales, such as the humpback, reside in the polar regions where they feed on a reliable source of schooling fish and krill. These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as the pressure increases. [...] Mysticetes consist of four families: rorquals (balaenopterids), cetotheriids, right whales (balaenids), and <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> (eschrichtiids).|$|E
