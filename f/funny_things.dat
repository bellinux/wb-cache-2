500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning rated the episode an 8 out of 10, saying it [...] "gave all {{the main characters}} an opportunity to shine" [...] and that the episode [...] "delivered some great laughs and elevated some standard sit-com plots to a much funnier level." [...] He argued that Liz helped make the episode good. Though, Canning found Elisa's secret disappointing and felt that Salma Hayek's exit from the show too much like a conventional sitcom. Entertainment Weeklys Aly Semigran wrote that the episode gave good character revelations about Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth, but that episode did not exceed expectations from the previous week's episode, [...] "Jackie Jormp-Jomp". Writing for The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall reported that despite the episode not being a 30 Rock classic it [...] "had more than enough <b>funny</b> <b>things</b> in it to keep me satisfied." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that [...] "The Ones" [...] felt [...] "a little stock" [...] {{but that it was}} [...] "just pretty good." [...] He further added that [...] "" [...] gag featured in this episode [...] "was mildly amusing but a little obvious." [...] He felt that Elisa's secret felt more like a Soap opera secret than a 30 Rock one. Nonetheless, Rabin gave [...] "The Ones" [...] a B-. David Bauder of the Guelph Mercury, however, was complimentary towards Hayek's guest appearances throughout season 3, noting, that they are [...] "the best this absurdist comedy has to offer. Hayek throws herself into her role with gusto, matching Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin step for silly step".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning praised [...] "The Funcooker" [...] {{writing that}} it was fantastic and [...] "never felt like a moment was wasted or that a scene was extraneous." [...] He enjoyed all the storylines in the episode, writing they were interesting and funny enough, and complimented the way they all tied together with such ease. Canning enjoyed Tracy's actions writing that they fit perfectly for the Tracy character, and gave the episode a 9.6 out of 10 rating. [...] "Holy normalsauce, did I ever love this episode", wrote Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons. Her only complaint about this episode was Scott Adsit's absence. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was grateful that the episode focused on NBC, TGS, {{and the work of}} the staff. Sassone wrote that despite [...] "The Funcooker" [...] not being [...] "the most laugh-out-loud episode" [...] he believed it was still funny. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised Jackie Hoffman's performance, noting that her monologue in court was brilliant. He enjoyed all of the episode's storylines, except for Tracy's, which he opined fell flat. In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode a B+ rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall wrote that an episode like [...] "The Funcooker" [...] is [...] "really instructive about why a lot of other shows... haven't quite worked. Even when they have lots of <b>funny</b> <b>things</b> in them, they never really build to a climax in the way that this one did, as everything went wrong at once." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed Tina Fey's Liz in the episode, noting that her craziness worked well, but his concern was that when Liz loses it [...] "there's nobody sane for her to push against." ...|$|E

2500|$|In mid-1957, Garcia began smoking {{cigarettes}} and {{was introduced to}} marijuana. Garcia would later reminisce about {{the first time he}} smoked marijuana: [...] "Me and a friend of mine went up into the hills with two joints, the San Francisco foothills, and smoked these joints and just got so high and laughed and roared and went skipping down the streets doing <b>funny</b> <b>things</b> and just having a helluva time". During this time, Garcia also studied at what is now the San Francisco Art Institute. The teacher there was Wally Hedrick, an artist who came to prominence during the 1960s. During the classes, he often encouraged Garcia in his drawing and painting skills. Hedrick also introduced Garcia to the fiction of Jack Kerouac, whom Garcia later cited as a major influence.|$|E
2500|$|Newton-John {{recorded}} {{her first}} single, [...] "Till You Say You'll Be Mine", in Britain for Decca Records in 1966. While in Britain, Newton-John missed her then-boyfriend, Ian Turpie, {{with whom she}} had co-starred in the Australian telefilm, <b>Funny</b> <b>Things</b> Happen Down Under. She repeatedly booked trips back to Australia which her mother would subsequently cancel. Newton-John's outlook changed when Pat Carroll moved to the UK. The two formed a duo called [...] "Pat and Olivia" [...] and toured nightclubs in Europe. (In one incident, they were booked at Paul Raymond's Revue in Soho, London. Dressed primly in frilly, high-collared dresses, they were unaware that this was a strip club until they began to perform onstage.) After Carroll's visa expired forcing her to return to Australia, Newton-John remained in Britain to pursue solo work until 1975.|$|E
2500|$|The two met in {{the semifinals}} of the 1998 US Open, where Sampras was slowed in the third set by a leg injury {{and called for a}} trainer, and Rafter broke Sampras twice in the {{deciding}} fifth set. [...] Sampras's loss denied him the chance to match two records—Jimmy Connors' mark of five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles. Sampras cited a leg injury as the reason Rafter won, an attitude that upset the Australian: [...] "He really does say some <b>funny</b> <b>things</b> at the wrong time", said Rafter, [...] "We are out there busting our guts and he doesn't show a lot of respect {{at the end of the}} day. He tries to play down the reason why he lost, giving no respect to the other player, and that is what really upsets me about him and the reason I try to piss him off as much as I can." [...] Following Rafter's successful defense of his 1997 U.S. Open title by defeating Mark Philippoussis in the 1998 final, when asked about Sampras' earlier comments about having to win another Grand Slam in order to be considered great, Rafter replied: [...] "Maybe you can ask him that question, if he thinks that now. For me, I won another Slam, and it hasn't sunk in yet. It's very, very exciting for me, especially to repeat it". For his part, Sampras said about Rafter, [...] "When I see him holding the US Open trophy, it pisses me off." [...] Rafter responded by calling Sampras a “cry baby” and saying that it would be better for tennis if someone besides the American were No. 1.|$|E
