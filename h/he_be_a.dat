Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Speaker begins Sonnet 4 (quatrain 1) {{by asking}} his male friend why he must waste his beauty on himself, because nature doesn’t give people gifts besides {{the ones we}} get at birth. However, nature does lend {{to those who are}} generous with their own beauty. The second quatrain is about the speaker asking a friend, the subject of the poem, why he abuses the {{plentiful}} and generous gifts he was given, which are meant to be shared with others. Then the speaker goes on to ask why he vows to be a bad shareholder, using up what he has to offer but not able to care for himself or reserve his own money. One literary piece sums this up as the [...] "idea of miser versus money-lender". This is questioning whether or not he should loan money. [...] Should <b>he</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lender or should he keep from giving his money away, coming off as a miser. In quatrain 3, the speaker is trying to persuade his male friend to have children because he says that not doing so would be a waste of the man’s beauty. The speaker says that {{there is no reason why}} his friend should remain alone and let his beauty die off with him. Joseph Pequigney said that Shakespeare's sonnets have [...] "erotic attachment and sexual involvement with the fair young man with whom all of sonnets 1-126 are concerned". Sonnet 4 clearly is a part of this group and does indeed have some references that can be taken as emotional descriptions. The couplet suggests that the young man has valuable attraction that is not being used properly or appreciated.|$|E
2500|$|The Medical Act 1858 made {{it illegal}} for anyone not {{qualified}} in medicine {{to use a}} title that implied they were. This led to prosecutions of people making unauthorised use of the title"Dr". However, it also called into question {{the use of the}} title by licentiates of the Colleges of Physicians – all of whom were, under the new act, allowed to practice throughout the UK. In 1859, the London College reversed its earlier decision, resolving [...] "That the title of Doctor shall not be given in any official document issued from this College to any person who is not possessed of the Degree of Doctor of Medicine". This was followed up in 1860 by new bylaws that stated [...] "No Fellow, Member, or Licentiate of the College shall assume the title of Doctor of Medicine, or use any other name, title, designation or distinction implying that he is a Graduate in Medicine of an University, unless <b>he</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Graduate in Medicine of an University". In Ireland, {{the question of whether the}} license of the [...] Royal College of Physicians of Ireland granted the title of Doctor of Medicine led to a court case in 1861, with the conclusion that it did not. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) observed, however, that anyone wanting the right to the title of [...] "Doctor" [...] could gain it [...] "with a five-shilling degree of Doctor of Philosophy" [...] from abroad, or could simply assume the title, as only [...] "Doctor of Medicine" [...] was actually protected. Debate continued as to the use of [...] "Doctor" [...] as a courtesy title by those who did not use it by right as holders of doctoral degrees, with the BMJ noting in 1876 that [...] "We have again a sort of flood of letters for and against the use of the title of Doctor by physicians" [...] and in 1882 that [...] "There is not any other subject which appears to excite so wide spread an interest as this". In February 1876, a report recommended that the Royal College of Physicians should use the courtesy title of Doctor for all fellows and members, but this was rejected. Then in April of the same year, the College amended its bylaws to forbid any fellow, member, extra-licentiate or licentiate from using the title of Doctor unless they had a doctorate in medicine from a recognised university – closing the loophole the BMJ had identified. It was not until the early 20th century that this was reversed. In 1905 the Royal College of Surgeons passed a motion instructing their council [...] "to take the necessary steps in conjunction with the Royal College of Physicians to ensure that all persons who pass the Conjoint examination shall be legally entitled to call themselves Doctors". The council of the surgeons' College felt it to be impractical to secure the legal right to the title as this would mean gaining the right to award M.D.s, but noted that the title had been used by the public to refer to medics for generations and was used without any legal right by Bachelors of Medicine – the only obstacle to licentiates of both colleges doing the same was the prohibition in the physicians' bylaws. On this occasion the College of Physicians refused to act, but they did finally relent in 1912, removing the clause forbidding the assumption of the title of Doctor. This was described in the American press as [...] "the British apostles of red-tape have been forced to bow to the popular will".|$|E
