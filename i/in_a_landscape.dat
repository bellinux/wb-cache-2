5|$|Ski orienteering {{is a form}} of {{cross-country}} skiing competition that requires navigation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape,</b> making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard orienteering maps are used, but with special green overprinting of trails and tracks to indicate their navigability in snow; other symbols indicate whether any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four orienteering disciplines recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.|$|E

25|$|Arizona is {{well known}} for its desert Basin and Range region in the state's {{southern}} portions, which is rich <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> of xerophyte plants such as the cactus.

The state is less well known for its pine-covered north-central portion of the high country of the Colorado Plateau (see Arizona Mountains forests).|$|E

All off-road movement was virtually impossible because the wet and boggy terrain {{had recently been}} ploughed and planted with first shoots starting to appear. The terrain favoured defence with stones which had been gathered from the fields and piled up in heaps or laid out in lines at the fields edges, providing good cover for concealed enemy riflemen and machine guns. The wadis in the region were steep sided making crossing by horses difficult; the Wadi Amman could not be crossed except {{in one or two}} places.|$|E

25|$|Holistic and {{interdisciplinary}} {{approaches to}} the study of human disease have revealed a reciprocal relationship between humans and parasites. The variety of parasites found within the human body often reflects the diversity of the environment in which that individual resides. For instance, Bushmen and Australian Aborigines have half as many intestinal parasites as African and Malaysian hunter-gatherers living in a species-rich tropical rainforest. Infectious diseases can be either chronic or acute, and epidemic or endemic, impacting the population in any given community to different extents. Thus, human-mediated disturbance can either increase or decrease species diversity <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape,</b> causing a corresponding change in pathogenic diversity.|$|E
25|$|The style, form, and {{placement}} of the stations vary widely. The typical stations are small plaques with reliefs or paintings placed around a church nave. Modern minimalist stations can be simple crosses with a numeral in the centre. Occasionally the faithful might say the stations of the cross without there being any image, such as when the pope leads the stations of the cross around the Colosseum in Rome on Good Friday. The older stations can be an outdoor series of chapels <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape,</b> known as a Calvary, and are sites of pilgrimage in their own right. Examples include Sacred Mount Calvary in Italy, Kalwaria Zebrzydowska in Poland, Via Crucis of Valinhos, Fátima, in Portugal, Žemaičių Kalvarija in Lithuania.|$|E
25|$|Crop {{protection}} {{scientists are}} trying to develop rice pest management techniques which are sustainable. In other words, to manage crop pests {{in such a manner}} that future crop production is not threatened. Sustainable pest management is based on four principles: biodiversity, host plant resistance (HPR), landscape ecology, and hierarchies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> – from biological to social. At present, rice pest management includes cultural techniques, pest-resistant rice varieties, and pesticides (which include insecticide). Increasingly, there is evidence that farmers' pesticide applications are often unnecessary, and even facilitate pest outbreaks. By reducing the populations of natural enemies of rice pests, misuse of insecticides can actually lead to pest outbreaks. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) demonstrated in 1993 that an 87.5% reduction in pesticide use can lead to an overall drop in pest numbers. IRRI also conducted two campaigns in 1994 and 2003, respectively, which discouraged insecticide misuse and smarter pest management in Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|In 1785 Fitzwilliam {{had been}} {{depicted}} in a magnificent portrait in oils by the leading painter of the day, Sir Joshua Reynolds, President of the Royal Academy, an engraving of which, by Joseph Grozer dated 1786, is shown here. The portrait, with its turbulent sky, alludes {{to both the}} emotional turmoil the Earl had relatively recently suffered {{on the death of}} his uncle, Rockingham, and the political turmoil in which he had become embroiled following the dismissal of Fox and North from government at the end of 1783. Set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> background, it also alludes to Fitzwilliam's wider responsibilities, which extended beyond the Parliamentary debating chamber. As Ernest Smith has perceptively noted, 'Fitzwilliam grew up to be the typical eighteenth-century aristocrat – a man to whom politics was a natural responsibility due to his order, his family and his country, but not a field for the display of ambition. He was always fonder of the country than the town, of the local rather than the national arena. He saw his role throughout his life as that of leader of his local society and a link between the party and the public...Fitzwilliam's world...was that of the great estate owner.... Agents, tenantry, mortgages, leases and properties were his daily concern, and to these his life had in some measure to be dedicated.' The portrait of Fitzwilliam by Reynolds had been missing since 1920 and was rediscovered in 2011.|$|E
