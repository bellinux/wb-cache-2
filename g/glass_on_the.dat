5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of {{the season}} was first noted in the central Atlantic Ocean on August21. Slowly intensifying, the system initially moved towards the west. On August22, a steamship in the vicinity was sustained some structural damage. After attaining hurricane strength on August24, the system turned northwestward, and reached Category3 intensity on August 25 with maximum sustained winds of 125mph (205km/h) as it grazed Bermuda. Recurving to the northeast, a French cruise liner encountered the hurricane while it was a Category2 hurricane. A large wave struck the ship, shattering <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vessel and injuring 40passengers. Although still a Category2 hurricane, the system became extratropical shortly after on August28. The extratropical storm was tracked due east towards the Azores {{for a few days}} while gradually weakening before abruptly turning to the north and dissipating.|$|E

25|$|The Museum {{survived the}} Second World War with only minor bomb damage. The worst loss was the Victorian stained <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ceramics Staircase, which was blown in when bombs fell nearby; {{pockmarks}} still {{visible on the}} façade of the museum were caused by fragments from the bombs.|$|E
25|$|The Queen Anne {{elements}} on the house, {{influenced by}} the Eastlake principles, include: the ornamental iron fences, geometric squares and scrollwork, the etched and frosted <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main entrance, incised flowers {{on the porch and}} bay windows and the spindles lining the porch rails. In particular the ornamental iron fencework shows Eastlake influence in its medieval design.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{methods for}} {{controlling}} wind-excited sways are {{to increase the}} stiffness, or increase damping with tuned/active mass dampers. To a design by Arup, its fully triangulated perimeter structure makes the building sufficiently stiff without any extra reinforcements. Despite its overall curved glass shape, {{there is only one}} piece of curved <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> building, the lens-shaped cap at the apex.|$|E
25|$|Mihran Mesrobian {{retired in}} the early 1950s and lived in 7410 Connecticut Avenue in Chevy Chase, Maryland in a house he {{designed}} himself in 1941. The house is a two-story building made of brick and includes a pavilion that transforms into a porch. The front facade is asymmetrical with a wall of <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right and the front door on the left.|$|E
25|$|The west facade has a {{basement}} entrance and tripartite window, again with diamond-paned colored <b>glass,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> apse flanked by pointed {{windows on the}} pent-roofed sides, with another octagonal oculus in the rear gable field above where the apse projects. Below the apse the basement is mortared fieldstone. Windows, a main entrance and a secondary entrance {{on the south side}} are trabeated with brick.|$|E

25|$|On 24 October 2005, vandals broke <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> church noticeboard, but it {{was quickly}} repaired. In 2012 the church hosted an {{exhibition}} featuring local history. In 2013 St Roberts Church won the bronze Community Grounds award: one of the Harrogate in Bloom awards. In March 2013 there was a Red Nose Day tea in the chapter house, and local people played pranks, wearing their children's school uniform.|$|E
25|$|Exterior glass— The {{exterior}} <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{west and}} south {{sides of the}} building provides an aesthetically pleasing view {{of the river and}} downtown and also provides natural lighting. This feature proved challenging for those designing an energy efficient structure. They found a solution with a custom-designed white dot pattern on the glass and strategically placed columns to maximize views, minimize glare and reduce solar heat gain by 50 percent.|$|E
25|$|When Ruetten {{returned}} {{home in the}} evening, he found his garage door open and broken <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driveway. In addition, Ruetten discovered that the BMW he had bought for Rasmussen as an engagement gift was missing. Because of her morning plans, he found it strange that Rasmussen would have later gone out without letting him know. The house's answering machine had not been activated, despite both of them usually activating it when leaving the house unoccupied.|$|E
60|$|Walthew {{nodded to}} show that he understood, for it might be {{dangerous}} to use the telegraph gong; and then he disappeared below while Grahame stood still, steadying <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deckhouse top.|$|R

25|$|They were {{followed}} by Henry C. Lee on April 9, 2004. After examining the Jeep, he deduced that the shots were fired from the outside because there were shards of <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jeep's floor. But due to the incompleteness of evidence preservation, {{and the lack of}} an accurate record on the Jeep's speed at the day of procession, he pointed out that it might be impossible to determine from which direction the bullets entered the Jeep.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 1998, an F3 tornado {{struck the}} {{downtown}} area at around 3:30p.m., causing serious damage and blowing out hundreds of windows from skyscrapers, raining shattered <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets and closing the business district for nearly four days. Over 300 homes were damaged, and three cranes at the then incomplete Adelphia Coliseum were toppled. Though only one person was killed, {{it was one of}} the most costly urban tornadoes on record in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The Raghav Satsang Bhavan, {{popularly known}} as Kanch Mandir, is a temple with three peaks, along with an {{attached}} hall, built in 1987. The presiding deities are Rama, Sita and Lakshmana.

All the windows and doors of the temple are made in <b>glass.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> walls of the attached hall, the scenes from Ramcharitmanas are displayed in glass paintings, along with twenty-four incarnations of Vishnu as per the Bhagavata Purana.|$|E
6000|$|He came, {{and stood}} looking gloomily {{in from the}} doorway. He {{caught sight of the}} {{decanters}} and <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> library table. [...] "Oh!" [...] he said, and gave a laugh cut in two by a hiccough.|$|R
6000|$|Upon this, the {{landlord}} danced down his <b>glasses,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bar, uncorked his decanters, and deferentially pushed them over toward the sailors, {{as much as}} to say--"Honorable gentlemen, {{it is not for}} me to allowance your liquor;--help yourselves, your honors." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a large}} crowd, so {{they had}} some {{difficulty}} in making their way to where the man was located. In his haste, Dick bumped against a waiter selling lemonade and spilled the contents of two <b>glasses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|R
25|$|For the Game, the Gardens {{facilities}} were upgraded to use <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boards (in {{an era where}} wire fences were the norm), a point that fans complained about as {{the sounds of the}} checks were somewhat muted. In what would be another tradition, the defending Stanley Cup champions were presented before the game with various gifts that included sweater coats, golf balls, cigarette boxes, ties, cufflinks, pocket knives, watches and lifetime passes to Maple Leaf Gardens. All-in-all, the game was a success, with the All-Stars winning 4–3.|$|E
25|$|The chapel is a plain structure, {{built of}} gritstone with quoins {{at the corners}} and a slate roof. It has a small, {{hexagonal}} bellcote on the west gable. The side walls have two cross-windows with rectangular panes of glass and the gable walls have windows with small diamond-latticed panes of <b>glass.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> south side are two doorways with chamfered surrounds; over one door is a lintel dated 1703. At the north-west corner is a two-storey wing with a tall chimney stack, which was the school house. The building {{is surrounded by a}} drystone wall and the chapel's original cast iron gates survive.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reported}} incident of crime at the Anacostia station {{occurred during the}} station's construction. Three teenagers broke into the construction site on July 7, 1989; stole tools; and broke the <b>glass</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cab of a crane before being arrested. Concern about crime at the station led Metro to station additional transit police officers at Anacostia station {{in the weeks after}} the station's opening, and D.C. police patrolled the station's parking garage. Fear of crime {{was one of the reasons}} why Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes in 1991 which would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia station.|$|E
