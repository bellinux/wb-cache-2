40|$|AbstractThe {{nature of}} chiral {{interactions}} among chiral biopolymers, such as DNA, protein α-helices, and rodlike virus particles, remains elusive. In particular, a satisfactory model connecting molecular chiral interactions and {{the pitch of}} the resulting chiral mesophases is lacking. We report the measurement of short-fragment (146 -bp) DNA cholesteric spherulite pitch {{as a function of}} osmotic pressure, average DNA <b>interaxial</b> spacing, and salt concentration. We determined cholesteric pitch and <b>interaxial</b> spacing by polarizing optical microscopy and x-ray scattering, respectively, from which the twist-angle between DNA molecules can be calculated. Surprisingly, we found that decreasing ionic strength resulted in weaker chiral interactions between DNA chains, as evidenced by the decrease in the twist-angle, and consequent increase in the cholesteric pitch, for a fixed <b>interaxial</b> spacing. We propose that this behavior can be explained by increased smearing-out of the helical charge pattern along DNA as the Debye screening length is increased...|$|E
40|$|An alpha-helix and a beta-strand {{are said}} to be interactively packed if at least one residue in each of the {{secondary}} structural elements loses 10 % of its solvent accessible contact area on association with the other secondary structural element. An analysis of all such 5, 975 nonidentical alpha/beta units in protein structures, defined at < or = 2. 5 A resolution, shows that the <b>interaxial</b> distance between the alpha-helix and the beta-strand is linearly correlated with the residue-dependent function, log[(V/nda) /n-int], where V is the volume of amino acid residues in the packing interface, nda is the normalized difference in solvent accessible contact area of the residues in packed and unpacked secondary structural elements, and n-int is the number of residues in the packing interface. The beta-sheet unit (beta u), defined as a pair of adjacent parallel or antiparallel hydrogen-bonded beta-strands, packing with an alpha-helix shows a better correlation between the <b>interaxial</b> distance and log(V/nda) for the residues in the packing interface. This packing relationship is shown to be useful in the prediction of <b>interaxial</b> distances in alpha/beta units using the interacting residue information of equivalent alpha/beta units of homologous proteins.

Among these rules, the mechanical alignment of the two cameras has to be ensured as well as a proper choice of the <b>interaxial</b> distance and convergence plane. Against this background the STAN assists stereographers by analyzing and monitoring important stereoscopic parameters. An image based analysis reconstructs the scene geometry based on the left and right camera images, deduces calibration parameters and proposes a suitable <b>interaxial</b> distance and convergence plane in accordance to the depth structure of the scene.

We calculate the dependence of the interaction energy on the <b>interaxial</b> angle, on the separation, and on the precise alignment of the charge pattern on one molecule {{with respect to the}} other. We focus in particular on molecules with helical charge patterns. We report an exact, explicit expression for the energy of interaction between net-neutral helices in a nonpolar medium as well as an approximate result for charged helices immersed in an electrolyte solution. The latter result becomes exact in the asymptotic limit of large separations. Molecular chirality of helices manifests itself in a torque that tends to twist helices in a certain direction out of parallel alignment and that has a nontrivial behavior at small <b>interaxial</b> angles. We illustrate the theory with the calculation of the torque between layers of idealized, DNA-like double helices in cholesteric aggregates. We propose a mechanism of the observed cholesteric-to-columnar phase transition and suggest an explanation for the observed macroscopic (0. 4 - 5 um) pitch of the cholesteric phase of B-DNA.

The pair potential furthermore includes the amount and distribution of counterions adsorbed on the DNA surface. The interaction does not only depend on the <b>interaxial</b> separation of two DNA molecules, but also on their azimuthal orientation. The optimal mutual azimuthal angle {{is a function of the}} DNA-DNA <b>interaxial</b> separation, which leads to azimuthal frustrations in an aggregate. On the basis of the pair potential, the positional and orientational order in columnar B-DNA assemblies in solution is investigated.

40|$|A {{hexagonal}} {{liquid crystal}} of DNA fragments (double-stranded, 150 basepairs) with tetramethylammonium (TMA) counterions was investigated with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). We obtained the structure factors {{pertaining to the}} DNA and counterion density correlations with contrast matching in the water. Molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation of a hexagonal assembly of nine DNA molecules showed that the inter-DNA distance fluctuates with a correlation time around 2 ns and {{a standard deviation of}} 8. 5 % of the <b>interaxial</b> spacing. The MD simulation also showed a minimal effect of the fluctuations in inter-DNA distance on the radial counterion density profile and significant penetration of the grooves by TMA. The radial density profile of the counterions was also obtained from a Monte Carlo (MC) computer simulation of a hexagonal array of charged rods with fixed <b>interaxial</b> spacing. Strong ordering of the counterions between the DNA molecules and the absence of charge fluctuations at longer wavelengths was shown by the SANS number and charge structure factors. The DNA-counterion and counterion structure factors are interpreted with the correlation functions derived from the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, MD, and MC simulation. Best agreement is observed between the experimental structure factors and the prediction based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and/or MC simulation. The SANS results show that TMA is too large to penetrate the grooves to a significant extent, in contrast to what is shown by MD simulation...|$|E
40|$|Mirror {{cleaning}} for concentrated {{solar thermal}} (CST) systems is {{an important aspect of}} operation and maintenance (O&M), which affects solar field efficiency. The cleaning process involves soil removal by erosion, resulting from droplet impingement on the surface. Several studies have been conducted on dust accumulation and CSP plant reflectivity restoration, demonstrating that parameters such as nozzle diameter, jet impingement angle, <b>interaxial</b> distance between nozzles, standoff distance, water velocity, nozzle pressure and others factors influence the extent of reflectance restoration. In this paper we aim at identifying optimized cleaning strategies suitable for CST plants, able to restore mirror reflectance by high-pressure water-spray systems through the enhancement of shear stress over reflectors’ surface. In order to evaluate the forces generated by water-spray jet impingement during the cleaning process, fluid dynamics simulations have been undertaken with ANSYS CFX software. In this analysis, shear forces represent the “critical phenomena” within the soil removal process. Enhancing shear forces on a particular area of the target surface, varying the angle of impingement in combination with the variation of standoff distances, and managing the <b>interaxial</b> distance of nozzles can increase cleaning efficiency. This procedure intends to improve the cleaning operation for CST mirrors reducing spotted surface and increasing particles removal efficiency. However, turbulence developed by adjacent flows decrease the shear stress generated on the reflectors surface. The presence of turbulence is identified by the formation of “fountain regions” which are mostly responsible of cleaning inefficiency. By numerical analysis using ANSYS CFX, we have modelled a stationary water-spray system with an array of three nozzles in line, with two angles of impingement: θ = 90 ° and θ = 75 °. Several numerical tests have been carried out, varying the <b>interaxial</b> distance of nozzles, standoff distance, jet pressure and jet impingement angle in order to identify effective and efficient cleaning procedures to restore collectors’ reflectance, decrease turbulence and improve CST plant efficiency. Results show that the forces generated over the flat target surface are proportional to the inlet pressure and to the water velocity over the surface, and that the shear stresses decrease as the standoff distance increases...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-assembly}} of chiral biopolymer systems involves both intra- and inter-molecular interactions. The {{contribution of}} these forces to protein hydration and stability and {{their influence on}} DNA chiral interactions is investigated. The osmotic stress technique is utilized to vary water activity in solution through {{the addition of a}} neutral osmolyte, such as poly(ethylene glycol). ^ For the osmotic stress experiments, the osmotic pressure of the stressing solutions and its temperature dependence is needed. Since traditional methods, such as vapor pressure osmometry, static light scattering, and membrane osmometry, are not suitable for the concentration and temperature range of interest, a new method is devised using sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. We are using this method to measure the osmotic pressure of aqueous poly(ethylene glycol) solutions over a concentration range of 0 to 50 wt% and over a temperature range of 10 to 40 °C. ^ Hydration changes accompanying protein folding are investigated using the helix-coil transition in poly(glutamic acid) as a model system. Circular dichroism spectropolarimetry is used to follow this transition as a function of osmotic pressure, temperature, and pH. The energetics of the helix-coil transition allow the number of water molecules associated with the conformational change to be calculated. We find that osmotic pressure raises the helix-coil transition temperature by favoring the more compact α-helical state over the more hydrated coil state. ^ To provide a better understanding of chiral interactions between biopolymers, measurements of short fragment (146 bp) DNA cholesteric pitch and twist angle are made as a function of DNA <b>interaxial</b> spacing and salt concentration. The cholesteric pitch and DNA <b>interaxial</b> spacing are followed by polarizing optical microscopy and X-ray scattering, respectively, and the microscopic twist angle between DNA molecules then can be calculated. Increasing ionic strength results in enhanced chiral interactions as evidenced by the increase in twist angle for a fixed <b>interaxial</b> spacing. In addition, we have created hybrid liquid crystals of short fragment DNA and elastin-like peptides that exhibit a cholesteric phase structure and undergo thermal contraction upon heating. These liquid crystalline systems are useful in studying chiral interactions between biopolymers and potentially could be utilized as biosensors. ...|$|E

40|$|The deoxyguanosine- 5 '-monophosphate in aqueous {{solution}} self-associates into stable structures, which include hexagonal and cholesteric columnar phases. The structural unit is a four-stranded helix, composed of a stacked array of Hoogsteen-bonded guanosine quartets. We have measured by osmotic stress method the force per unit length versus <b>interaxial</b> distance between helices in the hexagonal phase under various ionic conditions. Two contributions have been recognized: {{the first one is}} purely electrostatic, is effective at large distances, and shows a strong dependence on the salt concentration of the solution. The second contribution is short range, dominates at <b>interaxial</b> separations smaller than about 30 - 32 A, and rises steeply as the columns approach each other, preventing the coalescence of the helices. This repulsion has an exponential nature and shows a magnitude and a decay length insensitive to the ionic strength of the medium. Because these features are distinctive of the hydration force detected between phospholipid bilayers or between several linear macromolecules (DNA, polysaccharides, collagen), we conclude that the dominant force experienced by deoxyguanosine helices approaching contact is hydration repulsion. The observed decay length of about 0. 7 A has been rationalized to emerge from the coupling between the 3 -A decay length of water solvent and the helically ordered structure of the hydrophilic groups on the opposing surfaces. The present results agree with recent measurements, also showing the dependence of the hydration force decay on the structure of interacting surfaces and confirm the correlations between force and structure...|$|E

The excellent agreement between the equilibrium distances predicted by the model and that experimentally observed in charge-neutral complexes as revealed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, shows that the spatial dimensionality of both the lipids and the DNA may not be a crucial point to capture the essence of the DNA-DNA interactions within charge-neutral lipoplexe...|$|E

Raman spectra, collected on the same collagen samples on which these forces were measured, reveal a continuous change in water hydrogen-bonding structure {{as a function of}} separation between collagen triple helices. The varying spectral parameters track the force-distance curve. The energetic cost of water “restructuring,” estimated from the spectra, is consistent with the measured energy of intermolecular interaction.

40|$|A hexagonal-lamellar-hexagonal (HII-L-HII) {{reentrant}} {{phase transition}} sequence on dehydration of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine occurs below 22 degrees C. This provides an unusual opportunity {{to measure how}} several structural dimensions change during this transition. Using x-ray diffraction, we have measured these dimensions with a hope of gaining some clue about the accompanying internal stresses. The principal dimensions described are molecular areas and molecular lengths projected onto the hexagonal lattice. In contrast with large changes in average area at the polar and hydrocarbon ends of the molecule, a position near the polar group/hydrocarbon interface is one of constant molecular area. It remains constant both as the monolayers curl from changing water content and in the transition from one structure to the other. In the L-to-HII transition, the most obvious change in molecular length is a 25 % decrease in the distance between aqueous cylinders, the <b>interaxial</b> direction. There is little change in the interstitial direction, the direction toward the interstice equidistant from three aqueous cylinders. As the hexagonal phase is dehydrated, a number of internal changes in molecular lengths are described. Increases in the <b>interaxial</b> direction are much larger than in the interstitial. Simultaneously however, hydrocarbon chain lengths decrease, and polar group lengths increase. It is likely that molecules move axially and the cylinders become longer with dehydration.

40|$|AbstractIn a {{previous}} communication (Kindt et al., 2001) we reported preliminary results of Brownian dynamics simulation and analytical theory which address the packaging and ejection forces involving DNA in bacteriophage capsids. In the present work we provide a systematic {{formulation of the}} underlying theory, featuring the energetic and structural aspects of the strongly confined DNA. The free energy of the DNA chain is expressed as a sum of contributions from its encapsidated and released portions, each expressed as a sum of bending and interstrand energies but subjected to different boundary conditions. The equilibrium structure and energy of the capsid-confined and free chain portions are determined, for each ejected length, by variational minimization of the free energy {{with respect to their}} shape profiles and <b>interaxial</b> spacings. Numerical results are derived for a model system mimicking the λ-phage. We find that the fully encapsidated genome is highly compressed and strongly bent, forming a spool-like condensate, storing enormous elastic energy. The elastic stress is rapidly released during the first stage of DNA injection, indicating the large force (tens of pico Newtons) needed to complete the (inverse) loading process. The second injection stage sets in when ∼ 1 / 3 of the genome has been released, and the <b>interaxial</b> distance has nearly reached its equilibrium value (corresponding to that of a relaxed torus in solution); concomitantly the encapsidated genome begins a gradual morphological transformation from a spool to a torus. We also calculate the loading force, the average pressure on the capsid's walls, and the anisotropic pressure profile within the capsid. The results are interpreted in terms of the (competing) bending and interaction components of the packing energy, and are shown to be in good agreement with available experimental data...|$|E
