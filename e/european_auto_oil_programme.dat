50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century Belgium {{had been one of the}} leading <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> industries with famous and technically advanced brands. But domestic producers did not grow and soon disappeared. At the end of the century Belgium became one of the largest <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> makers with an annual output up to 1.2 million from assembly plants of foreign brands. Its mainly export-oriented auto industry shrunk by half in recent years (to 500 thousand units) due to strong competition with imports from near and far Eastern producers.|$|R

50|$|Moretti Motor Company is {{a former}} {{automobile}} manufacturer that was based in Italy. It was founded in 1925 and ceased automobile production in 1989. Today, many of its sports car models can still be found at various <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> shows,. Moretti Motors produced a variety of models at various times including motorcycles, microcars, and several commercial vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|Originally called Fiat 127 Fiorino, {{the first}} version {{was based on the}} design of Series 2 Fiat 127 with the back being a van box, i.e. a 1.3 m tall [...] "high cube" [...] design, an {{arrangement}} subsequently emulated by several <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> makers. The platform is a stretched version of the Brazilian 147 with different rear suspension.|$|R
50|$|Development of the W Motors brand took seven years. <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> {{manufacturers}} Carrozzeria Viotti, Magna Steyr, RUF Automobile and StudioTorino {{were involved}} in W Motors's development. Initial investment topped US$13 million, some of which came from FFA Private Bank of Lebanon, who became a stakeholder in the company. W Motors founder Ralph Debbas has a master's degree in automotive design.|$|R
5000|$|The {{proposed}} new standard {{was more than}} triple the voltage of existing [...] "12 volt" [...] systems. The higher voltage was selected to provide greater power capacity for wiring and devices on one hand, and to stay under the 50 volt limit used as a guideline for electric shock hazard. The <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> manufacturer Daimler-Benz proposed a 42V brand name for the conversion.|$|R
50|$|After WWII Franco's Spain {{lagged behind}} main <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> {{manufacturing}} countries for decades. Only {{at the end}} of the 1970s it was able to produce more than one million vehicles and was 5th in Europe and 9th in the world. Then significant growth allows Spain to overtake the United Kingdom, Italy and achieve the 3 million output (for export partially), 3rd place in Europe, 6th place in the World at 2000. Since that time, due to East-European and Asian competitors on <b>European</b> market, <b>auto</b> exports from Spain have slowed and annual production decreased to 2.4 million, although Spain beat France and became the second auto power in Europe (after Germany) but 9th in the world.|$|R

Kirk Douglas starred as Gino Borgesa, a reckless Formula One driver, ensnared by speed, adrenaline, and a Hollywood 1950s romance. The movie was shot at several classic circuits, including Monaco, the Nürburgring, the Mille Miglia, and Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, with the climactic race at Reims-Gueux.|$|R

50|$|This barrier, {{also called}} a parking stop or a turtarrier, is usually made of {{concrete}} or recycled plastic and will normally be a horizontal bar {{to prevent the}} tires from moving forward or a vertical bar that may cause damage to the vehicle if contact is made. In a parking garage, the barrier will often be a concrete wall. The recycled plastic parking stops are more lightweight than concrete and will not crack or chip. This lighter version can be installed by one person and will resist <b>auto</b> <b>oils</b> and fuels and will never need maintenance such as repainting.|$|R
5000|$|From 2003-2010, Citroën {{produced}} the C3 Pluriel, an unusual convertible with allusions to the 1948-1990 2CV model, both in body style (such as the bonnet) {{and in its}} all-round practicality.In 2001 it celebrated its history of innovation when it opened a museum of its many significant vehicles: the [...] "Conservatoire" [...] with 300 cars.With the severe decline in <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> sales after 2009, worldwide sales of vehicles declined from 1,460,373 in 2010 to 1,435,688 in 2011, with 961,156 of these sold in Europe.|$|R

5000|$|Telematics auto {{insurance}} was independently invented and patented {{by a major}} U.S. {{auto insurance}} company, Progressive Auto Insurance [...] and a Spanish independent inventor, Salvador Minguijon Perez (European Patent EP0700009B1). The Perez patents cover monitoring the car's engine control computer to determine distance driven, speed, time of day, braking force, etc. Ironically, Progressive is developing the Perez technology in the US and <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> insurer Norwich Union is developing the Progressive technology for Europe. Both patents have now since been overturned in courts due to prior work in the commercial insurance sectors.|$|R

40|$|The authors examine {{management}} whipsawing {{practices in}} the <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> industry based on more than 200 interviews and a comparison of three automakers. They identify four distinct ways in which managers stage competition between plants to extract labor concessions: informal, hegemonic, coercive, and rule-based whipsawing. Practices at the three auto firms differed from one another and changed over time because of two factors: structural whipsawing capacity and management labor relations strategy. In the context of economic globalization, whipsawing is an effective means for managers to extract concessions, to loosen national institutional constraints, and to diffuse employment practices internationally...|$|R

2500|$|Press reports {{indicate}} that sanctions have caused Iran’s production of automobiles to fall by about 40% from 2011 levels. Iran produces cars for the domestic market, such as the Khodro, based on licenses from <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> makers such as Renault and Peugeot. The currency collapse has largely overtaken the findings of an IMF forecast, released in October 2012, which Iran would return to economic growth in 2013, after a small decline in 2012. An Economist Intelligence Unit assessment published in late 2012 indicates Iran’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) likely contracted about 3% in 2012 and will contract an additional 1.2% in 2013.

40|$|New product {{development}} nowadays makes heavy use of IT instruments such as virtual simulation tools. The main motivation for introducing virtual simulation tools in new {{product development}} is {{to speed up}} development and lower its cost. Virtual simulation tools, however, do much more. They introduce profound changes in the organization, including the nature of problem-solving, bearing the potential to increase new product development performance beyond cost and lead time reduction. Understanding these profound changes, we argue, holds the key to unlocking the potential of virtual simulation tools for improving new product development performance, including more innovative products. We support our argument with a case study from the <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> industry...|$|R
40|$|In the leasing {{industry}} the lessor faces a risk, {{at the end}} of the contract, in not recovering su ¢ cient {{capital value}} from resale of the asset. We propose a model to hedge residual value risk using the Gaussian copula methodology. After discussing residual value risk and credit risk modelization, a new derivative product is introduced and analyzed; the Collateralized Residual Values (CRV). The model is applied to an <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> lease portfolio of operating lease contracts pertaining to a major company. Our results indicate that the nancial product is easy to customize, and to implement through the contract characteristics and the level of correlation...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates pricing {{to market}} {{behaviour}} using data for <b>European</b> <b>auto</b> exports. The empirical analysis uses forward instead of spot exchange rates. Cross-country and cross-product analyses reveal that pricing behaviour depends {{mainly on the}} class of product, while the country of origin and destination appears as less important. Furthermore, the data do not usually reject the hypothesis of a symmetric response of export prices to depreciations and appreciations of the exporter's currency. Finally, although the point estimates confirm the combined influence of the business cycle and {{the direction of the}} exchange rate movements on pricing to market in most cases, formal tests seldom provide statistical significance for this result. ...|$|R
