5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding the First World War {{and the development of}} the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously by an electrical trigger which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells.|$|E
5|$|The Allies had {{confidently}} {{expected that}} victory {{in a major}} set-piece battle would compel LouisXIV to accept peace on Allied terms, but after Malplaquet (the bloodiest battle of the war), that strategy had lost its validity: Villars <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> avoid defeat for a compromise peace settlement to become inevitable. In March 1710, fresh peace talks re-opened at Geertruidenberg, but again LouisXIV would not concede Whig demands to force his grandson, PhilipV, from Spain. Publicly Marlborough toed the government line, but privately he had real doubts about pressing the French into accepting such a dishonourable course.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} probe, The Voyage Home {{required}} no new starship designs. The USS Saratoga, the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan. The Bird-of-Prey model from The Search for Spock was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for The Voyage Homes action sequences. The {{inside of the}} Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock, but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, {{rather than relying on}} ambient or rigged lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock, the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When The Voyage Home called for the return of Spacedock, ILM <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> reassemble the model from storage.|$|E

Allenby’s exact remit was still undecided when he was appointed.|$|E
25|$|There {{was already}} at that time a school of thought that stated that liberty and {{equality}} can quickly become contradictory: indeed liberty doesn't solve social inequalities since there exist some natural inequalities (of talent, intelligence, etc.). That school of thought considered that the government <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> protect liberty and to only proclaim natural equality, and eventually liberty would prevail over social equality since all people have different talents and abilities and are free to exercise them.|$|E

The flat bottom of the 962 Le Mans also fit with GT rules. Three more modifications were necessary to fully comply: Narrower tires than the 962 had run in Group C, a larger fuel tank (now up to 120 litres), and the reinstallation of a restrictor for the engine, although this one would be larger than the one they had run in Group C.|$|E
25|$|Custine {{had already}} been {{informed}} by the republicans among Mainz's inhabitants that the French <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> appear before the city to become its master. A civilian and military war council convened, to which were summoned the Baron of Stein, the Prussian Minister, Baron Fechenbach, canon of the cathedral chapter, Baron von Franz Joseph Albini, chancellor of the court, and M. de Kalckhoff, private adviser to the Prince Archbishop. These three dignitaries of the ecclesiastical court {{argued that it was}} necessary to defend Mainz, but the governor, the Prussian Minister and members of the Electoral body held a contrary opinion. In a final conference, the council decided to surrender.|$|E

The Bowring treaty in particular ensured that foreign powers would not intervene in Siam's internal affairs, and allowed for Siam to remain independent. The Bowring Treaty is now credited with having led to the economic development of Bangkok, as it created a framework in which multilateral trade could operate freely in Southeast Asia, notably between China, Singapore, and Siam.|$|E

25|$|Slave {{characters}} in general {{came to be}} low-comedy types with names that matched the instruments they played: Brudder Tambo (or simply Tambo) for the tambourine and Brudder Bones (or Bones) for the bone castanets or bones. These endmen (for {{their position in the}} minstrel semicircle) were ignorant and poorly spoken, being conned, electrocuted, or run over in various sketches. They happily shared their stupidity; one slave character said that to get to China, one <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> go up in a balloon and wait for the world to rotate below. Highly musical and unable to sit still, they constantly contorted their bodies wildly while singing.|$|E
25|$|Unwilling {{to waste}} his troops in {{an assault on}} the forts at New Madrid, Pope sent a brigade under Colonel (later Brigadier General) Joseph B. Plummer to occupy the town of Point Pleasant, on the right bank of the river almost {{directly}} opposite Island No. 10. The movement was contested by the Confederate gunboats, but Plummer's troops soon learned that they <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> withdraw out of range when the gunboats appeared, and return as soon as they left. The brigade occupied Point Pleasant on March 6, and the boats shelled their positions for the next three days. In this period, the Confederate Army remained within their fortifications, offering no support to Flag Officer Hollins.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, two {{employees}} of Sveriges Radio contacted Guillou at Folket i Bild/Kulturfront {{with a story}} of a colleague that had been recruited by a CIA officer in Stockholm. They had earlier been turned down by a major newspaper, and now asked the journalist that had exposed IB if he could publish the story. The three worked out a scenario where the CIA recruiter could be legally accused of espionage, and instructed the recruit to collect evidence thereof. Unbelievable enough, the CIA officer agreed to give his spy written instructions of what information to retrieve, so the informal counter-intelligence group <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> stockpile these, take photographs of the two spies meeting, and discuss how much they needed before the final exposure would be made.|$|E

25|$|Pétain {{wrote that}} German barrages were being fired daily, which made {{infantry}} attacks almost impossible and that varying French bombardments to obtain surprise made little difference, {{now that the}} German artillery had been reinforced and was ready at a moment's notice to begin barrage fire. German guns were registered on no man's land and <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> fire into the area to hit French infantry during an attack. The French counter-battery effort {{had to wait until}} German guns revealed themselves and then begin area fire near the German artillery, which was a waste of ammunition. Pétain wanted more air reconnaissance but aircraft wireless was of extremely short range and during attacks, confusion on the ground made artillery observation from the air impossible. As an alternative, Pétain suggested making highly detailed maps of the German rear areas and systematically bombarding German artillery emplacements continuously, rather than during attacks but the suggestions were impractical, {{due to the lack of}} ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Wimbledon {{originally}} {{played on}} Wimbledon Common, using the Fox and Grapes public house in Camp Road as the team's headquarters and changing room. The club moved to Plough Lane in September 1912. During the 1930s and 1940s, crowds of between 7,000 and 10,000 were not uncommon at the ground. Wimbledon's highest {{attendance at the}} ground came on 2 March 1935, when 18,080 people were attracted to an FA Amateur Cup tie against HMS Victory. However, the ground was basic, and even after the club's rapid rise to the First Division Plough Lane had changed little from Wimbledon's amateur days. The only notable difference was the addition of floodlights, first used on 3 October 1960 in a London Charity Cup match against Arsenal. At {{the time of the}} club's acceptance into The Football League, applicants <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> meet minimal stadium criteria, and once in the League these same criteria sufficed whether the club subsequently found itself in the Fourth or First Division. Following the Hillsborough disaster and the Taylor Report, the football authorities introduced far stricter safety rules that gave top-flight clubs specific deadlines by which to redevelop terraced grounds or to build new all-seater stadiums. The board of the club decided that Plough Lane could not be made to comply with this economically and, in 1990, announced plans to temporarily groundshare with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in the town of Croydon, Surrey. When the club competed in the Intertoto Cup in 1995 Selhurst Park was not available, so Wimbledon's home games were played at the Goldstone Ground, the then home ground of Brighton & Hove Albion.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{their new}} home and {{heightened}} fan interest, New York suffered posted a 3-11 season in 1976. After compiling a 7–28 record Arsnparger was fired {{during the middle of}} that year. They traded the struggling Morton to the Denver Broncos following the season for quarterback Steve Ramsey. Morton led the Broncos to Super Bowl XII in his first season there, while Ramsey never started for the Giants, or any NFL team, after the trade. They went 5-9 in 1977, featuring the unusual choice of three rookie quarterbacks on the roster. [...] In 1978, New York started the year 5–6 and played the Eagles at home with a chance to solidify their playoff prospects. However, the season imploded on November 19, 1978, {{in one of the most}} improbable finishes in NFL history. Playing their archrival the Philadelphia Eagles the Giants were leading 17–12 and had possession of the ball with only 30seconds left. They <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> kneel the ball to end the game, as the Eagles had no time outs.|$|E
500|$|Fire control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I {{and the development of}} the Dreyer Fire Control Table was one such advance. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock and a simplified version, the Mk I, was fitted to the Indefatigables during refits in 1915–16. The more important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically transmitted training and elevation angles to the gun turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> follow. The director layer's trigger fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. A gun within the 'Y' turret was also equipped with transmitters so that, as a backup, it could function as a [...] "directing gun", but there was no provision for the gun battery to be split between the main director and this directing gun. [...] The Indefatigables received their director equipment between mid-1915 and May 1916.|$|E
500|$|The members worked {{together}} and shared all property. If {{a member of}} the society needed money for some purpose, they were free to take it from a community supply. Women of the society worked in the house sewing, setting type for newsletters, and general housework, while the men worked the farm. One of the founding principles of the society was that of the [...] "free gift". It dictated that, if anyone wanted something that they had to give—printed materials in particular—they <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> ask and it would be given to them without charge. After reading or seeing the society in practice, those people were free to contribute if they wished, but it was stressed that this was a [...] "free gift" [...] and not payment. In order to rise from their lower, selfish nature into an unselfish, spiritual nature, the society taught, everyone should obey the law of their being and subdue passions and impulses that control them by nature. The society believed in business and societal laws, but they felt that man would rise above those laws when they gained full control of their lower nature. They maintained, however, that they should still be obedient to those laws.|$|E
