40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} <b>horizontal</b> bone <b>gain</b> and implant {{survival and}} complication rates in patients treated with titanium meshes placed simultaneously with dental implants and fixed over them. Methods. Twenty-five patients treated with 40 implants and simultaneous guided bone regeneration with titanium meshes (i–Gen®, MegaGen, Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea) {{were selected for}} inclusion in the present retrospective multicenter study. Primary outcomes were <b>horizontal</b> bone <b>gain</b> and implant survival; secondary outcomes were biological and prosthetic complications. Results. After the removal of titanium meshes, the CBCT evaluation revealed a mean <b>horizontal</b> bone <b>gain</b> of 3. 67 [*]mm (± 0. 89). The most frequent complications were mild postoperative edema (12 / 25 patients: 48 %) and discomfort after surgery (10 / 25 patients: 40 %); these complications were resolved within one week. Titanium mesh exposure occurred in 6 patients (6 / 25 [*]:[*] 24 %) : one of these suffered partial loss of the graft and another experienced complete graft loss and implant failure. An implant survival rate of 97. 5 % (implant-based) and a peri-implant marginal bone loss of 0. 43 [*]mm (± 0. 15) were recorded after 1 year. Conclusions. The horizontal ridge reconstruction with titanium meshes placed simultaneously with dental implants achieved predictable satisfactory results. Prospective randomized controlled trials on a larger sample of patients are required to validate these positive outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} if adaptive modulation of vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) function is associated with commensurate alterations in manual target localization. To measure the effects of adapted VOR on manual responses we developed the Vestibular-Contingent Pointing Test (VCP). In the VCP test, subjects pointed to a remembered target following passive whole body rotation in the dark. In the first experiment, subjects performed VCP before and after wearing 0. 5 X minifying lenses that adaptively attenuate <b>horizontal</b> VOR <b>gain.</b> Results showed that adaptive reduction in <b>horizontal</b> VOR <b>gain</b> was accompanied by a commensurate change in VCP performance. In the second experiment, bilaterally labyrinthine deficient (LD) subjects were tested to confirm that vestibular cues were central to the spatial coding of both eye and hand movements during VCP. LD subjects performed significantly worse than normal subjects. These results demonstrate that adaptive change in VOR can lead to alterations in manual target localization...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} and three-dimensional (3 -D) {{properties of the}} primate translational vestibuloocular reflex (trVOR) for high-frequency (4 - 12 Hz, +/- 0. 3 - 0. 4 g) lateral motion were investigated during near-target viewing at center and eccentric targets. <b>Horizontal</b> response <b>gains</b> increased with frequency and depended on target eccentricity. The larger the horizontal and vertical target eccentricity, the steeper the dependence of <b>horizontal</b> response <b>gain</b> on frequency. In addition to horizontal eye movements, robust torsional response components also were present at all frequencies. During center-target fixation, torsional response phase was opposite (anticompensatory) to that expected for an "apparent" tilt response. Instead torsional response components depended systematically on vertical-target eccentricity, increasing in amplitude when looking down and reversing phase when looking up. As a result the trVOR eye velocity vector systematically tilted away from a purely horizontal direction, through an angle that increased with vertical eccentricity with a slope of approximately 0. 7. This systematic dependence of torsional eye velocity tilt on vertical eye position suggests that the trVOR might follow the 3 -D kinematic requirements that {{have been shown to}} govern visually guided eye movements and near-target fixation...|$|R

The latter effect is also achieved by half-wave spacing - inserting additional elements halfway between existing elements with full-wave spacing. This phasing achieves roughly the same <b>horizontal</b> <b>gain</b> as the full-wave spacing; that is, a five-element full-wave-spaced array equals a nine- or ten-element half-wave-spaced array.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{design and}} {{performance}} {{analysis of a}} coplanar waveguide fed printed monopole antenna for dual polarization is presented. The rectangular patch monopole has an hour glass shaped slot engraved on it whereas the two ground planes of the CPW are loaded with spiral shaped slots. The feed is made asymmetric {{with respect to the}} patch for enhancing the <b>horizontal</b> <b>gain</b> component. The measured (S 11 [*]<[*]− 10 [*]dB) impedance bandwidth achieved is from 2. 8 [*]GHz to 14. 0 [*]GHz and corresponds to 133 %. The current distribution and radiation patterns at various frequencies are plotted and indicate dual polarization. The antenna is further characterized by a peak gain of 4 – 5 [*]dBi and will be useful for applications requiring dual polarization capability in the operating band. In addition to the basic design, a two port version of the antenna for diversity applications with impedance bandwidth from 2. 7 [*]GHz to 12 [*]GHz and isolation around 15 [*]dB over band is presented at the end. To check the diversity performance of this two port antenna, the envelope correlation coefficient and the diversity gain are calculated and found to be within acceptable limits...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of ridge morphology on the amount of horizontal bone augmentation achieved with the sandwich bone augmentation (SBA) technique in the reconstruction of buccal dehiscence defects on dental implants. MethodsCone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was used to assess bone width changes in 26 patients who participated in a randomized controlled trial conducted in 2008 to 2011. The amount of <b>horizontal</b> bone <b>gain</b> was evaluated at four different levels (3, 6, 9, and 12 [*]mm apical to the alveolar crest) and three different time points (T 1 : baseline, T 2 : at time of graft placement, and T 3 : 6 months later). Different morphological characteristics of the alveolar ridge were also evaluated to determine their influence on horizontal bone augmentation. A total of 78 CBCT scans were assessed. ResultsComparison of the changes in ridge morphology at all measurement locations showed an overall ridge width gain of 2. 30 [*]±[*] 2. 20 [*]mm after 6 months. The use of membranes and the angulation of the concavity played a role in influencing the outcomes of the SBA technique. Critical crest angulation (CA) is 150 ° for bone gain at 9 [*]mm apical to the crest. When CA is smaller than 150 °, the <b>horizontal</b> bone <b>gain</b> was 4. 3 [*]±[*] 2. 2 [*]mm; if CA is greater than 150 °, the gain was significantly lower at 1. 3 [*]±[*] 1. 7 [*]mm (p[*]=[*]. 001). ConclusionsSBA is a reliable and predictable technique to <b>gain</b> <b>horizontal</b> ridge width with simultaneous implant placement.

30|$|Autogenous bone (AB) blocks {{harvested}} from intraoral donor sites (i.e., retromandibular, chin) {{are the most}} commonly used procedure for lateral alveolar ridge augmentation [1]. However, despite significant <b>horizontal</b> bone <b>gains,</b> cortical bone blocks were noted to undergo an incomplete replacement resorption [2, 3], thus featuring a composition of non-vital residual and newly formed vital bone in the former defect area [4]. Moreover, AB blocks are prone to a rapid degradation and therefore commonly combined with contour augmentation procedures using slowly resorbing particulate grafts and barrier membranes [5].|$|R
30|$|To {{overcome}} these limitations, {{the use of}} xenogeneic bone grafts {{as an alternative to}} autogenous bone blocks has been proposed [16]. Recently, a new equine-derived collagen containing xenogeneic bone block (CCXBB) was evaluated in preclinical studies [17, 18], demonstrating to be safe and adequate for ridge augmentation and better graft integration when compared to other xenogeneic bone blocks. Its performance in humans has been recently tested on 10 patients where these xenogeneic bone blocks were placed in single-tooth alveolar bone defects [19]. Clinically, a mean <b>horizontal</b> <b>gains</b> of 3.88 [*]±[*] 1.75  mm was reported and the histological outcomes resulted in a homogeneous new bone formation within the CCXBB. These results were concordant with a recent histological study also reporting that equine bone grafts were biocompatible and underwent advanced remodelling at the time of implant placement [20]. Although this preliminary evidence on the performance and histological behaviour of equine bone blocks seems promising, there is still limited information when used in staged horizontal bone augmentation of large osseous defects. It was, therefore, the aim of this prospective study to evaluate the histological outcomes of CCXBB blocks used for lateral bone augmentation in large alveolar horizontal defects of at least two adjacent missing teeth.|$|R

40|$|One {{commonly}} observed {{phenomenon of}} vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation is a frequency-selective change in gain (eye velocity / head velocity) and phase (relative timing between the vestibular stimulus and response) {{based on the}} frequency content of the adaptation training stimulus. The neural mechanism behind this type of adaptation is not clear. Our aim {{was to determine whether}} there were other parameter-selective effects on VOR adaptation; specifically velocity-selective and acceleration-selective changes in the <b>horizontal</b> VOR <b>gain</b> and phase. We also wanted to determine whether parameter-selectivity was also in place for cross-axis adaptation training (a visual-vestibular training stimulus that elicits a vestibular-evoked torsional eye movement during horizontal head rotations). We measured VOR gain and phase in 17 C 57 BL/ 6 mice during baseline (no adaptation training) and after gain-increase, gain-decrease and cross-axis adaptation training using a sinusoidal visual-vestibular (mismatch) stimulus with whole-body rotations (vestibular stimulus) with peak-velocity 20 º/s and 50 º/s both with a fixed frequency of 0. 5 Hz. Our results show pronounced velocity-selectivity of VOR adaptation. The difference in <b>horizontal</b> VOR <b>gain</b> after gain-increase versus gain-decrease adaptation was maximal when the sinusoidal testing stimulus matched the adaptation training stimulus peak-velocity. We also observed similar velocity-selectivity after cross-axis adaptation training. Our data suggest that frequency-selectivity could be a manifestation of both velocity- and acceleration-selectivity because when one of these is absent, e. g., acceleration-selectivity in the mouse, then frequency-selectivity is also reduced...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Palsy of a nerve {{might be}} {{expected}} to lower vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) responses in its fields of motion, but effects of peripheral neuromuscu-lar disease were unknown. We recorded the VOR during sinusoidal head rota-tions in yaw, pitch, and roll at 0. 5 – 2 Hz and static torsional gain in 43 patients with unilateral nerve palsies. Sixth nerve palsy (n = 21) reduced both abduction and adduction VOR gains in darkness. In light, horizontal visually enhanced VOR (VVOR) gains were normal in moderate and mild palsy. In severe palsy, <b>horizontal</b> VVOR <b>gains</b> remained low in the paretic eye when it was fixating, whereas gains in the nonparetic eye became higher than normal. Third nerve palsy (n = 10) decreased VOR and VVOR gains during abduction, adduction, elevation, depression, extorsion, and intorsion. Fourth nerve palsy (n = 13) re-duced VOR gains of the paretic eye during intorsion, extorsion, elevation, de-pression, abduction, and adduction, but in light vertical and <b>horizontal</b> VVOR <b>gains</b> were normal. In the nonparetic eye, all gains were normal. Reduced VOR gains in the direction of paretic muscles and also in the direction of their antag-onists, together with normal gains in the nonparetic eye, indicate a selective ad-justment to the antagonists of paretic muscles. Increase of VVOR gains to normal in the paretic eye, when used for fixation, without conjugate increase in gains in the occluded nonparetic eye, provides further evidence of selective ad-aptation for the paretic eye. Motions of the eyes after nerve palsies indicate mo-nocular VOR adaptation in three dimensions...|$|R

In April 2016, Embase, Medline (Ovid-SP), Cochrane Central, Web of Science and PubMed (as {{supplied by the}} publisher) were searched. There were no restrictions regarding language or publication date. Randomised controlled trials that reported membranes in bone augmentation procedures with a minimum follow-up period of 6  months after implant loading or that described geometrical changes of the bone graft at re-entry were included. Membrane placement {{had to be the}} only variable in the procedure. Outcomes were implant failure, complications, <b>horizontal</b> bone <b>gain</b> and resorption, graft resorption, defect height reduction, marginal bone loss around implants, aesthetic results and patient satisfaction. The results were pooled using fixed-effect models with mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes. After screening the titles and abstracts of 1843 papers, 32 potentially eligible articles were selected. Seventeen articles involving 10 trials were included in this review. These studies presented outcome data for 355 patients. Seven trials were considered to be at a high risk of bias, two at a low risk of bias and one at an unclear risk of bias. Insufficient evidence was found to determine whether there were differences in implant failure rates, marginal bone level changes, aesthetic results or patient satisfaction. For one-stage ridge augmentation (two trials; n =  52), there was evidence of more <b>horizontal</b> bone <b>gain</b> (MD: 0. 84  mm, 95 % CI: 0. 46 to 1. 21, P  <  0. 00001; two trials), defect height reduction (MD: 18. 36 %, 95 % CI: 10. 23 to 26. 50, P  <  0. 00001; two trials), and prevention of graft resorption (P =  0. 004; one trial) in favour of the membrane-covered group, although substantial heterogeneity was found for <b>horizontal</b> bone <b>gain</b> (Chi 2; P =  0. 05, I 2 = 74 %). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether any differences exist in two-stage ridge augmentation (three trials; n =  81), sinus augmentation (one trial; n =  104) and ridge preservation (one trial; n =  20). For immediate implant placement (three trials; n =  98), there was evidence of an increased defect height reduction in favour of the membrane-covered groups (MD: 6. 25 %, 95 % CI: 1. 67 to 10. 82, P =  0. 007; two trials), although with substantial heterogeneity (Chi 2; P =  0. 03, I 2  =  79 %). More complications were observed when a membrane was used (OR: 2. 52, 95 % CI: 1. 07 to 5. 93, P =  0. 03; three trials). There is insufficient evidence regarding the effects of membranes on bone augmentation procedures to support any definitive conclusions. Only 10 studies were included; they had limited sample sizes and short follow-up periods, and the majority were at a high risk of bias.

We used the magnetic scleral search coil technique to study the VOR in patients with unilateral fourth nerve palsy during sinusoidal head rotations in yaw, pitch and roll at different frequencies.

VOR gains during excyclotorsion, elevation and adduction of the paretic eye are also reduced, whereas gains in the non-paretic eye remain normal, indicating a selective adjustment of innervation to the paretic eye.
