5|$|In 1961, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth {{into three}} {{categories}} according {{to the amount of}} precipitation they received.

5|$|Various legal {{definitions}} of beer exist in different countries. Historically, {{the most famous}} of these was the Reinheitsgebot, which applied to parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Germany and required beer to be made from only water, hops, and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have alcohol content that ranges from 1.1% to 8.6%, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6% and labeled accordingly. Beer in South Korea must <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 25% ABV, which means {{that it has to be}} 25 mL of alcohol or less per 100 mL of solution and can be considered ‘lite’ only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, beer in South Korea must use only water, hops, and starches (wheat, rice, barley, corn, or potato) as ingredients in the brewing process. In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0% alcohol by volume concentration at 20°C. It is often brewed from a mixture of grains like malt, sugars or its equivalent, and hops or other vegetables.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that <b>have</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
