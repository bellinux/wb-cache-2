Zymography is a semi-quantitative tool for determining the activity of different MMP isoenzymes {{in a variety of}} biological samples. In substrate gel zymography, protein samples of different origin (tissue, cell lysates, plasma/serum, perfusates, other liquids) are separated in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels containing co-polymerized substrate (gelatin, casein, elastin, etc.), and after incubation enabling substrate cleavage by MMPs, MMP activities are detected after the gel staining as transparent bands against a dark-blue background. In situ zymography is a histological modification of substrate zymography in frozen sections, allowing detection of the localization of the MMP activities within the tissue.

40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, topoisomerase III {{forms an}} evolutionarily conserved complex with a RecQ family helicase and two OB-fold containing proteins, replication protein A (RPA) and RMI 1. One role for this complex is to catalyze {{the completion of}} homologous recombination reactions in which the recombining DNA molecules are covalently interlinked by a double Holliday junction structure. This process, which requires the single-stranded DNA decatenation activity of topoisomerase III, is termed Holliday junction "dissolution" to distinguish it from Holliday junction "resolution" catalyzed by endonucleases (resolvases) that simply cleave the four-way junction.

40|$|AbstractMany {{pathogenic}} fungi {{are genetically}} tractable. Analysis of their cellular organization and invasion mechanisms underpinning virulence determinants profits from exploiting such molecular tools as fluorescent fusion proteins or conditional mutant protein alleles. Generation of these tools requires efficient cloning methods, as vector construction {{is often a}} rate-limiting step. Here, we introduce an efficient yeast recombination-based cloning (YRBC) method to construct vectors for the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. This method is of low cost and avoids dependency {{on the availability of}} restriction enzyme sites in the DNA sequence, as needed in more conventional restriction/ligation-based cloning procedures. Furthermore, YRBC avoids modification of the DNA of interest, indeed this potential risk limits the use of site-specific recombination systems, such as Gateway cloning. Instead, in YRBC, multiple DNA fragments, with 30 bp overlap sequences, are transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereupon homologous recombination generates the vector in a single step.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) {{is essential for}} cell migration and ECM remodeling. Focal adhesions are macromolecular assemblies that couple the contractile F-actin cytoskeleton to the ECM. This connection allows for the transmission of intracellular mechanical forces across the cell membrane to the underlying substrate. Recent work has shown the mechanical properties of the ECM regulate focal adhesion and F-actin morphology as well as numerous physiological processes, including cell differentiation, division, proliferation and migration. Thus, the use of cell culture substrates has become an increasingly prevalent method to precisely control and modulate ECM mechanical properties. To quantify traction forces at focal adhesions in an adherent cell, compliant substrates are {{used in conjunction with}} high-resolution imaging and computational techniques in a method termed traction force microscopy (TFM). This technique relies on measurements of the local magnitude and direction of substrate deformations induced by cellular contraction. In combination with high-resolution fluorescence microscopy of fluorescently tagged proteins, it is possible to correlate cytoskeletal organization and remodeling with traction forces. Here we present a <b>detailed</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>protocol</b> for the preparation of two-dimensional, compliant matrices for the purpose of creating a cell culture substrate with a well-characterized, tunable mechanical stiffness, which is suitable for measuring cellular contraction.

The <b>detailed</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>protocol</b> was as followed (Genty et al. 1989). The minimal fluorescence (Fo) with all PSII reaction centers open was measured with modulated light that was sufficiently low (< 0.05 μmol·m- 2 ·s- 1 as not to induce significant variable fluorescence. The maximal fluorescence (Fm) with all PSII reaction centers closed was determined by a 0.8 s saturating pulse at 8000 μmol·m- 2 ·s- 1 in dark-adapted leaves. Then, leaves were continuously illuminated with 336 μmol·m- 2 ·s- 1 white actinic light. The steady-state value of fluorescence (Fs) was thereafter recorded and a second saturating pulse at 8000 μmol·m- 2 ·s- 1 was imposed to determine the maximal fluorescence in the light-adapted state (Fm'). Fo' was the basal fluorescence after far-red illumination. The photosynthetic parameters were calculated using the PAMWIN Data Acquisition System (Walz, Germany) as follow: the photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) = (Fm−Fo)/Fm, the excitation capture efficiency of open PSII reaction centers (Fv'/Fm') = (Fm'−Fo')/Fm', and the coefficients of photochemical quenching (qP) = (Fm'−Fs)/(Fm'−Fo'), coefficient of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) = (Fm−Fm')/Fm', and actual photochemical efficiency of PSII (ΦPSII) = (Fm'−Fs)/Fm' (Demmig-Adams et al. 1996).

Electrostatic repulsion between adsorbed species stress and Changes in the electronic structure of the underlying gold substrate play an important role in surface stress generation. ^ To achieve higher sensitivity in the performance of cantilever sensors, optimized cantilevers of different dimensions are required.

40|$|In principle, {{we should}} be glad that Eric Kmiec and his colleagues {{published}} in Science's STKE (1) a <b>detailed</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>protocol</b> of their gene repair method (2, 3). However, a careful reading of their contribution raises more doubts about the method. The research published in Science five years ago by Kmiec and his colleagues was said to demonstrate that chimeric RNA-DNA oligonucleotides could correct the mutation responsible for sickle cell anemia with 50 % efficiency (4). Such a remarkable result prompted many laboratories to attempt to replicate the research or utilize the method on their own systems. However, if the method worked at all, which it rarely did, the achieved efficiency was usually lower by several orders of magnitude. Now, in the Science's STKE protocol, we are given crucial information about the method and {{why it is so}} important to utilize these expensive chimeric RNA-DNA constructs. In the introduction we are told that the RNA-DNA duplex is more stable than a DNA-DNA duplex and so extends the half-life of the complexes formed between the targeted DNA and the chimeric RNA-DNA oligonucleotides. This logical explanation, however, conflicts with the statement in the section entitled "Transfection with Oligonucleotides and Plasmid DNA" that Kmiec and colleagues have recently demonstrated that classical single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides with a few protective phosphothioate linkages have a "gene repair conversion frequency rivaling that of the RNA/DNA chimera". Indeed, the research cited for that result actually states that single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides are in fact several-fold more efficient (3. 7 -fold) than the RNA-DNA chimeric constructs (5). If that is the case, it raises the question of why Kmiec and colleagues emphasize the importance of the RNA in their original chimeric constructs. Their own new results show that modified single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides are more effective than the expensive RNA-DNA hybrids. Moreover, the current efficiency of the gene repair by RNA-DNA hybrids, according to Kmiec and colleagues in their recent paper is only 4 × 10 - 4 even after several hours of pre-selection permitting multiplification of bacterial cells with the corrected plasmid (5). This efficiency is much lower than the 50 % value reported five years ago, but is assuredly much closer to the reality...|$|E

Cellular reprogramming induces global changes in gene expression involving hundreds of transcription factors and thousands of genes and understanding how cells globally alter their gene expression profile during reprogramming is an open problem. Here we reanalyze time-series data on cellular reprogramming from differentiated cell types to {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) and show that gene expression dynamics during reprogramming follow a simple one-dimensional reaction coordinate. This reaction coordinate is independent of both {{the time it takes to}} reach the iPSC state as well as the <b>details</b> of <b>experimental</b> <b>protocol</b> used. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that such a reaction coordinate emerges naturally from epigenetic landscape models of cell identity where cellular reprogramming is viewed as a "barrier-crossing" between the starting and ending cell fates. The model also provides gene-level insight into reprogramming dynamics and resolves a debate in the stem cell field about the different phases of reprogramming dynamics. Overall, our analysis and model suggest that gene expression dynamics during reprogramming follow a canonical trajectory consistent with the idea of an "optimal path" in gene expression space for reprogramming.

The first chapter details the optimisation of the auration reaction of benzene and trapping of the intermediate species, PhAuCl 2, {{with the use of a}} coordinating ligand. The isolation and characterisation of the aurated species, PhAuCl 2. lut, is also discussed. The intermediate aurated species is utilised to achieve oxidative homocoupling, yielding biphenyl. The reaction is further expanded to a number of electron rich and mildly electron deficient aromatics. Attempts to render the reaction catalytic and to achieve oxidative heterocoupling are also described. The second chapter illustrates the total synthesis of (±) -polysiphenol, via a biomimetically inspired highly regioselective intramolecular oxidative coupling route. The two bromine atoms are installed prior to oxidative coupling, preventing further oxidation to a planar aromatized phenanthrene, however attempts to brominate the aromatic rings following oxidative coupling, have also been carried out. The first synthesis of 1, 1 ’-ethane- 1, 2 -diylbis(2, 5, 6 -tribromobenzene- 3, 4 -diol), another natural product belonging to the family of Rhodomelaceae, is also described. The last section of each chapter <b>details</b> the <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols</b> and spectral characterisation of all the compounds synthesised in this study. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{measurements of}} nanofluids were {{the subject of}} a considerable amount of published research works. Up to now, the experimental results reported in the current literature are still scarce and show many discrepancies. In this paper we propose measurements of this parameter using another experimental set-up. Because of very good thermal controls and big aspect ratio, the Bénard set-up is particularly well suited to determine the thermal conductivity. The aim {{of this paper is to}} <b>detail</b> the <b>experimental</b> measurement <b>protocol.</b> The investigated liquid is composed of single walled carbon nanotubes dispersed in water. The effect of liquid temperature on thermal conductivity was investigated. Obtained results confirm the potential of nanofluids in enhancing thermal conductivity and also show that the thermal conductivity temperature dependence is nonlinear, which is different from the results for metal/metal oxide nanofluids. © 2013 Mohamed Mojahed et al.

40|$|Repair {{of acute}} {{injury to the}} cell {{membrane}} is an elemental process of normal cellular physiology, and defective membrane repair {{has been linked to}} many degenerative human diseases. The recent discovery of MG 53 as a key component of the membrane resealing machinery allows for a better molecular understanding of the basic biology of tissue repair, as well as for potential translational applications in regenerative medicine. Here we <b>detail</b> the <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols</b> for exploring the in vivo function of MG 53 in repair of muscle injury using treadmill exercise protocols on mouse models, for testing the ex vivo membrane repair capacity by measuring dye entry into isolated muscle fibers, and for monitoring the dynamic process of MG 53 -mediated vesicle trafficking and cell membrane repair in cultured cells using live cell confocal microscopy. Protocol 1. Treadmill Running for Revealing the Extent of Muscle Injury in Mouse Models 1. Establish the angle of the treadmill surface for use during the running protocol. Generally, a flat level or an angle between 7 °and 15 °degrees downhill or uphill is used. Some treadmills have in integral apparatus to adjust the incline while others require the treadmill to be elevated through other means. 2. Place a tray or a blue lab pad underneath the treadmill before putting the animals in the treadmill to collect any waste from the animals during the running protocol. 3. Before running mice should be acclimated to the environment of the treadmill. This involves placing the animals in the treadmill for 15 minute...|$|R
40|$|As our {{understanding}} of the biological sciences expands, the boundaries between traditional disciplines tend to blur at the edges. Physiologists and pharmacologists, for instance, now need to embrace techniques that until recently were the strict preserves of biochemists and molecular biologists. However, the acquisition of new technologies can be a time-consuming and frustrating business, and unless an expert is on hand to give instruction, precious hours can be spent poring over half-described Methods sections with no guarantee of eventual success. The aim of Signal Transduction Protocols has been to get experts with "hands-on" experience in particular techniques to give <b>detailed</b> accounts of <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols</b> in a recipe-type format, which we hope will circumvent the problems of ambiguity often encountered when reading the literature. The techniques described in Signal Transduction Protocols are those that we think will be most useful in addressing questions in the area of receptor-mediated cell signaling, with particular regard to those receptors {{that are part of the}} G-protein-linked superfamily. To keep it to a manageable size, we have omitted any reference to electrophysiology and have instead concentrated on more biochemical approache...|$|R
40|$|This volume {{reports on}} a cross‐cultural {{investigation}} of social preferences in 15 small‐scale, non‐Western societies. Participants from all 15 groups played the ultimatum game with {{members of their own}} culture; subjects from a subset also played dictator and voluntary contribution to public goods games. The bulk of the book (Chapters 4 through 14) consists of reports by the field workers (mostly anthropologists). Each chapter includes ethnographic information, a description of how members of the group make their living, <b>details</b> on the <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols</b> and results, and some discussion. Although none of the results are consistent with the predictions of the standard rational choice model (as has been true in earlier work), group average offers and rejection frequencies in these experiments display more variation than has been observed in experiments using university students from developed Westernized societies. The editors report that little of this variation can be accounted for by individual economic or demographic variables, such as gender, age, education, or wealth. On the other hand, group dummies account for quite a lot, and social preferences seem to be stronger in groups experiencing greater market integration or whose economic mode offers greater opportunities for gains from cooperative enterprise...|$|R
