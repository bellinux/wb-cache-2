5000|$|Some {{researchers}} view party identification as [...] "a form {{of social}} identity", {{in the same way}} that a person identifies with a religious or ethnic group. This identity develops early in a person's life mainly through family and social influences. This description would make party identification a stable perspective, which develops as a consequence of personal, family, social and environmental factors. Other researchers consider party identification to be more flexible and more of a conscious choice. They see it as a position and a choice based on the continued assessment of the political, economic and social <b>environment.</b> <b>Party</b> identification can increase or even shift by motivating events or conditions in the country.|$|E

[...] Each of them is presented under a critical light: the positives as well as the negatives sides of the DDR are explored in this exhibition.

40|$|The {{basic premise}} {{of this paper}} is that {{perception}} of the role of marketing · in politics is the major determinant of the extent of application of marketing strategies in electoral politics. If political parties and their candidates should {{come to terms with the}} truism that marketing is the heart and soul of democratic politics in their perception, they will be eager to develop marketing strategies that most suitably fit or match the characteristics of their political market place. Thus the overriding objective of this study is to examine how political parties and their candidates perceive the role of marketing strategies in party politics. The basis of this objective is that political parties operate in a complex and uncertain environment. In order to make sense of this <b>environment</b> <b>party</b> leaders tend to form si 11 zplified cognitive representation of the importance or otherwise of marketing strategies. This mental model can be referred to as "their perception of the role of marketing strategies, and constitutes a factor in the formulation and execution of political marketing strategies. In pursuit of our objective in this study, Nigeria was stratified into six geopolitical zones, out of which a representative sample of 400 respondents was drawn to fill out the questionnaire. Of this number, 311 Copies of questionnaire were completed and retumed. After editing, only 298 copies were usable. These were analyzed to crystallize the findings. The findings show that marketing strategies do not play extremely positive role in Nigerian politics. Infact only 52...|$|E
40|$|Air/ground digital {{datalink}} communications are {{an integral}} component of the FAA's Air Traffic Control (ATC) modernization strategy. With the introduction of datalink into the ATC system, there is concern over the potential loss of situational awareness by flight crews due to {{the reduction in the}} "party line" information available to the pilot. "Party line" information is gleaned by flight crews overhearing communications between ATC and other aircraft. In the datalink <b>environment,</b> <b>party</b> line information may not be available due to the use of discrete addressing. Information concerning the importance, availability, and accuracy of party line elements was explored through an opinion survey of active air carrier flight crews. The survey identified numerous important party line elements. These elements were scripted into a full-mission flight simulation. The flight simulation experiment examined the utilization of party line information by studying subject responses to the specific information elements. Some party line elements perceived as important were effectively utilized by flight crews in the simulated operational environment. However, other party line elements stimulated little or no increase in situational awareness. The ability to assimilate and use party line information appeared to be dependent on workload, time availability, and the tactical/strategic nature of the situations. In addition, the results of both the survey and the simulation indicated that the importance of party line information appeared to be greatest for operations near or on the airport. This indicates that caution must be exercised when implementing datalink communications in these high workload, tactical sectors. This document is based on the thesis of Alan H. Midkiff submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|E

5|$|Bravely Default is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{which features}} a party of four characters navigating the fantasy world of Luxendarc. Navigation in towns, dungeons and the world map environments are done from an angled, third-person overhead view: the character remains still, the camera zooms out to a distant view. These environments are displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS system, while the bottom screen displays maps of <b>environments,</b> <b>party</b> stats and other information such as item menus. On the world map, a day-night cycle alters the types of enemies present, and after {{a certain point in}} the story an airship can be used to speed up travel and access previously inaccessible areas. In towns, players can interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), purchase items or magic at specialized shops, buy or sell weapons and equipment at an armory, or rest at an inn to restore health points (HP) and magic points (MP). In all <b>environments,</b> the <b>party</b> can find chests containing items, weapons or equipment. During certain points, a Party Chat option appears, giving players the option of initiating conversations between the party members. During exploration, standard enemies appear through random encounters: outside battle, the counter rate can be adjusted from high to nothing. The game features multiple difficulty levels, which can be adjusted freely outside battle.|$|R

40|$|Our model {{describes}} {{competition between}} groups {{driven by the}} choices of self-interested voters within groups. Within a Poisson voting <b>environment,</b> <b>parties</b> observe aggregate support from groups and can allocate prizes or punishments to them. In a tournament style analysis, the model characterizes how contingent allocation of prizes based on relative levels of support affects equilibrium voting behavior. In addition to standard notions of pivotality, voters influence the distribution of prizes across groups. Such prize pivotality supports positive voter turnout even in non-competitive electoral settings. The analysis shows that competition for a prize awarded to the most supportive group is only stable when two groups actively support a party. However, competition among groups to avoid punishment is stable in environments with any number of groups. We conclude by examining implications for endogenous group formation and how politicians structure the allocation of rewards and punishments. Comment: 34 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
