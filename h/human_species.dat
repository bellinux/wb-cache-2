5|$|Sri Aurobindo {{argues that}} divine Brahman manifests as {{empirical}} reality through līlā, or divine play. Instead of positing {{that the world}} we experience is an illusion (māyā), Aurobindo argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the <b>human</b> <b>species</b> just as <b>human</b> <b>species</b> have evolved after the animal species.|$|E

5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} that humanity could be impacted by {{an influx of}} extraterrestrial science and technology {{in the same way}} that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists. Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the <b>human</b> <b>species,</b> and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the <b>human</b> <b>species</b> itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E
5|$|Raël founded Clonaid in March 1997, {{shortly after}} the Dolly the Sheep cloning, believing that the process was {{important}} because the <b>human</b> <b>species</b> had been created by an extraterrestrial cloning project. On a practical level, Raël promoted the practice {{as a way to}} develop more desirable genetics and eventually prolong memories in new bodies. Shortly after Clonaid's launch, Boisselier began publicizing and managing its operations. In 1999, she announced that she had set up cloning laboratories and had hired a team of six scientists. She said she had limited knowledge of cloning but was skilled in selecting experts.|$|E
5|$|Survivors is a British {{science fiction}} {{television}} series {{produced by the}} BBC. It depicts {{the lives of a}} group of people who survived a virulent unknown strain of influenza which has wiped out most of the <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> According to the producers, the series is not a remake of the 1970s BBC television series Survivors (1975–1977), created by Terry Nation, but rather is loosely based on the novel of the same name that Nation wrote following the first series of the 1970s programme. Two series were produced of the new show: series 1 ran on BBC One and BBC HD in November–December 2008, and series 2 ran in January–February 2010, ending with a cliffhanger. The BBC announced on 13 April 2010 that, due to poor viewing figures and other considerations, Survivors had been cancelled.|$|E
40|$|Orthodontists {{are working}} anthropologists. We measure {{the bones of}} skull, face, and teeth, and study the {{relationship}} of these structures. We should also be interested, then, in learning {{as much as possible}} about the origins of human beings and the evolutionary development of our anatomy. This paper is an attempt to describe the orthodontic relevance during the evolution of <b>humans</b> <b>species...</b>|$|R
50|$|Tabanids {{are known}} vectors for some {{blood-borne}} bacterial, viral, protozoan and worm diseases of mammals, {{such as the}} equine infectious anaemia virus and various species of Trypanosoma which cause diseases in animals and <b>humans.</b> <b>Species</b> of the genus Chrysops transmit the parasitic filarial worm Loa loa between humans, and tabanids are known to transmit anthrax among cattle and sheep, and tularemia between rabbits and humans.|$|R

5|$|The Overlords {{are eager}} to escape from their own {{evolutionary}} dead end by studying the Overmind, so Rodricks's information is potentially of great value to them. By radio, Rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet. As the column disappears, Rodricks experiences {{a profound sense of}} emptiness when the children have gone. Then material objects and the Earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency. Jan reports no fear, but a powerful sense of fulfillment. The Earth evaporates in a flash of light. Karellen looks back at the receding Solar System and gives a final salute to the <b>human</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of hybridisation between homo sapiens and other <b>human</b> <b>species</b> of the genus Homo. In 2010, the Neanderthal genome project showed that 1–4% of DNA from all people living today, apart from most Sub-Saharan Africans, are of Neanderthal heritage. Analyzing the genomes of 600 Europeans and East Asians found that combining them covered 20% of the Neanderthal genome {{that is in the}} modern human population. Ancient human populations lived and interbred with Neanderthals, Denisovans, and at least one other extinct Homo species. Thus, Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA has been incorporated into human DNA by introgression.|$|E

Relationship of Mycoplasma pneumoniae {{to other}} <b>human</b> Mycoplasma <b>species</b> studied by gel diffusion. J. Bacteriol. 90 : 1432 – 1437. 1965. —Conditions are {{presented}} {{for the production}} of four lines of precipitate between Mycoplasma pneumoniae antigen and homologous hyperimmune rabbit serum in double diffusion in agar. The specificity of the reaction was shown by the fact that M. pneumoniae antigen did not react with antisera to the other <b>human</b> mycoplasma <b>species,</b> nor did M. pneumoniae antiserum produce lines with antigens prepared from the other human mycoplasmas. In addition, there was no reduction in the number or intensity of precipitation lines after absorption of M. pneumoniae antiserum with heterotypic mycoplasma antigens, or after absorption of heterotypic mycoplasma antisera with M. pneumoniae antigen. These findings indicate that, of the <b>human</b> mycoplasma <b>species</b> so far studied, M. pneumoniae is antigenically the most distinct...|$|R

25|$|In 2009, a {{study by}} Jungers et al. {{presented}} a statistical analysis of skull shapes of healthy modern humans, microcephalic humans, and several ancient <b>human</b> <b>species,</b> as well as H.floresiensis. They showed that the three grouped separately, with H.floresiensis among the ancient humans, providing evidence that H.floresiensis is a separate species instead of a diseased modern human.|$|E
25|$|The {{species name}} is also called a binomial, that is, a two-term name. For example, the zoological {{name for the}} <b>human</b> <b>species</b> is Homo sapiens. This is usually {{italicized}} in print and underlined when italics are not available. In this case, Homo is the generic name and it is capitalized; sapiens indicates the species {{and it is not}} capitalized.|$|E
50|$|The {{level of}} {{biodiversity}} {{that can be}} yielded from organic farming provides a natural capital to <b>humans.</b> <b>Species</b> found in most organic farms provides a means of agricultural sustainability by reducing amount of human input (e.g. fertilizers, pesticides). Farmers that produce with organic methods reduce risk of poor yields by promoting biodiversity. Common game birds such as the ring-necked pheasant and the northern bobwhite often reside in agriculture landscapes, and are a natural capital yielded from high demands of recreational hunting. Because bird species richness and population are typically higher on organic farm systems, promoting biodiversity {{can be seen as}} logical and economical.|$|R

25|$|In 1758, Carl Linnaeus {{proposed}} what {{he considered}} to be natural taxonomic categories of the <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> He distinguished between Homo sapiens and Homo sapiens europaeus, and he later added four geographical subdivisions of humans: white Europeans, red Americans, yellow Asians and black Africans. Although Linnaeus intended them as objective classifications, his descriptions of these groups included cultural patterns and derogatory stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|Sherwood Washburn and Ashley Montagu {{were heavily}} {{influenced}} by the modern synthesis in biology and population genetics. In addition, they were influenced by Franz Boas, who had moved away from typological racial thinking. Rather than supporting Coon's theories, they and other contemporary researchers viewed the <b>human</b> <b>species</b> as a continuous serial progression of populations and heavily criticised Coon's Origin of Races.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there is}} {{disagreement}} about {{the uniqueness of}} language to humans, babbling {{is not unique to}} the <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> Many animals produce similar ranges of sounds to human infants. These ranges of sounds are used in the young of many species to experiment with sound-making capabilities, or to practice for future vocal behavior. Similar to human infants, animal babbling is restricted by physiological development.|$|E
