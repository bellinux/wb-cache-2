I was at first surprised to see a pathogen paper published in Developmental Cell, even though I remembered that plant viruses sometimes induced rather bizarre developmental abnormalities. In this paper, the Carrington group revealed that such defects were because of collateral damage caused by a viral protein that blocks an antiviral gene silencing pathway. Since this pathway involves small RNAs, the viral protein inadvertently also interferes with microRNAs important for development. Viral suppressor proteins have since become important tools for dissecting the role of small RNAs in plant development and physiology.

Her principal sin, apparently, was to cultivate a distinctive vocal style that was at home in all kinds of music, be it R, blues, jazz, middle of the road pop – and she probably would have made a fine gospel or country singer had she the time. Hers was a gritty, salty, high-pitched voice, marked by absolute clarity of diction and clipped, bluesy phrasing..." ...|$|E

According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a <b>good</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted.

2500|$|The buildup to Steven's exit {{involved}} in a bisexual love triangle storyline between him, Stacey and Christian Clarke (John Partridge), who is the gay brother of Jane. On-screen, Steven and Stacey's friendship progressed into something more serious in March 2008, when they shared a kiss. Steven later decided {{he was ready to}} lose his virginity to Stacey, and took Ian's advice [...] "to try to name the England football team and substitutes as a technique for pacing himself," [...] which Sidwell has described as, [...] "a really funny scene to film [...] my favourite comedy moment since joining the show." [...] Speaking of the character's impending exit, he added: [...] "Steven loves Stacey as a friend, and would do anything for her. He misreads loving someone as being 'in love', though. Things aren't right between them, and he can't put his finger on the reason why. That's what's going to lead him to question his sexuality..." [...] On-screen, Steven was unable to consummate his love for Stacey, and after an emotional rant, he kissed Christian. The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; {{in an interview with the}} Daily Star he explained, [...] " [...] a really <b>good</b> <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> so kissing her was weird, but we just got on with it! But I found it really challenging to kiss [...] because I'm not gay [...] I saw the conflict teenagers go through when they're struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. [...] is a cracking scene and I'm really pleased with it." [...] The storyline progressed with Steven denying his homosexual tendencies, leading Christian to continuously try and [...] "out" [...] him. John Partridge, has commented, [...] "Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man – and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt. He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it. There's nothing you can do about it and if you try to hide it, people get hurt." [...] After the truth was revealed to Stacey, Steven falsely claimed to Ian that Christian had attempted to seduce him – a means of revenge for Christian's rejection. The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot has been described as [...] "controversial" [...] and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: [...] "A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well." ...|$|E

Prof. Stefano Serra Capizzano, and dott. Marco Donatelli are the nearest in time that paid attention to this effort and the first I’m grateful to. A special regard goes to prof.
