40|$|Abstract. —Hook size is an {{important}} consideration {{in the use of}} circle <b>hooks</b> as a conservation tool for minimizing the injury and mortality of marine fishes, but {{little is known about the}} role of <b>hook</b> size in the performance of <b>hooks</b> in recreational freshwater fisheries. In this study, we angled 100 bluegills Lepomis macrochirus on each of five different-sized circle <b>hooks</b> (1 / 0, 2, 6, 10, and 14). The largest <b>hook</b> size (1 / 0) had low <b>hooking</b> and capture efficiency but selected larger individuals. The smallest <b>hook</b> size also had low <b>hooking</b> efficiency and resulted in the selection of smaller individuals. Intermediate <b>hook</b> sizes captured fish of intermediate size. Jaw <b>hooking</b> rates generally increased with decreasing <b>hook</b> size, whereas roof <b>hooking</b> rates decreased. Gullet <b>hooking</b> was restricted to the three smallest <b>hook</b> sizes. Relative <b>hooking</b> depth and incidences of bleeding were uniformly low for all <b>hook</b> sizes. Similarly, the fish were generally easy to remove from the <b>hook</b> irrespective of <b>hook</b> size. Our mortality projections revealed no trends associated with <b>hook</b> size, our overall mortality rate being less than 1 %. This study suggests that circle <b>hooks</b> function most effectively when the entire <b>hook</b> can fit in the mouth of the fish and when the shank-to-point distance is large enough to permit jaw <b>hooking.</b> Size selectivity for larger individuals can be achieved by using larger <b>hook</b> sizes. However, large circle <b>hooks</b> will also catch smaller fis...|$|R

25|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{different}} types of fish <b>hooks.</b> At the macro level, there are bait <b>hooks,</b> fly <b>hooks</b> and lure <b>hooks.</b> Within these broad categories there are wide varieties of <b>hook</b> types designed for different applications. <b>Hook</b> types differ in shape, materials, points and barbs, and eye type and ultimately in their intended application. When individual <b>hook</b> types are designed the specific characteristics of each of these <b>hook</b> components are optimized relative to the <b>hook's</b> intended purpose. For example, a delicate dry fly <b>hook</b> is made of thin wire with a tapered eye because weight is the overriding factor. Whereas Carlisle or Aberdeen light wire bait <b>hooks</b> make use of thin wire to reduce injury to live bait but the eyes are not tapered because weight is not an issue. Many factors contribute to <b>hook</b> design, including corrosion resistance, weight, strength, <b>hooking</b> efficiency, and whether the <b>hook</b> is being used for specific types of bait, on different types of lures or for different styles of flies. For each <b>hook</b> type, there are ranges of acceptable sizes. For all types of <b>hooks,</b> sizes range from 32 (the smallest) to 20/0 (the largest).|$|R
5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} <b>hooked</b> sharply downwards, while the heavy lower mandible <b>hooked</b> sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E
5|$|The spines of cacti {{are often}} useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, {{as well as}} in whether all the spines {{produced}} by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most spines are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened spines (e.g. Schlerocactus papyracanthus). Other cacti have <b>hooked</b> spines. Sometimes, one or more central spines are <b>hooked,</b> while outer spines are straight (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).|$|E

50|$|The big {{breakthrough}} George de Mestral {{made was}} {{to think about}} hook-and-eye closures on a greatly reduced scale. <b>Hook</b> and eye fasteners have been common for centuries, but what was new about <b>hook</b> and loop fasteners was the miniaturisation of the <b>hooks</b> and eyes. Shrinking the <b>hooks</b> led to the two other important differences. Firstly, instead of a single-file line of <b>hooks,</b> touch fasteners have a two-dimensional surface. This was needed, because in decreasing {{the size of the}} <b>hooks,</b> the strength was also unavoidably lessened, thus requiring more <b>hooks</b> for the same strength. The other difference is that <b>hook</b> and loop has indeterminate match-up between the <b>hooks</b> and eyes. With larger <b>hook</b> and eye fasteners, each <b>hook</b> has its own eye. On a scale as small as that of <b>hook</b> and loop fasteners, matching up each of these <b>hooks</b> with the corresponding eye is impractical, thus leading to the indeterminate matching.|$|R

50|$|The <b>hook</b> {{point is}} {{probably}} {{the most important part of}} the <b>hook.</b> It is the point that must penetrate fish flesh and secure the fish. The profile of the <b>hook</b> point and its length influence how well the point penetrates. The barb influences how far the point penetrates, how much pressure is required to penetrate and ultimately the holding power of the <b>hook.</b> <b>Hook</b> points are mechanically (ground) or chemically sharpened. Some <b>hooks</b> are barbless. Historically, many ancient fish <b>hooks</b> were barbless, but today a barbless <b>hook</b> is used to make <b>hook</b> removal and fish release less stressful on the fish. <b>Hook</b> points are also described relative to their offset from the <b>hook</b> shank. A kirbed <b>hook</b> point is offset to the left, a straight point has no offset and a reversed point is offset to the right. Care needs to be taken when handling <b>hooks</b> as they can 'hook' the user. If a <b>hook</b> goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling the <b>hook</b> out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a <b>hook.</b> The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of the <b>hook</b> off and then push the remainder of the <b>hook</b> through the flesh and the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the <b>hook</b> out the way it came in.|$|R

5000|$|Adding {{a trailer}} <b>hook</b> or [...] "stinger" [...] <b>hook</b> (either a single or treble <b>hook)</b> behind the main spinnerbait <b>hook</b> {{is also a}} {{personal}} preference and may ensure a better hookup as well preventing fish that jump from throwing the bait. Some anglers prefer the single <b>hook</b> to be rigged so that the point is down, especially in open-water situations. Others prefer it rigged point-up. In either case the <b>hook</b> must be prevented from coming off the main <b>hook</b> or grabbing weeds. One way to accomplish this is to use rubber or silicone tubing cut to 1/8", inserting {{the eye of the}} trailer <b>hook</b> and forcing the main <b>hook</b> through the tube-covered eye. The trailer <b>hook</b> is now fixed stationary behind the main <b>hook.</b> Another way allows the <b>hook</b> more side to side motion and consists of stops above and below the eye placed on the main <b>hook.</b> These stops can be 1/8-inch cut silicone tubing or disks hole-punched from the plastic lid of a coffee can or wide rubber bands and placed above and below the trailer <b>hook</b> eye encircling the main <b>hook.</b>|$|R
