5|$|One temnospondyl, the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis, {{may have}} brooded young {{in an area}} between the gills called the {{pharyngeal}} pouch. Small bones belonging to younger Trimerorhachis individuals {{have been found in}} these pouches. The living Darwin's Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for <b>its</b> <b>young</b> in this way. An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic, eating <b>its</b> <b>young</b> like many amphibians do today. If this was the case, the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} Ciomadul {{could be a}} still active volcano was first {{proposed}} in 1780 {{on the basis of}} <b>its</b> <b>young</b> appearance and the release of gas.

5|$|Several {{species of}} Tapeigaster flies have been {{collected}} from the fruit bodies, including T.cinctipes, T.annulipes, and T.nigricornis; the latter species uses the fruit bodies as a host to rear <b>its</b> <b>young.</b> Fruit bodies in Springbrook National Park have been observed to attract nocturnal insects such as beetles, native cockroaches and crickets (white-kneed cricket (Papuastus spp.) and thorny cricket), as well as giant rainforest snails (Hedleyella falconeri) and red triangle slugs (Triboniophorus graeffei), which voraciously consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds <b>its</b> <b>young</b> foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{feeds on}} carrion and locates {{carcasses}} by sight and by smell, an ability which {{is rare in}} birds. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the king vulture, to open the hides of larger animal carcasses, as its bill is {{not strong enough to}} do this. Like other New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed vulture utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on flat surfaces, such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds <b>its</b> <b>young</b> by regurgitation.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{recorded}} {{information on the}} Lānai hookbill's breeding behavior. However, the other Hawaiian honeycreepers are remarkably uniform in their breeding behavior, and it is therefore likely that the hookbills also bred from early winter {{through the end of}} summer in August, with pair bonding being completed by January or February. The males likely defended a territory that moved along with his bonded female and became a centered around the nest after the female constructed it. It is hypothesized that the hookbill laid two to three eggs and that <b>its</b> <b>young</b> were altricial.|$|E
5|$|These {{advantages}} {{offset the}} high stress, physical exertion costs, and other {{risks of the}} migration. Predation can be heightened during migration: Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to <b>its</b> <b>young.</b> A similar strategy is adopted by the greater noctule bat, which preys on nocturnal passerine migrants. The higher concentrations of migrating birds at stopover sites make them prone to parasites and pathogens, which require a heightened immune response.|$|E

5|$|On 24 November 2008, 14 league {{games into}} the 2008–09 season, Fàbregas was named as the {{successor}} to William Gallas as club captain. However, just as Arsenal were getting back into the title race after a poor start to the season, the Spaniard was ruled out for four months after sustaining a knee injury against Liverpool. The Gunners eventually finished the season without any silverware, coming in fourth {{in the league and}} being knocked out at the semi-finals of the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. In tandem with Arsenal's policy to groom <b>its</b> <b>young</b> players, the team that Fàbregas led into the new season consisted mostly of the same young nucleus as before, with the likes of Nicklas Bendtner, Gaël Clichy, Abou Diaby, Denílson, Samir Nasri, Alex Song and Theo Walcott in tow.|$|E
5|$|Péron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water {{and on the ground}} under the shade of a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend <b>its</b> <b>young</b> from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Some of Aristotle's {{observations}} were not taken seriously by science {{until they were}} independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 Le Règne Animal. Aristotle {{also noted that the}} young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a placenta (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, too, that a river catfish which he called the glanis cares for <b>its</b> <b>young,</b> as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to be correct in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to <b>its</b> <b>young</b> to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} is very {{sensitive}} to human activity when rearing <b>its</b> <b>young.</b> No institution, for example, has successfully raised giant otter cubs unless parents were provided sufficient privacy measures; the stress caused by human visual and acoustic interference can lead to neglect, abuse and infanticide, as well as decreased lactation. In the wild, it has been suggested, although not systematically confirmed, that tourists cause similar stresses: disrupted lactation and denning, reduced hunting, and habitat abandonment are all risks. This sensitivity is matched by a strong protectiveness towards the young. All group members may aggressively charge intruders, including boats with humans in them.|$|E

5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on <b>its</b> <b>young,</b> reflective surface and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through venting of water vapor. Readings from Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.|$|E
5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for <b>its</b> <b>young</b> age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E
