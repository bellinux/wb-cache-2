5|$|During gunnery {{training}} on 5 May, {{there was a}} premature detonation in the left gun of Hyūgas Turret No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen. Both aft magazines were flooded to douse the resulting fire and save the ship. She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25mm gun mounts were positioned. On 11 May a valve in <b>Ises</b> No. 2 engine room stuck {{in the open position}} and flooded the engine room. While under repair at Kure, both ships received prototype Type 21 radars. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time that}} most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{ships were}} {{generally}} not camouflaged. In special tactical situations, camouflage could be improvised, {{as when the}} battleships Yamato and Musashi had their decks blackened {{with a mixture of}} soot to help them hide while passing through the San Bernardino Strait at night in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf. Japanese ships largely retained their pre-war dark gray paint scheme, although some major units like aircraft carriers changed to a dark sea green. Some aircraft carriers had their flight decks painted in a dazzle camouflage, but this seems to have been ineffective. By 1945, with the remnants of the Japanese Navy seeking to hide from American air power, its battleships were painted in a variety of camouflage measures. Haruna for example wore olive green overall, its turrets painted light green with gray stripes, whereas <b>Ises</b> olive dress was broken up with patches of gray, red-brown, yellow, and dark green.|$|E
5|$|Following Theodore's coronation, {{there were}} four rulers who claimed the {{imperial}} title and vied for control of Constantinople: Theodore, the Latin Emperor, Robert of Courtenay, John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea, and the young but ambitious John II Asen (r. 1218–41) of Bulgaria. The Latin Empire was a shadow of its former strength: following Poimanenon, the Latins had lost most of their territories in Asia, while in Europe, it was soon reduced to the environs of Constantinople itself. Already in 1224, {{or at least in}} 1225, Theodore captured Chalcidice with Mount Athos, and in spring 1225, he advanced through eastern Macedonia and western Thrace, seizing Christopolis, Xanthi, Gratianopolis, Mosynopolis and Didymoteicho. In an attempt to pre-empt him and block his advance onto Constantinople, the Nicaeans had answered the summons of the inhabitants of Adrianople and taken over the city from the Latins. Theodore however crossed the Evros River and blockaded the city, until it agreed to surrender. The Nicaean army, under the protostrator John <b>Ises</b> and John Kammytzes, was allowed to withdraw unmolested to Asia with ships provided by Theodore.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} turned into {{floating}} AA batteries {{over the next}} several months although it availed them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July. On the 24th Ise was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded. The bombs started numerous leaks and Ise began to settle by the bow, although she was returned to an even keel after three days pumping. Hyūga was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses. She was badly damaged with some 200-odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack. She slowly foundered over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later. This time it was <b>Ises</b> turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list. The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} types of cis-acting RNA {{sequence}} elements present in pre-mRNAs and they have corresponding trans-acting RNA-binding proteins. Splicing silencers are sites to which splicing repressor proteins bind, reducing {{the probability that a}} nearby site will be used as a splice junction. These can be located in the intron itself (intronic splicing silencers, ISS) or in a neighboring exon (exonic splicing silencers, ESS). They vary in sequence, {{as well as in the}} types of proteins that bind to them. The majority of splicing repressors are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) such as hnRNPA1 and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB). Splicing enhancers are sites to which splicing activator proteins bind, increasing the probability that a nearby site will be used as a splice junction. These also may occur in the intron (intronic splicing enhancers, ISE) or exon (exonic splicing enhancers, ESE). Most of the activator proteins that bind to <b>ISEs</b> and ESEs are members of the SR protein family. Such proteins contain RNA recognition motifs and arginine and serine-rich (RS) domains.|$|E
500|$|The {{first six}} years of the IB Diploma Programme, with {{a limited number of}} students, are {{referred}} to as the [...] "experimental period". Each school was to be inspected by <b>ISES</b> or IBO and had to be approved by their government. The experimental period ended in 1975, and in that year, the International Baccalaureate North America (IBNA) was established as a separate entity, allowing the funding for implementation of the IBDP to remain in the country rather than being sent to Geneva. The first official guide to the programme containing its syllabus and official assessment information was published in 1970 and included the theory of knowledge course. The extended essay was introduced in 1978, but creativity, action, service (CAS), although mentioned in guides beforehand, was not specifically identified in the guide until 1989.|$|E

500|$|By 1964, {{international}} educators such as Alec Peterson (director of the Department of Education at Oxford University), Harlan Hanson (director of the College Board Advanced Placement Program), Desmond Cole (director of United Nations International School in New York) and Desmond Cole-Baker (head of the International School of Geneva) {{founded the}} International Schools Examination Syndicate (<b>ISES).</b> Cole and Hanson brought experience with college entrance examinations in the United States, and Hanson, in particular, brought his experience {{from a long}} relationship with the College Board. According to Peterson, [...] "the breakthrough {{in the history of}} the IB" [...] came in 1965 with a grant from the Twentieth Century Fund, which commissioned Martin Mayer, author of The Schools, to produce a report on the feasibility of establishing a common curriculum and examination for international schools that would be acceptable for entry to universities worldwide. This led to conferences involving Ecolint, United World College of the Atlantic (UWC Atlantic College), and others in the spring and fall of 1965, at which details about the curriculum for the Diploma Programme were discussed and agreed upon.|$|E
500|$|The Ford Foundation grant, secured in 1966, funded Peterson's {{study at}} Oxford University, {{which focused on}} three issues: a {{comparative}} analysis of [...] "secondary educational programmes in European countries...in cooperation with the Council of Europe"; university expectations for secondary students intending to enter university; and a [...] "statistical comparison of IB pilot examination results with...national school leaving examinations such as British A Levels and US College Board (AP) Tests". As {{a result of the}} study and the curriculum model developed at UWC Atlantic College, Peterson initiated the pattern of combining [...] "general education with specialization", which melded with the curricula of the United States and Canada, and became the [...] "curriculum framework" [...] proposed at the UNESCO conference in Geneva in 1967. Late in 1967, <b>ISES</b> was restructured and renamed the IB Council of Foundation, and John Goormaghtigh became the first president in January 1968. In 1967, the group, which by then also included Ralph Tyler, identified eight schools to be used for the experimentation of the curriculum.|$|E
500|$|Upon commissioning, {{the sister}} ships were {{assigned}} to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet. Hyūga had an explosion in one of her main gun turrets that killed 11 men and injured 25 in 1919; the following year she accidentally collided with and sank a schooner, losing two crewmen. Before the start of the Pacific War, both ships frequently exercised off the coasts of the Soviet Union, Korea and China in addition to training in Japanese waters. Ise hosted Edward, Prince of Wales, and his aide-de-camp Lieutenant Louis Mountbatten in 1922 during the prince's visit to Japan. In Korea Bay when the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake struck, they sailed to Kyushu where they loaded supplies from for the victims on 4 September. Together with two other battleships and a pair of light cruisers, Ise sank the destroyer [...] in 1926 during gunnery practice. <b>Ises</b> AA armament was upgraded in 1931 and Hyūgas two years later. The latter ship was modernized in 1934–36 and Ise in 1935–37, both at Kure Naval Arsenal. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the sisters frequently patrolled the Chinese coast in support of the blockade imposed by Japan. In August 1937 Hyūga ferried two battalions of Special Naval Landing Forces to Port Arthur. Three years later, she served as the flagship [...] for the Emperor of the puppet state of Manchukuo, Henry Pu-yi, during his state visit to Japan in June 1940. On 15 November the ships were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet. The sisters were refitted in late 1940 in preparation for war, which included the fitting of external degaussing coils and additional AA directors.|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} green tea ingestion and interval sprinting exercise on body and abdominal fat of overweight males was investigated. Participants {{were randomly assigned}} into control (C), green tea (GT), interval sprinting exercise (<b>ISE),</b> and green tea and <b>ISE</b> (GT + <b>ISE)</b> groups. The GT, GT + <b>ISE,</b> and C groups consumed three GT capsules daily. The <b>ISE</b> and GT + <b>ISE</b> groups completed 36 <b>ISE</b> sessions over 12 weeks. Forty eight overweight males with a mean BMI of 28. 5 ± 0. 92 kg/m 2 and age of 26 ± 0. 7 years acted as participants. There was {{a significant reduction in}} total and abdominal fat mass for the <b>ISE</b> and GT + <b>ISE</b> groups, p < 0. 05, however, total and abdominal fat mass did not significantly change in the GT and C groups. There was a significant increase in total lean mass, p < 0. 05, after the intervention for the <b>ISE</b> and GT + <b>ISE</b> groups only.

40|$|SummaryPlasmodesmata (PD) {{transport}} developmentally important {{nucleic acids}} and proteins between plant cells [1 – 3]. Primary PD form during cell division and are simple, linear channels [4, 5]. Secondary PD form in existing cell walls after cell division and are simple, twinned, or branched [4]. PD function undergoes a marked reduction at the mid-torpedo stage of Arabidopsis embryogenesis [6]. Two mutants, increased size exclusion limit (<b>ise)</b> 1 and <b>ise</b> 2, fail to undergo this transition, and their null mutations are embryonically lethal [7,  8]. We investigated the ultrastructure of PD in early-, mid-, and late-torpedo-stage embryos and in young leaves. Wild-type (WT) embryos contain twinned and branched (T/B) PD at all stages, but <b>ise</b> 1 and <b>ise</b> 2 embryos contain significantly higher proportions of T/B PD than WT embryos. WT T/B PD formation {{occurs in a}} stage- and tissue-specific pattern that is reversed in <b>ise</b> 1 embryos. Silencing <b>ISE</b> 1 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves increases the frequency of secondary PD in existing cell walls. Silencing <b>ISE</b> 2 increases the proportion of T/B secondary PD formed. Silenced tissues exhibit increased PD-mediated movement of green fluorescent protein tracers. Thus, silencing of <b>ISE</b> 1 and <b>ISE</b> 2 phenocopies <b>ise</b> 1 and <b>ise</b> 2 mutant embryos: when wild-type <b>ISE</b> 1 and <b>ISE</b> 2 functions are lost, de novo production of PD occurs, leading to increased intercellular transport...|$|R
