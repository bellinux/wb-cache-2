5|$|The Duke {{eventually}} led his untrained and ill-equipped {{troops out of}} Bridgwater at around 10:00pm to undertake a night-time attack on the King's army. They were guided by Richard Godfrey, the servant of a local farmer, along the old Bristol road towards Bawdrip. With their limited cavalry in the vanguard, they turned south along Bradney Lane and Marsh Lane {{and came to the}} open moor with its deep and dangerous rhynes (<b>drainage</b> <b>ditches).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{main road}} in the town is the A39 which passes through Glastonbury from Wells {{connecting}} the town with Street and the M5 motorway. The other roads around the town are small and run across the levels generally following the <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches.</b> Local bus services are provided by WebberBus, Nippy Bus, National Express and local community groups. Glastonbury's bus services have suffered in cuts made from 2012 to 2014. The main routes are to Bristol via Wells, to Bridgwater, to Yeovil via Street and to Taunton.|$|E
5|$|There is {{some concern}} that {{areas of the}} Moss have been damaged or partly {{destroyed}} {{as a result of}} agricultural activity, including the digging of <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches.</b> Natural England, the agency responsible for the management of SSSIs in England, has suggested that no further irrigation channels should be dug, existing ones should not be deepened, and that the area should not be exposed to fertilisers or surface water run-off. Natural England further notes that the site's continued status as an SSSI depends on maintaining a high water table.|$|E

5|$|Several rivers, {{including}} the Parrett, Brue and Washford, drain into the bay. Man-made <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> from the Somerset Levels, {{including the}} River Huntspill, also {{run into the}} bay. The mud flats provide a habitat {{for a wide range}} of flora and fauna. These include some nationally rare plants, beetles and snails. It is particularly important for over-wintering waders and wildfowl, with approximately 190 species recorded including whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope). Fishing has taken place using shallow boats, known as flatners, and fixed wooden structures for hundreds of years. It was also the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing'. There are several small harbours along the coast.|$|E
5|$|The Holderness {{landscape}} {{is dominated by}} deposits of till, boulder clays and glacial lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form {{a more or less}} continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial landscape features such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area. The well drained glacial deposits provide fertile soils that can support intensive arable cultivation. Fields are generally large and bounded by <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches.</b> There is very little woodland in the area and this leads to a landscape that is essentially rural but very flat and exposed.|$|E
5|$|The South Forty-Foot Drain and the Black Sluice pumping station, {{together}} {{with most of}} the side channels which run into the drain are the responsibility of the Environment Agency. Management of the <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> which drain the Fens are the responsibility of the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board, who maintain 34 pumping stations and three gravity stations in the region. Of these, 21 are situated {{on the banks of the}} Drain, and pump directly into it, while one, the Black Hole Drove pumping station, is constructed over the channel, and acts as a boundary between the part of the Drain managed by the Environment Agency, and that managed by the Drainage Board.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of drains that connect to the River Witham and that are {{protected}} by flood doors. These consist of a single pair of mitre gates that are designed to close if the level in the river rises above the level in the drain. Several of these are navigable to the more adventurous boater. The river is also joined by the Kyme Eau, which connects to the Sleaford Navigation on which navigation will eventually be restored to Sleaford. At Antons Gowt, a lock drops down into the Witham Navigable Drains, a system of <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> which are used to prevent flooding of the fens to the north of Boston. Since November 2008 there has been an active campaign by the Billinghay Skirth Regeneration Society to restore navigation on the River Skirth, and the project has won the support of Billinghay and other parish councils, the Inland Waterways Association, the Environment Agency, Lincolnshire County Council and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch</b> is {{important}} for the plain reservoir, the water table in the dam foundation outside the enclosed dam can be lowered by the ditch, and some leakage water can be pumped from the ditch return to the reservoir. So the design of the <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch</b> {{is the key to the}} plain reservoir. The finite element method is used to investigate the effects of the position, width, depth and the relief well of the <b>ditch</b> on the <b>drainage</b> effects. The results show that the drainage flow is proportional to the depth of the <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch,</b> and is inversely proportional to the distance between the ditch and dam, and the relief well can increase the drainage flow and lower the grounder water table...|$|R

25|$|Beyond Guthram Gowt, {{the river}} flows in a north-easterly direction, and is flanked {{on both sides}} by <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> because the land is low-lying.

25|$|Manitoba has {{an extreme}} climate, but {{southern}} latitudes allow agriculture. The northern {{area of the}} region ranges from coniferous forests to muskeg to tundra in the far north. Before settlement had occurred, a vast portion of southern Manitoba was either flood plain or swamp. An extensive system for <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> was required throughout south-central Manitoba to make the region suitable for cultivation.|$|E

50|$|Work on the <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch</b> {{from the}} swamp to the St. Marys River began on September 20, 1891. Captain Henry Jackson, the {{president}} of the company, and his crews spent three years digging the Suwannee Canal 11.5 mi into the swamp. Work was slow due to various problems. The sides of the <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch</b> collapsed because of poor engineering design and bad weather. Leased convict labor, large steam shovels, and finally gold miners from north Georgia using large water hoses were unable to dig the ditch deep enough through an area known as Trail Ridge to drain the swamp.|$|R
25|$|The largest bog on L√ºneburg Heath is the Pietzmoor, {{which lies}} east of Schneverdingen. It was drained however and peat was cut {{there until the}} 1960s. The Nature Park Association carried out work in the 1980s to try to turn it back to its natural {{waterlogged}} state. For example, some of the <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> were filled {{which led to a}} considerable rise in the water levels of the former peat cuts. However typical bog vegetation has not yet re-established itself.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of {{the trade}} argue that {{developing}} countries utilize methods that are more harmful and more wasteful. An expedient and prevalent method is simply to toss equipment onto an open fire, in order to melt plastics and to burn away non-valuable metals. This releases carcinogens and neurotoxins into the air, contributing to an acrid, lingering smog. These noxious fumes include dioxins and furans. Bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies.|$|E
25|$|A {{network of}} roads, bridges, and narrow gauge {{railways}} {{was created to}} connect excavation sites with the nearby railway stations. Prisoners were reloading building materials, cutting trees, digging reservoirs and <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches.</b> Small dams were built across streams to create water supplies and sewage systems. Later the rocks of the mountains were drilled and blasted with explosives and the resulting caverns were reinforced by concrete and steel. For this purpose mining specialists were employed, mostly Germans, Italians, Ukrainians, and Czechs but the most dangerous and exhausting work was done by prisoners.|$|E
