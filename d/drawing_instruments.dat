He completed his apprenticeship in 1913 and obtained a position as assistant engineer to the Pontypridd and Rhondda Valley Joint Water Board, he did not enjoy this routine work and disliked his district. To continue his interest in civil engineering he began a master of science dissertation on masonry dams which he wrote at evenings and weekends. [...] This was submitted to his alma mater in April 1914, was approved and he subsequently received his MSc.|$|E
60|$|He fetched his <b>drawing</b> <b>instruments,</b> rods, sketching-blocks {{and other}} {{articles}} {{from the field}} where they had lain, and was passing under the walls with them in his hands, when there emerged from the outer archway an open landau, drawn {{by a pair of}} black horses of fine action and obviously strong pedigree, in which Paula was seated, under the shade of a white parasol with black and white ribbons fluttering on the summit. The morning sun sparkled on the equipage, its newness being made all the more noticeable by the ragged old arch behind.|$|E

A big box carried an iron wash-basin, and a small table some <b>drawing</b> <b>instruments.</b> Lister was not fastidious, and, as a rule, did not stop long enough at one spot to justify his making his shack comfortable. Besides, he found it necessary to concentrate on his work, and had not much time to think about refinements.|$|E

These include curves constructed {{by means of a}} <b>drawing</b> <b>instrument</b> composed of several rulers; a <b>drawing</b> <b>instrument</b> designed for the hyperbola and its different variations, in which the guiding line is replaced by one of conics in a special position.

All drawings are made in Cabri Geometry II and are accompanied by a derivation of the equations of the resulting curves.
