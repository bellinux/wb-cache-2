In a crossing situation, the stand-on vessel should avoid turning to port even if the <b>give-way</b> <b>vessel</b> is not taking appropriate action. These options for the stand-on vessel do not relieve the <b>give-way</b> <b>vessel</b> of her obligations under the rules.|$|E

5000|$|The stand-on vessel {{must hold}} a steady course and speed but be {{prepared}} to take late avoiding action to prevent an actual collision if the other vessel does not do so in time. The <b>give-way</b> <b>vessel</b> must take early, positive and obvious avoiding action, without crossing ahead of the other vessel. (Rules 16-17) ...|$|E
40|$|How {{to handle}} traffic {{situations}} is different between a merchant vessel and a fishing vessel when {{the latter is}} engaged in fishing. A merchant vessel navigates from port A to port B, while fishing vessels when they are fishing, have {{to keep track of}} ships around as well as the trawl with respect {{to the nature of the}} bottom. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven commercial fishermen from Gothenburg, engaged in trawling, to get the background to fishermen's actions in close-quarters situations and to give recommendations to the bridge officers so they can make more accurate assessments in a meeting with a fishing vessel. Among other questions, questions about how often a person will be assigned the task as a look out, how a fishing vessel has the ability to maintain course and speed in a close-quarters situation and what the fishermen believe to be the best action to avoid collision, were asked. What fishermen considered primarily as difficult, was the ability to take evasive action if there is a risk of collision and they would be forced to turn to because of the <b>give-way</b> <b>vessel</b> is not taking timely action. Likewise, the ability to maintain course and speed as the other vessel is give-way, and the fishing vessel under COLREG must keep course and speed...|$|E
40|$|Applications of {{autonomous}} marine vehicles in dynamic and uncertain environments continuously grow as research unveils new enabling technology and academic, commercial, and government entities pursue new marine autonomy concepts. The safe operation of these {{vehicles in the}} marine domain, which is currently dominated by human-operated vehicles, demands compliance with collision avoidance protocol, namely the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS). Strict application of this protocol {{can lead to a}} highly constrained motion planning problem, in which it is difficult for a vehicle to identify a safe and efficient motion plan. This thesis proposes a multi-objective optimization-based method for COLREGS-compliant autonomous surface vehicle collision avoidance in which vehicles use shared intent information, in addition to vehicle state information, to identify safe and efficient collision avoidance maneuvers. The proposed method uses intent information to relax certain COLREGS-specified constraints with the goal of providing sufficient maneuvering flexibility to enable improvements in safety and efficiency over a non-intent-aware system. In order to arrive at an intent-aware solution, this thesis explores the concept of intent, including intent formulations for the marine domain, intent communications, and the application of intent to the COLREGS-compliant motion planning problem. Two types of intent information are specifically evaluated: COLREGS mode intent, in which the <b>give-way</b> <b>vessel</b> in an overtaking or crossing scenario communicates its intent to maneuver in a certain direction with respect the stand-on vessel, and discrete trajectory intent in which vehicles communicate projected future positions. Simulations and on-water experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed intent-aware method, as well as improvements in performance, in terms of both vehicle safety and mission efficiency, over a non-intent-aware, COLREGS-compliant collision avoidance method. by Joseph William Leavitt.
