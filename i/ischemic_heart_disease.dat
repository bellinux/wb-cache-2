A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In most countries, {{cardiovascular}} diseases {{are the leading}} disorders, with <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> being {{the leading cause of}} death. According to WHO data, every year about 17 million people die of {{cardiovascular diseases}}, which is 30 % of all deaths. <b>Ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> contribute from one-third to one-half of all deaths due to cardiovascular diseases. Three point eight million men and 3. 4 million women in the world die every year from <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> and in Europe about 2 million. The highest mortality rate from <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> occurs in India, China and Russia. OBJECTIVE The aim of this descriptive epidemiological study was to determine heart attack mortality in Belgrade population during the period 1990 - 2004. METHOD In the study, we conducted investigation of Belgrade population during the period 1990 - 2004. Mortality data were obtained from the city institution for statistics. The mortality rates were calculated based on the total Belgrade population obtained from the mean values for the last two register years (1991 and 2002). The mortality rates were standardized using the direct method of standardization according to the world (Segi) standard population. RESULTS In the Belgrade population during the period 1990 - 2004, the participation of mortality rate due to heart attack among deaths from cardiovascular diseases was 17 % in males and 10 % in females. In Belgrade male population, mean standardized mortality rates (per 100, 000 habitants) were 50. 5 for heart attack, 8. 3 for chronic <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> and 4. 6 for angina pectoris, while in females the rates were 30. 8, 6. 7 and 4. 2, respectively. Mortality from <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> and from <b>heart</b> attack was higher in males than in females. During the studied 15 -year period, on average 755 males and 483 females died due to heart attack every year. Mean standardized mortality rates per 100, 000 habitants were 50. 0 in male and 31. 1 in female population. Males died 1. 6 times more frequently from heart attack than females. During the studied period, mean standardized mortality rates from heart attack, in the population aged over 30 increased with age both in male and female population. However, males tended to die from heart attack at an earlier age than females, with death rates for males approximately the same as those for women who were 10 years older. CONCLUSION In Belgrade during the period from 1990 - 2004, we found that there was an increasing trend in mortality rate due to cardiovascular diseases, while the trend of mortality rate from heart attack was constant with insignificant oscillations...|$|R

40|$|We {{collated}} and analysed {{data from}} hospital records regarding {{the cause of}} death of 18, 385 patients with diabetes who died in 282 medical institutions throughout Japan over the 10 -year period between 1991 and 2000. Autopsy was carried out in 1750 cases. The most frequent cause of death in all 18, 385 cases was malignant neoplasia, accounting for 34. 1 % of cases, followed by vascular dis-eases (including diabetic nephropathy, <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> and cerebrovascular diseases) in 26. 8 %, infections in 14. 3 %, and then diabetic coma in 1. 2 %. The most common malignancy was liver cancer, accounting for 8. 6 % of all the deaths. Of the deaths from vascular diseases, diabetic nephropathy was {{the cause of death}} in 6. 8 % of cases, and the frequency as cause of death for <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> and cerebrovascular diseases were similar at 10. 2 % and 9. 8 %, respectively. Myocardial infarction accounted for almost all the deaths from <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> whereas deaths from cerebral infarction were 2. 2 -fold as common as those from cerebral hemorrhage. In the analyses of the relationship between age and causes of death in diabetic patients who underwent autopsy, the overall mortality rate as a result of vascular diseases increased with age, although the mortality rates from diabetic nephropathy and cerebrovascular diseases increased little from the fifth decade of life. The mortality rate from <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> increased with age, however, and was higher than the other forms of vascular diseases from the sixth decade of life, accounting for approximately 50 % of vascular deaths in the eighth decade.

40|$|O objetivo desta investigação foi o de estudar a influência do treinamento físico sistemático sobre a auto-imagem em adultos de média idade, portadores ou não de cardiopatia isquêmica. Oitenta indivíduos do sexo masculino, entre quarenta e sessenta e cinco anos de idade, clientes de clínicas especializadas em cardiologia, da cidade de Porto Alegre, foram divididos em quatro grupos caracterizados como: portadores de cardiopatia isquêmica não submetidos a treinamento físico sistemático; portadores de cardiopatia isquêmica submetidos a treinamento físico sistemático; não portadores de cardiopatia isquêmica não submetidos a treinamento físico sistemático e não portadores de cardiopatia isquêmica submetidos a treinamento físico sistemático. O instrumento utilizado foi baseado no questionário de auto-imagem e auto-estima de Steglich (1978), para indivíduos de terceira idade. Foram selecionados os itens referentes apenas a escala de auto-imagem, sendo que a fidedignidade e validade do instrumento foram determinadas pelo estudo piloto. Para a análise estatística dos dados foi utilizado o Teste U de Mann-Whitney, sendo que os resultados indicaram: - Os indivíduos portadores de cardiopatia isquêmica submetidos a treinamento físico sistemático, apresentam níveis mais elevados de auto-imagem que os indivíduos porta dores de cardiopatia isquêmica não submetidos a treinamento físico sistemático. - Os indivíduos portadores de cardiopatia isquêmica submetidos a treinamento físico sistemático, apresentam níveis mais elevados de auto-imagem que os indivíduos não portadores de cardiopatia isquêmica não submetidos a treinamento físico sistemático. - Não houve diferença estatisticamente significativa nos níveis de auto-imagem entre os indivíduos não portadores de cardiopatia isquêmica submetidos a treinamento físico sistemático e os indivíduos não portadores de cardiopatia isquêmica não submetidos a treinamento físico sistemático. The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the influence of systematic physical training upon the self-image of middle age adults with and without <b>ischemic</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> The subjects were eighty males, aged between forty and sixty-five years.

To gather the data a self-image questionnaire, was used in this study. This questionnaire was developed based on the self-image part of the self-image and selfestim questionnaire of steglich (1978). The reliability and the validity of the developed questionnaire was determined based on a pilot study. For the statistical analysis of the data the Mann-Whitney "U" Test was employed.

The impact of such conditions on mortality in the post-HAART era has been also assessed in various modes in the literature. In this paper, {{we report on the}} death risks for DM, myocardial infarction, and chronic <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> that were investigated among 9662 Italian AIDS cases diagnosed between 1999 and 2005. Death certificates reporting DM, myocardial infarction, and chronic <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> were reviewed to identify the underlying cause of death, and to compare the observed numbers of deaths with the expected ones from the sex- and age-matched, general population of Italy. Person-years at risk of death were computed from date of AIDS diagnosis up to date of death or to December 31, 2006. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were computed. DM and cardiovascular diseases were the cause of death for 43 out of 3101 deceased AIDS cases (i. e., 1. 4 % of all deaths). In comparison with the general population, the risks of death were 6. 4 -fold higher for DM (95 % CI: 3. 5 - 10. 8), 2. 3 -fold higher for myocardial infarction (95 % CI: 1. 4 - 3. 7) and 3. 0 for chronic <b>ischemic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> (95 % CI: 1. 5 - 5. 2) ...|$|R
