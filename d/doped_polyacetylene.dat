The kinetics and the cyclability of this process have been exam-ined by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge curves, and EPR analysis. The results show that, for film-type polyacetylene electrodes, the kinetics are controlled by the diffusion of the dopant species throughout the polymer. This diffusion appears particularly slow from the bulk {{to the surface of}} the polymer so that constant-current charge-discharge cycles of polyacetylene film electrodes may sustain only low rates (i. e., in the range of microamperes per square centimeter), and have a poor coulombic efficiency (i. e., of the order of 50 %). Much better performance is offered by foam-type polyacetylene electrodes, where the intrinsic high porosity produces an improved surface morphology, which in turn favors the diffusion of the dopant species.

The nature of the trapping sites is investigated as well as the influence of alkali atoms in ET. The semiconductor [...] metal transition that appears at high doping levels is examined. One or two polyene chains are taken as model compounds for polyacetylene. In some calculations alkali metal atomswere added. Geometries are optimized keeping restrictions according to crystallographic data. Quantum chemistry methods at different levels of approximation were used. Simple tight-binding and CNDO/S semiempirical methods were used to study large systems. For smaller systems ab initio HF-SCF and correlation corrected methods were used: second-order perturbation theory (MP 2), multiconfigurational-SCF (CASSCF), multiconfigurational second order perturbation (CASPT 2), and state interaction based on CASSCF wave functions (CASSI) methods. It is shown that ET theory can be applied to describe the role of hopping in the electronic conductivity of polyacetylene. It is found that in C n H n+ 2 with even n the reorganization energy. lambda. i is much larger than in systems with odd n. Odd-n polyenes are more ready acceptors of an additional electron.

40|$|Electronic {{excitations}} of polyene cations with chain {{lengths of}} up to 101 CH units were investigated as model systems for lightly <b>doped</b> <b>polyacetylene</b> (PA). Since high level ab initio calculations such as complete active space perturbation theory (CASPT 2) are limited to systems with about 14 CH units, the performances of time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) were evaluated. It turned out that TDDFT excitations energies are much more accurate for polyene cations than for neutral polyenes. The difference between TDHF and TDDFT excitation energies for the first allowed excited state of C 49 H 51 + is only 0. 30 eV with pure DFT and 0. 21 eV with a hybrid functional.

Dipole, quadrupole, and octopole interactions are included in the model with sixfold crystal-field anisotropy and are analyzed within the mean-field theory. The relative strength of these interactions can be estimated from the observed setting angle of the HB phase {{with the help of the}} smallness of crystal-field anisotropy. A model where the polymer chain is represented by a ‘‘quadrupolar’’ mass density only has various phases as the temperature and the interaction parameters are varied. Among them, the HB phase is found below a critical temperature Tc for some range of the parameter space, and the setting angle of the HB phase is 45 ° and independent of temperature. Competition between quadrupole and other interactions such as dipole or octopole, parametrized by the ratio of interaction strengths λ, results in an additional phase transition at T’c(λ) and makes the setting angle vary with the temperature below T’c(λ). For a model with quadrupole and octopole terms, there are two degenerate states of the setting angle related by θ’=π/ 2 -θ. This degeneracy does not reflect a symmetry of the system and is lifted by the dipole terms. For a model with quadrupole and dipole interactions, the setting angle increases as the temperature is reduced below T’c(λ). From these results, we conclude that quadrupole and dipole interactions are important terms to explain experimental observations. Effects of crystal-field anisotropy resolve the twofold degeneracy, destroy the critical behavior associated with T’c(λ), and make the setting angle temperature dependent over the entire range of temperature below Tc. Crucial information on the interaction parameters of the model can be obtained through the temperature dependence of the setting angle of the HB phase...|$|E
40|$|The {{suitably}} <b>doped</b> <b>polyacetylene</b> film can be {{used for}} the conversion of sunlight energy into electrical or chemical energy. A new electrochemical technique was introduced for obtaining polyacetylene film by cathodic initiation of the polymerization process. The advantage of this technique is that the polymerization process can be controlled by the wave form of electrode current and the composition of the solution. Polyacetylene films of different properties and thickness can be conveniently prepared in this way. The catalyst was dissolved in certain organic solvent and introduced into the electrolytic cell. The solution was then cooled flown la low temperature and saturated with acetylene gas before cathodic polymerization. Several transition metals and other electric conducting materials have been used as electrodes. On passing suitable current, red color appeared at the cathode/solution interface and the polyacetylene; film formed gradually. The solvent used may influence the film growing kinetics in the electrochemically initiated polymerization. It must show adequate dielectric constant and be inert toward the ends of the growing chains. Among many solvents studied, DMF is the appropriate one. The influences of electrolysis conditions are remarkable and interesting. The polyacetylene film cannot be formed when the current density is smaller than a critical value. The chain growth may be effectively stopped by reversing the cathodic current to anodic current. This phenomenon provides not only information for the anionic polymerization mechanism but also an effective way to control the chain growth and the properties of the polymer film formed. By passing cathodic/anodic alternative pulses through the electrode, some codeposited impurities can be removed and the length of chain controlled. The effect of electrode materials on the rate of film growing has been studied. Rapid polymerization and thick fain can be obtained for Ni and Cu electrodes. After the electrochemically initiated polymerization process, the polyacetylene film was washed with hydrochloric acid and dried. A silvery and coherent film may be obtained if the film is thick enough. The polyacetylene film was characterized using Raman scattering technique(Fig. 1) and scanning electron microscope (Fig. 2). The morphology of the film depends strongly on the wave form of electrode current. The photovoltaic effect of the polyacetylene film has been measured and detailed studies are under way...|$|E
