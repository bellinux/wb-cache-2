In 1641, wine imports from Chile and the Viceroyalty of Peru into Spain were banned, severely damaging the wine industry in the colony.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} why credit constraints {{for domestic}} and exporting firms arise {{in a setting}} where banks do not observe firms' productivities. To maintain incentive-compatibility, banks lend below the amount needed for first-best production. The longer time needed for <b>export</b> <b>shipments</b> induces a tighter credit constraint on exporters than on purely domestic firms, even in the exporters' home market. Greater risk faced by exporters also affects the credit extended by banks. Extra fixed costs reduce exports on the extensive margin, but can be offset by collateral held by exporting firms. The empirical application to Chinese firms strongly supports these theoretical results, and we find a sizable impact {{of the financial crisis}} in reducing exports. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes {{studying}} export {{frequency of}} firms. While extensive margins {{of products and}} destination define the scope of firm's export, <b>export</b> <b>shipment</b> frequency is determined by sale method choice and cost structure of the trade technology. Exporters optimize the frequency of international trade transactions to save on costs and gain maximum exposure to clients. Their decisions {{can be related to}} a more general problem a la Baumol (1952), where the choice is about the optimal number of transactions in presence of a fixed cost and variable transportation costs. This opens an additional margin of trade: the number of shipments of a firm to a given market in a year. While extensive margins of products and destination define the scope of firm's export, <b>export</b> <b>shipment</b> frequency is determined by sale method choice and cost structure of the trade technology. This paper both presents a framework to think about shipment frequency and analyzes its behavior on French data. We argue that given the decision to export and the anticipated demand, the decision on the number of shipments is guided by the trade technology. In line with the Baumol-Tobin model, the optimal number of shipments will be positively afiected by demand (controlling for distance to destination) and inventory costs and negatively affected by the fixed cost of shipment. Using monthly firm-productdestination level export data from France, we show that key predictions of the model are validated in a gravity model setting that also allows for comparing various margins of trade. During the recent trade collapse, our results point to a strong resilience of export ows despite the drop in demand, which was mainly absorbed at the intensive margin...|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} extent and {{importance}} of rate competition among railroads for the <b>export</b> <b>shipment</b> of three narrowly defined agricultural commodities since passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which increased the railroads' freedom to set rates. I construct measures of intermodal and intramodal competition, and find that each has strong impacts on rail rates. The farther a shipper is from competing water transportation, the more considerably rates rise. Rates fall as railroad competition in a region increases. There appears to be some interaction between intermodal and intramodal competition. I find that the competitive effects of two proposed rail mergers depend on the vigor of intermodal competition from truck and water transport and on the change in interrailroad competition that results from the reduced number of competing rail systems. ...|$|E

40|$|Raisins are an {{important}} export commodity for Afghanistan, however, Afghan packers are challenged to export to markets seeking high quality products due to limited knowledge regarding their quality and safety. To evaluate this, Afghan raisin samples from pre-, semi-, and post-processed raisins were obtained from a raisin packer in Kabul, Afghanistan. The raisins were analyzed and compared to U. S. standards for processed raisins. The samples tested did not meet U. S. import standards for embedded sand, but the process used to clean the raisins is suitable to maintain food safety standards. ^ Previous Afghan raisin shipments have been rejected from the U. S. due to too high levels of internal and external sugar crystals, and pesticide residues. Based on the likelihood of <b>export</b> <b>shipment</b> rejection, the thesis examines the quality improvement options available to packers in the short and long-term. To produce raisins compliant with U.
