5|$|The wind-wind {{collision}} cone {{separates the}} winds of the two stars. For 55–75° behind the secondary, there is a thin <b>hot</b> <b>wind</b> typical of O or Wolf–Rayet stars. This allows some radiation from Eta Carinae B to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to spectral lines that {{are unlikely to be}} produced by any other source. Although the secondary star has never been directly observed, there is widespread agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37,000K and 41,000K.|$|E

The 11-track album was released in February 1984 and sold 45,000 copies in Sweden. According to Gessle, the group's first English-language release {{was in response to}} interest expressed by EMI's American label Capitol Records. Capitol took six of the tracks and released an extended play (EP) record in the US with an abridged title, Heartland, but the company insisted on a different name for the band. Gessle and the other members of Gyllene Tider (Swedish for [...] "Golden Times" [...] or [...] "Golden Age") chose the title of a 1975 Dr. Feelgood song, [...] "Roxette".|$|E

2500|$|The British {{had fought}} the Somaliland Campaign, a twenty-year long {{campaign}} from 1900–1920, against Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and the Dervish state {{to gain control}} over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison {{had been forced to}} retreat to the coast {{until the end of the}} First World War, only ending the insurgency in 1920, after four campaigns by attacking with local troops, a KAR battalion and aircraft. After three weeks of operations the Dervishes were defeated. The colony had an area of about [...] with a plain inland from the coast up to [...] deep, ending at a mountain range an average of [...] high. Agriculture was sparse and the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock. Berbera, the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. Berbera was a first class anchorage and was the principal entrepot of the colony, despite having no port installations and ships having to load and unload by boat. From July to August the Kharif a strong and <b>hot</b> <b>wind</b> blew, making it impossible to work. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion but this was revoked on 19 December 1939, in favour of a defence of the country and of the port of Berbera as a last resort. In 1940, British Somaliland was garrisoned by 631 members of the Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) in five locations and a small party of police at Berbera. The SCC had only rifles, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles, the infantry rifles being old Belgian [...] calibre single-shot models, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality; the SCC had a transport pool of 29 motor vehicles 122 horses and 244 camels.|$|E

40|$|Horizontal {{wind speed}} {{patterns}} above a scarce millet row crop on inhomogeneous sandy soil revealed insufficient protection from <b>hot</b> <b>winds</b> by multiple shelterbelts in semi-arid Northern Nigeria. This appeared mainly due to too high distances between the belts. Marked yield drops occurred with {{distance between the}} belts, in what McNaughton defined (under mechanical damage and microclimate disturbance from strong winds) as the unprotected wake zone. These may, {{in the case of}} <b>hot</b> <b>winds,</b> mainly be attributed to combined negative effects on soil moisture and crop physiology of the combination of turbulence, worsened by the shelterbelts, and advected heat. Other parameters confirm the picture of the wake zone and the quiet zone, the latter also being present windward of the belts in a reduced form. The results have serious consequences for the design rules of multiple shelterbelts and alternatives under African semi-arid conditions...|$|R
