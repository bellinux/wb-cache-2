His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to him being likened to Baron Haussmann and Robert Moses.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{took over}} as manager of Derby County in November 1982, to the great {{surprise}} of {{most people in the}} game.

25|$|Rodezno was acutely {{sensitive}} to threat of revolution and convinced that democracy could not contain it; he responded warmly to authoritarian nationalism, covering {{in his opinion}} a broad spectrum from fascist Benito Mussolini's regime to Ramsay MacDonald’s National Government. Hostile especially to militant republican secularism and agrarian reform, he remained vehement opponent in the parliament and was once hit by a flying glass in return. Touring the country he boasted that “Carlist shock troops are ready to defend society against Marxist threat”. However, he was not among those pressing an insurgent strategy.

25|$|The Skjöldunga saga tells that Sigurd Ring {{was married}} to Alfhild, the {{daughter}} of king Alf of Alfheim, and their son was Ragnar Lodbrok. Unfortunately, Alfhild died. When Sigurd Ring was an old man, he came to Skiringssal {{to take part in}} the great blóts. There he spotted a very beautiful girl named Alfsol, and she was the daughter of King Alf of Vendel (Vendel). The girl's two brothers refused to allow Sigurd to marry her. Sigurd fought with the brothers and killed them, but their sister had been given poison by her brothers so that Sigurd could never have her. When her corpse was carried to Sigurd, he went aboard a large ship where he placed Alvsol and her brothers. Then, <b>he</b> <b>steered</b> the ship with full sails out on the sea, as the ship burnt.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2016, André Gomes and Paco Alcácer were both sold to Barcelona and Shkodran Mustafi was sold to Arsenal, while Ezequiel Garay and former Manchester United player Nani were brought in. Pako Ayestarán was sacked on 21 September 2016 after four-straight defeats at the {{beginning}} of the 2016–17 season. Former Italy national team head coach Cesare Prandelli was hired as his replacement on 28 September. However, he resigned after just three months on 30 December, claiming the club had made him false transfer promises. Days later, on 7 January 2017, Valencia sporting director Jesús García Pitarch also resigned, saying he felt like he was being used as a shield for criticism by the club and that he could not defend something he no longer believed in. Voro was named caretaker manager for the fifth time until the end of season, with Valencia in 17th position and in danger of relegation. However, results improved under Voro and <b>he</b> <b>steered</b> Valencia clear off relegation, ultimately finishing the season in 13th place.

25|$|Plutarch {{clarified}} {{that those}} who were granted a triumph had to stay outside the city until the celebration, while candidates for the consulship had {{to be present in}} the city. The option of registering in absentia through a friend acting on his behalf was turned down and Caesar opted for the consulship. Like Appian, Plutarch wrote that Cato the Younger was the fiercest opponent of Caesar. <b>He</b> <b>steered</b> the other senators towards rejecting the proposal. In both The Life of Cato and The Life of Pompey he wrote that after the agrarian bill was defeated the hard pressed Pompey resorted to seeking the support of the plebeian tribunes and young adventurers, the worse of whom was Publius Clodius Pulcher (see below). In the former he added that Pompey then won the support of Caesar, who attached himself to him. In the latter he wrote that Caesar pursued a policy of conciliating Crassus and Pompey. Therefore, the two texts seem contradictory. In The Life of Caesar he wrote Caesar started his policy to reconcile Pompey and Crassus soon after entered the city. Caesar pursued this policy because they were the most influential men and he told them that by concentrating their united strength on him, they could succeed in changing the form of government.|$|E
25|$|In his youth, MGR and his elder brother, M. G. Chakrapani, became {{members of}} a drama troupe to support their family. Influenced by Gandhian ideals, MGR joined the Indian National Congress.

By the late 1940s he graduated to lead roles and for the next three decades dominated the Tamil film industry. He {{became a member of the}} C. N. Annadurai-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and rapidly rose through its ranks, using his enormous popularity as a film star to build a large political base. In 1972, three years after Annadurai's death, he left the DMK, now led by Karunanidhi, MGR's once friend and now rival, to form his own party—the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). Five years later, <b>he</b> <b>steered</b> an AIADMK-led alliance to victory in the 1977 election, routing the DMK in the process.

40|$|Growth, feed intake, feed {{efficiency}} and carcass traits on 208 yearling Angus steers differing in genetic merit for residual feed intake (RFI) were measured {{in a large}} commercial feedlot. At feedlot entry the steers were drafted into three groups: high efficiency (HE; midparent RFI-EBV ≤- 0. 3 kg/day, medium efficiency (ME: midparent RFI-EBV>- 0. 3 to 0. 14 kg/day), and low efficiency (LE; midparent RFI-EBV ≥ 0. 16 kg/day), and feedlot performance evaluated over 251 days. Whilst individual animal weight and carcass data were collected, daily feed consumption was recorded on a group basis. The <b>HE</b> <b>steers</b> grew as fast or faster than either the ME and LE steers (1. 11 ± 0. 02 (sd) v 1. 06 ± 0. 01 and 1. 07 ± 0. 02 kg/day). At slaughter the HE and ME groups were heavier than the LE group (713 ± 5 and 714 ± 5 v 701 ± 5 kg). The <b>HE</b> <b>steers</b> consumed less feed than the ME and LE steers over the 251 days (10. 4 v 11. 8 and 11. 1 kg/day). Compared to the LE <b>steers,</b> the <b>HE</b> <b>steers</b> had a 10 % lower FCR and 0. 98 kg/day lower RFI. Carcass weight and dressing percentage were lowest in the LE steers, and eye muscle area was highest in the ME steers. Subcutaneous rib fat depth on the carcass was lower in the <b>HE</b> <b>steers</b> than for the ME and LE steers (15. 6 ± 0. 6 v 17. 6 ± 0. 6 and 20. 7 ± 0. 6 mm). AUSMEAT and USDA marbling scores were highest in the ME group and not different for the HE and LE groups. The experiment showed that genetic superiority in RFI reduced feed consumed over 251 days of feeding in a large commercial feedlot with no compromise in weight gain, carcass weight, dressing percentage or marbling grade...|$|R
25|$|Afterwards Dashwood took eight American merchantmen, and on 15 June 1812, he {{captured}} the Hope, a merchant ship off {{the north of}} Gothland. On 14 August 1812 he was appointed captain of HMS Cressy of 74 guns, and given a piece of plate by the officers of HMS Pyramus. After serving in the North Sea under Admiral Sir William Young, Dashwood escorted a convoy to the West Indies, whence he returned with another of equal importance. At {{the review of the}} fleet at Spithead, in the summer of 1814, <b>he</b> <b>steered</b> the Royal barge. Afterwards he took part, commanding HMS Norge of 74 guns, in the Battle of New Orleans, where he assisted Admiral Pulteney Malcolm in the debarkation of the army, being reported by Sir Alexander Cochrane. He was also present at the Battle of Lake Borgne, where a few gunboats of the Norge, in company with other small vessels, captured five American gunboats. In 1815, when at anchor in Port Royal, his ship was struck by lightning, which broke the main-topgallant-mast in three pieces, shivered the maintop-mast and brought the mizentop-mast and topgallant-mast down on to deck. In 1821 he was given command of HMS Windsor Castle of 74 guns, and HMS Impregnable, of 104 guns, as Cochrane's flag-captain. He recommissioned Windsor Castle on 4 January 1822, as part of the guard-ships in Hamoaze. In 1825 he was put onto half-pay, and was made a rear-admiral on 22 July 1830. He assumed the rank of vice-admiral on 23 November 1841. Charles died while at service, on 21 September 1847. Consequently, on 22 September 1847, the Admiralty promoted him posthumously to the rank of admiral.|$|E
25|$|The runners-up in the Champions Trophy took October {{off before}} {{beginning}} {{a tour of}} Africa in November. Their first port of call was Zimbabwe, visiting {{for the first time}} since the 2003 World Cup political concerns and despite being minnows Strauss could not muster even a half century in the 4–0 series win. In the final match, Strauss was called on to bowl a single over, conceding three runs. England then moved to Strauss' native South Africa for a five Test series taking them into the new year. His homecoming was an explosive one as he caught captain Graeme Smith off the second ball and went on to score his first away century with 126 before scoring over half of the team's second innings score as <b>he</b> <b>steered</b> them towards victory, again falling short of twin hundreds with 94 not out; still he became only the seventh Test player to record a century on his home and away debut. Despite missing out on this accolade he did record back to back centuries, in the Boxing Day Test he top scored in the first innings with only 25 as it seemed England were set for defeat, Strauss and Trescothick bolstered the side with an opening partnership stand of 273, top scoring with 136 to help England push for victory though it would end in a draw. In the losing, third Test Strauss not only top scored in the first innings with 45, he also became the fourth fastest Englishman to reach 1,000 Test runs in 19 innings. After his third century of the tour in the fourth Test that helped secure the decisive victory Strauss ended with a pair of ducks in the fourth and fifth Test preventing England from extending the lead to 3–1. Despite the two zeroes, Strauss dominated the batsmen of the series making 656 runs over the five matches at an average of 72.88 and earned his first Man of The Series award. In the losing One Day series that followed Strauss failed to impress with the bat, never making more than 35. Nevertheless, his Test success drew the plaudits of, among others, future Australian rival Justin Langer.|$|E
