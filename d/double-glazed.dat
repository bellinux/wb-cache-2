5|$|Inside {{the living}} hut were two small ante-rooms, one {{used as a}} {{photographic}} darkroom, the other for taxidermy. Within the main accommodation area daylight was admitted via a <b>double-glazed</b> and shuttered window and through a small square pane high on the northern wall. Bunks were fitted around the outer walls, and a table and stove dominated {{the centre of the}} hut. During the few brief weeks before winter set in, members of the party made trial sledging journeys on the sea ice in nearby Robertson Bay, during which they surveyed the coastline and collected specimens of birds and fish. They also slaughtered seals and penguins for food and fuel. Outside activities were largely curtailed in Mid-May, with the onset of severe winter weather.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} bank {{needed for the}} episode, Ilt Jones and the {{location}} department staff found a former bank and current animation school and film production house on Fourth and Main Street in downtown Los Angeles. The building was completely renovated, complete with fake ATMs, columns, desks, and <b>double-glazed</b> windows. All of the items inside of the bank were bought from a bank-supply catalogue by set decorator Tim Stepeck. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, a four-block area was sealed off to allow cameras to film. A total of eleven cameras, some at different speeds, were used. Some of the cameras made it onto the film, but they were erased during post-production.|$|E

Most of the schemes have flaws {{and many of the}} reassuring logos used by <b>double-glazing</b> companies are simply labels for trade associations rather than formal warranty schemes like ABTA. People paying for <b>double-glazing</b> or conservatories still need to be on their guard against poor or worthless guarantees.|$|R

25|$|Each saloon had 64 seats, {{arranged}} in eight bays of four around a table, {{either side of}} a central gangway, with two toilets situated in the vestibule at one end. The interior was finished in laminated plastics, creating a light and airy feel. They were fitted with a public address system, <b>double-glazed</b> windows and central fluorescent lighting along their length, the first coaches in Ireland to be so treated. Heating was by steam, supplied from a Steam Heating Van.|$|E

2500|$|The IDF {{produced}} a video about Corrie's death that includes footage taken {{from inside the}} cockpit of a D9. The video makes a [...] "credible case", wrote Joshua Hammer in Mother Jones, that [...] "the operators, peering out through narrow, <b>double-glazed,</b> bulletproof windows, their view obscured behind pistons and the giant scooper, might not have seen Corrie kneeling in front of them".|$|E
2500|$|While early Mk VIIs were {{fitted with}} a {{detachable}} canopy, secured by four pilot operated catches, later Mk VIIs were {{fitted with a}} [...] "Lobelle" [...] type hood which opened by sliding backwards, as on non-pressurised versions of the Spitfire. This was a big improvement on the clamp down cockpit of the Mk VI. The canopy was <b>double-glazed</b> and used rubber tubing to create a proper pressure seal against the fuselage. The canopy rails were bulkier than the standard Spitfire type.|$|E
2500|$|Langer {{typically}} exploited passive {{lighting and}} ventilation in intelligent and uncomplicated ways {{and for the}} MRD building he included simple methods to achieve this. Parallel to the street, the long, narrow plan form (approximately 71m by 16m) was oriented with its long sides facing north-east and south-west. These elevations were highly glazed, comprising a grid of large, <b>double-glazed,</b> operable windows. A critical requirement for the drafting work of the department, this created interiors that were naturally well lit and well insulated, and allowed passive ventilation. The glazing was sheltered by a projecting [...] "egg-crate" [...] of concrete. The northern side had a deeper projection to block direct sun, reducing heat gain and glare. The west and east elevations were predominantly windowless to occlude the harsh, low sun and were built of concrete to provide a thermal mass quality. In contrast, the photographic and computational spaces that required highly controlled light and ventilation conditions were located in the basement levels, which had deep floor plans and limited fenestration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Interaction through glass {{has been}} {{demanding}} in industry, business, education, advertising and entertainment fields. Different technologies exist {{and work in}} varied cir-cumstances. For example: acoustics or vibration detection, computer vision, capacitive interactive foils, infrared and oth-ers. The existing technologies tend to not work reliably through <b>double-glazing</b> and in outdoors conditions. This pa-per introduces an easy-to-implement, inexpensive solution, which is using light sensors to detect human actions and to interact with a computer. Light-Keypad {{can be used on}} any transparent medium, including through thick, coated <b>double-glazing.</b> This is a non-intrusive interactive method that may be used on existing objects and structures without modifying them. The prototype product has been used successfully in our current research project exploring the urban impact of digital screens.

40|$|To exploit in full {{the energy}} saving {{potential}} of high thermal resistance IGUs, {{they have to be}} coupled with systems which have high thermal performances as well. Traditional metal spacers can double the thermal transmittance of the edge area against the central area of the IGU and even using “warm edge” spacers the heat loss at the edge area is greater than {{in the center of the}} glazing. Nowadays there are several types of <b>double-glazing</b> spacer on the market differing form each other in the materials used. This paper took aim at getting characterization of the thermal performance of some commercial types of <b>double-glazing</b> spacer claimed having low thermal transmittance. Full scale specimens (1000 mm x 800 mm) were tested by Stazione Sperimentale del Vetro using the hot box apparatus of the VeniceIUAV University of Architecture. First results are presented...|$|R
50|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} of dissimilar metals can {{be prevented}} (using aluminum screws for <b>double-glazing</b> tracks for example) by a careful choice of material. Some types of plastic, such as nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or {{for the purpose of}} electrical insulation.|$|R
2500|$|Upon Sam Tyler awaking in 1973, {{he finds}} himself on a {{building}} site, beneath a large advertising board, proclaiming {{the construction of a}} new motorway, the Mancunian Way. In reality, construction of Mancunian Way was completed in 1967. According to Matthew Graham, writing in the Radio Times, the error was deliberate. [...] "We knew that this road was built in the 1960s, but we took a bit of artistic licence". Minor historical anachronisms such as this are present throughout Life on Mars. Some, as above, were made out of artistic licence whilst others were deliberately inserted to confuse the issue of whether Sam Tyler was in a coma, mad or really back in time. Many inaccuracies were visible such as modern street furniture, cable television cabinets, satellite television dishes, CCTV cameras, LCD digital watches and <b>double-glazed</b> uPVC window frames, which were all unintentional. During DVD commentaries for the series, the programme makers acknowledge these as errors but also point out they are in fact perfectly feasible, given Sam's situation. As the popularity of the series grew, the hunting of such anachronisms became a favourite pastime among Life on Mars fans.|$|E
2500|$|The glass {{panels in}} <b>double-glazed</b> windows {{transmit}} heat {{in both directions}} by radiation, across the panes by convection, and by conduction around the perimeter seals. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. The unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains {{in the winter and}} using sun shades in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a [...] "Window Energy Rating" [...] WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of R-value), the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall.|$|E
5000|$|Modern <b>double-glazed</b> sash {{windows are}} now available, but {{depending}} on their aesthetic style, can be frowned upon. Traditionally styled <b>double-glazed</b> sash windows will often attempt to mimic the original appearance {{through the use of}} non-functional muntins or [...] "glazing bars", which are applied {{to the surface of the}} glazing, and give the appearance that the sash is made up of several smaller panes, whereas in reality, each sash consists of only one large <b>double-glazed</b> unit.|$|E

50|$|If {{you live}} in a cold climate, and you are {{planning}} on building an energy-efficient house, you should look for triple-glazing windows with a U-value between 0.19 and 0.26; in moderate and hot climates, also look for windows with a low U-value; but since, in general, quality <b>double-glazing</b> windows are a more cost-competitive and effective choice for mixed and hot climates, consider windows with a U-value of about 0.30, if possible.|$|R
