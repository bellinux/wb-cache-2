Motorists that may have loud music playing in their car, for example, may not hear the audible siren of a police car behind them, but will feel the vibrations of the Rumbler. The <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of {{standing next to a}} large speaker with pumped bass.|$|E

Using ROVs to film the hull, the team concluded that the ship had sunk due to combat damage. Expedition leader David Mearns claimed significant gashes {{had been found in}} the hull: [...] "My <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> those holes were probably lengthened by the slide, but initiated by torpedoes".|$|E

Vonnegut had not intended to publish again, but his anger against the George W. Bush administration led him to write A Man Without a Country.|$|E

[...] The remaining two families accepted a $2.6 million settlement from the USN on 31 January 2003. [...] Before accepting the settlement, the two families had asked for face-to-face apologies from the USN and Waddle, a full investigation into the collision, a reasonable compensation offer, and a promise from the USN to help prevent similar accidents in the future.

He said that {{it felt like the}} book [...] "wrote me". Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: [...] "My <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one has to grapple with the abyss if one can." [...] In his 1997 memoir, Errata: An Examined Life, Steiner remarked that had he known what the response to The Portage and its stage interpretation would be, he would have made the novella [...] "my foremost business".|$|E
500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I think that was a curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series creator Rob Thomas, marking his seventh writing credit and second and final directing credit for the series (after [...] "Donut Run"). Starting with this episode, Thomas and the crew's plan for the season changed—while they had initially scheduled three major story arcs for the season, this number was now bumped down to two, while the last few episodes would be standalone. The creative team decided that their choices for major mysteries had not worked since season one; Thomas elaborated, [...] "One <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the big mysteries keep away the casual TV viewers, and the other is the thing that has been the least successful since season one [...] the big mysteries." [...] Thomas also recalled that his major design for the first season that was because Lilly had been murdered, everyone had a stake in the solving of the mystery and that the crew were finding it impossible to keep the same amount of emotional involvement since the first season; Thomas thought that the new format would be a way of trying to return to a more emotionally driven format.|$|E

He stated: [...] "I've had four great years but I felt {{the time had come to}} leave. The show has gone from strength to strength so now seems a good time to go." [...] Of his decision to leave, Irving explained that, while he enjoyed Meyer's sureness and confidence, he found it difficult to [...] "switch off" [...] the character outside of work, and had been forced to [...] "put the rest of his life on hold" [...] whilst part of the series, deeming it to be an [...] "intense experience." [...] He felt that, had he stayed in the series, Meyer could not have remained enigmatic much longer, and believed: [...] "you have to stop when a character's time is through." [...] Following Irving's departure from Holby City, Benji Wilson of the Radio Times questioned whether he would ever consider returning. Irving responded: [...] "I don't know–my <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Meyer was of his time. He's the kind of character that belongs at the launch of series like Holby and I think that's where he should remain. The memory of Meyer is important to me and I want it to stay as it is." ...|$|E

[...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E

500|$|Conceivably, Olga was {{initially}} either {{open to the}} possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind. Anderson's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, Herluf Zahle, at the end of October 1925: [...] "My <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she is not the one she believes—but one can't say she is not as a fact". However, within a month she had made up her mind. She wrote to a friend, [...] "There is no resemblance, and she is undoubtedly not A." [...] Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson as Anastasia. Olga later said she sent the gift and letters [...] "out of pity", and called the claims [...] "a complete fabrication". When Olga refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper, Anderson's supporters, Harriet von Rathlef and Gleb Botkin, claimed that Olga was acting on instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in private letters and sworn testimony. She told her official biographer, [...] "I never received any such telegram."

500|$|The {{on-screen}} {{relationship between}} Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written {{out of the}} soap due to Bardon's health problems. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and {{was placed in the}} care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the Daily Mirror: [...] "Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] The <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{this is the end of}} Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't ever be a regular in Albert Square again." [...] It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it. Jim left the show on 26 May 2011. Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim, saying, [...] "I think she'll be very lonely and feel she doesn't have much purpose in life. It was really important to tell this story because there are so many people in a similar situation to Dot. It was moving to act out, too—not just because of Dot and Jim's relationship, but because I'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life." ...|$|E

The development of the perfume took three years to complete and Shakira compared the process to composing a song, opining that [...] "It's similar to the process you go through when writing a melody: certain chord combinations inspire different feelings in the listener. I wanted to find a way of expressing the feeling of pure happiness through the medium of fragrance". José Manuel Albesa, chief brand officer of Puig, commented that Shakira was completely involved {{in the process of developing}} the fragrance and was [...] "extremely hands-on". Didier Maine de Biran, general manager of Puig USA, opined that S by Shakira was different from other celebrity-branded fragrances, saying [...] "What makes this stand out is how involved she [...] was. The key difference is she has the knowledge of what she wants and really wants to share it with her fans. She's involved. She's committed. And it is just a great fragrance that stands on its own".|$|E
