40|$|Abstract. The main {{role of the}} {{permanent}} magnet machine in the aviation frequency alternator is as the exciter. Its main function {{is not only to}} supply power for the generator controller but also supply the excitation current to <b>exciter</b> by supplying <b>field</b> <b>winding</b> of <b>exciter</b> with DC excitation voltage in the case without the emergency power. So we have to rectify 115 V AC of permanent magnet machine output and make DC/DC conversion, so that the output is the suitable DC voltage. In the actual, it is very troublesome to make parameter tuning to rectifier module and DC/DC module, so this it is necessary to make model and simulation research. In this paper, we make module, simulation and parameter tuning for the rectifier and DC/DC transformation module in the MATLAB environment. From the simulation results, we can get that the model is correct, the parameters are appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 An {{algorithm}} for computing the parameter sensitivities of an {{excitation system}} for a hydroelectric generation system is developed for model analysis in this thesis. The IEEE Type 1 excitation system representation, linked with a simplified alternator and voltage regulator equivalent, provide a closed-loop model for digital simulation. Parametric sensitivities are derived from computations upon the transient <b>exciter</b> <b>field</b> voltage response caused by a perturbation of the regulator reference voltage. The digital-analog simulator language, MIMIC, was utilized to implement the model. <b>Exciter</b> <b>field</b> voltage responses from models differing by variations in one parameter are converted to sensitivities by a FORTRAN program. Sensitivities, <b>exciter</b> <b>field</b> voltages and system parameters are listed as output data. A line printer plotting routine provides several types of graphic representation for the sensitivity responses. A broad range of model specifications was executed {{to demonstrate the utility}} of these programs. Observations directly from the sensitivity results revealed the effects of parameter derivations upon the system's response. Program flexibility, providing the user {{with a wide range of}} options in both model specification and information output, received major emphasis throughout this study...|$|R

40|$|The Norwegian Network Code FIKS {{from the}} Norwegian Transmission System Operator (TSO) Statnett, states that {{synchronous}} generators ≥ 25 MVA {{must have a}} static excitation system. It also includes requirements on the step time response and the available <b>field</b> <b>winding</b> ceiling voltage of the excitation system. An improved brushless excitation system is in operation in some pilot power plants. A rotating thyristor bridge is controlled via Bluetooth. The step time response is as fast as conventional static excitation systems. However, a ceiling voltage factor of 2 requires the thyristor bridge to operate at firing angles about 60 degrees. High torque pulsations, low power factor and low utilization of the exciter is the end result.

40|$|HTS {{machines}} are a potentially capable option {{in order to}} address technical challenges that the wind industry is going to face in the coming years. HTS winding excitation allows to highly increase the power density of the machine, achieving large increments in output power of a single wind turbine. Already several HTS machine prototypes have been constructed and experimentally demonstrated, and they are about to cross the frontier to become marketable product. However, one of the main factors that limits this progress is the high cost of HTS conductors. Therefore, reducing HTS usage plays a crucial role to make HTS machines a cost-effective solution. This research presents a topology optimization of an HTS <b>field</b> <b>winding</b> distribution for a given HTS synchronous machine design. The optimization problem is formulated in order to minimize HTS usage, so that the HTS <b>field</b> <b>winding</b> performance can be maximized. Two widely used topology optimization techniques are applied and compared, both using very different optimization methodologies (gradient-based and discrete optimization). Results show that discrete optimization adjusts better with the limitations imposed by the critical current condition of HTS tapes. However, gradient-based presents faster convergence. Inspired by the results presented above, a third algorithm is developed combining the discrete optimization with a local optimization based on an on/off sensitivity analysis. A short test is performed where the superiority of this approach is confirmed. This later algorithm is then applied into two different case scenarios.
