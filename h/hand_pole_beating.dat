50|$|This victory, over an {{experienced}} Swedish side, {{was a turning}} point for the Poles. The National Team quickly took advantage of it, as more nations showed interest in facing white-reds. On September 3, 1922, in Cernăuţi, Poland tied 1-1 with Romania and on October 1, in Zagreb, <b>Poles</b> <b>beat</b> Yugoslavia 3-1, with two goals by Józef Kałuża.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} gradient in an ultrasonic wave moves particles {{relative to the}} fluid. This motion disturbs the double layer that exists at the particle-fluid interface. The picture illustrates the mechanism of this distortion. Practically all particles in fluids carry a surface charge. This surface charge is screened with an equally charged diffuse layer; this structure is called the double layer. Ions of the diffuse layer {{are located in the}} fluid and can move with the fluid. Fluid motion relative to the particle drags these diffuse ions in the direction of {{one or the other of}} the particle's poles. The picture shows ions dragged towards the left <b>hand</b> <b>pole.</b> As a result of this drag, there is an excess of negative ions in the vicinity of the left <b>hand</b> <b>pole</b> and an excess of positive surface charge at the right <b>hand</b> <b>pole.</b> As a result of this charge excess, particles gain a dipole moment. These dipole moments generate an electric field that in turn generates measurable electric current. This phenomenon is widely used for measuring zeta potential in concentrated colloids.|$|R

50|$|Two weeks later, Polish {{team went}} {{a long way}} to Stockholm, to face Sweden. This time, at the Olympic Stadium, with 16,000 spectators, Poland won the first game in its history. The <b>Poles</b> <b>beat</b> their opponents 2-1, with goals by Józef Klotz (on a penalty kick) and Józef Garbień. It must be mentioned, that in 1922 it took almost four days for the Poles to get by trains and ferry from Kraków, via Warsaw, Berlin, Stralsund and Malmö, to the capital of Sweden.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the use of}} [...] "poles" [...] is {{also now}} widespread. Here, the line is fixed to the very tip of the rod, with no reel used: in order to {{retrieve}} the line, the pole itself is taken apart until the line can be swung to <b>hand.</b> <b>Poles</b> are often very long {{in order to increase}} the angler's range—up to 16 metres.|$|R
50|$|In 1923, {{the first}} game {{occurred}} as late as June 3. In Kraków, the Poles lost 1-2 to Yugoslavia (goal by Kałuża). This goal is also significant - {{it was the first}} one scored on home turf. Fans had to wait for next match until September 2, when in Lwów, on the Czarni Lwów's stadium, Poland tied 1-1 with Romania. Soon after, white-reds traveled north. On September 25 in Helsinki, Poland lost 3-5 to Finland, two days later, in Tallinn, the <b>Poles</b> <b>beat</b> Estonia 4-1. The last game in 1923 took place in Kraków. On November 1, the Poles tied 2-2 with Sweden.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} attacks {{occurred}} on 15 February 1981, when a wolf entered a yard bordered by [...] and attacked a young boy. The boy's cries attracted several people, who attacked the wolf with wooden <b>poles,</b> <b>beating</b> it to death. Throughout the next six months, the remaining wolves killed 13 children and mauled 13 others. On a night of June 1981, they were seen via a headlight to be exhuming and eating a human corpse. During the year, 4 wolves were killed, the last of which, {{thought to be the}} dominant male, was caught in a scrub forest and shot.|$|R

50|$|Vettel {{initially}} made {{a strong}} start from <b>pole,</b> <b>beating</b> Button into the first corner. Vettel then ran wide at the challenging Turn 9, gifting Button the lead. Button's Brawn team-mate had a less fortunate start, a clutch problem dropping him from third on the grid to thirteenth {{by the end of}} the first lap. Webber was running third, having initially been passed by Jarno Trulli before the Australian regained his position. Felipe Massa had moved up to fifth position, ahead of Kimi Räikkönen and Fernando Alonso. Reigning world champion Hamilton had lost a place on the first lap, meaning he was running in 17th position out of 20 runners.|$|R

60|$|At the {{appointed}} hour Mannering {{went to a}} small house in the suburbs to the southward of the city, where he found the place of mourning indicated, as usual in Scotland, by two rueful figures with long black cloaks, white crapes and hat-bands, holding in their <b>hands</b> <b>poles,</b> adorned with melancholy streamers of the same description. By two other mutes, who, from their visages, seemed suffering {{under the pressure of}} some strange calamity, he was ushered into the dining-parlour of the defunct, where the company were assembled for the funeral.|$|R

Strakka Racing once again took pole in the LMP2 class. They qualified 2.5 seconds quicker than the next nearest LMP2 car, the RML Lola-HPD. Hope Polevision Racing took the Formula Le Mans <b>pole</b> <b>beating</b> Boutsen Energy Racing by 0.5 seconds. Marc VDS took the GT1 pole in their first Le Mans Series event, racing a Ford GT they also use in the 2010 FIA GT1 World Championship season. They qualified 1.5 seconds ahead of the next nearest GT1 car, a Ford GT also used by fellow GT1 World Championship contenders and LMS débutants Matech Competition. AF Corse once again took the GT2 pole but only by 0.08 seconds over Team Felbermayr-Proton.|$|R
50|$|Münnich Motorsport earned pole {{position}} in the qualifying session, only to be penalized for an infraction and <b>handing</b> <b>pole</b> to the Young Driver team of Stefan Mücke and Darren Turner. Early incidents in the Qualifying Race led to Marc VDS Ford winning their first GT1 race with Maxime Martin and Frédéric Makowiecki driving. Marc VDS was unable to hold the lead after starting from pole in the Championship Race as a quick pit stop vaulted Stef Dusseldorp and Clivio Piccione's Hexis Aston Martin into the race lead, fending off the Nissan of JR Motorsports but {{less than half a}} second at the finish.|$|R

6000|$|At last, after {{fixing a}} lighted torch between the logs of each raft, the Mulgars {{began to get}} aboard. On the first Ghibba and Thimble embarked, {{squatting}} the one in front and the other astern, to keep their craft steady. With big torches smoking in the sunshine, they pushed off. Tugging on a long strand of Samarak which they had looped around the smooth branch of a Boobab, they warped themselves free. Soon well adrift, with water singing in their green twigs, they slid swiftly into the stream, shoving and pulling at their long <b>poles,</b> <b>beating</b> the green water to foam, as they neared the fork, to keep their dancing catamaran from drifting into the surge that would have toppled them over the cataract. The rest of the travellers stood stock-still by the water-side, gazing beneath their hands after the green ship and its two sailors, dark and light, brandishing their poles. They followed along the bank {{as far as they}} could, standing lean in the evening beams, wheezing shrilly, [...] "Illaloothi, Illaloothi!" [...] as Moona and Mulla-mulgar floated into the mouth of the cavern and vanished from sight.|$|R

5000|$|In 1555, Queen Mary began {{permitting}} {{the burning of}} Anglicans for heresy, and some 220 men and 60 women were executed before her death in 1558. Pole shares responsibility for these persecutions which, despite his intention, contributed to the ultimate victory of the English Reformation. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Pole</b> was in failing health during the worst period of persecution, {{and there is some}} evidence that he favoured a more lenient approach: [...] "Three condemned heretics from Bonner's diocese were pardoned on an appeal to him; he merely enjoined a penance and gave them absolution." [...] As the reign wore on, an increasing number of people turned against Mary and her government, and some people who had been indifferent to the English Reformation began turning against Catholicism. Writings such as John Foxe's 1568 Book of Martyrs, which emphasised the sufferings of the reformers under Mary, helped shape popular opinion against Catholicism in England for generations.|$|R
50|$|The Polish Grand Prix, first hosted in Toruń, was won by Pole Tomasz Gollob, who <b>beat</b> <b>Poles</b> Rune Holta and Jarosław Hampel and Jason Crumo of Australia. It {{was first}} time in SGP history, when podium was won by riders from the same country.|$|R
50|$|Lauda {{had begun}} his recovery, and was {{planning}} to race later in the season, and as a result, Ferrari were back in business in the Netherlands, but with only one car for Regazzoni. It was Peterson who took <b>pole</b> at Zandvoort, <b>beating</b> <b>pole</b> king Hunt and Tom Pryce's Shadow. Peterson led the early stages ahead of Watson, until Watson made a mistake which let Hunt through. Peterson then struggled and dropped behind Hunt, Watson and Regazzoni. Watson retired with a gearbox failure, promoting Regazzoni and Peterson, but the latter also retired when he lost oil pressure. Regazzoni now closed up on Hunt, bringing Mario Andretti with him, but Hunt held them off, with Regazzoni and Andretti within two seconds of him in second and third.|$|R

The four contenders were occupying the first four spots - Lauda leading Fittipaldi, Scheckter and Regazzoni. But Scheckter crashed after suffering a brake failure, and then Lauda crashed out late in the race after running over debris, ending his championship hopes. Fittipaldi won the race from Regazzoni, with Peterson completing the podium.|$|R
