25|$|When {{the patient}} is {{unsatisfied}} with {{the outcome of the}} augmentation mammoplasty; or when technical or medical complications occur; or because of the breast implants’ limited product life, it is likely she might require replacing the breast implants. Common revision surgery indications include major and minor medical complications, capsular contracture, shell rupture, and device deflation. Revision incidence rates were greater for breast reconstruction patients, because of the post-mastectomy changes to the soft-tissues and to the skin envelope of the breast, and to the anatomical borders of the breast, especially in women who received adjuvant external radiation therapy. Moreover, besides breast reconstruction, breast cancer patients usually undergo revision surgery of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and symmetry procedures upon the opposite breast, to create a bust of natural appearance, size, form, and feel.

5000|$|One of the {{potential}} causes of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is when the trophoblast does not invade far enough into the uterine lining. [...] When the fetus’ trophoblast does not fully extend into the uterine wall, the spiral arteries do not become fully converted into low-resistance channels. [...] It {{has been found that}} this incomplete conversion of spiral arteries increases the resistance to uterine blood flow during pregnancy, and that this occurrence was associated with gestational hypertension. [...] One potential cause of this incomplete breach of the spiral arteries that leads to gestational hypertension is a mistaken immune response by the maternal tissue, reaction to the alien fetal tissue. [...] Therefore, {{it is clear that the}} complication of gestational hypertension has roots in the early implantation of the fetus in the uterine wall, an <b>implantation</b> <b>technique</b> that is unique to humans.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{if there}} is to be significant progress towards long-term implantable electrodes, an important step is documenting the response of living tissue to electrode implantation in both the acute and chronic timelines. It is ultimately this tissue response that causes electrodes to fail by encapsulating the electrode itself in a protective layer called a “glial scar,” (see 2.2). One serious impediment to understanding the tissue response is the lack of true standardization of <b>implantation</b> <b>technique</b> or of electrode materials. Common materials for electrode or probe construction include silicon, platinum, iridium, polyimide, ceramic, gold, as well as others. In addition to the variety of materials used, electrodes are constructed in many different shapes, including planar shanks, simple uniform microwires, and probes that taper to a thin tip from a wider base. Implantable electrode research also employs many different techniques for surgically implanting the electrodes; the most critical differences are whether or not the implant is anchored across the skull and the speed of insertion. The overall observed tissue response is caused by a combination of the traumatic injury of electrode insertion and the persistent presence of a foreign body in the neural tissue.|$|E

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the effect of <b>implantation</b> <b>technique</b> on strut embedment and scaffold expansion. Methods and Results:Strut embedment depth and scaffold expansion index assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) (minimum scaffold area/reference vessel area) were evaluated in the ABSORB Japan trial (OCT subgroup: 87 lesions) with respect to <b>implantation</b> <b>technique</b> using either quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) or OCT. Strut embedment was assessed at the strut level (n= 667), while scaffold expansion was assessed at the lesion level (n= 81). The mean embedment depth was 63 ± 59 µm. Balloon sizing and inflation pressure had no direct effect on strut embedment. Plaque morphology affected strut embedment [nonatherosclerotic (58. 9 ± 54. 3 µm), fibroatheroma (73. 3 ± 59. 6 µm), fibrous plaque (59. 7 ± 51. 1 µm), and fibrocalcific plaque (- 3. 1 ± 61. 6 µm, negative value means malapposition), P < 0. 001]. The balloon-artery ratio positively correlated with the expansion index. This relationship was stronger when the OCT-derived reference vessel diameter (RVD) was used as a reference for balloon selection rather than the QCA-derived one [predilatation (Pearson correlation r: QCA: 0. 167 vs. OCT: 0. 552), postdilatation (QCA: 0. 316 vs. OCT: 0. 717) ].

40|$|Objective—To {{establish}} the <b>implantation</b> <b>technique</b> for the atrial septal defect occluder system (ASDOS) device in an experimental animal model {{and to determine}} long term mechanical stability of the device and its in vivo properties in terms of biocompatibility and tissue reaction.  Materials and methods—An atrial septal defect was created and the device implanted in 17  pigs (mean weight 30  kg). The <b>implantation</b> <b>technique</b> was refined and modified because of initial technical and anatomical complications during nine acute pilot studies. The technique proved to be feasible in eight subsequent survival studies. Four pigs were electively killed three months after implantation (group 1). The remaining four pigs were killed six months after implantation (group 2).  Results—Necropsy showed all devices were embedded in soft tissue three months after implantation. Microscopic examination of atrial septal tissue showed an acute granulomatous inflammatory reaction in group 1  and fibrosis in group 2.  The intensity of the inflammatory reaction around the device was clearly milder in group 2, indicating {{a decline in the}} inflammatory response with time.
