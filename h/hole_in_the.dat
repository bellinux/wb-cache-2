5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jugal {{which appears to be}} a puncture wound that was sustained while this individual was still alive. This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the hull showed that a piece of coral {{the size of a}} man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug the <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef.|$|E

50|$|Near <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top {{and bottom}} of the door, some {{restraining}} device is provided for the rods to pass through, to prevent them from falling away entirely when <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unlocked position, and thus not inserted into <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> door. This consists of either a rubber or plastic gasket fitted into <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> door and protruding up or down a short distance, or else a small metal plate with a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> it welded {{to the inside of the}} door through which <b>the</b> rod extends <b>in</b> any position.|$|R
5|$|Camden County Coroner Robert J. Blake ruled {{her death}} an accident; {{a case of}} {{starvation}} with exposure as a contributing factor. A spokesman for the coroner said Barker became trapped in the closet, and died of fright and starvation. Due to a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closet, {{she could not have}} suffocated.|$|E
5|$|Her primary outfit {{consists}} of a blue and white wrestling leotard with an eyemask and knee-length white boots. Her outfit slightly differed, depending on the game. In Alpha 3, her breasts were covered by two blue heart shaped patterns, but in SFV the blue hearts were replaced by a heart-shaped <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chest of her leotard.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{the naturalist}} David Attenborough {{and his wife}} Jane bought a house {{situated}} between the former Mayfield Cottages (which still stand today) and the <b>Hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wall pub.

25|$|The Glock 17L, {{introduced}} in 1988, incorporates a longer slide and extended barrel. Initially, the Glock 17L had three <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} barrel and a corresponding slot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slide; however, later production pistols lack <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barrel. The Glock 17L is manufactured in limited quantities.|$|R
50|$|There is {{observational}} {{evidence for}} two {{other types of}} black holes, which are much more massive than stellar black holes. They are intermediate-mass black <b>holes</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of globular clusters) and supermassive black <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of the Milky Way and other galaxies.|$|R
30|$|Impact of <b>the</b> {{number of}} <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network: To see the {{performance}} of the fault tolerance mechanism, we create <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network for this scenarios. Each different shaped and middle sized hole covering 5 cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network is randomly generated and positioned on a hextant or over the border lines. The number of sources is equal to <b>the</b> number of <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network. Each source is placed on a location where it is affected by at least one hole. Three destination sinks are chosen randomly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network.|$|R
5|$|In September 2007, the {{historian}} Wolfram Pobanz {{declared that the}} copy of the giant globe with a bullet <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Berlin museum is not Hitler's, but another one that {{is thought to have}} belonged to Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Nazi foreign minister, and with no clue as to where the Globe that belonged to Hitler is today.|$|E

Between 1986 and 2001, at least three people died at the swimming holes and three others were severely injured.|$|E

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|At 2pm on Wednesday, March 21, the Spray {{collided}} with the Lucinda four miles north of Barnegat, New Jersey, knocking a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sprays bow that resulted in her filling with water; the Lucinda also sustained damage. Capt. Willis of the Lucinda saw no one other than Jackalow (whom he blamed for the collision) on board the Spray, and Jackalow refused to be rescued and taken aboard the Lucinda. Willis observed that {{the deck of the}} Spray was strewn with bedding and other articles from the cabin.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{encounters}} Chinese agent Wai Lin, {{who is also}} {{investigating the}} matter and the two agree to work together.

They blow a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ship, exposing it to radar, leading to its sinking averting war between Britain and China.|$|E

5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from the <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|During archaeological {{investigation}} of the ballcourt a well-preserved tennoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench. Its original placement was indicated by a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{upper part of the}} ballcourt wall. The second marker that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt wall where it would have been had collapsed prior to excavations. Replicas of the ballcourt marker have been placed in both walls; the original is in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
