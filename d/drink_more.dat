5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to <b>drink</b> <b>more</b> as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation. He felt {{he had become a}} journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few of his teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his career}} with West Ham Greaves began to <b>drink</b> <b>more</b> and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted that he was in the early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E

25|$|Kvass was {{reported}} to be consumed in excess by peasants, low-class citizens, and monks; in fact, it is sometimes said that it was usual for them to <b>drink</b> <b>more</b> kvass than water. In the 19th century, the kvass industry was created and less natural versions of the drink became increasingly widespread. On the other hand, the popularity of kvass and the market competition led to the emergence of many varieties, which included herbs, fruits and berries. At that time kvass vendors called kvasnik (pl. kvasniki) were on the streets in almost every city. They often specialized in particular kinds of kvass: strawberry kvass, apple kvass, etc.|$|E
25|$|Topi live {{primarily}} in grassland habitats ranging from treeless plains to savannas. In ecotone habitats between woodlands and open grasslands, they stay {{along the edge}} using the shade in hot weather. They prefer pastures with green grass that is medium in height with leaf-like swards. Topis are more densely populated in areas where green plants last into the dry season, particularly near water. The topi is a selective feeder and uses its elongated muzzle and flexible lips to forage for the freshest plants. When foraging for food, topi tend to take small bites at a fast rate. Topi generally frequent flat lowlands and at elevations below 1500 m. When {{they have access to}} enough green vegetation, topi usually do not have to drink. They <b>drink</b> <b>more</b> when relying on dry grass. Topi use , such as termite mounds, to {{get a good look at}} their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} {{for people with}} ALD depends on the liver histology as well as cofactors, such as concomitant chronic viral hepatitis. Among patients with alcoholic hepatitis, progression to liver cirrhosis occurs at 10–20% per year, and 70% will eventually develop cirrhosis. Despite cessation of alcohol use, only 10% will have normalization of histology and serum liver enzyme levels. As previously noted, the MDF {{has been used to}} predict short-term mortality (i.e., MDF ≥ 32 associated with spontaneous survival of 50–65% without corticosteroid therapy, and MDF < 32 associated with spontaneous survival of 90%).The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has also been found to have similar predictive accuracy in 30day (MELD > 11) and 90-day (MELD > 21) mortality. Liver cirrhosis develops in 6–14% of those who consume more than 60–80 g of alcohol daily for men and more than 20 g daily for women. Even in those who <b>drink</b> <b>more</b> than 120 g daily, only 13.5% will suffer serious alcohol-related liver injury. Nevertheless, alcohol-related mortality was the third leading cause of death in 2003 in the United States. Worldwide mortality is estimated to be 150,000 per year.|$|E

[...] Lemon or lime leaves and two other herbs were soaked {{in a bowl of}} water, and a family member whose parents were still living would be chosen to sprinkle it on the deceased's possessions, enabling them to be redistributed and reused. The door by which the corpse had been removed was then locked for eight days, during which time the family was required to fast. After completion of this fasting period, the family underwent a purification ritual (afana) and the second door was unlocked. Another feast was observed to formally end the period of community purification. The home of the deceased was then allowed to fall into ruin.|$|E
500|$|One {{evening in}} January 1842, Virginia showed {{the first signs}} of consumption, now known as tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano. Poe {{described}} it as breaking a blood vessel in her throat. She only partially recovered. Poe began to <b>drink</b> <b>more</b> heavily under the stress of Virginia's illness. He left Graham's and attempted to find a new position, for a time angling for a government post. He returned to New York where he worked briefly at the Evening Mirror before becoming editor of the Broadway Journal and, later, sole owner. There he alienated himself from other writers by publicly accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism, though Longfellow never responded. On January 29, 1845, his poem [...] "The Raven" [...] appeared in the Evening Mirror and became a popular sensation. It made Poe a household name almost instantly, though he was paid only $9 for its publication. It was concurrently published in [...] under the pseudonym [...] "Quarles".|$|E
500|$|Misuse, problem use, abuse, {{and heavy}} {{use of alcohol}} refer to {{improper}} use of alcohol which may cause physical, social, or moral harm to the drinker. Moderate use is defined by The Dietary Guidelines for Americans as {{no more than two}} alcoholic beverages a day for men and no more than one alcoholic beverage a day for women. Some drinkers may <b>drink</b> <b>more</b> than 600 ml of alcohol per day during a heavy drinking period. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as the amount of alcohol leading to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08, which, for most adults, would be reached by consuming five drinks for men or four for women over a two-hour period. According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 standard drinks per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5ounces of distilled spirits. Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either [...] "heavy drinkers" [...] or [...] "binge drinkers" [...] defined according to the above criteria also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met the criteria. An inference drawn from this study is that evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive services may effectively reduce binge drinking without requiring addiction treatment in most cases.|$|E
40|$|PurposeTrauma patient {{readiness}} to change score {{and its relationship}} to the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score were assessed in addition to the feasibility of Computerized Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention (CASI).

As many Spanish-speaking as English-speaking males did not drink, but a higher percentage of Spanish-speaking males <b>drank</b> <b>more</b> than recommended and were dependent. Half of patients who <b>drank</b> <b>more</b> than recommended rated themselves eight or higher on a 10 -point readiness-to-change scale. CASI also provided personalized feedback. A high percentage of trauma patients (92 %) found CASI easy and a comfort in use (87 %).

40|$|PURPOSE To {{test whether}} {{differences}} in alcohol use between {{boys and girls}} and between northern and southern/central Europe are mediated by social, enhancement, coping, and conformity motives. METHODS Cross-sectional school-based surveys were conducted among 33, 813 alcohol-using 11 - to 19 -year-olds from northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Poland, Scotland, and Wales) and southern/central Europe (Belgium, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, and Switzerland). RESULTS Particularly in late adolescence and early adulthood, boys <b>drank</b> <b>more</b> frequently and were more often drunk than girls. Instead of mediation, gender-specific motive paths were found; 14 - to 16 -year-old girls <b>drank</b> <b>more</b> because of higher levels of coping motives and lower levels of conformity motives, whereas 14 - to 19 -year-old boys <b>drank</b> <b>more</b> because of higher levels of social and enhancement motives. Geographical analyses confirmed that adolescents from southern/central European countries <b>drank</b> <b>more</b> frequently, but those from northern Europe reported being drunk more often. The strong indirect effects demonstrate that some of the cultural differences in drinking are because of higher levels of social, enhancement, and coping motives in northern than in southern/central Europe. CONCLUSIONS The results from the largest drinking motive study conducted to date suggest that gender-specific prevention should take differences in the motivational pathways toward (heavy) drinking into account, that is, positive reinforcement seems to be more important for boys and negative reinforcement for girls. Preventive action targeting social and enhancement motives and taking drinking circumstances into account could contribute to tackling underage drinking in northern Europe...|$|R

2500|$|In 1992/1993, Sublime {{was briefly}} signed to Danny Holloway's True Sound imprint. However, the band stayed on Skunk Records {{and then in}} June 1994, they were signed to the label Gasoline Alley of MCA Records by Jon Phillips who {{subsequently}} became Sublime's manager. Sublime released their second album Robbin' the Hood in 1994, an experimental effort with its diffuse mixture of rock, rap, spoken-word nonsense and folk-leaning acoustic home recordings. Robbin' the Hood was a commercial failure. The band toured extensively throughout 1994-1995, their popularity increasing gradually beyond the West Coast as [...] "Date Rape" [...] began earning radio play. In 1995, the band co-headlined the inaugural nationwide Vans Warped Tour.

2500|$|Acute intoxication, such as binge {{drinking}} and alcoholism, are known potent {{risk factors for}} suicide. [...] Binge drinking is also {{associated with an increased}} risk of unplanned sex, unprotected sex, unplanned pregnancies, and an increased risk of HIV infection. 10 percent of women and 19 percent of men have reported being assaulted as a result of alcohol. Males who <b>drink</b> <b>more</b> than 35 units of alcohol per week report being physically hurt as a result of alcohol, and 15 percent report physically hurting others {{as a result of their}} drinking. Almost 16 percent of binge drinkers report being taken advantage of sexually, and 8 percent report taking advantage of another person sexually as a result of alcohol within a 1-year period. Heavy drinkers cause approximately 183,000 rapes and sexual assaults, 197,000 robberies, 661,000 aggravated assaults, and 1.7 million simple assaults each year. Binge drinking has been associated with high odds of divorce, spousal abuse, and poor job performance. Binge drinking can cause adverse effects on the body including effects on blood homeostasis and its circadian variation, cardiac rhythm, ischaemic heart disease, blood pressure, white blood cell activity, female reproductive hormone levels as well as adverse effects on the fetus. There is also evidence from animal studies that {{binge drinking}} causes brain damage. Binge drinking has been associated with lower abdominal pain in women. Ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. Alcohol affects brain development quite significantly especially during adolescence when the brain is still developing. The main lobes that are involved in decision making and complex thought processes are undergoing their final development phase during adolescence and binge drinking can negatively stunt the growth of these frontal lobes.|$|E
