The design of the support structures in Canada is governed by the current Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC).

Although there are equivalent static natural and truck-induced wind pressures for <b>fatigue</b> <b>design</b> recommended in {{the provisions of the}} American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), none of relevant studies discussed the implied reliability by using these design pressures based on Canadian practice.

For the calibration, the support structures were approximated by a linear elastic single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, structural response with selected natural frequencies, damping ratios under natural and truck-induced wind gusts was estimated. A target reliability index of 4. 25 for a service period of 75 years was adopted for the calibration.
