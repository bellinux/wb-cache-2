25|$|The primary {{function}} of PfEMP1 is to bind and attach RBCs {{to the wall}} of the blood vessels. The most important binding properties of P. falciparum known to date are mediated by the <b>head</b> <b>structure</b> of PfEMP1, consisting of DBL domains and CIDRs. DBL domains can bind to a variety of cell receptors including thrombospondin (TSP), complement receptor 1 (CR1), chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), P-selectin, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and heparan sulfate. The DBL domain adjacent to the <b>head</b> <b>structure</b> binds to ICAM1. CIDRs mainly bind to a large variety of cluster determinant 36 (CD36). These bindings produce the pathogenic characteristics of the parasite, such as sequestration of infected cells in different tissues, invasion of RBCs, and clustering of infected cells by a process called rosetting.|$|E
25|$|CIDR1 {{protein in}} the semi-conserved <b>head</b> <b>structure</b> is the {{principal}} and best understood adhesion site of PfEMP1. It binds with CD36 on endothelial cells. Only group B and C proteins are able to bind, and that too with only those having CIDRα2-6 sequence types. On the other hand, group A proteins have either CIDRα1 or CIDRβ/γ/δ, and {{they are responsible for}} the most severe condition of malaria. Binding with ICAM1 is achieved through the DBLβ domain adjacent to the <b>head</b> <b>structure.</b> However, many PfEMP1s having DBLβ domain do not bind to ICAM1, and it appears that only the DBLβ paired with C2 domain can to bind to ICAM1. The DBLα-CIDRγ tandem pair is the main factor for rosetting, sticking together the infected RBC with the uninfected cells, and thereby clogging of the blood vessels. This activity is performed through binding with CR1.|$|E

He proposed a new classification scheme based on <b>head</b> <b>structure,</b> this being supported by later work by others regarding antennal muscles, and locomotive behaviour and machinery in the relevant animals.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{isolation}} of an empty spiracles class homeodomain-containing gene, Cn-ems, from the hydrozoan Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, the first gene of this class characterized in a lower metazoan. Cn-ems {{was found to be}} expressed in the head of gastrozooids, specifically in endodermal epithelial cells of the taeniolae of the hypostome. Cn-ems is not expressed in gonozooids, which lack taeniolae. Experimental conversion of the posterior region of the planula larva into <b>head</b> <b>structures</b> up-regulates expression of the gene.

Knock down experiments in which Cerberus was partially repressed show a decreased formation of the <b>head</b> <b>structures.</b> In experiments where Cerberus was decreased and wnt, bmp and nodal signals were increased, embryos completely lacked <b>head</b> <b>structures</b> and develop only trunk structures. These experiments suggest that a balance of these signaling molecules is required for proper development of the anterior and posterior regions.|$|R

25|$|Duffy-binding-like domains are {{so named}} because of their {{similarity}} to the Duffy-binding proteins of P. vivax and P. knowlesi. There are six variant types of DBL, named DBLα, DBLβ, DBLγ, DBLδ, DBLε and DBLζ. CIDR is also divided into three classes: CIDRα, CIDRβ and CIDRγ. Both DBL and CIDR have an additional type called PAM, {{so named because}} of their specific involvement in pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM). In spite of the diverse DBL and CIDR proteins, the extracellular amino terminal region is partly conserved, consisting of about 60 amino acids of NTS, one each of DBLα and CIDR1 proteins in tandem. This semi-conserved DBLα-CIDR1 region is called the <b>head</b> <b>structure.</b> The last CIDR region joins the TMD, which {{is embedded in the}} cell membrane. The TMD and ATS are highly conserved among different PfEMP1s.|$|E
25|$|The <b>head</b> <b>structure</b> is {{followed}} by a variable combination of diverse DBL and CIDR proteins, and in many cases along with C2. This variation gives rise to different types of PfEMP1. The DBL-CIDR combination in a particular type of PfEMP1 protein is never random, but organized into specific sequences known as domain cassettes. In some domain cassettes, there are only two or few DBL domains and CIDR domains, but in others they cover {{the entire length of the}} PfEMP1. These differences are responsible for different binding capacity among different PfEMP1s. For instance, among the most well-known types, VAR3 (earlier called type 3 PfEMP1) is the smallest, consisting of only NTS with DBL1α and DBL2ε domains in the ECD. Its molecular size is approximately 150 kDa. In domain cassette (DC) 4 type, the ECD is made up of three domains DBLα1.1/1.4, CIDRα1.6 and DBLβ3. The DBLβ3 domain contains a binding site for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1). This is particularly implicated with the development of brain infection. VAR2CSA is atypical in having a single domain cassette that consists of three N terminal DBLPAM domains followed by three DBLε domains and one CIDRPAM. The seven domains always occur together. The usual NTS is absent. The protein specifically binds to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA); hence the name VAR2CSA.|$|E

40|$|Realistic {{electrical}} {{brain activity}} mapping implies reconstructing and visualizing sources of electrical brain activity within the specific patient's head. This requires {{the assumption of}} a precise and realistic volume conductor model of the specific subject's head, i. e., a 3 -D representation of the head's electrical properties in terms of shape and electrical conductivities. Source reconstruction accuracy is influenced by errors committed in head modeling. Clinical images, MRI and CT, are used to identify the <b>head</b> <b>structures</b> {{to be included in}} the volume conductor head model. Modeling accuracy mainly relies on the correct image-based identification of <b>head</b> <b>structures,</b> characterized by different electrical conductivities, to be included as separate compartments in the model. This paper analyzes the imaging protocols used in clinical practice to define the most suitable procedures for identification of the various <b>head</b> <b>structures</b> necessary to build an accurate head model also in the presence of morphologic brain pathologies. Furthermore, tissues anisotropy is discussed and identified as well. With this work we have identified a protocol for the acquisition of multimodal patient's imaging data for realistic electrical brain activity mapping purposes, able to account for pathological conditions and for head tissues anisotropy...|$|R
500|$|Robby Benson as Beast [...] – A young prince who is {{transformed}} into a beast by an enchantress as punishment for his arrogance. The animators drew him with the <b>head</b> <b>structure</b> and horns of an American bison, the arms and body of a bear, the ears of a deer, the eyebrows of a gorilla, the jaws, teeth, and mane of a lion, the tusks of a wild boar, and the legs and tail of a wolf. Chris Sanders, one of the film's storyboard artists, drafted the designs for the Beast and came up with designs based on birds, insects, and fish before coming up with something close to the final design. Glen Keane, supervising animator for the Beast, refined the design by going to the zoo and studying the animals on which the Beast was based. Benson commented, [...] "There's a rage and torment in this character I've never been asked to use before."

50|$|A Gene {{knock down}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Xenopus where the amount of Cerberus expressed was decreased by inhibiting translation. The proteins that Cerberus inhibits (BMP4, Xnr1, Xwnt8) concentrations were increased also. It was also shown that just the decrease of Cerberus translation alone {{was not enough to}} inhibit the formation of <b>head</b> <b>structures.</b> While the increase of just BMP4, Xnr1, Xwnt8 led to defects {{in the formation of the}} head. The increase of BMP4, Xnr1, Xwnt8 and the decrease of Cerberus together blocked the formation of the head. This gene knockdown experiment showed the necessity of Cerberus’ inhibitory functions in the formation of <b>head</b> <b>structures.</b> It quite possibly may be that although Cerberus is necessary for the induction of a head, its inhibitory actions may play a more significant role in ensuring the head is developed properly.|$|R

2500|$|Further {{differences}} between the KIF standard and those used internationally {{are found in the}} guidelines for coat and colour. The registered Kangal organizations in Turkey, Cynology Federation Of Turkey (KIF)—to an extent—and Ankara Kangal Derneği (ANKADER) do not regard coat colour as a breed defining feature. Brindle, recessive black tan pattern, white markings and a longer coat are regarded as Kangal and are not usually indicative of cross breeding, as the KIF standard as significant restrictions on accepted color and is more restrictive with respect to white markings {{than any of the other}} international standards, as white markings are only accepted on the chest and on the tip of the tail, whereas standards from other kennel clubs allow white markings on the feet and legs. Rather it is <b>head</b> <b>structure</b> and morphology that differentiate Kangal from other Çoban Köpegi. In contrast other kennel clubs describe coat and colour as perhaps the most visible traits that distinguish the Kangal from the Akbash and Anatolian. The coat must be short and dense, not long or feathery, and of a pale fawn or tan color with varying amounts of sable guard hairs. All Kangal Dogs have a black facial mask, and black or shaded ears. White at certain points (chest, chin, toes) may or may not be allowed, depending on the standard. Some heavily sabled Kangals also have darker legs and chests. Most importantly, the coat should not be broken, brindled, or spotted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —The {{relationships}} of the 3 major clades of winged insects—Ephemeroptera, Odonata, and Neoptera—are still unclear. Many morphologists favor a clade Metapterygota (Odonata+Neoptera), but Chiastomyaria (Ephemeroptera+ Neoptera) or Palaeoptera (Ephemeroptera+Odonata) {{has also been}} supported in some older and more recent studies. A {{possible explanation for the}} difficulties in resolving these relationships is concerted convergence—the convergent evolution of entire character complexes under the same or similar selective pressures. In this study, we analyze possible instances of this phenomenon in the context of <b>head</b> <b>structures</b> of Ephemeroptera, Odonata, and Neoptera. We apply a recently introduced formal approach to detect the occurrence of concerted convergence. We found that characters of the tentorium and mandibles in particular, but also some other <b>head</b> <b>structures,</b> have apparently not evolved independently, and thus can cause artifacts in tree reconstruction. Our subsequent analyses, which exclude character sets that may be affected by concerted convergence, corroborate the Palaeoptera concept.

40|$|This squib {{presents}} two puzzles {{related to}} an ambiguity found in For-infinitival relative clauses (FIRs). FIR’s always receive a modal interpretation {{even in the absence}} of any overt modal verb, and the modal interpretation seems to come in two distinct types, which can be paraphrased by finite relative clauses employing, respectively, the modal auxiliaries should and could. The two puzzles presented here concern the compositional analysis of FIRs. Both puzzles arise from the fact that the availability of the two readings is constrained by factors that are not otherwise known to affect the interpretation of a relative clause. Specifically, we show, first, that “strong” determiners require the FIR to be interpreted as a SHOULD-relative while “weak ” determiners allow both interpretations (the Determiner-Modal Generalization). Secondly, we observe that the COULD-interpretation requires a raising (internally <b>headed)</b> <b>structure</b> for the FIR, while the SHOULD-interpretation is compatible with either a raising or a more standard matching (externally <b>headed)</b> <b>structure</b> (the Raising/Matching Generalization) ...|$|R
