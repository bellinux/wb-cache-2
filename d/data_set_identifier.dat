40|$|ABSTRACT: Identification of histone post-translational {{modifications}} (PTMs) {{is challenging}} for proteomics search engines. Including many histone PTMs in one search increases {{the number of}} candidate peptides dramatically, leading to low search speed and fewer identified spectra. To evaluate database search engines on identifying histone PTMs, we present a method in which one kind of modification is searched each time, for example, unmodified, individually modified, and multimodified, each search result is filtered with false discovery rate less than 1 %, and the identifications of multiple search engines are combined to obtain confident results. We apply this method for eight search engines on histone data sets. We find that two search engines, pFind and Mascot, identify most of the confident results at a reasonable speed, so we recommend using them to identify histone modifications. During the evaluation, we also find some important aspects {{for the analysis of}} histone modifications. Our evaluation of different search engines on identifying histone modifications will hopefully help those who are hoping to enter the histone proteomics field.

40|$|Proteomics {{has been}} {{successfully}} used for cell culture on dishes, but more complex cellular systems {{have proven to be}} challenging and so far poorly approached with proteomics. Because of the complexity of the angiogenic program, we still do not have a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this process, and there have been no in depth quantitative proteomic studies. Plating endothelial cells on matrigel recapitulates aspects of vessel growth, and here we investigate this mechanism by using a spike-in SILAC quantitative proteomic approach. By comparing proteomic changes in primary human endothelial cells morphogenesis on matrigel to general adhesion mechanisms in cells spreading on culture dish, we pinpoint pathways and proteins modulated by endothelial cells. The cell-extracellular matrix adhesion proteome depends on the adhesion substrate, and a detailed proteomic profile of the extracellular matrix secreted by endothelial cells identified CLEC 14 A as a matrix component, which binds to MMRN 2. We verify deregulated levels of these proteins during tumor angiogenesis in models of multistage carcinogenesis. This is the most in depth quantitative proteomic study of endothelial cell morphogenesis, which shows the potential of applying high accuracy quantitative proteomics to in vitro models of vessel growth to shed new light on mechanisms that accompany pathological angiogenesis.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms that determine tea leaf color, we examined Camellia sinensis cv. ‘Anjin Baicha’ (an albino tea cultivar) by tandem mass tag isobaric labeling to generate a high-resolution proteome and acetyl-proteome atlas of three leaf developmental stages. We identified a total of 7, 637 proteins and quantified 6, 256; of these, 3, 232 were classified as differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs). We also identified 3, 161 lysine acetylation sites in 1, 752 proteins and quantified 2, 869 in 1, 612 proteins. The acetylation levels at 468 sites were significantly altered across the three developmental stages during periodic albinism; the corresponding proteins were associated {{with a variety of}} biological processes. Interestingly, a large number of DAPs and acetylated proteins with increased/decreased acetylation were related to photosynthesis and secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways, suggesting that the accumulation or acetylation level of these proteins regulates periodic albinism in ‘Anjin Baicha. ’ Additionally, overlap between succinylome and acetylome among three ‘Anjin Baicha’ developmental stages were found.

40|$|International audienceSpermatogenesis is {{a complex}} process, {{dependent}} upon the successive activation and/or repression of thousands of gene products, and ends with the production of haploid male gametes. RNA sequencing of male germ cells in the rat identified thousands of novel testicular unannotated transcripts (TUTs). Although such RNAs are usually annotated as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), {{it is possible that}} some of these TUTs code for protein. To test this possibility, we used a "proteomics informed by transcriptomics" (PIT) strategy combining RNA sequencing data with shotgun proteomics analyses of spermatocytes and spermatids in the rat. Among 3559 TUTs and 506 lncRNAs found in meiotic and postmeiotic germ cells, 44 encoded at least one peptide. We showed that these novel high-confidence protein-coding loci exhibit several genomic features intermediate between those of lncRNAs and mRNAs. We experimentally validated the testicular expression pattern of two of these novel protein-coding gene candidates, both highly conserved in mammals: one for a vesicle-associated membrane protein we named VAMP- 9, and the other for an enolase domain-containing protein. This study confirms the potential of PIT approaches for the discovery of protein-coding transcripts initially thought to be untranslated or unknown transcripts. Our results contribute to the understanding of spermatogenesis by characterizing two novel proteins, implicated by their strong expression in germ cells.

It was recently suggested that the expression of proteins that have been systematically missed might be restricted to particular organs or cell types, for example, the testis. Testicular function, and spermatogenesis in particular, is conditioned by the successive activation or repression of thousands of genes and proteins including numerous germ cell- and testis-specific products.

Procedures for obtaining and organizing such meta-data on genes, transcripts and proteins have been streamlined in many data analysis packages, but are still lacking for metabolites. Chemical identifiers are notoriously incoherent, encompassing a wide range of different referencing schemes with varying scope and coverage. Online chemical databases use multiple types of identifiers in parallel but lack a common primary key for reliable database consolidation. Connecting identifiers of analytes found in experimental data with the identifiers of their parent metabolites in public databases can therefore be very laborious. Results Here we present a strategy and a software tool for integrating metabolite identifiers from local reference libraries and public databases that do not depend on a single common primary identifier. The program constructs groups of interconnected identifiers of analytes and metabolites to obtain a local metabolite-centric SQLite database. The created database can be used to map in-house identifiers and synonyms to external resources such as the KEGG database. New identifiers can be imported and directly integrated with existing data.

40|$|The oomycete Phytophthora infestans is {{the most}} harmful {{pathogen}} of potato. It causes the disease late blight, which generates increased yearly costs of up to one billion euro in the EU alone and is difficult to control. We have performed a large-scale quantitative proteomics study of six P. infestans life stages with the aim to identify proteins that change in abundance during development, {{with a focus on}} preinfectious life stages. Over 10 000 peptides from 2061 proteins were analyzed. We identified several abundance profiles of proteins that were up- or downregulated in different combinations of life stages. One of these profiles contained 59 proteins that were more abundant in germinated cysts and appressoria. A large majority of these proteins were not previously recognized as being appressorial proteins or involved in the infection process. Among those are proteins with putative roles in transport, amino acid metabolism, pathogenicity (including one RXLR effector) and cell wall structure modification. We analyzed the expression of the genes encoding nine of these proteins using RT-qPCR and found an increase in transcript levels during disease progression, in agreement with the hypothesis that these proteins are important in early infection. Among the nine proteins was a group involved in cell wall structure modification and adhesion, including three closely related, uncharacterized proteins encoded by PITG- 01131, PITG- 01132, and PITG- 16135, here denoted Piacwp 1 - 3. Transient silencing of these genes resulted in reduced severity of infection, indicating that these proteins are important for pathogenicity.

Further, 21. 3 % of the sample experienced inpatient or crisis admissions in the community, and 14. 5 % of the sample were arrested (6. 8 % on felony charges) during this time frame. 2. Almost 30 % of the sample had no record of non-crisis, mental health treatment services in the community during the six months following discharge. This figure probably overestimates the magnitude of the problem with follow-up care since some of the cases may have been lost to follow-up for a variety of other reasons (e. g., follow-up data not reported; <b>data</b> <b>set</b> <b>identifiers</b> mismatched; the person died, moved out of state, or was reinstitutionalized elsewhere; services were billed to Medicaid but not reported to the Department of Children and Families (DCF); or services were received from a provider that does not report to the DCF). It was also the case that almost 30 % of the persons who were readmitted to the state hospital had no record of receiving mental health services in the community during the time between their original discharge and their subsequent readmission. 3. Of those who did receive mental health services in the community, most received case management services and those were instituted in a timely fashion. However, substantially fewer received psychiatric services, and a distinct minority of persons received residential treatment or other therapy. For those who did receive such treatment services, those services were sometimes not initiated promptly, but such services were usually provided in reasonable quantities. 4. About 70 % of the sample was enrolled in Medicaid during the study period. Many of these were enrolled prior to discharge from the hospital. Enrollment in Medicaid (or lack thereof) {{did not appear to be}} related to the experience of adverse outcomes in this group. 5. Neither the latency of onset, nor the quantity of mental health services received in the community during the first six months following discharge appeared to be related to experiencing readmission or other adverse events, except that those who experienced crisis events were more likely to have received case management services in the community. 6 Several case variables were found to be associated with the experience of readmission to the state hospital or to the experience of adverse events. Specifically, persons with schizoaffective disorder were more likely than persons with other disorders to be readmitted to the hospital and to experience other adverse events. Persons who had more prior state hospital episodes were also more likely to be readmitted. Younger persons, and persons with prior arrest histories were more likely to experience adverse events. Gender and race were unrelated to readmission and to adverse event experience. A follow-up report will be prepared by June 30, 2001 regarding this sample of persons that will include analysis of Medicaid claims data (mental health, physical health, and pharmacy), data on community hospital admissions, and involuntary mental health treatment...|$|R
