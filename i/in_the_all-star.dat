5|$|After {{a year of}} success, the Devils were in {{the middle}} of the pack for most of the 1995–96 season and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team's 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goalie, while having the 2nd-most shutouts (6) in the league.

During July of the 1984 season, Smith went on the disabled list with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres. Smith's return to the lineup a month later was not enough to propel the Cardinals to a postseason berth.|$|E
5|$|Having vanquished this long-time bane, West {{entered his}} 13th NBA year. In the 1972–73 NBA season, the main scoring role {{was taken by}} Goodrich, and West was now a playmaker instead of a scorer. However, West {{averaged}} 22.8points, but also averaged 8.8assists per game, and again was a First Teamer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star,</b> All-NBA, and All-Defense Teams. The Lakers won 60 games and reached the 1973 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks. In Game 1 West scored 24points before fouling out with three minutes left and L.A. won Game 1 with 115–112. However, the Knicks took Games 2 and 3, and West strained both of his hamstrings: in Game 4, the shorthanded Lakers were no match for New York, and in Game 5, the valiant, but injured West and Hairston had miserable games, and despite Chamberlain scoring 23points and grabbing 21rebounds, the Lakers lost 102–93 and the series.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Rick Monday became MLB's {{first draft}} pick after being {{selected}} by the Kansas City Athletics. Royce Lewis is the most recent first overall pick; he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 2017. Overall, 23 of the 50 picks before 2015 have participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> Game, and three (Bob Horner, Darryl Strawberry, and Bryce Harper) have won the Rookie of the Year Award. Twenty-five of the fifty picks before 2015 have been drafted from high schools, one has been drafted out of the Independent American Association, {{and the others were}} drafted from universities. To date, Arizona State University and Vanderbilt University are the only schools from which multiple number-one overall draft picks have been chosen. No first overall pick was inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame until 2016, when Ken Griffey, Jr. was inducted with a record 99.3% of votes cast.|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, the Bulls {{lost only}} {{three games in}} four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, Orlando Magic 4–0).

Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards. He also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP Awards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> Game, regular season and NBA Finals, Willis Reed having achieved the first, during the 1969–70 season. Because this was Jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on Father's Day, Jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker room floor with the game ball.|$|E
5|$|Individually, Iginla reached 900 career {{points in}} a two-goal, two-assist effort against the Oilers on January 30, 2010. Six nights later, he played his 1,000th career game against the Florida Panthers. Iginla {{struggled}} offensively to begin the 2010–11 season, and with the Flames falling {{to the bottom of}} the standings, there was renewed speculation over his future in Calgary. Team management repeatedly reiterated that they were not interested in moving him to another team. Improving his game as the season wore on, Iginla reached another personal milestone, recording his 500th career assist on January 11, 2011, the same day he was named to play in his sixth All-Star Game. He announced several days later that he had declined to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> Game as he wished to spend the time with his ailing grandmother.|$|E
