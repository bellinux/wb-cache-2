5|$|Atopic <b>dermatitis</b> is {{a chronic}} <b>dermatitis</b> {{associated}} with a hereditary tendency to develop allergies to food and inhalant substances.|$|E
5|$|Seborrhoeic <b>dermatitis,</b> a chronic, usually mild form of <b>dermatitis</b> {{effected}} {{by changes in}} the sebaceous glands. In newborn infants seborrhoea <b>dermatitis</b> can occur as cradle cap.|$|E
5|$|After {{nickel and}} chromium, cobalt {{is a major}} cause of contact <b>dermatitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Contact <b>dermatitis</b> {{is caused}} by certain {{substances}} coming {{in contact with the}} skin.|$|E
5|$|Eczema {{refers to}} {{a broad range of}} {{conditions}} that begin as spongiotic <b>dermatitis</b> and may progress to a lichenified stage.|$|E
5|$|Pustular <b>dermatitis</b> is an {{inflammation}} of the skin that presents with pustular lesions.|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic <b>dermatitis</b> is a chronic, superficial, {{inflammatory}} disease characterized by scaling on an erythematous base.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is prone}} to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies {{surveyed}} are affected by atopic <b>dermatitis,</b> a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of <b>dermatitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{is widely}} used to treat a variety of skin conditions, {{including}} <b>dermatitis,</b> itching due to eczema, diaper rash and acne.|$|E
5|$|Cardiomyopathy, {{heart murmur}} and other cardiac issues {{were present in}} 17.2% of {{responses}} while dermatolic conditions such as <b>dermatitis</b> or alopecia were reported by 10.8% of responses. Salukis have an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years, {{which is similar to}} other breeds of their size.|$|E
5|$|Napkin {{psoriasis}} is a subtype of psoriasis {{common in}} infants characterized by red papules with silver {{scale in the}} diaper area that may extend to the torso or limbs. Napkin psoriasis is often misdiagnosed as napkin <b>dermatitis</b> (diaper rash).|$|E
5|$|Pugs {{have many}} {{wrinkles}} in their faces, so owners will often clean inside the creases to avoid irritation and infection. If {{this is not}} done, the dog may develop a condition known as skin fold <b>dermatitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{people suffer}} from {{allergic}} reactions after handling onions. Symptoms can include contact <b>dermatitis,</b> intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchial asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} denaturing of the proteins from cooking.|$|E
5|$|Some {{susceptible}} {{individuals have}} experienced {{an allergic reaction}} after touching Suillus americanus. The symptoms of allergic contact <b>dermatitis</b> generally develop one to two days after initial contact, persist for roughly a week, then disappear without treatment. Cooking the fruit bodies inactivates the responsible allergens.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{bacteria in the}} stomach may be beneficial, reducing the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis, <b>dermatitis,</b> inflammatory bowel disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal cancer by influencing systemic immune responses.|$|E
5|$|Trivalent {{chromium}} {{occurs in}} trace amounts in foods, wine and water. In contrast, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) or Cr6+) is highly toxic and mutagenic when inhaled. Ingestion of chromium(VI) in {{water has been}} linked to stomach tumors, and it may also cause allergic contact <b>dermatitis</b> (ACD).|$|E
5|$|Immune {{complexes}} (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) {{deposited in}} various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes {{between two and}} three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact <b>dermatitis</b> (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Like other platinum-group metal, bulk Pd {{is quite}} inert. Although contact <b>dermatitis</b> has been reported, {{data on the}} effects are limited. It {{has been shown that}} people with an {{allergic}} reaction to palladium also react to nickel, making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic.|$|E
5|$|Pet rats {{can also}} develop {{pituitary}} tumors {{if they are}} given high-calorie diets, and ringtail if they are placed in areas with low humidity or high temperatures. Staphylococcus spp. are a mostly benign group of bacteria that commonly reside {{on the top of}} the skin, but cuts and scratches from social and hierarchical fighting can open up the pathways for them to cause ulcerative <b>dermatitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phase II {{clinical}} trials {{with one of}} the candidate compounds, mapracorat (code names BOL-303242-X and ZK245186), started in summer 2009. One was a double blind dose finding study for an ointment against atopic <b>dermatitis</b> conducted by Intendis, a part of Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals specialized on dermatology. A Phase III trial started in November 2010, evaluating an ophthalmic suspension for the treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery, conducted by Bausch & Lomb.|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic-like {{psoriasis}} is {{a common}} form of psoriasis with clinical aspects of psoriasis and seborrheic <b>dermatitis,</b> {{and it may be}} difficult to distinguish from the latter. This form of psoriasis typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher sebum production such as the scalp, forehead, skin folds next to the nose, skin surrounding the mouth, skin on the chest above the sternum, and in skin folds.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras can rub and pinch the breast, causing skin {{irritation}} and breast pain, and the wire of a worn bra can protrude from the fabric and scrape or cut the skin. When {{the fabric of}} worn bra exposes an underwire, skin contact with nickel and other metals may cause contact <b>dermatitis</b> in a few women.|$|E
5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic <b>dermatitis.</b> Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact <b>dermatitis</b> reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic <b>dermatitis,</b> and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic <b>dermatitis</b> (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),â€¦, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal. It {{remains to be seen whether}} selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E
5|$|Tests on the thorium uptake {{of workers}} {{involved}} in monazite processing showed thorium levels above recommended limits in their bodies, but no {{adverse effects on}} health were found at those moderately low concentrations. No chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the tracheobronchial tract and the lungs from exposure to thorium. People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of <b>dermatitis.</b> It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions {{are more likely to}} occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic <b>dermatitis,</b> and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E
5|$|To {{do battle}} with an enemy {{expected}} to muster four or five carriers, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, needed every available U.S. flight deck. He already had Vice Admiral William Halsey's two-carrier (Enterprise and Hornet) task force at hand, though Halsey was stricken with severe <b>dermatitis</b> {{and had to be}} replaced by Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Halsey's escort commander. Nimitz also hurriedly recalled Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's task force, including the carrier Yorktown, from the South West Pacific Area.|$|E
5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact <b>dermatitis.</b> Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E
5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy <b>dermatitis</b> is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic <b>dermatitis.</b> Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid was {{detached}} {{with the}} cruisers Astoria, Minneapolis and New Orleans, and four destroyers on 11 May 1942 and sailed for NoumÃ©a, while Fletcher took {{the rest of}} Task Force 17 to Tongatapu. Kinkaid then headed north to join the Vice Admiral William F. Halsey's Task Force 16. Kinkaid's force became part of its screen which was {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. Shortly after Task Force 16 returned to Pearl Harbor, Halsey was hospitalized with a severe case of <b>dermatitis</b> and, on his recommendation, was replaced as commander of Task Force 16 by Spruance. Kinkaid then became commander of the screen, also known as Task Group 16.2. He was one of only four American flag officers present during the subsequent Battle of Midway. However, he saw little action, as Task Force 16 did not come under attack.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus is {{a species}} of fungus in the Suillaceae family of mushrooms. Commonly known as the chicken fat mushroom, the American {{slippery}} Jack (or slipperycap), or the American suillus, it grows in a mycorrhizal association with eastern white pine {{and can be found}} where this tree occurs in eastern North America and China. The mushroom can be recognized by the bright yellow cap with red to reddish-brown scales embedded in slime, the large yellow angular pores {{on the underside of the}} cap, and the narrow yellow stem marked with dark reddish dots. Molecular phylogenetics analysis suggests that S.americanus may be the same species as S.sibiricus, found in western North America and western and central Asia. Suillus americanus is edible, although opinions vary as to its palatability; some susceptible individuals may suffer a contact <b>dermatitis</b> after touching the fruit bodies. The fruit bodies contain a beta glucan carbohydrate shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{potential for}} sand whiting was first investigated {{in the late}} 1980s, {{with a number of}} reports detailing both successful trials and also a number of problems with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand whiting were more likely to grow in captivity than other whiting species, but the mortality rate of over 50% was unacceptable for use in an economic setting. A number of problems with diseases such as ulcerative <b>dermatitis</b> and the failure of the swim-bladder to inflate properly were also documented, however many of these initial problems have been overcome, and some facilities are breeding around 2000 larvae with a 95% survival rate. Some of these fingerlings are used to restock depleted estuaries, while others form the basis of commercial fish crops.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>dermatitis</b> {{including}} atopic <b>dermatitis,</b> contact <b>dermatitis,</b> stasis <b>dermatitis,</b> and seborrheic eczema. Many use the term <b>dermatitis</b> and eczema synonymously.|$|E
