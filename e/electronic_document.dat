25|$|The Greek {{alphabet}} and its successors {{settled on}} a left-to-right pattern, from the top {{to the bottom of}} the page. Other scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, came to be written right-to-left. Scripts that incorporate Chinese characters have traditionally been written vertically (top-to-bottom), from the right to the left of the page, but nowadays are frequently written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, due to Western influence, a growing need to accommodate terms in the Latin script, and technical limitations in popular <b>electronic</b> <b>document</b> formats. Chinese characters sometimes, as in signage, especially when signifying something old or traditional, may also be written from right to left. The Old Uyghur alphabet and its descendants are unique in being written top-to-bottom, left-to-right; this direction originated from an ancestral Semitic direction by rotating the page 90° counter-clockwise to conform to the appearance of vertical Chinese writing. Several scripts used in the Philippines and Indonesia, such as Hanunó'o, are traditionally written with lines moving away from the writer, from bottom to top, but are read horizontally left to right. While Ogham is written bottom to top and read vertically, commonly on the corner of a stone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Development of Electronic Archive Information System was {{the final}} step in {{completing}} Lithuania’s preparation for signed <b>electronic</b> <b>documents.</b> The system is unique not only in Lithuania, but also in Europe. It allows {{to submit to the}} state archives the official <b>electronic</b> <b>documents</b> signed by qualified e-signature, assuring their integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation and possibility to use and store them for a long or unlimited time. To resolve the interoperability problems the universal model, sufficient for complex <b>electronic</b> <b>documents</b> during whole of their life cycle has been created and described in two specifications: ADOC- for human readable <b>electronic</b> <b>documents</b> and MDOC- for machine readable <b>electronic</b> <b>documents.</b> The public free software tools for preparation, signing, preview and verification of official <b>electronic</b> <b>documents</b> have {{played an important role in}} promoting the usage of <b>electronic</b> <b>documents.</b> The paper presents practical fundamental solutions applied in Lithuania...|$|R

2500|$|Moore also {{analyzed}} the case under the precedents {{set by the}} [...] "dissemination" [...] cases. In discussing the pertinence of In re Klopfenstein, Moore analyzed each of that case's four requirements for patent invalidity due to public disseminations. According to Moore, the Live Traffic paper was available on the FTP server 24 hours per day for seven days, longer than the three days during which the posters from In re Klopfenstein were displayed. Thus, the Live Traffic paper met the first requirement of being available for longer than a transient period. Moreover, SRI had admitted during oral arguments that the target audience of the paper was members of the Internet security community. The defendants showed that this community included people {{who knew how to}} use SRI's FTP server and actually used it to share information. Thus, the FTP server met the second requirement of being accessible to experts in the field. Furthermore, neither Porras nor SRI took any steps to ensure that the paper would not be copied. Porras emailed links to the paper to many people outside of SRI and failed to take protective measures such as non-disclosure agreements or even disclaimers. Thus, the Live Traffic paper met the third requirement of failing to create a reasonable expectation that the work would not be copied. Finally, {{the very nature of the}} Live Traffic paper as an <b>electronic</b> <b>document</b> forced it to meet the fourth requirement that the document be easy to copy. Thus, Moore held that the [...] "dissemination" [...] cases clearly showed that the Live Traffic paper was publicly accessible.|$|E
