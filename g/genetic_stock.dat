5|$|The tarpan was a Eurasian {{wild horse}} that became extinct {{in the wild}} in 1879, due to hunting and {{crossbreeding}} with domesticated horses, and in 1887 the last captive horse died in Russia. The Heck horse {{was created by the}} German zoologist brothers Heinz Heck and Lutz Heck, director of the Berlin Zoo, at the Tierpark Hellabrunn (Munich Zoo) in Germany in their attempt to breed back the tarpan. The Hecks believed they could recreate the extinct tarpan subspecies by back breeding living descendants. They believed they could combine and rearrange the genetic material from these living descendants into a recreation of the extinct horse. Other breeders had the same idea, and used different <b>genetic</b> <b>stock</b> to attempt to recreate the tarpan or a reasonable look-alike. One result was a line of horses bred from American Mustangs by a breeder named Harry Hegardt.|$|E
5|$|Many lemurs {{that eat}} leaves {{tend to do}} so during times of fruit scarcity, {{sometimes}} suffering weight loss as a result. Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit (frugivory) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86native plant families and 15alien plant families. As with most tropical fruit eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from Ficus (fig) species. In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary source of vitamin C, but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own vitamin C. Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause hemosiderosis, a type of iron overload disorder, since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity {{have been shown to}} be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and <b>genetic</b> <b>stock.</b> Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species. The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{human history}} about 10% of the <b>genetic</b> <b>stock</b> {{found in the}} wild has been bred into {{palatable}} and higher yielding cereals, fruits and vegetables.

40|$|Plant genetic {{resources}} {{play a major}} role for global food security. The most significant and widespread mean of conserving plant {{genetic resources}} is ex situ conservation. Most conserved accessions are kept in specialized facilities known as genebanks maintained by public or private institutions. World-wide 7. 4 million accessions are stored in about 1, 500 ex situ genebanks. In addition, series of <b>genetic</b> <b>stocks</b> including chromosome substitution lines, alloplasmic lines, single chromosome recombinant lines, introgression lines, etc. have been created. Analysing these <b>genetic</b> <b>stocks</b> many qualitative and quantitative inherited traits were associated to certain chromosomes, chromosome arms or introgressed segments. Today, <b>genetic</b> <b>stocks</b> are supplemented by a huge number of genotyped mapping populations. Beside progenies of bi-parental crosses (doubled haploid lines, recombinant inbred lines, etc.) panels for association mapping were created recently. In our presentation we give examples for the successful utilisation of genebank accessions and <b>genetic</b> <b>stocks</b> for <b>genetic</b> and genomic studies. Using both segregation and association mapping approaches, data on mapping of loci/marker trait associations for a range of different traits are presented...|$|R

25|$|Young halibut {{are highly}} migratory and {{generally}} migrate in a clockwise direction {{east and south}} throughout the Gulf of Alaska. Halibut in older age classes {{tend to be less}} migratory, but continue to move predominately on a clockwise direction. Mature fish are also involved in winter spawning migrations towards deeper waters, migrating across several areas in some instances. Research has indicated small, localized spawning populations may occur in deep waters such as in Chatham Straight in northern Southeast Alaska. However, because of the free-floating nature of larvae and subsequent mixing of juvenile halibut from throughout the Gulf of Alaska, only one <b>genetic</b> <b>stock</b> of halibut is known in the northern Pacific.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{historically}} few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable {{progress has been made}} recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and somatic cell transgenesis in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl. The Ambystoma <b>Genetic</b> <b>Stock</b> Center (AGSC) is a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the axolotl supported by the National Science Foundation as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad.

2500|$|One of {{the main}} advocates of {{eugenics}} who helped pass Alberta's sterilization law was the first female magistrate of the British Empire, Emily Murphy, who {{was also one of}} the Famous five (canada) who campaigned for women's rights in the 1920s. Under her influence, many Albertans, especially farmers who saw first-hand what selective breeding can do to enhance livestock quality, agreed that eugenics could be used to improve human stock as well. One of the people influenced by Murphy’s opinions was the Minister of Agriculture and Health, George Hoadley. Hoadley convened the first meeting of the Alberta Eugenics Board a year after the Sexual Sterilization Act was passed. This Board interviewed all people considered to have inferior <b>genetic</b> <b>stock</b> and approved the sterilization of 4,725 of 4,800 cases. The three-member Board elected a fourth member John M. MacEachran to act as chairman, a position he held until his death in 1965.

40|$|The high {{carotenoid}} {{content in}} tritordeum (×Tritordeum Ascherson et Graebner) grains {{is derived from}} its wild parent, Hordeum chilense Roem. et Schulz. Phytoene synthase 1 (Psy 1) is located on chromosome 7 HchS and {{plays a major role}} in this trait. This study investigates the impact of the introgression of chromosome 7 Hch into common wheat background on carotenoid composition, including xanthophylls esterified with fatty acids (monoesters and diesters). All of the <b>genetic</b> <b>stocks</b> carrying Psy 1 from H. chilense increased their carotenoid content relative to common wheat. In addition, significant changes in the carotenoid profile were detected in different <b>genetic</b> <b>stocks.</b> The most relevant was the increase in content of lutein diesters when both 7 Hch and 7 D were present, which indicates the existence of genes involved in the esterification of xanthophylls in both chromosomes. Furthermore, our results suggest that 7 Hch genes preferentially esterify lutein with palmitic acid, whereas 7 D is either indifferent to the fatty acid or it prefers linoleic acid for lutein esterification. The involvement and complementarity of 7 Hch and 7 D are highly significant considering the scarcity of previous results on lutein esterification in wheat. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
