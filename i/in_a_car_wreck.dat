However, while both Boss Hogg and Uncle Jesse would scowl at the mention of the other's name, the two enjoyed a lifelong [...] "friendship" [...] of sorts, with one helping the other when in desperate need. Jesse educated his nephews against Hogg, and often provides the cousins with inspirational sage advice. Uncle Jesse drives a white 1973 Ford F-100 pickup truck.

They won their first game against Caltech with a shutout score of 25–0. McKale retired after sixteen seasons at Arizona.
