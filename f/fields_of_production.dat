5000|$|The {{overproduction}} {{of commodities}} forces businesses to reduce production {{in order to}} clear inventories. Any reduction in production implies a reduction in employment. A reduction in employment, in turn, reduces consumption. As overproduction is the excess of production above consumption, this reduction in consumption worsens the problem. This creates a [...] "feed-back loop" [...] or [...] "vicious cycle", whereby excess inventories force businesses to reduce production, thereby reducing employment, which in turn reduces the demand for the excess inventories. The general reduction {{in the level of}} prices (deflation) caused by the law of supply and demand also forces businesses to reduce production as profits decline. Reduced profits render certain <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> unprofitable.|$|E
5000|$|Though recontextualisation {{often is}} used within linguistics, {{it also has}} {{interdisciplinary}} applications. Particularly, in Basil Bernstein's concept of the pedagogic device that consists of three fields: the <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> recontextualisation and reproduction. The field of reproduction is the field of schooling institutions. The field of production is the field, where knowledge is produced (often universities). The field of recontextualisation mediates between these two fields. The recontextualisation field [...] "is composed of two sub-fields; namely, the official recontextualising field (ORF) and the pedagogic recontextualising field (PRF). The ORF consists of 'specialized departments and sub-agencies of the State and local educational authorities'. The PRF consists of university departments of education, their research as well as specialised educational media.|$|E

50|$|Two of {{the most}} {{significant}} systems of human philosophy and religion, Confucianism (China) and Buddhism (India), were officially transplanted in 284-5 and 522 AD respectively, and became deeply acculturated into indigenous Japanese thought and ethics. David and Zweigert and Kotz argue that the old Chinese doctrines of Confucius, which emphasize social/group/community harmony rather than individual interests, have been very influential in the Japanese society, with the consequence that individuals tend to avoid litigation in favour of compromise and conciliation. In addition, it is presently believed that various arts and techniques in many <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> such as agriculture, weaving, pottery, building construction, medicine and tanning, were brought to Japan by immigrants by way of the Korean peninsula. These immigrants, wherever they came from, had significant influence on the development of Japan.|$|E

Several thousand years before the beginning of these events, an advanced extraterrestrial life form known as the Maians discovered life on Earth and great potential, but decided to let humans develop undisturbed. Another life form, the Skedar, who were bent on fighting, encountered the Maians and soon a war began between them. In 1985, Daniel Carrington discovered and contacted the Maians, and gradually a mutual interest began to grow between them.|$|E
