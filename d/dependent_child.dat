30|$|Being {{a female}} gambler living with <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> was {{associated}} with over five times the odds of also being a victim of family violence amongst help-seeking gamblers, compared to male gamblers without <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> Importantly, this finding remained even after sociodemographic and psychosocial factors known {{to be associated with}} violence were adjusted for, and once gambling factors were considered. Our final adjusted estimate of the odds was that females with <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> were six times more likely than males without <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> to be victims of family violence (Model 4, Table  5). The persistence of this effect, despite adjustment for known contextual factors, indicates a strong gender dimension to the effect of having <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> on being a victim of family violence among gamblers. Why is it that females living with <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> are especially vulnerable? This question warrants further research in regard to the particular gendered social and psychological processes at work, and highlights the necessity for interventions to reduce victimisation that involve female gamblers with <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> In this study, over two-thirds of female gambler participants with <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> lived in homes where violence was occurring; 68 % where violence was perpetrated by the female gambler, and 77 % where the female gambler was a victim of violence. Thus, children in such homes were subject to an environment with violence occurring.|$|R

30|$|This {{study has}} shown that the {{relationship}} between having <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> and being a victim of family violence was gender-related, with female gamblers living with <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> reporting more family violence perpetration and victimisation than male gamblers living with <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> Additionally, female gamblers with <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> had greater odds of being a victim of family violence than male gamblers without <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> The implications of this finding are that children living in homes where the mother is a gambler, have a higher risk of living in a household within which family violence is occurring, increasing their vulnerability to poorer health outcomes. Thus, as a harm minimisation measure, it would be prudent for a coordinated approach to be developed between different health and social service sectors for potential early identification of family violence. In particular, it would be useful for gambling treatment services to routinely screen for family violence, particularly in households with <b>dependent</b> <b>children,</b> so that clients can be facilitated, as necessary, to relevant family violence services for assistance. Conversely, family violence services may benefit from screening for problematic gambling. In an ideal world, there would be a collaborative inter-agency and case management approach in order to identify family violence amongst people, particularly those with <b>dependent</b> <b>children,</b> who are affected by gambling problems; this could improve the prospects and outcomes for those people.|$|R

60|$|The first {{fact that}} I learned, {{was the very}} {{important}} one that the vicomtesse had lost all her usual means of support by the late revolution, and the consequent exile of the dauphine. This blow, so terrible to the grandmother and her <b>dependent</b> <b>child,</b> had occurred, too, most inopportunely, as to time. A half year's pension was nearly due {{at the moment the}} great change occurred, and the day of payment arrived and passed, leaving these two females literally without twenty francs. Had {{it not been for the}} remains of the trousseau, both must have begged, or perished of want. The crisis called for decision, and fortunately the old lady, who had already witnessed so many vicissitudes, had still sufficient energy to direct their proceedings. Paris was the best place in which to dispose of her effects, and thither she and Adrienne came, without a moment's delay. The shops were first tried, but the shops, in the autumn of 1830, offered indifferent resources for the seller. Valuable effects were there daily sold for a twentieth part of their original cost, and the vicomtesse saw her little stores diminish daily; for the Mont de Piete was obliged to regulate its own proceedings by the received current values of the day. Old age, vexation, and this last most cruel blow, did not fail of effecting that which might have been foreseen. The vicomtesse sunk under this accumulation of misfortunes, and became bed-ridden, helpless, and querulous. Every thing now devolved on the timid, gentle, unpracticed Adrienne. All females of her condition, in countries advanced in civilization like France, look to the resource of imparting a portion of what they themselves have acquired, to others of their own sex, in moments of urgent necessity. The possibility of Adrienne's being compelled to become a governess, or a companion, had long been kept in view, but the situation of Mad. de la Rocheaimard forbade any attempt of the sort, for the moment, had the state of the country rendered it at all probable that a situation could have been procured. On this fearful exigency, Adrienne had aroused all her energies, and gone deliberately into the consideration of her circumstances.|$|E

30|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of problem gambler gender {{on the relationship between}} the gambler having <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> (younger than 18  years) living at home and the gambler perpetrating or being a victim of family violence. The sample comprised 164 help-seeking gamblers (43 % female; 37 % with dependent child/ren) recruited from three national gambling treatment services in New Zealand. Family violence was measured using {{a modified version of the}} HITS scale covering physical, psychological, verbal, emotional and sexual violence. Forty-nine percent of participants reported being a victim of violence and 43 % had perpetrated violence. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was conducted, adjusting in sequence for significant socio-demographic, psychosocial and gambling factors. The relationship between having <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> and being a victim of family violence was gender-related. Female gamblers living with <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> reported more family violence perpetration and victimisation than male gamblers living with <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b> Female gamblers with <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> living at home had greater odds of being a victim of family violence than male gamblers without <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> living at home. This relationship remained when adjusted for contextual factors of being a victim (ethnicity, income support status, and feelings of inadequacy) in this sample. A similar gender effect of having <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> living at home on violence perpetration disappeared when known psychosocial contextual factors of violence perpetration (aggression, difficulties in emotion regulation, drug issue in the family, and interpersonal support) were taken into account. These findings suggest the value of coordinated approaches between gambling treatment services and programmes supporting vulnerable families in order to identify vulnerable families and put support mechanisms in place.|$|R

30|$|Being {{a female}} gambler {{and living with}} <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> was {{significantly}} associated with more than four times the odds for perpetrating family violence amongst help-seeking gamblers, compared with being male and not living with <b>dependent</b> <b>children,</b> even after adjusting for significant sociodemographic factors. However, once psychosocial factors were also taken into account, this effect disappeared. This suggests {{that it is not the}} combination of female gender and having <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> per se that is related to increased violence perpetration but the association of that combination with other contextual factors that leads to the higher risk for perpetrating family violence. In their Australian study, Dowling et al. (2014) discuss their findings of elevated odds of victimisation, and combined victimisation and perpetration among female gamblers commenting that “this group of service users should be specifically targeted for screening, assessment and management” (p. 1716). The current results suggest that interventions targeted to female gamblers with <b>dependent</b> <b>children</b> that focus on addressing broader family issues such as drug use and the availability of tangible support, in addition to emotion regulation strategies could potentially reduce the risk of violence perpetration by female gamblers with <b>dependent</b> <b>children.</b>|$|R
