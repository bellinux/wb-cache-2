5|$|A hydro-electric {{scheme was}} built in 2016 on Radyr Weir to {{generate}} renewable energy. The Radyr Weir scheme channels more than 500 million cubic metres of water per year through two screw turbines {{and is expected to}} generate 400kW — <b>enough</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> power three of the city’s leisure centres — which will save 700 tonnes of CO2 annually.|$|E
5|$|Liquid xenon {{is used in}} calorimeters {{to measure}} gamma rays, and as a {{detector}} of hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, theory predicts it will impart <b>enough</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> cause ionization and scintillation. Liquid xenon is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through self-shielding.|$|E

50|$|If a continuous-circuit coaster {{does not}} have <b>enough</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> {{completely}} travel the course after descending from its highest point (as can happen with high winds or increased friction), the train can valley: that is, roll backwards and forwards along the track, until all kinetic energy has been released. The train will then come to a complete stop {{in the middle of}} the track. This, however, works somewhat differently on a launched coaster. When a train launcher {{does not have}} <b>enough</b> potential <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> launch the train to the top of an incline, the train is said to roll back.|$|R

5|$|The {{evolution}} of the asteroid belt after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by collisions. Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision. In the asteroid belt this usually is not the case. As a result, many larger objects have been broken apart, and sometimes newer objects have been forged from the remnants in less violent collisions. Moons around some asteroids currently can only be explained as consolidations of material flung away from the parent object without <b>enough</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> entirely escape its gravity.|$|E
5|$|This made reactor {{plutonium}} {{unsuitable for}} use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too quickly, causing a predetonation that would release <b>enough</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> disperse the critical mass with a minimal amount of plutonium reacted (a fizzle). A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was considered and rejected, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.|$|E
5|$|In the final, Jastremski {{attacked}} {{from the}} outset as expected, while O'Brien raced with a characteristically even pace. After being fourth at the halfway mark behind Jastremski, Prokopenko and Henninger, O'Brien panicked and accelerated in the third 50m and overtook Jastremski, leaving the American in fourth place. He then moved past Henninger, before overtaking Prokopenko. O'Brien's acceleration in the third meant that he tired at the end, but he had <b>enough</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> fend off Prokopenko in the late stages to win {{the gold medal in}} a new world record time of 2min 27.8s, a margin of 0.4s, with Jastremski a further 1.4s in arrears. O'Brien had reduced his personal best time by more than four seconds during the Olympics to claim an upset win.|$|E

50|$|In the physics-based gameplay, {{the player}} swings large melee weapons and relies on {{centripetal}} force {{to give the}} object <b>enough</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> destroy enemies. The demo release had six main types of weapons - four melee and two ranged.|$|R
5|$|In most {{fusion energy}} designs, fusion {{neutrons}} react {{with a blanket}} of lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major issue with the fission–fusion design is that the neutrons causing fission are no longer available for tritium breeding. While the fission reactions release additional neutrons, these do not have <b>enough</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy neutrons will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, {{and more than one}} T per neutron is needed to make up for natural decay and other losses. Using Li-6, neutrons from the fission would make up for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other fission reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; burning up the fuel through fusion neutrons, or providing power through self-induced fission events.|$|E
5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by {{using some of the}} liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving it <b>enough</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{radioactivity}} of thorium and uranium {{made it hard}} to determine what was happening when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called hesperium and ausonium. The chemist Ida Noddack criticised this work, suggesting that some of the experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium, and its claim to have discovered masurium (technetium) was disputed. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have <b>enough</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.|$|E

5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is <b>enough</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E
