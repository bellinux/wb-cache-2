5|$|As the German commanders on {{the spot}} <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> Hitler in vain, there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the {{concentration}} of their armoured reserves at {{the western end of}} the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} there were {{conflicting}} reports {{that she had not}} and allegations that she <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> a nearby convoy of the presence of a U-boat. The British nationality of her captain became an issue in the Irish general election of June 1943, there were diplomatic exchanges between the United States and Ireland, and questions raised in the British House of Commons. In Germany, the U-boat's captain received a mild reprimand.|$|E
5|$|Captain Glušica {{was given}} {{clearance}} to land, however, he suddenly aborted the attempted landing. The aircraft's throttle handle {{was found in}} the forward position, suggesting that the pilot had attempted to abort the landing and take off again. The co-pilot Ahluwalia <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> his commander three times to go around instead of landing; the first of these warnings had come 2.5 miles before the runway threshold.|$|E

5|$|Generalfeldmarshall Günther von Kluge was the German supreme {{commander}} in the West. After Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel was injured by Allied aircraft on 17 July, Kluge also took over direct command of Army Group B, the formation conducting the battle in Normandy. He <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> Hitler on 22 July that {{the collapse of the}} front was imminent, but Hitler continued to order him to stand fast.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of November29, 1729, the Natchez came to Chépart with corn, poultry, and deerskins, also {{carrying}} with them a calumet—well known as a peace symbol. The commandant, still somewhat intoxicated from drinking the night before, was certain that the Natchez had no violent intentions, and he challenged those who <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> of an attack {{to prove that the}} rumors were accurate.|$|E
5|$|The abrupt {{abolition}} of slavery which Rio Branco <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> against eventually occurred eight years later. This {{resulted in the}} alienation of the second Viscount of Uruguai's ultraconservative faction and powerful political interests. These formed a subversive alliance with republicans and discontented military officers {{which led to the}} overthrow of the Empire on 15 November 1889.|$|E

5|$|Tickets for {{the match}} had been selling for £500 {{in the lead}} up to the game. UEFA and the Spanish police <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> Celtic fans to avoid buying the 700 {{estimated}} fake tickets that were circulating before the game. Many of the fans who {{were not able to}} get tickets for the final watched the game on a large screen placed a mile from the stadium.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, another group of Hatanaka's rebels led by Captain Takeo Sasaki went to Prime Minister Suzuki's office, intent on killing him. When they found it empty, they machine-gunned the office and set the {{building}} on fire, then left for his home. Hisatsune Sakomizu <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> Suzuki, and he escaped minutes before the would-be assassins arrived. After setting fire to Suzuki's home, {{they went to the}} estate of Kiichirō Hiranuma to assassinate him. Hiranuma escaped through a side gate and the rebels burned his house as well. Suzuki spent the rest of August under police protection, spending each night in a different bed.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He {{told the court}} that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, and said he <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated {{that he had been}} asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E

5|$|For the operation, the Germans {{committed}} five Air Corps to the attack, comprising 1,100 aircraft. The {{operation was}} launched on 3 June 1940. British intelligence <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> the French {{of the impending}} attack, and the operation failed to achieve the strategic results desired by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force). Fortunately for the Luftwaffe, {{the plight of the}} French ground and air forces at this stage meant that the failure of the operation would not impede the defeat of France.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 1985, Wiggins {{was traded}} to the Orioles for {{pitchers}} Roy Lee Jackson and Richard Caldwell. Padres owner Joan Kroc said that the team <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> Wiggins that he would not remain with the team if he had further problems with drugs. She stated {{that it would have been}} self-serving to keep Wiggins after his relapse when he could instead pursue a fresh start with another team. Nonetheless, Gwynn felt that Wiggins had been shortchanged by the Padres.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E

5|$|The brawl {{began with}} 45.9seconds {{remaining}} in the game, when Indiana led 97–82. The Pistons' Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by the Pacers' Ron Artest (now known as Metta World Peace), who slapped him {{across the back of}} the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> him he would be hit. Wallace responded by shoving Artest in the face with both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep Wallace and Artest separated.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00 on 26 April 1797, the 74-gun ship of {{the line}} HMS Irresistible under Captain George Martin and the 36-gun frigate HMS Emerald under Captain Velterers Cornewall Berkeley were sailing at the {{southern}} edge of Jervis' (now known as Earl St. Vincent) fleet. While cruising close to the Spanish coast two unknown ships were sighted. Martin immediately ordered his ships to give chase and the strangers fled with Martin's vessels in pursuit. The new arrivals were two Spanish 34-gun frigates, the Santa Elena and Ninfa, bound to Cádiz from Havana with a cargo of silver specie. The captains of these Spanish ships had unwittingly sailed into the midst of the blockade fleet the previous night, but had had a fortunate encounter with a Spanish fishing vessel which <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> them of the danger. Acting quickly, the captains off-loaded their treasure into the fishing boat with instructions to carry it safely into Cádiz.|$|E
5|$|Before other British {{outposts}} {{had learned}} about Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Native Americans captured five small forts {{in a series of}} attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was Fort Sandusky, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots, who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed {{in the early stages of}} the war. The dead were ritually scalped and the fort—as the Wyandots <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> a year earlier—was burned to the ground.|$|E

5|$|Enrollment dropped {{every year}} since the program's {{inception}} such that, when compounded by dropouts, the program was below half-capacity three years later. UW President Glenn Frank <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired. He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve {{what he saw as}} a communication issue. The adviser found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students {{to the point where they}} did not consider improvements upon that model. The adviser found students uninterested in the Experimental College's prospects.|$|E
5|$|In World War II, {{the bomber}} mafia's {{theory of the}} primacy of unescorted {{daylight}} strategic bombing was proved wrong. Fleets of heavy bombers {{were not able to}} achieve victory without the cooperation of the Army and Navy, and required the protection of long-range fighters for deep penetration missions. Overall casualties in the war were not minimal, and victory did not come significantly quicker. Precision in bombing was not achieved until long-range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved, as opponents <b>had</b> <b>warned.</b> The strategic bombing concept, however, was {{a major factor in the}} eventual victory and became the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force. Its proponents continued to promote the doctrine into the nuclear age, forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear warfare. The bomber mafia was gradually replaced in the 1950s and 1960s by advocates of intercontinental ballistic missile warfare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{two weeks before the}} test, some 250 {{personnel}} from Los Alamos were at work at the Trinity site, and Lieutenant Bush's command had ballooned to 125 men guarding and maintaining the base camp. Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary. They had enough vehicles to move 450 people to safety, and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation. Groves <b>had</b> <b>warned</b> the Governor of New Mexico, John J. Dempsey, that martial law might have to be declared in the southwestern part of the state.|$|E
