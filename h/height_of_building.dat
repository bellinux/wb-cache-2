40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to numerically study flow and traffic exhaust dispersion in urban street canyons with different configurations to find out the urban-planning strategies to ease the air pollution. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model used in this study—Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) software package—was firstly validated against the wind-tunnel experiment data by using three different k-ε turbulence models. And then the patterns of flow and dispersion within three different kinds of street canyon configuration under the perpendicular approaching flow were numerically studied. The result showed that the width and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> can dramatically affect the pollution level inside the street canyon. As the width or <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> increases, the pollution at the pedestrian level increases. And the asymmetric configuration (step-up or step-down street canyon) could provide better ventilation. It is recommended to design a street canyon with nonuniform configurations. And the OpenFOAM software package can be used as a reliable tool to study flows and dispersions around buildings...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Disaster is the {{fundamental}} problem that causes loss of life and property around the world. Especially, when occurring in urban area which has characters of the high population density, it make negative impact to tremendous people and their property. In order to prepare and mitigate the effect of disaster, Evaluating land value and disaster risk in term of spatial information is necessary. This research proposed a methodology to estimate land value and disaster risk in urban area using remotely sensed data. High-resolution satellite images acquired by GeoEye- 1 satellite and past to present medium-resolution satellite images provided by Landsat 1 - 7 satellites have been used. The high-resolution images have been employed to provide land cover and digital elevation model (DEM) and medium-resolution time series were extracted to get land cover changes. Using both land cover and DEM, <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> that can indicate residential or commercial areas were able to obtain. Land value has been estimated in term of index based on <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> and land cover change. While disaster risk has been assessed by using land elevation and floodway for flood risk, and by using distance from fault line, land slope and indirect age of building for earthquake risk. In our experiment, Yangon, former capital of Myanmar, was concentrated to evaluate {{since it is the}} country's largest city with over five million people and has had suffer with flood and earthquake disasters. There are three resultant maps with land value, flood risk and earthquake risk. For validation, the land value map was compared with landmark buildings by surveying.
