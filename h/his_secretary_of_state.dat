5|$|Bent on {{securing}} Reedman's investiture quickly, the Rhodesian {{government made}} it publicly known on 19 June that, pursuant to British and Portuguese approval, Reedman would be appointed within seven days. Whitehall still took no action.

5|$|Morrow's first {{political}} experience {{was working in}} his uncle William O. Bradley's gubernatorial campaign in 1895. In 1899, Republican gubernatorial candidate William S. Taylor offered to make Morrow <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> in exchange for Bradley's support in the election; Bradley refused. Despite the encouragement of friends, Morrow declined {{to run for governor}} in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Harding chose pro-League Charles Evans Hughes as <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> {{ignoring}} {{advice from}} Senator Lodge and others. After Charles G.

Harding appointed Herbert Hoover as United States Secretary of Commerce. RNC Chairman Will Hays was made Postmaster General, then a cabinet post; he would leave after a year in the position to become chief censor to the motion picture industry.|$|E

5|$|Taft and <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> Philander Knox, {{instituted a}} policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America, believing U.S. {{investment}} would benefit all involved, while diminishing European influence in regions where the Monroe Doctrine applied. The policy was unpopular among Latin American states that {{did not wish to}} become financial protectorates of the United States, {{as well as in the}} U.S. Senate, many of whose members believed the U.S. should not interfere abroad. No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's policy more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the Mexican Revolution.|$|E
5|$|To {{show his}} {{commitment}} to reform, Hayes appointed {{one of the best-known}} advocates of reform, Carl Schurz, to be Secretary of the Interior and asked Schurz and William M. Evarts, <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> to lead a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments. John Sherman, the Treasury Secretary, ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was stacked with Conkling's spoilsmen. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} inauguration, Jefferson {{instructed}} <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> James Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions. Further, {{an act of}} March 8, 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madisonconcerning a confirmed D.C. {{justice of the peace}} who had not received his commissionas a test case for the constitutionality of the repeal. The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before the repeal would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system.|$|E

50|$|After the {{experience}} during the Trienio Liberal the Council of Ministers was formally created by King Ferdinand VII, who ordered by Royal Decree of 19 November 1823 that <b>his</b> <b>Secretaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> (Secretarios de Estado y del Despacho) should gather {{to form a}} body, {{which was to be}} called Council of Ministers. In the meetings of this Council all matters of common interest would be discussed, and every Secretary would report about affairs under his responsibility and receive instructions from the King. The <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> would act as Chief Minister and preside over the meetings when the King was absent.|$|R
5|$|Later, Owsley's tenure {{would be}} marred by a {{conflict}} with Benjamin Hardin, <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State.</b> Hardin believed that by supporting Owsley in the gubernatorial election, he would obtain some influence in Owsley's choices for other appointments. Tensions between Hardin and Owsley worsened as Hardin became increasingly frustrated with his lack of influence. On September 1, 1846, Owsley removed Hardin from his cabinet, charging that Hardin had abandoned his duties {{because he did not}} reside in Frankfort. Hardin challenged this premise for his removal, and when Owsley nominated George B. Kinkead to replace Hardin, the state senate voted 30—8 that no vacancy existed. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Vindicated, Hardin then resigned, charging Owsley with practicing nepotism. In the Kentucky Constitution of 1850, the governor was stripped of his power to remove the Secretary of State from office.|$|E
5|$|Senate {{and house}} legislators who had favored Benton's renegotiated {{version of the}} Texas {{annexation}} bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure, but leave its implementation to the incoming Polk administration. But, during his last day in office, President Tyler, with the urging of <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Calhoun, decided to act decisively to improve the odds for the immediate annexation of Texas. On March 3, 1845, with his cabinet's assent, he dispatched an offer of annexation to the Republic of Texas by courier, exclusively {{under the terms of}} the Brown–Foster option of the joint house measure. Secretary Calhoun apprised President-elect Polk of the action, who demurred without comment. Tyler justified his preemptive move on the grounds that Polk was likely to come under pressure to abandon immediate annexation and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Jimmy Carter {{became the}} first Democratic {{president}} to use a Saxbe fix when he appointed Senator Edmund Muskie as <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State.</b> Cyrus Vance had resigned on April 28, 1980. (Ironically, Muskie {{had been one of}} the ten senators voting against Saxbe's confirmation.) Carter nominated Muskie on April 29, and the Senate confirmed Muskie on May 7 by a 94–2 vote. Unlike the Knox and Saxbe fixes, the salary reduction to allow Muskie's appointment was temporary, reducing the salary only for the duration of Muskie's tenure. When Carter appointed Representative Abner Mikva to the D.C. Circuit, a lawsuit challenging the appointment based on Ineligibility Clause objections again failed for lack of standing.|$|E

5|$|The British people {{returned}} Clement Attlee and his Labour Party {{later in}} July. Attlee and <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> for India, Lord Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, immediately ordered {{a review of}} the Indian situation. Jinnah had no comment on the change of government, but called a meeting of his Working Committee and issued a statement calling for new elections in India. The League held influence at the provincial level in the Muslim-majority states mostly by alliance, and Jinnah believed that, given the opportunity, the League would improve its electoral standing and lend added support to his claim to be the sole spokesman for the Muslims. Wavell returned to India in September after consultation with his new masters in London; elections, both for the centre and for the provinces, were announced soon after. The British indicated that formation of a constitution-making body would follow the votes.|$|E
5|$|Harrison had {{developed}} {{his foreign policy}} based largely on Blaine’s ideas, and {{at the start of}} his term, Harrison and Blaine had very similar views on the United States' place in the world. In spite of their shared worldview, however, the two men became personally unfriendly as the term went on. Harrison was conscious that <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> was more popular than he, and while he admired Blaine’s gift for diplomacy, he grew displeased with Blaine’s frequent absence from his post because of illness, and suspected that Blaine was angling for the presidential nomination in 1892. Harrison tried to limit how many “Blaine men” filled subordinate positions in the State Department and denied Blaine’s request that his son, Walker, be appointed First Assistant Secretary, instead naming him Solicitor of the Department of State. Despite the growing personal rancor, the two men continued, with one exception, to agree on the foreign policy questions of the day.|$|E
5|$|Taylor and <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> John M. Clayton, both lacked {{diplomatic}} experience, {{and came}} into office at a relatively uneventful time in American–international politics. Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight, although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration. As opponents of the autocratic European order, they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848, although they offered {{little in the way}} of aid. A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced, and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh words from the Taylor administration. In a more positive effort, the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom's search for a team of British explorers, led by John Franklin, who had gotten lost in the Arctic. While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative, the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East.|$|E

5|$|A Democratic-Republican, Garrard {{opposed the}} Alien and Sedition Acts and favored {{passage of the}} Kentucky Resolutions. He lobbied for public education, militia and prison reforms, {{business}} subsidies, and legislation favorable to the state's large debtor class. In 1798, the state's first governor's mansion was constructed, and Garrard became its first resident. Due {{in part to the}} confusion resulting from the 1795 election, he favored calling a constitutional convention in 1799. Because of his anti-slavery views, he was not chosen as a delegate to the convention. Under the resulting constitution, the governor was popularly elected and was forbidden from succeeding himself in office, although Garrard was personally exempted from this provision and was re-elected in 1799. During his second term, he applauded Thomas Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana from France as a means of dealing with the closure of the port at New Orleans to U.S. goods. Late in his term, <b>his</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> Harry Toulmin, persuaded him to adopt some doctrines of Unitarianism, and he was expelled from the Baptist church, ending his ministry. He also clashed with the legislature over the appointment of a registrar for the state land office, leaving him embittered and unwilling to continue in politics after the conclusion of his term. He retired to his estate, Mount Lebanon, and engaged in agricultural and commercial pursuits until his death on January 19, 1822. Garrard County, Kentucky, created during his first term, was named in his honor.|$|E

50|$|Even Truman's {{overhaul}} of the machinery in 1949 did not create a National Security Council that fulfilled the role originally envisioned. Truman was partly to blame. He insisted on going outside NSC channels for national security advice, relying directly on <b>his</b> <b>Secretaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> and Defense, and increasingly on the Bureau of the Budget. Attendance at NSC meetings gradually increased {{to a point where}} the Council became too large for free discussion and degenerated into a bureaucratic battleground of departmental rivalries. NSC lines of authority, never clear, became increasingly blurred. By not attending most NSC meetings, Truman ensured that Council members would seek him out to press their own viewpoints privately.|$|R
