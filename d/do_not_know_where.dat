5|$|In the North Atlantic, two {{stocks of}} B. m. musculus are recognised. The first is found off Greenland, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. This group is {{estimated}} to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from the Azores in spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the two volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted {{as far north as}} Spitsbergen and Jan Mayen, though such sightings are rare. Scientists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population {{is estimated to}} be between 600 and 1,500. Off Ireland, the first confirmed sightings were made in 2008, since then Porcupine Seabight has been regarded as a prominent habitat for the species along with fin whales. One was sighted along Galicia, Spain, in 2017.|$|E

The International Whaling Commission is based in Impington, while the now abolished East of England Development Agency was based in Histon. Histon is also the location of the radio station Heart 103 (formerly Q103), which covers Cambridge, Ely, Newmarket, Huntingdon and Royston and is part of Global Radio.|$|E
25|$|The Reform Party's {{success in}} 1993 {{was related to}} the {{mobilization}} of people who were opposed to the welfare state, but this represents only one dimension of the party's appeal. Jenkins (2002) examines the effect of issues on Reform support during the campaign and considers the actual process by which issues affected party support. Although candidates can prime or stress certain issues for voters, the priming label is sometimes misused. Jenkins makes a distinction between campaign learning and priming. If voters <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> a party stands on an issue, they cannot adequately employ this information in their overall evaluation. Evidence demonstrates that the increased importance of attitudes toward the welfare state was largely a function of the distribution of new information or learning, while the increased importance of cultural questions represented priming.|$|E

500|$|Corzine was subpoenaed {{to appear}} before a House {{committee}} on December 8, 2011, to answer questions regarding 1.2 billion dollars of missing money from MF Global client accounts. He testified before the committee, [...] "I simply <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date", and that {{given the number of}} money transfers {{in the final days of}} trading at MF Global, he didn't know specifics of the movement of the funds. He also denied authorizing any misuse of customer funds. In March 2012, Bloomberg reported on a memo produced by congressional investigators that quoted an internal company e-mail relating to a $175 million transfer which was a subject of their investigation. Initial media reports suggested impropriety on Mr. Corzine's part, but this was later disproved. According to the New York Times, the employee responsible for the transfer e-mailed Mr. Corzine stating the transfer was a [...] "House Wire", meaning it came from the firm's own account. The instructions Mr. Corzine had given were to deal with several overdrafts at JPMorgan Chase, but never related to any specific accounts or specific transfers made. A spokesperson for Mr. Corzine responded that Corzine [...] "never directed Ms. O’Brien or anyone else regarding which account should be used to cure the overdrafts, and he never directed that customer funds should be used for that purpose. Nor was he informed that customer funds had been used for that purpose." [...] In fact, as the New York Times reported, Mr. Corzine had been given specific assurances that the transfer in question was proper, and that no customer funds had been used. Subsequent court filings also attest to this fact. On November 5, 2013 The New York Times reported that MF Global customers would likely recover 100 percent of their funds. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine said [...] "Mr. Corzine is very pleased that all customers will receive a full recovery. This is a great outcome, which has been anticipated for many months." [...] Customers have since received distributions making them whole.|$|E

2500|$|Zero Time Dilemma is an {{adventure}} game consisting of multiple chapters, representing 90-minute periods; chapters consist of narrative sections and escape-the-room puzzle sections. The chapters, {{referred to as}} [...] "fragments", are chosen through the Floating Fragment system, in which the player gets to choose a fragment to play based on an image and a vague description. The fragments can be played out of order; the characters lose their memory after each 90-minute period, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> {{they are in the}} timeline. When the player completes a fragment, they are returned to the Floating Fragment screen, and the completed fragment is placed in a narrative flowchart, indicating where it takes place in the story.|$|E

2500|$|Obesity {{prevalence}} {{is affected}} by access to care for truckers. Company drivers often have issues with insurance, such as necessary pre-approval if out of network. Most owner-operator drivers {{do not have any}} kind of medical insurance (that is, in the USA where medical treatment isn't free of charge like most countries). [...] Moreover, truckers have difficulties making an appointment on the road and often <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to stop for assistance. Many self-diagnose or ignore their health issue altogether. [...] Some are able to be seen at doctor’s offices or private clinics while a large percentage depend on emergency rooms and urgent care visits. The Department of Transportation has Convenient Care Clinics across the U.S., but those are hard to find and are few and far between. Health care costs are substantially higher for overweight and obese individuals, so obesity in the truck driver population puts a greater financial demand on the industry.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study in}} 2008 {{concluded}} that a contributing factor to the Israeli Defense Force's defeat in the Israeli-Hezbollah Conflict in the Summer of 2006 was {{due in large part}} to an over reliance on EBO concepts. However, contrary to this opinion, Dag Henriksen, PhD, Royal Norwegian Air Force Academy, highlights the reality that [...] "the absence of a clearly identified military strategy for war or of one’s objectives reduces the relevance of the concept of EBO—or, indeed, of any military concept. In other words, if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you are going, the means to get there is hardly the key problem. Thus, one risks cherry-picking the variable (in this case EBO) that actually played a subordinate role in the negative outcome for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during this conflict. Logically, these factors render this particular conflict largely unsuitable as an empirical foundation for harshly criticizing EBO." [...] Henriksen's study finds that the Israeli campaign in 2006 does not provide sufficient empirical evidence of flaws in EBO.|$|E

I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows that race is the great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is indeed admirable.Another foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had {{spent most of his life}} in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power:"...
