5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation.

Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>imagined</b> a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine.
