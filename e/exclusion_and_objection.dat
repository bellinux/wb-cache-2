I find, first, that citation <b>and</b> <b>objection</b> stock represent the knowledge stock of the company well, whereas patent stock itself is an ineffective proxy for the knowledge stock. Objection stock seems to be the best proxy for the knowledge stock. Second, citation <b>and</b> <b>objection</b> stocks are effective in playing {{the role of}} control factors for successful R&D stock, whereas patent stock is only effective if lags in R&D stock are incorporated. Third, citation <b>and</b> <b>objection</b> stocks are good proxies for controlling for the quality of patent stock.

This corresponds {{with one of the}} requirements developed in Dutch jurisprudence: if the justification of a ju dicial decision does not reflect on essential counter-arguments, the decision may be quashed in appeal. I will first examine what textual clues identify counter-arguments <b>and</b> <b>objections,</b> <b>and</b> then discuss the criteria that are used in legal practice to ev aluate how well the justification responds to counter-arguments <b>and</b> <b>objections.</b> Finally, I compare these with proposals for dialectical criteria...|$|R

40|$|<b>Exclusion,</b> reintegration, <b>and</b> sexual {{offending}} are {{explored in}} this thesis with particular reference to the 'black box' of probation practice. <b>Exclusion</b> <b>and</b> reintegration are discussed in conceptual terms and with reference to existing theoretical and empirical literature. Conceptually, <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> reintegration are both complex and diverse, with {{the first part of}} the thesis devoted to exploration of links between subjects such as social capital <b>and</b> citizenship, <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> rei ntegration. Theories from existing theoretical and empirical research pertaining to the backdrop to sex offender probation practice, <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> reintegration are then considered. Considering such theories leads to the 'co-presence' thesis, which suggests that both <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> reintegration will have roles to playas strategies and objectives in sex offender probation practice. An empirical investigation of the 'black box' of probation practice then considers the roles that <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> reintegration play in sex offender probation practice and the applicability of the 'co-presence' thesis. Though the writer found that the 'co-presence' thesis was applicable to sex offender probation practice, with <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> reintegration playing important roles, the emergent picture was not a straightforward one. Offenders were classified into different groups via a taxonomy, highlighting differences in terms of their levels of reintegration, strategies that were adopted, and the impact of such strategies on offenders' lives. Consideration of various 'problematics' also highlights the complexities raised by sex offender reintegration, especially where offenders were not 'integrated' prior to their current convictions. The 'problematics' identified reduced scope for the use of reintegrative strategies with sex offenders. This thesis highlights the need to understand and explore the roles that <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> reintegration play in sex offender probation practice in order to maximise beneficial outcomes arising from such probation practice.

40|$|Social <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> {{inclusion}} {{have become}} popular concepts discussed in social sciences {{for the last}} three decades. In extant literature, it is understood that discussions around these concepts rarely refer to the classical sociological thought emerged in Europe, even though these concepts are quite relative to discuss within the boundaries of sociological thought, especially in conflict tradition. Little attention has also been paid to explanation of social <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> social inclusion as regards to the conflict tradition. In this regard, this piece of work relates the issue to thoughts of two leading scholars of conflict tradition. This study traces roots of notions of social <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> inclusion in the conflict tradition by examining original works of Marx and Dahrendorf. This paper shows contending and converging ideas of Marx and Dahrendorf on social <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> social inclusion. Finally, the paper rejuvenates the ideas of conflict tradition on the domain of social <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> inclusion...|$|R

40|$|Social {{exclusion}} {{attempts to}} {{make sense out of}} multiple deprivations and inequities experienced by people and areas, and the reinforcing effects of reduced participation, consumption, mobility, access, integration, influence and recognition. This book works from a multidisciplinary approach across health, welfare, and education, linking practice and research in order to improve our understanding of the processes that foster <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> how to prevent it. Theorising Social <b>Exclusion</b> first reviews <b>and</b> reflects upon existing thinking, literature and research into social <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> social connectedness, outlining an integrated theory of social exclusion across dimensions of social action and along pathways of social processes. A series of commissioned chapters then develop and illustrate the theory by addressing the machinery of social <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> connectedness, the pathways towards <b>exclusion</b> <b>and,</b> finally, experiences of <b>exclusion</b> <b>and</b> connection. This innovative book takes a truly multidisciplinary approach and focuses on the often-neglected cultural and social aspects of exclusion. It will be of interest to academics in fields of public health, health promotion, social work, community development, disability studies, occupational therapy, policy, sociology, politics, and environment [Book Synopsis...|$|R
