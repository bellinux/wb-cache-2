50|$|There {{are some}} common {{problems}} {{not related to}} <b>dysgraphia</b> but often associated with <b>dysgraphia,</b> {{the most common of}} which is stress. Often children (and adults) with <b>dysgraphia</b> will become extremely frustrated with the task of writing (and spelling); younger children may cry, pout, or refuse to complete written assignments. This frustration can cause the child (or adult) a great deal of stress and can lead to stress-related illnesses. This can be a result of any symptom of <b>dysgraphia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Dysgraphia</b> {{is a hard}} {{disorder}} {{to detect}} as it does not affect specific ages, gender, or intelligence. The main concern in trying to detect <b>dysgraphia</b> is that people hide their disability behind their verbal fluency because they are ashamed that they cannot achieve the same goals as their peers. Having <b>dysgraphia</b> {{is not related to}} a lack of cognitive ability, and it is not uncommon in intellectually gifted individuals, but due to <b>dysgraphia</b> their intellectual abilities are often not identified.|$|E
50|$|People with <b>dysgraphia</b> {{can often}} write {{on some level}} and may {{experience}} difficulty with other fine motor skills, such as tying shoes. However, <b>dysgraphia</b> does not affect all fine motor skills. People with <b>dysgraphia</b> often have unusual difficulty with handwriting and spelling which in turn can cause writing fatigue. They may lack basic grammar and spelling skills (for example, having difficulties with the letters p, q, b, and d), and often will write the wrong word when trying to formulate their thoughts on paper. The disorder generally emerges when the child is first introduced to writing. Adults, teenagers, and children alike are all subject to <b>dysgraphia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dysgraphia</b> {{is nearly}} always {{accompanied}} by other learning differences such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder, [...] {{and this can}} impact the type of <b>dysgraphia</b> a person might have. There are three principal subtypes of <b>dysgraphia</b> that are recognized. There is little information available about different types of <b>dysgraphia</b> and there are likely more subtypes than the ones listed below. Some children may have a combination {{of two or more}} of these, and individual symptoms may vary in presentation from what is described here. Most common presentation is a motor dysgraphia/agraphia resulting from damage to some part of the motor cortex in the parietal lobes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dysgraphia</b> is a biologically based {{disorder}} with {{genetic and}} brain bases. More specifically, it is a working memory problem. In <b>dysgraphia,</b> individuals fail to develop normal connections among different brain regions needed for writing. People with <b>dysgraphia</b> have difficulty in automatically remembering and mastering {{the sequence of}} motor movements required to write letters or numbers. <b>Dysgraphia</b> is also {{in part due to}} underlying problems in orthographic coding, the orthographic loop, and graphmotor output (the movements that result in writing) by one’s hands, fingers and executive functions involved in letter writing. The orthographic loop is when written words are stored in the mind’s eye, connected through sequential finger movement for motor output through the hand with feedback from the eye.|$|E

5000|$|Treatment for <b>dysgraphia</b> varies and {{may include}} {{treatment}} for motor disorders to help control writing movements. The use of occupational therapy {{can be effective}} in the school setting, and teachers should be well informed about <b>dysgraphia</b> to aid in carry-over of the occupational therapist's interventions. Treatments may address impaired memory or other neurological problems. Some physicians recommend that individuals with <b>dysgraphia</b> use computers to avoid the problems of handwriting. <b>Dysgraphia</b> can sometimes be partially overcome with appropriate and conscious effort and training. [...] The International Dyslexia Association suggests the use of kinesthetic memory through early training by having the child overlearn how to write letters and to later practice writing with their eyes closed or averted to reinforce {{the feel of the}} letters being written. They also suggest teaching the students cursive writing as it has fewer reversible letters and can help lessen spacing problems, at least within words, because cursive letters are generally attached within a word.|$|E

50|$|The {{symptoms}} to <b>dysgraphia</b> {{are often}} overlooked or {{attributed to the}} student being lazy, unmotivated, not caring, or having delayed visual-motor processing. In order to be diagnosed with <b>dysgraphia,</b> one must have a cluster, but not necessarily all, of the following symptoms:Dysgraphia may cause students emotional trauma often {{due to the fact}} that no one can read their writing, and they are aware that they are not performing to the same level as their peers. Emotional problems that may occur alongside <b>dysgraphia</b> include impaired self-esteem, lowered self-efficacy, heightened anxiety, and depression. They may put in extra efforts in order to have the same achievements as their peers, but often get frustrated because they feel that their hard work does not pay off.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dysgraphia</b> - A {{disorder}} which primarily expresses {{itself through}} difficulties with writing or typing, {{but in some}} cases through difficulties associated with eye-hand coordination and direction or sequence-oriented processes such as tying knots or carrying out repetitive tasks. In dyslexia, <b>dysgraphia</b> is often multifactorial, due to impaired letter-writing automaticity, organizational and elaborative difficulties, and impaired visual word forming which makes it more difficult to retrieve the visual picture of words required for spelling.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Dysgraphia</b> can be {{difficult}} to diagnose because the handwriting starts out clear and slowly degrades, making the writer appear lazy.|$|E
5000|$|The word <b>dysgraphia</b> {{comes from}} the Greek words dys meaning [...] "impaired" [...] and γραφία graphía meaning [...] "writing by hand".|$|E

50|$|<b>Dysgraphia</b> is a {{deficiency}} {{in the ability}} to write, primarily handwriting, but also coherence. <b>Dysgraphia</b> is a transcription disability, meaning that it is a writing disorder associated with impaired handwriting, orthographic coding (orthography, the storing process of written words and processing the letters in those words), and finger sequencing (the movement of muscles required to write). It often overlaps with other learning disabilities such as speech impairment, attention deficit disorder, or developmental coordination disorder. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), <b>dysgraphia</b> is characterized as a learning disability in the category of written expression when one’s writing skills are below those expected given a person’s age measured through intelligence and age-appropriate education. The DSM is not clear in whether or not writing refers only to the motor skills involved in writing, or if it also includes orthographic skills and spelling.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosing <b>dysgraphia</b> can be {{challenging}} but can be done at facilities specializing in learning disabilities. It is suggested that those who believe they may have <b>dysgraphia</b> seek a qualified clinician to be tested. Clinicians will have the client self-generate written sentences and paragraphs, and copy age-appropriate text. They will assess the output of writing, as well as observe the client's posture while writing, their grip on the writing instrument, and will ask the client to either tap their finger or turn their wrists repeatedly to assess fine motor skills.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} {{students}} with <b>dysgraphia</b> may increase from 4 percent of students in primary grades, due to the overall difficulty of handwriting, and up to 20 percent in middle school because written compositions become more complex. With this in mind, there are no exact numbers of how many individuals have <b>dysgraphia</b> due to its difficulty to diagnose. There are slight gender differences in association with written disabilities; overall {{it is found that}} males {{are more likely to be}} impaired with handwriting, composing, spelling, and orthographic abilities than females.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{cure for}} Gerstmann syndrome. Treatment is {{symptomatic}} and supportive. Occupational and speech therapies may help diminish the <b>dysgraphia</b> and apraxia. In addition, calculators and word processors may help school children cope with the symptoms of the disorder.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{no special}} {{education}} category {{for students with}} dysgraphia; in the United States, The National Center for Learning Disabilities suggests that children with <b>dysgraphia</b> be handled in a case-by-case manner with an Individualized Education Program, or provided individual accommodation to provide alternative ways of submitting work and modify tasks to avoid the area of weakness. [...] Students with <b>dysgraphia</b> often cannot complete written assignments that are legible, appropriate in length and content, or within given time. It is suggested that students with <b>dysgraphia</b> receive specialized instructions that are appropriate for them, this means that each set of instructions may be different for each child. Children will mostly benefit from explicit and comprehensive instructions, help translating across multiple levels of language, and review and revision of assignments or writing methods. Direct, explicit instruction on letter formation, and guided practice will help students achieve automatic handwriting performance before they use letters to write words, phrases, and sentences. Some older children may benefit {{from the use of}} a personal computer, or a laptop in class so {{that they do not have}} to deal with the frustration of falling behind their peers.|$|E
