5000|$|Despite being outmoded, {{strontium}} titanate {{is still}} manufactured and periodically encountered in jewellery. It {{is one of}} the most costly of diamond simulants, and due to its rarity collectors may pay a premium for large i.e. >2 carat (400 mg) specimens. As a diamond simulant, strontium titanate is most deceptive when mingled with melée i.e. <0.20 carat (40 mg) stones and when it is used as the base material for a composite or doublet stone (with, e.g., synthetic corundum as the crown or top of the stone). Under the microscope, gemmologists distinguish strontium titanate from diamond by the former's softness—manifested by surface abrasions—and excess dispersion (to the trained eye), and occasional gas bubbles which are remnants of synthesis.

40|$|AbstractFriction stir welding {{is solid}} state welding and {{involves}} heating the metal with a suitable {{amount of pressure}} so that homogeneous and complete microstructural welding is possible without melting of the parts to be joined. The process uses a rotating tool with a profiled pin that penetrates the parts to be joined; the tool then starts to travel along the <b>join</b> <b>line.</b> By keeping the tool rotating and moving it along the <b>join</b> <b>line</b> to be welded, the softened material due to the frictional heat is stirred and mixed together by the rotating pin forming a weld in solid state without melting. Frictional heat generated by rotation of the tool due to the high compressive pressure and shearing action of the shoulder along the joint line causes a softened zone of material without melting. Localized severe deformation around the tool results in refinement of the microstructure and the material flow produces coalescence and formation of a weld. FSW provides superior welding over conventional fusion welding and is preferred for joining of Al-Li alloys. The present work is to investigate was to study the effect of friction stir welding parameters on mechanical and microstructural properties of AA 2195 -T 0 and T 8. Since FSW is both a deformation and a thermal process, temperature distribution during FSW is measured. The microstructure and mechanical properties of welded joint were investigated for different friction stir welding conditions. This paper describes {{the results of an}} experimental study to investigate the mechanical and microstructure evolution of AA 2195 friction stir welded joint. The optimum welding condition is also provided for different heat treated AA 2195 alloys...|$|E
40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} joining process using a {{rotating}} cylindrical shoulder and threaded pin which is plunged into the work piece to traverse along the <b>join</b> <b>line.</b> Friction Stir Processing (FSP) is a comparatively new process derived from FSW, {{which can be used}} to refine and modify as-cast microstructures for superior properties. In the last decade, several researchers have attempted to evaluate the microstructure and properties inside the stir zone. However, it is important to explain the features occurring outside the stir zone, in particular during multipass FSP (MP-FSP). The aim of this proposed research is to explain the MP-FSP process parameters and their relations to mechanical properties of the processed material, and hence to explain the fracture behaviour of the MP-FSPed material. Experimentally, cast plates of A 356 (Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg) alloy were made. Initial set of experiments with a high tool rotation speed (ω rpm) was conducted to produce maximum stir zone area. However, on finding that this parameter was not suitable (as will be explained), lower ω range FSP experiments were conducted. First, single pass FSP experiments were carried out to understand the flow, particularly outside the stir zone followed by MP-FSP under varying process parameters. Tensile testing was conducted and factors/FS parameters relating to fracture strain, and thus the quality of MP-FSP stir zone were studied and fracture features were examined. It was found that the use of high ω values resulted in the less deformed cast material wedging up into the stir zone of the previous pass. This wedging resulted in low tensile fracture strain. Explanation of Si particle alignment due to wedging and subsequently causing low fracture strain will be given. It will be shown that reducing ω reduces the degree of wedging, as the downward stir flow reduces. However, low ω values are shown to have a detrimental effect, incapable of completely disrupting / healing of tunnel wall oxide films, thus resulting in low fracture strain. It will be shown that with the current FS condition, ω= 1000 rpm is the optimum value...|$|E
