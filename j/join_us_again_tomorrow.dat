60|$|Hollis looked smiling {{into the}} box. He had lately made a dash home through the Canal. He {{had been away}} six months, and only <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>again</b> {{just in time for}} this last trip. We had never seen the box before. His hands hovered above it; and he talked to us ironically, but his face became as grave as though he were pronouncing a {{powerful}} incantation over the things inside.|$|R
60|$|At the old boat-house he <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>again.</b> I {{will put}} down the {{conversation}} that ensued when we were all settled in our places exactly as it passed. It is an important conversation, so far as I am concerned, for it has seriously disposed me to distrust the influence which Count Fosco has exercised over my thoughts and feelings, and to resist it for the future as resolutely as I can.|$|R
60|$|At dinner she <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>again,</b> and {{was more}} easy and more herself with Sir Percival than I {{have seen her}} yet. In the evening {{she went to the}} piano, {{choosing}} new music of the dexterous, tuneless, florid kind. The lovely old melodies of Mozart, which poor Hartright was so fond of, she has never played since he left. The book is no longer in the music-stand. She took the volume away herself, so that nobody might find it out and ask her to play from it.|$|R
60|$|I bowed {{my head in}} silence. What I couldn’t {{understand}} was why he delayed so long in <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>again.</b> Unless he had {{had enough}} of his mother? I thought without any great resentment that I was being victimized; but then {{it occurred to me that}} the cause of his absence was quite simple. I was familiar enough with his habits by this time to know that he often managed to snatch an hour’s sleep or so during the day. He had gone and thrown himself on his bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{search the}} whole {{of the back of the}} island with boats, keeping at oar's length from the cliffs. There must be some places where a man can climb up, {{probably}} gulleys worn by streams. Then to-morrow night sail round and <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>again.</b> I will be waiting for you about two miles off the land, and will show a light to seaward so that you will know where to find me. Then we can talk matters over, and you can get back to the other side again before morning." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{this is the}} house; but it {{has grown}} a good deal since we settled down, and will grow more before you come to it for good. Then it was only meant for a {{superior}} sort of gamekeeper, and had only six rooms in it--parlour, kitchen, and back kitchen, and three bedrooms above them; but this we agreed would be ample for ourselves and Betsey, an old servant of our mother's, who could turn her hand to anything, and on the break-up of our home had begged to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>again</b> whenever or wherever {{we should have a}} house of our own once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we must {{let things}} {{go on as}} they are," [...] the colonel said, [...] "until we get to Chitral. Then we will have him up, {{and get to the}} bottom of the affair. If it turns out to be Bullen, he must at once leave the ranks and <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>again.</b> I shall then have to ask for a {{commission}} for him, and give him temporary rank as junior lieutenant, until an answer to my recommendation arrives. Even if it is not Bullen, it may be--unlikely as it seems--some other Englishman; but in any case, we could not allow an Englishman to be in the ranks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Personally I {{was doing}} {{everything}} that {{occurred to me}} at the moment. I stormed and scolded and coaxed in English and French and gamekeeper language; I made absurd, ineffectual cuts in the air with my thongless hunting-crop; I hurled my sandwich case at the brute; in fact, I really don't know what more I could have done. And still we lumbered on through the deepening dusk, with that dark uncouth shape lumbering ahead of us, and a drone of lugubrious music floating in our ears. Suddenly Esmé bounded aside into some thick bushes, where we could not follow; the wail rose to a shriek and then stopped altogether. This part of the story I always hurry over, because it is really rather horrible. When the beast <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>again,</b> after an absence of a few minutes, there was an air of patient understanding about him, as though he knew that he had done something of which we disapproved, but which he felt to be thoroughly justifiable.|$|R
5000|$|Top 2 {{contestant}} of Season 10's Idols South Africa, Bongiwe Silinda wowed {{the judges}} {{and the audience}} in the most dramatic Theatre Week when she performed the song in the Top 31. This was the last performance the Top 31 had to do before they were put through to the Top 16 live shows. Bongi had the judges raving about her stripped down version of the song with a climatic end,rather contradictory to the original version. After she auditioned twice in one season,judge of the show,Unathi Msengana had said this after she had finished her performance: [...] "I'm so glad you decided to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>again</b> in Pretoria to give yourself a second chance. Beyonce did the song for Gatsby....she'd bow down to you after this performance." [...] This saw Bongiwe alongside Vincent Bones,who performed Adorn by Miguel and Lize Mynhardt,who performed Love Story by Taylor Swift being dubbed the standout performers of {{the final round of}} theatre week,which also securely placed her in the Top 16 of the 10th historic season of Idols.|$|R
5000|$|After being {{transfer}} {{listed at}} the start of the 2011-12 season, Kovács joined former club Luton Town on an emergency one-month loan on 19 September 2011 during a period when the majority of the Luton defence had picked up injuries or suspensions. This loan was then extended until 1 January 2012. He was released by Hereford on 2 January 2012, signing permanently for Luton on a one-and-a-half-year contract. On Kovács signing a permanent contract Luton manager Gary Brabin said [...] "János has been a rock at the back for <b>us</b> since <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>again.</b> His performances have been fantastic and he has had an unbelievably positive effect on the team on and off the pitch." [...] He made 44 appearances and scored 4 goals over the season for Luton, and won the Player of the Year Award for his performances. Kovács was also named in the 2011-12 Conference Premier Team of the Year alongside Luton teammate Mark Tyler. Manager John Still confirmed Kovács would be released at the end of the 2012-13 season, in which the player made 30 appearances and scored three goals.|$|R
50|$|US 167 is {{predominantly}} a grade-level four-lane freeway through the Pineville area with exits {{that do not}} utilize a numbering scheme. Tight diamond interchanges connect with LA 1250 (Shamrock Street) to Downtown Pineville and LA 107 toward Marksville. LA 28 departs to the east toward Jonesville at the next exit. US 167 curves northwest on the Pineville Expressway through Kingsville and intersects US 165, the main route connecting Alexandria with Monroe. Shortly afterward, {{in the community of}} Tioga, <b>US</b> 167 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 71 <b>again</b> briefly until the latter splits off toward Shreveport. Just before crossing into Grant Parish, the freeway ends as US 167 intersects LA 3225 at Creola.|$|R
40|$|Thanks for <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>again</b> in this {{our latest}} issue (V/ 1) of Journal of Social Studies Education Research (JSSER). Our journal has turned 5 {{years old with}} this issue. We are {{extremely}} delighted and proud to see the seeds we planted {{in the autumn of}} 2010 take root and grow. Social studies as a system of scientific research, and an academic career, is relatively new to Turkey, so achieving this success here means even more compared to in other countries with more deeply rooted traditions and a greater accumulation of knowledge in this area. Therefore I am grateful to everyone who contributed to achieving this success over the last four years. JSSER {{is a member of the}} Association for Social Studies Educators (ASSE). From ASSE’s perspective JSSER‘s role is to provide a basis for social studies academicians to fulfill their national and wider responsibilities and mission by contributing to the advancement of the social science research and to the sharing of research results. The second contribution of the JSSER in this area was to set up and institutionalize an International Symposium on Social Studies Education. Last month we held the third such symposium. Every year we bring together hundreds of native and foreign scientists, teachers and students in these symposiums, which have gained the status of a scientific banquet. Among our medium term targets is the advancement of these two activities in quality and quantity...|$|R

We were torn asunder, she to pine and die within the twelvemonth, I to toil life's long journey sad and alone, praying daily, hourly, for that release which shall <b>join</b> <b>us</b> {{together}} <b>again</b> in that dear realm where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. Now, sir, if you will be so kind as {{to look at these}} maps and plans in my portfolio, I am sure I can sell you an echo for less money than any man in the trade.

50|$|At {{the very}} {{complicated}} junction of US 36, I-25, I-76, and I-270, US 36 emerges overlapped and unsigned with I-270, and continues overlapped and unsigned with I-70 when I-270 ends near the former Stapleton Airport site. At Colfax Avenue, this I-70/US 36 overlap is also <b>joined</b> by <b>US</b> 287 (<b>again)</b> and <b>US</b> 40. From the interchange with Colfax Avenue, the road continues to Watkins {{and then to}} Byers, unsigned in its four-way overlap with I-70, US 40, and US 287. The former route through Bennett, Strasburg, and Byers is signed separately as State Highway 36.|$|R
6000|$|... “The wife?”—Mr. Morrow was for {{a moment}} as {{confused}} as myself. But when I explained that I alluded to Dora Forbes in person he informed me, with visible amusement at my being so out of it, that this was the “pen-name” of an indubitable male—he had a big red moustache. “He goes in for the slight mystification because the ladies are such popular favourites. A great deal of interest is felt in his acting on that idea—which is clever, isn’t it?—and there’s every prospect of its being widely imitated.” Our host at this moment <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>again,</b> and Mr. Morrow remarked invitingly that he should be happy to make a note of any observation the movement in question, the bid for success under a lady’s name, might suggest to Mr. Paraday. But the poor man, without catching the allusion, excused himself, pleading that, though greatly honoured by his visitor’s interest, he suddenly felt unwell and should have to take leave of him—have to go and lie down and keep quiet. His young friend might be trusted to answer for him, but he hoped Mr. Morrow didn’t expect great things even of his young friend. His young friend, at this moment, looked at Neil Paraday with an anxious eye, greatly wondering if he were doomed to be ill again; but Paraday’s own kind face met his question reassuringly, seemed to say in a glance intelligible enough: “Oh I’m not ill, but I’m scared: {{get him out of the}} house as quietly as possible.” Getting newspaper-men out of the house was odd business for an emissary of Mr. Pinhorn, and I was so exhilarated by the idea of it that I called after him as he left us: “Read the article in The Empire and you’ll soon be all right!” ...|$|R
