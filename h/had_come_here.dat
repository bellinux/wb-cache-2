Angered with the outcome of the vote, he announced that his party would withdraw from the Soviet and Baku itself: [...] "With pain in our hearts and curses on our lips, we who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to die for the Soviet regime are forced to leave." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{came last}} night and called this {{afternoon}} at your hotel. They told me you <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> and I looked about for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> for," [...] she said. [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to ask questions. Spare yourself, and spare me. I warn you {{beforehand}} that I will not answer any questions relating to my son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no joke," [...] I answered. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> {{to take up}} {{the inquiry}} which was dropped when I left England. I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to do what nobody has done yet--to find out who took the Diamond." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Letitia," [...] he said, [...] "let me explain. I {{shall never}} {{ask for your}} forgiveness. I shall never venture to {{approach}} you again. I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> by the secret passage from Vont's cottage. I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to keep an oath which I swore in America to Richard Vont, and I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> because, if I had broken my word, he would have killed himself." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Lady Ker {{and the old}} nurse {{could not}} make {{too much of the}} pretty English child that <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> in such a {{wonderful}} way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I'd known Dan Fernald <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here.</b> It {{was in the}} {{agreement}} he should keep away, an' I'd 'a' pounded him if I'd caught him sneakin' 'round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just so;--and {{he told me}} that he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> simply {{with the}} object of saying so. It was more candid than civil, but we must take it as we get it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] Mr. Jacks said, [...] "I <b>have</b> not <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to gratify any {{personal}} curiosity. I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> {{in the cause}} of justice. You should find me a welcome visitor, for both these men who have lost their lives were friends of yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to {{ascertain}} whether any of those, who were present at the attack upon the party who landed from the steamer over there, are still living here. There is no question of punishment. On the contrary, I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to obtain information as to some private matters, and anyone who can give me that information will be well rewarded." ...|$|R

60|$|The old stiff-necked haughtiness of {{her race}} did not desert {{her for a}} moment, {{even though she was}} {{obviously}} at a disadvantage in this instance, and <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> as a suppliant.|$|E
6000|$|... "When he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> all the {{way from}} South Africa on purpose to see me, as he said, of course he would know. Why should there be any pretence on my part?" ...|$|E
60|$|My {{consolation}} lies {{in knowing}} {{what sort of}} dinner {{you would have had}} if you <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> and in looking forward to claiming the fulfilment of your kind promise when we are again at home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your name is, I believe--Brady--Jim Brady--correct me if I am wrong-- and you <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> you--you--young--villain--to steal my birds." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, I {{know you}} have--for five minutes. It {{was only an}} excuse. You {{might just as well}} <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> straight.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll come, after a bit, and see you. Quit foolin' now. If you'd only <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> like yourself--like--like--a white man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{called in}} at the mont-de-piete but you had gone. Gandinot told me you <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here.</b> What an ugly fellow that Gandinot is! But a good sort. I like him. I had a chat with him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never! She has a {{way with}} her just as though she didn't care for silk purses. And it's my mind, sir, that she don't. She wishes, however, to be uppermost, and if she <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> she'd have said so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! dear, no, ma'am, I rather {{think that}} if he knew I <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> he would not await my return, for the young gentleman does not seem quite willing to come home. Indeed he is not quite fit; excuse me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> {{to refresh}} myself," [...] {{she said to}} Mackinnon one evening--to Mackinnon and myself; for we were {{standing}} together.|$|R
25|$|You <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> {{and paid}} twenty-five cents {{to see a}} fool; I receive seventy-five dollars, and see a whole houseful of fools.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, yes," [...] {{answered}} the Professor, with blinking eyes, and still completely bewildered. [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here.</b> Just so. Just so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Going {{to spend}} the evening on shore," [...] the captain observed. [...] "I am not {{surprised}} at that. It is likely enough they have been six months on their voyage from Lima. It is unlucky, though; I wish he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
60|$|So I {{told him}} everything, {{although}} {{until that moment}} I had not {{made up my mind}} to go upon this journey, I who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to his kraal by accident, or so it seemed, and by accident had delivered to him a certain message.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may rely on my {{guidance}} and protection, noble lady," [...] answered her host, [...] "though you <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> at midnight, {{and with the}} rogue's head in your apron, like Judith in the Holy Apocrypha, which I joy to hear once more read in churches." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nada: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to chew {{bubble gum}} and kick ass, and I'm {{all out of}} bubble gum." [...] - Nominated ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> Mrs. Glenarm--by Mr. Delamayn's permission--to ask {{leave to}} speak to you on a matter in which you are interested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{his usual}} kindness. He takes your views of things. He laughed {{when he heard}} I had {{sent a letter to}} you, and he ran off (dear fellow!) to see you on my behalf. You must have met him, if you <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> by the village." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{medical officer}} was giving his {{testimony}} {{at great length}} as {{to the cause of}} death. Technical terms were used in plenty, and puzzled the elegant ladies who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to be amused. The jury listened attentively, and the coroner--himself a medical man--asked several very pertinent questions: ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{world of}} meaning in the phrase. Charteris {{felt that he was}} in the same case. They had not let him.

6000|$|... 'But we {{have now}} {{found out that he}} has behaved very badly. He <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to you,--with unexampled treachery to your cousin Roger--' ...|$|R
