5000|$|<b>Hemivertebrae</b> are {{wedge-shaped}} vertebrae {{and therefore}} can cause an angle in the spine (such as kyphosis, scoliosis, and lordosis). Among the congenital vertebral anomalies, <b>hemivertebrae</b> {{are the most likely}} to cause neurologic problems. The most common location is the midthoracic vertebrae, especially the eighth (T8). [...] Neurologic signs result from severe angulation of the spine, narrowing of the spinal canal, instability of the spine, and luxation or fracture of the vertebrae.

Lumbosacral <b>hemivertebrae</b> resection {{by a combined}} posterior and anterior approach have been previously described, but only one study is concerning such a large series of <b>hemivertebrae.</b> Methods. From 1980 to 2001, a consecutive series of 17 congenital scolioses due to lumbosacral <b>hemivertebrae</b> were managed by <b>hemivertebrae</b> resection using a combined approach and short anterior and posterior convex fusion. Results. The mean age at surgery was 4. 9 years. The mean follow-up period was 7. 6 years. One postoperative complication was encountered: a patient had motor deficit and recovery was incomplete. The mean segmental scoliosis curve was 27. 5 before surgery, 10. 7 after surgery, and 8. 9 at the latest follow-up assessment. This represents a mean improvement of 61. 1 % after surgery and of 67. 6 % at the latest follow-up.

40|$|<b>Hemivertebra</b> is a {{congenital}} malformation, {{that affects}} small and brachicephalic breeds particularly those with short and twisted tail. Its origin is hereditary. It becomes from an inappropriate or incomplete embryo {{development of a}} vertebrae or due to its vascularization or ossification. Hemivertebras are cuneiform vertebrae and its vertex may be lead dorsally, ventrally or medianly through the mean line. It happens mostly in thoracic vertebras. Symptomatology is varied; {{the most important is}} pain, showed by young animals, three or four months of age with weakness of posterior limbs. It could be found pain at back when palpations near the <b>hemivertebra.</b> In puppies with those symptoms, the paralysis in posterior limbs gets worse; they can show muscular atrophy, and no control of bladder and intestines. Final diagnostic of <b>hemivertebra</b> must be done with radiological studies of spinal column and the treatment consists in decompress the vertebral body involved and a stabilization of the spinal column.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} surgical treatment in patients with unlocked full-segmented <b>hemivertebra</b> treated by excision. Twenty-six patients {{with a mean age}} of 12. 4 ± 1. 7  years were included in the study. The mean duration of follow-up was 47. 8 ± 21. 9  months. Diagnosis of type-IA <b>hemivertebra</b> was established by clinical, radiological, CT, and MRI evaluation. Preoperatively, patients were randomly allocated into two groups. In the first group, patients underwent anterior hemivertebrectomy initially; this was followed by posterior excision of the <b>hemivertebra,</b> posterior instrumentation, and fusion. In the second group, posterior components of the <b>hemivertebra</b> were excised at first, then the <b>hemivertebra</b> body was excised anteriorly, and this was followed by anterior instrumentation and fusion. For both groups, compression was applied to the convex side while distraction was applied to the concave side. Frontal and sagittal plane analysis of radiograms obtained preoperatively, postoperatively, and after a minimum period of 2  years was performed. The balance was analyzed clinically and radiologically by the measurement of the lateral trunk shift (LT) and shift of head (SH). The mean preoperative and postoperative Cobb angles were 45. 5 °∓ 11. 4 ° and 16. 8 °∓ 7. 9 °, respectively, and postoperatively, a mean correction rate of 64. 4 ± 13. 9 % was obtained (P= 0. 00). The mean correction rate was 61. 2 ± 13. 3 % (19. 2 °∓ 7. 6 °) for the last follow-up visit. Sagittal plane analysis demonstrated either conservation of physiological sagittal contours or a normalizing effect following excision of <b>hemivertebra</b> combined with anterior or posterior instrumentation. When postoperative balance values were compared, a statistically significant correction was found in terms of LT and SH values. Although none of the patients had complete balance (SH: 0  mm) or balanced curves (0  mm<SH< 15  mm) preoperatively, 20 (76. 9 %) of the patients had a balanced trunk after surgical intervention. Circumferential fusion could be achieved in all cases. No neurological complication developed, the only complication was delayed wound healing. In view of these data, it is concluded that these techniques can be safely used for this patient group at low thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbar levels of vertebral column with high correction rates...|$|E
30|$|Congenital {{vertebral}} deformities can {{be classified}} as defects of segmentation or defects of formation; however, a mixture of both is most common [2]. Defects of formation include hemivertebrae, anteriorly wedged, and butterfly vertebrae, while defects of segmentation include unsegmented bars and block vertebrae [2, 3, 4]. This morphologic classification has prognostic value in that spinal column deformity associated with unilateral segmentation defects (bars), contiguous ipsilateral <b>hemivertebra,</b> or bars opposite <b>hemivertebra</b> {{are more likely to}} progress. Additionally, congenital deformities {{can be classified}} by location (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacrococcygeal) or curve pattern (scoliosis, kyphosis, lordoscoliosis) [2]. However, the three dimensional nature of spinal deformity makes the distinction between scoliosis and kyphosis arbitrary and often both sagittal and coronal deformity exists [1, 2].|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} several reports on <b>hemivertebra</b> {{resection}} via a posterior-only procedure. However, the number of reported cases is small, and various types of instrumentation have been used. In our study, we retrospectively investigated 56 consecutive cases of congenital scoliosis that were treated by posterior <b>hemivertebra</b> resection with transpedicular instrumentation. Radiographs were reviewed to determine the type and location of the <b>hemivertebra,</b> the coronal curve magnitude and the sagittal alignment pre-operatively, post-operatively and at the latest follow-up. Radiographs were also used to assess implant failure and inter-body fusion. Surgical reports and patient charts were reviewed to record any peri-operative complications. Fifty-eight posterior hemivertebrae resections from 56 patients aged 1. 5 - 17 years with fully segmented non-incarcerated <b>hemivertebra</b> were evaluated. The average age at surgery was 9. 9 years (1. 5 - 17 years). The average follow-up was 32. 9 months (24 - 58 months). The mean fusion level was 5. 0 segments (2 - 11 segments). There was a mean improvement of 72. 9 % in the segmental scoliosis, from 42. 4 ° before surgery to 12. 3 ° {{at the time of}} the latest follow-up, and there was a mean improvement of 70 % in segmental kyphosis from 42. 0 ° to 14. 5 ° over the same time period. The thoracic kyphosis (T 5 -T 12) averaged 10. 8 ° before surgery and 23. 9 ° at the latest follow-up. The lumbar lordosis (L 1 -S 1) averaged - 52. 8 ° before surgery and - 51. 6 ° at the latest follow-up. Two cases with neurological claudications had complete recovery immediately after the surgery. There was one case of delayed wound healing, two fractures of the pedicle at the instrumented level, two rod breakages and one proximal junction kyphosis that required revision. There were no neurological complications. Radiolucent gaps were found in the residual space after resection on the lateral view in five cases, without any sign of implant failure or correction loss. Our results show that one-stage posterior <b>hemivertebra</b> resection with transpedicular instrumentation can achieve excellent correction, 360 ° decompression and short fusion without neurological complications. Pedicle cutting still remains a challenge in younger children when using bisegmental instrumentation. In addition, the radiolucent gaps in the residual space require further investigation. © The Author(s) 2011. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The aim of this retrospective {{study was to determine}} whether a radiographic classification scheme developed for use in humans would be feasible for use in these dog breeds. Inclusion criteria were hospital admission between September 2009 and April 2013, neurologic examination findings available, diagnostic quality lateral and ventro-dorsal digital radiographs of the thoracic vertebral column, and at least one congenital vertebral malformation. Radiographs were retrieved and interpreted by two observers who were unaware of neurologic status. Vertebral malformations were classified based on a classification scheme modified from a previous human study and a consensus of both observers. Twenty-eight dogs met inclusion criteria (12 with neurologic deficits, 16 with no neurologic deficits). Congenital vertebral malformations affected 85 / 362 (23. 5 %) of thoracic vertebrae. Vertebral body formation defects were the most common (butterfly vertebrae 6. 6 %, ventral wedge-shaped vertebrae 5. 5 %, dorsal <b>hemivertebrae</b> 0. 8 %, and dorso-lateral <b>hemivertebrae</b> 0. 5 %). No lateral <b>hemivertebrae</b> or lateral wedge-shaped vertebrae were identified.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that certain {{congenital}} spinal deformities occur in conjunction with congenital anorectal malformations. Congenital scoliosis (curving of the spine to the side) and kyphosis (excessive hunching of the spine) represent the most challenging subsets of all types of spinal deformity treated by pediatric spine specialists. The exact incidence of such spinal problems is not really known, but rates may be around 3 to 4 per 10, 000 newborn babies. Up to 75 % of these spinal deformities can be progressive in nature, so proper evaluation and check-ups are necessary. When the predominant deformity is scoliosis, the classification created by Robert Winter is most commonly applied in order to segregate deformities into failures of formation (e. g. <b>hemivertebra)</b> or failures of segmentation (e. g. congenital bar).
