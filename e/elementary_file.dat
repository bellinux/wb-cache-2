50|$|The CSIM {{application}} {{contains a}} file {{system with a}} number of parameters needed to operate on cdmaOne/CDMA2000 ("CDMA") networks. Each parameter, or a group of related parameters, is specified with a unique identifier with an implicit or explicit length, and is considered a separate <b>Elementary</b> <b>File</b> (EF). The following examples are taken from the 3GPP2 specification.|$|E
50|$|The SF_EUIMID has {{the unique}} ability to {{override}} the phone’s own MEID in signaling. This is controlled by a flag inside the R-UIM stored in bit 2 of the UsgInd (Usage Indicator) <b>elementary</b> <b>file</b> (EF). This may {{make it easier to}} provision a R-UIM that is manufactured without other unique identifiers (such as MIN or IMSI). The tradeoff is that the phone hardware cannot be easily identified. This tradeoff was removed in 2008 by the ability to specify MEID or EUIMID in OTASP signaling and in 2009 by the addition of these options to the CDMA air interface StatusRequest message. The term MEID_ME is used to distinguish the hardware identity of the phone from the MEID protocol element that may be the EUIMID.|$|E
50|$|The MTPAS access class may be {{indicated}} on the SIM card or in protected storage on the handset itself, {{by a set}} of numbers in the range 0 - 15 giving a total of 16 flag bits in the Access Control Class <b>Elementary</b> <b>File</b> (EFACC) in a USIM. It is not hierarchical so it can allow level 1 access while disallowing level 6 access. If the 16-bit control word is, 1010-0000-0011-1111 only phones with the MTPAS access level of 1, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 & 16 will accept requests for placing a call. The cell broadcasts the Access Control Classes it allows (or bars) in a System Information Block (SIB) message. It {{is important to note that}} the decision whether to permit a call is not made by the cellular network but by the handset itself.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} bank {{includes a}} variety of analysis tools to extract the audio and video descriptors. Each of these tools produce an <b>elementary</b> xml <b>file</b> that describes {{the contents of the}} audio or and video sources with a single descriptor type. Some of these tools are applied directly to the segmented video or audio streams while others will only process a set of selected key-frames of the video sequence. In the latter case, the analysis tools are used at the output of a key-frame detector that selects a few frames (in most cases a single frame) that represent the shot. An example of a particular analysis tool is the person’s detector.|$|R

Baseada na Gramática Sistêmico-Funcional (Halliday, 1994), a Gramática Visual busca sistematizar o processo de leitura de imagens de um ponto de vista teórico-prático. A partir de sua aplicabilidade, é objetivo deste trabalho trazer à visibilidade elementos socioculturais próprios das culturas produzidas pelos autores de livros didáticos de línguas estrangeiras através dos elementos constitutivos da imagem bem como da imagem enquanto elemento na construção de sentidos. This work {{consists of}} an investigation on images belonging to the German coursebook Themen aktuell 1 and the English New English <b>File</b> <b>Elementary</b> {{from the perspective of}} the Visual Grammar by the theoreticians Günther Kress e Theo van Leeuwen (2006). Based on Michael Halliday s Systemic Functional Linguistics (1994), the Visual Grammar aims at systematising the image-reading process from a theoretical as well as practical point of view. Through its applicable feature, this work aims at increasing visibility of particular sociocultural elements produced by the authors of foreign language coursebooks. In order to achieve this goal, it will take into consideration the constitutive elements of images as well as the property of images in construing meanings...|$|R

Thus, this study aims to find out how social gender identity is constructed in the reading passages in two sets of coursebooks, Face 2 Face and English <b>File,</b> <b>elementary,</b> pre-intermediate, intermediate and upper-intermediate. To collect the data, the reading texts in these coursebooks were scanned and the adjectives used to describe both genders were identified and categorized to determine what kind of characteristics have been attributed to male and female and how their social identities have been constructed...|$|R

That was the official start of PCS ministry in the municipality of Panabo.The following year, an application to operate complete <b>elementary</b> was <b>filed</b> and Government Recognition was released soon after. With DECS Recognition No. 019, s. 1989, PCS {{was grateful to}} have as its pioneer elementary graduates 14 members and kindergarten graduates 40 members. They were officially confirmed by a DECS representative on March 19, 1989. With the inspiration coming from the parents themselves, Permit to operate the complete Secondary curriculum was applied for and Government Permit No.006, s. 1991 dated April 1991 was released. On the initial year of such operation, there were 2 sections in the First Year and one section each for the second, third and fourth years. School Year 1993-1994 was {{the third year of}} operation of the High School Department, which was administered by Mrs. MaryHelen R. Ortiz.
