5|$|Although he {{was once}} again {{expected}} to be Italy's star player in the number 10 role, Totti acquired a measure of infamy at Euro 2004 after <b>he</b> <b>spat</b> at Danish midfielder Christian Poulsen in a goalless draw in Italy's opening group match of the tournament on 14 June 2004.

5|$|Barkley {{was popular}} with the fans and media and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league. He was {{frequently}} involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when <b>he</b> <b>spat</b> on a young girl while attempting to spit at a heckler, and as in 1993 when he declared that sports figures {{should not be considered}} role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness {{to become one of the}} NBA's most dominant rebounders. He was a versatile player who had the ability to score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists.|$|E
5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that <b>he</b> <b>spat</b> on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E

After the season had concluded, Lajoie was officially named manager. He still managed to lead the majors with a [...]376 batting average as he recorded his second consecutive league batting title. He also led the majors in hits (208), doubles (49), RBIs (102) and slugging percentage (.546). Lajoie forbade card playing and gambling from his players during the regular season.

In fact, according to Cade, when Gators lineman Larry Gagner first tried it, <b>he</b> <b>spat</b> it out and strongly suggested that the original experimental formula tasted more like bodily waste. Dana Shires remembered that [...] "it sort of tasted like toilet bowl cleaner." [...] To make it more palatable, at the suggestion of Cade's wife, the researchers added lemon juice and cyclamate to the original formula of water, salt, sodium citrate, fructose and monopotassium phosphate.|$|E
500|$|Because of her tour of North Vietnam {{during wartime}} and the {{subsequent}} rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists.

500|$|Early in the tour, Vicious {{wandered off}} from his Holiday Inn in Memphis, Tennessee, looking for drugs.

500|$|In July 1977, on {{the final}} date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium, {{a small group of}} noisy and excited fans near the stage irritated Waters {{to such an extent that}} <b>he</b> <b>spat</b> at one of them. [...] He was not the only band member to feel disaffected at the show: guitarist David Gilmour refused to perform the band's usual encores ("Money" [...] and [...] "Us and Them"), leaving the band, with backup guitarist Snowy White, to improvise a slow, sad twelve-bar blues, which Waters {{described}} as [...] "some music to go home to". [...] Later that night, returning from hospital after an injury sustained to his foot while play-fighting backstage with manager Steve O'Rourke, Waters spoke with music producer Bob Ezrin, and a friend of Ezrin's, a psychiatrist sharing their car, about the feelings of alienation he was experiencing on the tour. He articulated his desire to isolate himself by constructing a wall across the stage between the performers and the audience. He later said, [...] "I loathed playing in stadiums ... I kept saying to people on that tour, 'I'm not really enjoying this ... there is something very wrong with this.'" [...] While Gilmour and Wright were in France recording solo albums, and Nick Mason was busy producing Steve Hillage's Green, Waters began to write new material. The spitting incident became the starting point for a new concept, which explored the protagonist's self-imposed isolation after years of traumatic interactions with authority figures and the loss of his father as a young child. To execute The Wall concept was to attempt to analyse the performer's psychological separation from the audience, using a physical structure as a metaphorical and theatrical device.|$|E
500|$|The band {{were joined}} by {{familiar}} figures such as Dick Parry and Snowy White, but relations within the band became fraught. [...] Waters took to arriving at the venues alone, departing as soon as each performance was over. [...] On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band. [...] The size of the venues was also an issue; in Chicago, the promoters claimed to have sold out the 67,000 person regular capacity of the Soldier Field stadium (after which ticket sales should have been ended), but Waters and O'Rourke were suspicious. [...] They hired a helicopter, photographer and attorney, and discovered that the actual attendance was 95,000; a shortfall to the band of $640,000. [...] The end of the tour was a low point for Gilmour, who {{felt that they had}} by now achieved the success they originally sought, and that there was nothing else they could look forward to. [...] In July 1977 – on the final date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium – a small group of noisy and excited fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters {{to such an extent that}} <b>he</b> <b>spat</b> at one of them. [...] He was not the only person who felt depressed about playing to such large audiences, as Gilmour refused to perform a third encore. [...] Waters later spoke with producer Bob Ezrin and told him of his sense of alienation on the tour, and how he sometimes felt like building a wall to separate himself from the audience. [...] The spitting incident would later form the basis of a new concept, which would eventually become one of the band's most successful album releases, The Wall.|$|E

500|$|Jardine's first {{experience}} against Australia {{came when he}} scored an unbeaten 96 to secure a draw against the 1921 Australian touring side for Oxford University. The tourists were criticised in the press for not allowing Jardine to reach his hundred, but had tried {{to help him with}} some easy bowling. There has been speculation that this incident helped develop Jardine's antipathy towards Australians, although Jardine's biographer Christopher Douglas denies this. Jardine's attitude towards Australia hardened after he toured the country in 1928–29. When he scored three consecutive hundreds in the early games, he was frequently jeered by the crowd for slow play; the Australian spectators took an increasing dislike to him, mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of headwear—a Harlequin cap that was given to successful Oxford cricketers. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators; his general demeanour drew one comment of [...] "Where's the butler to carry the bat for you?" [...] By this stage Jardine had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century {{at the start of the}} tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to Hunter Hendry that [...] "All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob". After the innings, when teammate Patsy Hendren remarked that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied [...] "It's fucking mutual". During the tour, Jardine fielded next to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked for his awkward fielding, particularly when chasing the ball. On one occasion, <b>he</b> <b>spat</b> towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time.|$|E
500|$|By {{spring of}} 1997, the real-life {{backstage}} conflict between Michaels and Hart were reaching its heights. Both men {{were going out}} on television and frequently making personal, true to heart remarks about one another. Michaels briefly left the WWF in June of that year after a real backstage fight with Hart, just hours before a Raw Is War show, which allegedly resulted from Michaels making an on-air remark, known as the [...] "Sunny Days" [...] comment, implying that Hart (who was married at the time) {{was having an affair}} with Tammy Sytch, a Diva who was signed to the WWF as Sunny. Michaels and Austin were still WWF Tag Team Champions at the time during an ongoing feud with the Hart Foundation and a tournament was made to decide new tag team champions. Michaels would eventually return that summer in July. At SummerSlam, Michaels officiated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between WWF Champion The Undertaker and Bret Hart. The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels hitting Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Hart after <b>he</b> <b>spat</b> in his face). Michaels was then forced to award the championship to his nemesis, Bret Hart. The next night on Raw Is War, signs of a heel turn started to show as Michaels told the WWF fans what happened at SummerSlam was an accident and that he would deal with the Undertaker when the time came. At WWF One Night Only, held in Birmingham, England in September, Michaels defeated The British Bulldog to capture the European Championship. The fans at the event were so appalled at the result of the match they booed Michaels out of the building to the extent that they littered the ring with garbage, cementing his second heel turn. With this win, Michaels became the first Grand Slam Champion. At , Michaels and Undertaker participated in the first Hell in a Cell match, during which Michaels fall off the side of the [...] high structure through a table and saw him as the winner in the match after the debuting Kane tombstoned his victory bound half-brother, The Undertaker. The match received a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer.|$|E
500|$|Jardine was {{the centre}} of {{attention}} {{at the start of}} the tour. He began the tour with three consecutive hundreds and was seen as one of the main English threats. In his first hundred, the crowd engaged in some good-natured joking at Jardine's expense, but he was jeered by the crowd in his second hundred for batting too slowly. His third hundred was described by Bradman as one of the finest exhibitions of strokeplay that he had seen; Jardine accelerated after another slow start, during which he was again barracked, to play some excellent shots. The crowds took an increasing dislike to him, partially for his success with the bat, but mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of headwear. His first public action in South Australia was to take out the members of the South Australian team who had been to Oxford or Cambridge Universities. Then, he wore a Harlequin cap, given to people who played good cricket at Oxford. It was not unusual for Oxford and Cambridge cricketers to wear similar caps while batting, as both Jardine and M.C.C. captain Percy Chapman did so on this tour, although it was slightly unorthodox to wear them while fielding. However, this was neither understood nor acceptable to the Australian crowds. They quickly took exception to the importance he seemed to place on class distinction. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators, with his general demeanour drawing one comment of [...] "Where's the butler to carry the bat for you?" [...] Jardine's cap became a focus for criticism and mockery from the crowds throughout the tour. Nevertheless, Jack Fingleton later claimed that Jardine could still have brought the crowds onto his side by exchanging jokes or pleasantries with them. It is certain that Jardine by this stage had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century {{at the start of the}} tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to a sympathetic Hunter Hendry that [...] "All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob". After the innings, when Patsy Hendren said that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied [...] "It's fucking mutual". Due to the large number of good close fielders in the side, Jardine did not field in the slips, his usual position for Surrey, but next to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked, particularly when chasing the ball: he was not a good fielder on the boundary. In one of the Test matches, <b>he</b> <b>spat</b> towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time.|$|E
