"Cacahuazintle" [...] or [...] "cacahuacintle" [...] (Náhuatl [...] "cacahuacentli" [...] 'pineapple-cocoa cob/cacao-like corn', from [...] "cacahuatl" [...] 'cacao' and [...] "centli" [...] or [...] "cintli" [...] 'corn on the cob') is {{the name}} of an old {{heirloom}} variety of white dent maize (corn) originating in Mexico. It has a large ear with grains that are more white, round, and tender than the typical field corn grain. The dried grains are soaked and/or cooked in water with lime or wood ash, then rinsed thoroughly to remove the outer seed coat as well as any traces of the alkali salts (from the lime or ash)—this is an ancient process called nixtamalization. This creates a fresh, wet hominy, which can be dried for later use or ground into a flour called masa to make tortillas, tamales, atole, pozole, etc... (the dry hominy can also be ground to make dry masa). When boiling the grains, they open by themselves like a flower, and a loose foam appears. The primary use of cacahuazintle grain is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> of the traditional Mexican dish pozole. The Náhuatl name pozole, pozolli, means sparkling, probably from the foam produced when cooking this type of corn.|$|E
5000|$|Cognitive science today gets {{increasingly}} interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> {{of human}} perception, thinking, and action. Abstract information processing models {{are no longer}} accepted as satisfactory accounts of the human mind. Interest has shifted to interactions between the material human body and its surroundings and {{to the way in}} which such interactions shape the mind. Proponents of this approach have expressed the hope that it will ultimately dissolve the Cartesian divide between the immaterial mind and the material existence of human beings (Damasio, 1994; Gallagher, 2005). A topic that seems particularly promising for providing a bridge across the mind-body cleavage is the study of bodily actions, which are neither reflexive reactions to external stimuli nor indications of mental states, which have only arbitrary relationships to the motor features of the action (e.g., pressing a button for making a choice response). The shape, timing, and effects of such actions are inseparable from their meaning. One might say that they are loaded with mental content, which cannot be appreciated other than by studying their material features. Imitation, communicative gesturing, and tool use are examples of these kinds of actions. Georg Goldenberg ...|$|E

40|$|Water {{and soap}} remove more than {{physical}} dirt―they attenuate guilt from one’s moral transgressions (Zhong & Liljenquist, 2006) and soften one’s judgment of others ’ misdeeds (Schnall, Benton, & Harvey, 2008).

Such findings indicate that abstract thought about morality is grounded in concrete experiences of physical cleanliness (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999).

40|$|Insects and ‘the swarm’ as {{metaphors and}} objects of {{research}} have inspired {{works in the}} genres of science fiction and horror; social and political theorists; {{and the development of}} war-fighting technologies such as ‘drone swarms’, which function as robot/insect hybrids. Contemporary developments suggest that the future of warfare will not be ‘robots’ as technological, individualised substitutions for idealised (masculine) warfighters, but warfighters understood as swarms: insect metaphors for non-centrally organised problem-solvers that will become technologies of racialisation. As such, contemporary feminist analysis requires an analysis of the politics of life and death in the insect and the swarm, which, following Braidotti (2002), cannot be assumed to be a mere metaphor or representation of political life, but an animating materialist logic. The swarm is not only a metaphor but also a central mode of biopolitical and necropolitical war, with the ‘terrorist’ enemy represented as swarm-like as well. In analysing the relations of assemblage and antagonism in the war ontologies of the drone swarm, I seek inspiration from what Hayles (1999, p. 47) describes as a double vision that ‘looks simultaneously at the power of simulation and at the materialities that produce it’. I discuss various representations and manifestations of swarms and insect life in science/speculative fiction, from various presentations of the ‘Borg’ in Star Trek (1987 – 1994, 1995 – 2001, 1996), Alien (1979) and The Fly (1958, 1986) to more positive representations of the ‘becoming-insect’ as possible feminist utopia in Gilman’s Herland (2015 [1915]) and Tiptree’s Houston, Houston, Do You Read? (1989 [1976]). Posthuman warfare also contains the possibilities of both appropriating and rewriting antagonisms of masculine and feminine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> of the subject of war in the swarm. This piece seeks to analyse new ways of feminist theorising of the relations of power and violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>embodiment</b> of war as the swarm...|$|E
