5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} venography {{employs the}} same principles, but uses MRI as a scanning modality. MRI <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being better at detecting {{damage to the}} brain itself {{as a result of}} the increased pressure on the obstructed veins, but it is not readily available in many hospitals and the interpretation may be difficult.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium alloys can be {{produced}} by adding a metal to molten plutonium. If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, plutonium can be added {{in the form of}} oxides or halides. The δ phase plutonium–gallium and plutonium–aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium(III) fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium, which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal.|$|E

5|$|The {{ignition}} system {{consisted of two}} rear-mounted, crankshaft-driven magnetos, each supplying one {{of a pair of}} spark plugs fitted to each cylinder. This is common practise for aero engines, as it ensures continued operation {{in the case of a}} single magneto failure, and <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> more efficient combustion over a single spark plug application.|$|E
5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This {{is critical in}} experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E

5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It {{is also used to}} purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|Bunnies & Burrows <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> {{offering}} players {{an intuitive}} grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is {{confronted with a}} fox. There is an immediate intuition {{on the amount of}} peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{design has}} similar goals to protein design. In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. Nucleic acid design <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. Nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides {{as compared to the}} twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E

5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{numerical}} weather prediction is to sample {{the state of the}} fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. Sites launch radiosondes, which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into the stratosphere. Data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available. Compared with similar data from radiosondes, the satellite data <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> global coverage, however at a lower accuracy and resolution. Meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity, which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time. Additionally, if a pulse Doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
