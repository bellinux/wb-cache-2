40|$|Abstract. In profile {{envelope}} {{process of}} <b>form</b> <b>cutter</b> for involute gear, the grinding depth is variable which causes grinding force to change {{on a large}} scale and the profile error of envelope to increase. To improve <b>form</b> <b>cutter</b> accuracy, a closed-loop control system was designed to accomplish control of envelope process. For complicated dynamic process, fuzzy controller is used to adjust parameters online. By measuring grinding force, characteristic information of grinding process is acquired. Regulation factor of feed rate is determined by grinding force ratio, force deviation and its change rate used as evaluation indexes. Thus, fuzzy control of constant force grinding process is accomplished.

In {{order to}} improve <b>form</b> <b>cutter</b> {{accuracy}} in grinding process, a closed-loop control system was designed to accomplish adaptive control of constant force in grinding process. Since it is a complicated dynamic process with severe nonlinear and much stochastic disturbance, fuzzy adaptive controller was used which can adjust parameters online.

Regulation factor of feed rate is determined by grinding force ratio, and force deviation and its change rate are used as evaluation indexes. Thus, adaptive control of constant force in grinding process is accomplished.

30|$|The {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) diamond film {{is attractive}} as an ideal coating for excellent characteristics, such as the high hardness, favorable wear resistance, low friction coefficient, high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient and excellent chemical stability [4, 5]. It is demonstrated that during the machining processes of the Al alloy workpieces, especially under the circumstance of the rough machining, the deposition of diamond films on the cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) milling cutters can prolong the working lifetime significantly, and improve the machining quality to some extent, because the excellent tribological properties of the diamond film can reduce the adhesion between the cutter and workpiece [6]. However, for the finish machining, since the cutting depth is relatively small, it is supposed that the optimal-designed uncoated WC-Co milling cutters can meet the requirement of the machining quality during their life cycles, but one drawback is that they wear out rapidly, followed by {{the deterioration of the}} machining quality. The employment of the turning or milling cutters made of the monocrystalline diamond is believed as the best choice for finish machining Al alloy workpieces, regardless of the cost, which can be directly used for mirror finishing [7, 8]. It is another option to adopt the polycrystalline diamond (PCD) as the cutting edges [9, 10], the wear resistance of which is undoubtedly much higher than that of WC-Co, while lower than those of the monocrystalline diamond and CVD diamond film. This is because the PCD is composed of not only diamond crystals but also some metallic bonding phases. Moreover, for either the monocrystalline diamond or PCD, it is rather difficult to <b>form</b> milling <b>cutters</b> with complicated shapes. Consequently, prolonging the tool life and guaranteeing the long-time machining quality with low cost are main aims of depositing diamond films on milling cutters.|$|R

On 16 April 1965 United States Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze requested Coast Guard assistance with Market Time. On 6 May 1965 seventeen Point-class cutters were loaded as deck cargo on merchant ships in New York City, Norfolk, New Orleans, Galveston, San Pedro, San Francisco, and Seattle for transport to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate {{the two sides of}} the flute, the face and the heel of a twist drill. The flute face was designed to yield straight diametral lips which could be extended to eliminate the chisel edge, and consequently a single cutting edge will be obtained. Since drill rigidity and space for chip conveyance have to be a compromise a theoretical expression is deduced which enables optimum chip disposal capacity to be described in terms of drill parameters. This expression is used to describe the flute heel side. Another {{main objective}} is to study the effect on drill performance of changing the conventional drill flute. Drills were manufactured according to the new flute design. Tests were run in order to compare the performance of a conventional flute drill and non conventional design put forward. The results showed that 50 % reduction in thrust force and approximately 18 % reduction in torque were attained for the new design. The flank wear was measured at the outer corner and found to be less for the new design drill than for the conventional one in the majority of cases. Hole quality, roundness, size and roughness were also considered as a further aspect of drill performance. Improvement in hole quality is shown to arise under certain cutting conditions. Accordingly it might be possible to use a hole which is produced in one pass of the new drill which previously would have required a drilled and reamed hole. A subsidiary objective is to design the <b>form</b> milling <b>cutter</b> that should be employed for milling the foregoing special flute from drill blank allowing for the interference effect. A mathematical analysis in conjunction with computing technique and computers is used.
