[...] If an elastic bar with uniform and symmetric cross-section is bent {{in one of its}} planes of symmetry, the resulting bending stress will still be normal (perpendicular to the cross-section), but will vary over the cross section: the outer part will be under tensile stress, while the inner part will be compressed. Another variant of normal stress is the <b>hoop</b> <b>stress</b> that occurs on the walls of a cylindrical pipe [...] or vessel filled with pressurized fluid.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{factors that}} {{occurred}} {{on that day}} and the previous days might {{have contributed to the}} disaster. The tank was constructed poorly and tested insufficiently. Due to fermentation occurring within the tank, carbon dioxide production might have raised the internal pressure. The rise in local temperatures that occurred over the previous day also would have assisted in building this pressure. Records show that the air temperature rose from [...] over that period. The failure occurred from a manhole cover near the base of the tank, and [...] a fatigue crack there possibly grew to the point of criticality.

40|$|Equations {{describing}} the <b>hoop</b> <b>stresses</b> in a pipe due to water hammer {{have been presented}} in the literature {{in a series of}} papers, and this paper discusses the complete derivation of the pertinent equation. The derivation considers the pipe wall response to a water hammer induced shock wave moving along the inner wall of the pipe. Factors such as fluid properties, pipe wall materials, pipe dimensions, and damping are considered. These factors are combined to present a single, albeit rather complicated, equation to describe the pipe wall vibrations and <b>hoop</b> <b>stresses</b> as a function of time. This equation is also compared to another theoretical prediction for <b>hoop</b> <b>stresses,</b> which is also derived herein. Specifically, the two theories predict different maximum stresses, and the differences between these predictions are graphically displayed...|$|R

40|$|Many {{analytical}} and experimental techniques utilize two-dimensional analysis approach to determine residual strains and stresses at cold expanded holes.

50|$|One area {{in which}} Poisson's effect has a {{considerable}} influence is in pressurized pipe flow. When the air or liquid inside a pipe is highly pressurized it exerts a uniform force {{on the inside of}} the pipe, resulting in a <b>hoop</b> <b>stress</b> within the pipe material. Due to Poisson's effect, this <b>hoop</b> <b>stress</b> will cause the pipe to increase in diameter and slightly decrease in length. The decrease in length, in particular, can have a noticeable effect upon the pipe joints, as the effect will accumulate for each section of pipe joined in series. A restrained joint may be pulled apart or otherwise prone to failure.|$|E

50|$|The first {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} the stress in cylinders {{was developed by the}} mid-19th century engineer William Fairbairn, assisted by his mathematical analyst Eaton Hodgkinson. Their first interest was in studying the design and failures of steam boilers. Fairbairn realised that the <b>hoop</b> <b>stress</b> was twice the longitudinal stress, an important factor in the assembly of boiler shells from rolled sheets joined by riveting. Later work was applied to bridge building, and the invention of the box girder. In the Chepstow Railway Bridge, the cast iron pillars are strengthened by external bands of wrought iron. The vertical, longitudinal force is a compressive force, which cast iron is well able to resist. The <b>hoop</b> <b>stress</b> is tensile and so wrought iron, a material with better tensile strength than cast iron, is added.|$|E
