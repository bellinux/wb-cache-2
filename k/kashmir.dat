5|$|Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and {{the valley}} itself during the First <b>Kashmir</b> War, but the intense {{fighting}} flagged {{with the onset}} of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions. The plebiscite was never held, and on 26 January 1950, the Constitution of India came into force in <b>Kashmir,</b> but with special provisions made for the state. India did not, however, secure administrative control over all of <b>Kashmir.</b> The northern and western portions of <b>Kashmir</b> came under Pakistan's control in 1947, and are today Pakistan-administered <b>Kashmir.</b> In the 1962 Sino-Indian War, China occupied Aksai Chin, the north-eastern region bordering Ladakh, which it continues to control and administer.|$|E

5|$|Some {{academics}} {{suggest that}} the insurgency in <b>Kashmir</b> is at least partly {{a result of the}} manner in which it was integrated into India. <b>Kashmir,</b> uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of issues than the three originally provided for. Instead, the power to make laws relating to <b>Kashmir</b> was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the Constitution of Jammu and <b>Kashmir</b> and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states. Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the politics of Jammu and <b>Kashmir.</b> The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing. Similarly, Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards <b>Kashmir</b> meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi-ethnic democracy. As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India's hold over <b>Kashmir,</b> transformed into an active insurgency.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti found in <b>Kashmir</b> and north West India predating 10th century suggests {{the worship of}} Vishnu in this form in the era. The form developed a cult between 8th to 10th century CE. The 12th century chronicle Rajatarangini also mentions about the installation of this form of Vishnu. The icon received royal patronage from King Avantivarman, the founder of Utpala dynasty (reign: 855-883 CE); temples built in his reign often depict Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Vaikuntha Chaturmurti became the tutelary deity of the Karkotas and Utpala dynasties of <b>Kashmir.</b> It was also popular in the regions adjoining <b>Kashmir.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon the Partition of India in 1947, Manekshaw's unit, the 4th {{battalion}} of the 12th Frontier Force Regiment, {{became part of}} the Pakistan Army, so Manekshaw was reassigned to the 16th Punjab Regiment. While handling the issues relating to partition in 1947, Manekshaw demonstrated his sound planning and administrative skills in his capacity as GSO1. At the end of 1947, Manekshaw was posted as the commanding officer of the 3rd {{battalion of}} 5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force). However, before he moved on to his new appointment, on 22 October, Pakistani forces infiltrated <b>Kashmir,</b> capturing Domel and Muzaffarabad. The following day, the ruler of the princely state of Jammu and <b>Kashmir,</b> Maharaja Hari Singh, appealed for India to send troops. But the Indian government replied that they would send troops only if Jammu and <b>Kashmir</b> acceded and became part of India. On 25 October, V. P. Menon, then-political advisor to the Viceroy of India, along with Manekshaw flew to Srinagar, with the Instrument of Accession. While Menon was with the Maharaja, Manekshaw carried out an aerial survey of the situation in <b>Kashmir.</b> After the Maharaja had signed the document, they flew back to Delhi the same night. Soon a briefing was held with Lord Mountbatten, and Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, where Manekshaw suggested immediate deployments of troops to save <b>Kashmir</b> from being captured.|$|E

He {{held a series of}} meetings with senior Indian and Pakistani government officials as well as senior Kashmiri leaders in both Indian and Pakistani-held <b>Kashmir</b> from November 1999 until January 2001, traveling to India secretly on out-of-passport visas. Following months of clandestine negotiations between militant Kashmiri commander Abdul Majid Dar and A. S. Dulat, then-chief of India's intelligence directorate, Dar declared a unilateral ceasefire in the Himalayan enclave on July 25, 2000. The initial ceasefire was aborted by a hard-line militant faction within Dar's Hizbul Mujahideen, widely believed to have been supported by Pakistani intelligence. In order to gain Pakistani support for India's peace efforts in <b>Kashmir,</b> Ijaz met Gen. Pervez Musharraf in Islamabad in May 2000. Musharraf reluctantly agreed to back the ceasefire plan despite opposition from hardliners in the ranks of Pakistan's armed forces and intelligence services.|$|E

Mauli Chandra Sharma was elected to succeed Mookerjee; however, he was forced out of power by the RSS activists within the party, and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS. The party minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of integral humanism, which formed the official doctrine of the party. Younger leaders, such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani also became involved with the leadership in this period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were legislating a uniform civil code, banning cow slaughter and abolishing the special status given to Jammu and <b>Kashmir.</b>|$|E
