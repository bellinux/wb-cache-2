2500|$|Writing for {{the album}} began shortly after Adele {{separated}} from her lover. Within a day of her break-up, she contacted producer Paul Epworth, intent on capturing her emotion in a song: [...] "We'd had a fuming argument the night before ... I'd been bubbling. Then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio and screamed." [...] Although she had initially planned on completing a ballad that she had begun writing with Epworth {{more than a year}} ago, the producer suggested that she aim for a more aggressive sound. Together, they restructured the song and re-wrote lyrics to reflect Adele's recent experience, deciding on the title [...] "Rolling in the Deep." [...] The instrumentation evolved organically—after trying out various jazz riffs, Adele attempted the first verse a cappella, inspiring Epworth to improvise a melody on his acoustic guitar. A thumping drum beat was set to mimic her racing heartbeat. In two days, a demo was recorded to be produced by Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin later that year. However, Adele re-approached Epworth months later to complete production of the song.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2013, Beyoncé {{explained}} {{the idea behind}} [...] "Bow Down" [...] on iTunes Radio: [...] "The reason I put out 'Bow Down' is because I woke up, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio, I had a chant in my head, it was aggressive, it was angry, it wasn't the Beyoncé that wakes up every morning. It was the Beyoncé that was angry. It was the Beyoncé that {{felt the need to}} defend herself. And if the song never comes out…OK! I said it! And I listened to it after I finished, and I said, This is hot! I'mma put it out. I'm not going to sell it. I'm just going to put it out. People like it, great; they don't, they don't. And I won't do it every day because that's not who I am. But I feel strong. And anyone that says, 'Oh that is disrespectful,' just imagine the person that hates you. Imagine a person that doesn't believe in you. And {{look in the mirror and}} say, 'Bow down, bitch' and I guarantee you feel gangsta!

2500|$|In 1890, Bennett {{remained}} with the Beaneaters {{even though he}} had in 1886 joined the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. [...] As a member of the Brotherhood, his refusal to play in the Players' League was criticized by many of his fellow Brotherhood members. Hardy Richardson, a Brotherhood representative and former teammate of Bennett, stated that Bennett offered to sign with the Brotherhood only if he was given a three-year contract guaranteed by two responsible men. Some reports indicated that former Detroit manager Robert Leadley was paid $1,000 to convince Bennett to remain with the Beaneaters and that Bennett was himself paid a substantial signing bonus. [...] Bennett later described his ambivalence about the Players' League: [...] "I was a Brotherhood man from the first. Mrs. Bennett was strongly opposed to my going into it and before the season opened I told my friends that I could not join them, so I {{remained with}} the Boston Club. When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Brotherhood it was a protective order and I had no idea that they intended organizing an association of their own." ...|$|E
2500|$|An early 1996 Q {{magazine}} interview {{revealed that}} relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy {{wrote that he}} found them [...] "on {{the verge of a}} nervous breakup". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. [...] "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on", he said, and decided to let Coxon have more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period, stating that, [...] "I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day , I was watching the TV and I saw a programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I got on a plane, and booked into the Saga hotel. I didn't know it meant Saga holidays, for older people—I thought it was Saga as in Nordic sagas. But it was actually an OAP cruise hotel. I was on my own: I didn't know anybody. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> street, Laugavegur, where the bars are, and that was it." ...|$|E

[...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse. [...] We jumped on him, my brother and I double, and escaped." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another Verhoeven film—the erotic thriller Basic Instinct (1992)— {{she took}} on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, bisexual, alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required. In the film's most notorious scene, Tramell is being {{questioned}} by the police, and she crosses and uncrosses her legs, exposing her vulva, which is not covered by underwear. According to Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no underwear, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene {{from the beginning of}} production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be: [...] "I knew {{that we were going to}} do this leg-crossing thing and I knew that we were going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it in a room full of strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> booth and slapped him and left". Stone claimed in an earlier interview, however, that [...] "it was so fun" [...] watching the film for the first time with strangers. Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, [...] "As much as I love her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot between her legs, which was a straight lie". Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who later befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir, Hollywood Animal, that the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved.|$|E

[...] "It is you and men like you," [...] he shouted, [...] "who have reduced our race to slavery and starvation!" [...] American Horse did not flinch but deliberately reentered the office, followed by Jack still flourishing the pistol. But his timely appearance and eloquence had saved the day.
