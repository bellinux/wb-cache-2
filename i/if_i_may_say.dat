You had an option, sir—to say 'no'—and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party. That, sir, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> respectfully, is not good enough for Canadians." ...|$|E
2500|$|Menzies oversaw an effusive {{welcome to}} Queen Elizabeth II {{on the first}} visit to Australia by a reigning monarch, in 1954. He made the {{following}} remarks during a light-hearted speech to an American audience in New York, while {{on his way to}} attend her coronation in 1953: [...] "We in Australia, of course, are British, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so, to the boot heels...but we stand together–our people stand together –till the crack of doom." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{minute later}} he drew me aside. [...] "Excellent company your friend is, sir: most gentlemanly manners; but at times, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> so <b>say,</b> not very gleg." ...|$|R

2500|$|NMPs {{were made}} a {{permanent}} feature of Parliament {{with effect from}} 1 July 2010. Prior to this change, Parliament had to decide within six months after every election whether to appoint NMPs. The rationale for the changes was given by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Parliament on 27 May 2009. According to him, the main motivation behind having NMPs as a permanent {{part of the system}} of government in Singapore {{was the fact that the}} scheme had been a great success and had improved the quality of debate in the House: [...] "The scheme has worked well. The NMPs represent non-partisan alternative views in Parliament, and the NMPs have made effective contributions and raised the quality of debate in Parliament. Sometimes, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so, they may have outshone even the Opposition MPs. This NMP scheme should be a permanent part of our political system." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{religious}} polemic {{of about}} this time complains bitterly of the oppression and extortion suffered by all but the richest Romans. Many wished to flee to the Bagaudae or even to foul-smelling barbarians. Although these men differ in customs and language from those with whom they have taken refuge, and are unaccustomed too, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so, to the nauseous odor of the bodies and clothing of the barbarians, yet they prefer the strange life they find there to the injustice rife among the Romans. So you find men passing over everywhere, now to the Goths, now to the Bagaudae, or whatever other barbarians have established their power anywhere... We call those men rebels and utterly abandoned, whom we ourselves have forced into crime. For by what other causes were they made Bagaudae save by our unjust acts, the wicked decisions of the magistrates, the proscription and extortion {{of those who have}} turned the public exactions to the increase of their private fortunes and made the tax indictions their opportunity for plunder? ...|$|E

"True, {{as far as}} {{you have}} gone," [...] said Ruby, with a quiet smile; [...] "but Swankie is six feet two in his stockings, and his nose is turned up, and his hair don't curl, and his eyes are light-green, and his {{complexion}} is sallow, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> not <b>say</b> yellow--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hardly your liege subjects, Your Majesty, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> {{venture to}} <b>say</b> so; for, assuredly, {{they were not}} engaged in lawful proceedings, when I came upon them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have read}} what you said," [...] Bransome remarked. [...] "What we {{should like to}} hear, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> venture to <b>say</b> so, is what you left unsaid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly disappointed, Little Bill, but sort o' ways scumbusticated, so to speak--perplexed, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so. Kind o' ways puzzled, d'ee see?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You forget, Lady Janet (<b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> {{venture to}} <b>say</b> so), that the {{circumstances}} are changed. She {{took me by}} surprise on the last occasion; I am prepared for her now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A most perspicacious young lady!' he interjected, well pleased. 'I have {{investigated}} that point, {{and find it}} perfectly regular. Only, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> venture to <b>say</b> so, {{there should be no}} erasures.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well....ur...yes, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> {{venture to}} <b>say</b> so to a lady,' the old {{shoemaker}} answered hesitatingly, with unwonted gallantry. 'I should {{say they were}} a trifle, ur, just a trifle roseate, you know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must congratulate you, Inspector, on {{handling}} so {{distinctive and}} instructive a case. Your powers, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so without offence, seem superior to your opportunities." ...|$|E
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN [again gallant] But surely, Mrs Lutestring, {{that has}} been your own fault. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so, a lady of your attractions need never have been lonely.|$|E
60|$|CUSINS [cautiously] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so, Lady Brit, I think Charles has rather happily {{expressed}} {{what we all}} feel. Homer, {{speaking of}} Autolycus, uses the same phrase.|$|E

6000|$|He {{stared at}} me with a sort of suspicion. 'Please don't tell me you think me like my sister,' he went on. 'For though, of course, every right-minded man feels--ur--a natural respect and affection for the members his family--bows, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> so <b>say,</b> to the inscrutable decrees of Providence--which has mysteriously {{burdened}} him with them--still, there are points about Lady Georgina which I cannot conscientiously assert I approve of.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said Richie, [...] "in declaring {{your trust}} in me, {{you have done}} what is honourable to yourself, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> with humility <b>say</b> so much, and in no way undeserved on my side. Nevertheless, we must part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{very glad}} to have the {{privilege}} of your acquaintance; and, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so, you 'ave--you 'ave my 'earty sympathy. Good-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|Me, mother dear? [...] You, faith, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> it dutifully! [...] Had {{all been}} left to me, some time ere now [...] He would have wedded Kate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I fear you may {{possibly}} have {{to submit to}} {{a certain amount of}} good-natured chaff, but nothing more. All, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so, is forgiven, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|There was my reply! Poor {{enough as}} a {{composition}} (I {{could write a}} much better letter now), it had, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> presume to <b>say</b> so, one merit. It was the honest expression of what I really meant and felt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Talk {{to people}} a little, and smile sometimes. Move about quicker. Don't look {{when you come}} into a room {{as if you were}} consecrating it to tears. And, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> venture to <b>say</b> so, drop {{something}} of the heaviness of your mourning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My best thanks are yours," [...] and {{her hand}} was taken, she was {{carefully}} conducted {{to the door and}} dismissed with a gentle pressure of her fingers, and a courteous: [...] "Goodnight, madam; Au revoir, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> venture to <b>say</b> so." ...|$|R
60|$|It was no {{very great}} grief {{to me to}} do that, for he was, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so, hardly worthy {{to have such a}} subaltern. I saluted, however, in silence.|$|E
60|$|DOCTOR. [After a pause.] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so, I quite {{agree with}} you. I have often taken {{the liberty of}} warning your sister against going out in all weathers like this.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless I'll have a look," [...] said Bellew, with a smile, [...] "for I'm {{a bit of}} {{a doctor}} myself in such matters,--about a quarter of one, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> so." ...|$|E
60|$|Besides this {{ignorance of}} the primary qualities of the insensible parts of bodies, on which depend all their {{secondary}} qualities, there is yet another and more incurable part of ignorance, which sets us more remote from a certain knowledge of the co-existence or INCO-EXISTENCE (<b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> so <b>say)</b> of different ideas in the same subject; and that is, {{that there is no}} discoverable connexion between any secondary quality and those primary qualities which it depends on.|$|R

60|$|My Lords, {{these are}} the {{opinions}} of those with whom I have the honor to act, and in their opinions I readily acquiesce.
