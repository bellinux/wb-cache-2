5|$|The Girossi newsstands project, {{which was}} never carried out, was a {{commission}} from the tradesman Enrique Girossi de Sanctis. It would have consisted of 20 newsstands, spread throughout Barcelona. <b>Each</b> <b>would</b> have included a public lavatory, a flower stand and glass panels for advertisements {{as well as}} a clock, a calendar, a barometer and a thermometer. Gaudí conceived a structure with iron pillars and marble and glass slabs, crowned by a large iron and glass roof, with a gas illumination system.|$|E
5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone’s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being “joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.” Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other’s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other’s subsequent earnings. <b>Each</b> <b>would</b> {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell’s objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that <b>each</b> <b>would</b> enjoy personal independence and autonomy: “Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.” During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright’s book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple’s marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose “when, where and how often” she would “become a mother.” In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of Ombifotsy was ruled by Andriambahoakafovoanitany, {{who had a}} friendly relationship with Andriamasinavalona. The two agreed to a challenge: <b>each</b> <b>would</b> leave his palace simultaneously on a chosen Friday night, and walk toward the other's palace until the two met. They crossed paths at the Ombifotsy ("White Zebu") river, so named because the two sacrificed a white zebu there in honor of their friendship and the peace agreement between their two territories of Imamo and Imerina. Andriambahoakafovoanitany's son dug a trench along the river, where he erected a stone to commemorate the agreement. Imamo was divided into four parts, each administered by one of Andriambahoakafovoanitany's sons.|$|E
50|$|The eight invited {{teams were}} {{split into two}} groups that played a {{round-robin}} tournament. On completion of this, the fourth placed teams in <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> play <b>each</b> other to determine seventh and eighth place, the third placed teams in <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> play <b>each</b> other to decide fifth and sixth place, the second placed teams in <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> play to determine third and fourth place and the winners of <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> compete for first and second place overall.|$|R

5|$|Work began almost {{immediately}} {{to prepare for}} the expansion of the town. A full master plan was in place by 1949. This envisaged an increase in the population of the town to 50,000, residential properties in nine neighbourhoods radiating from the town centre, and a separate industrial area to the north. The neighbourhoods would consist mainly of three-bedroom family homes, with a number of smaller and larger properties. <b>Each</b> <b>would</b> be built around a centre with shops, a church, a public house, a primary school and a community centre. Secondary education was to be provided at campuses at Ifield Green, Three Bridges and Tilgate. Later, a fourth campus, in Southgate, was added to the plans.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} Empire again in 293AD, {{appointing}} two Caesars (junior emperors) to rule over further subdivisions of East and West. <b>Each</b> <b>would</b> be subordinate {{to their respective}} Augustus (senior emperor) but would act with supreme authority in his assigned lands. This system would later be called the Tetrarchy. Diocletian's first appointee {{for the office of}} Caesar was Constantius; his second was Galerius, a native of Felix Romuliana. According to Lactantius, Galerius was a brutal, animalistic man. Although he shared the paganism of Rome's aristocracy, he seemed to them an alien figure, a semi-barbarian. On 1 March, Constantius was promoted to the office of Caesar, and dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels Carausius and Allectus. In spite of meritocratic overtones, the Tetrarchy retained vestiges of hereditary privilege, and Constantine became the prime candidate for future appointment as Caesar as soon as his father took the position. Constantine went to the court of Diocletian, where he lived as his father's heir presumptive.|$|E
5|$|During the war, all {{the uranium}} from the Congo {{had gone to}} the United States, as had that {{captured}} in Europe by the Alsos Mission, even though some of it passed through British hands. The entire output of the Shinkolobwe mine was contracted to the Combined Development Trust until 1956, but in March 1946 there were fears that the mine might be exhausted in 1947, resulting in a severe uranium shortage. After some negotiation, Groves and Chadwick agreed on a division of uranium ore production, with everything up to March 1946 going to the United States, and supplies being shared equally thereafter. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 31 July 1946, the financial arrangements were adjusted. Previously, the two countries had split the costs equally; henceforth <b>each</b> <b>would</b> only pay for what they actually received. Britain was therefore able to secure the uranium it needed without having to outbid the United States, and paid for it in sterling, while receiving reimbursement for the supplies allocated to the United States in dollars, thus easing Britain's dollar shortage.|$|E
5000|$|... 12 {{teams were}} grouped into 3 groups of 4 teams each, where <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> consist {{of home and}} away {{round-robin}} tournament. The winners of <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> qualify to the finals.|$|R

5000|$|Often, motel {{owners would}} {{organize}} [...] "referral chains" [...] in which <b>each</b> member lodge <b>would</b> voluntarily meet {{a set of}} standards and <b>each</b> property <b>would</b> promote the others. <b>Each</b> property <b>would</b> display the group's name alongside its own; a printed directory of all member locations would generally be freely distributed at each member hotel or motel.|$|R
5|$|In {{the charter}} of the Presidential Council, each of the three leaders would sit on a Presidential Council which would be tasked with {{approving}} all major policy decisions of the country. At the same time, <b>each</b> <b>would</b> get two years as the President of the country able to implement many of the ongoing tasks of managing the military and civil service in the country. The various ministerial positions would be divided between the three leaders; however, the Ministry of the Interior and the Minister of the Army would be appointed by the sitting president. It was decided that Maga would be the first President from 1970 until 1972, followed by Ahomadégbé until 1974, and then Apithy until 1976. One peaceful transition occurred with Hubert Maga giving power to Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin on 7 May 1972. However, stalled politics ensued with Maga and Apithy working to undermine Ahomadégbé's ability to govern and the Presidential Council was ended on 26 October 1972 when a military coup led by Mathieu Kérékou assumed power and ruled the country until 1991.|$|E
5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; <b>each</b> <b>would</b> inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|E
25|$|Owens would {{hand out}} replicas of his {{trademark}} acoustic guitar to friends, acquaintances and fans. <b>Each</b> <b>would</b> contain a gold plaque {{with the name}} of the recipient. Some of these guitars cost $1000 and up.|$|E
5000|$|... 24 {{teams were}} grouped into 6 groups of 4 teams each, where <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> consist {{of home and}} away {{round-robin}} tournament. The winners and runners-up of <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> advance to the final stage.|$|R

25|$|After {{independence}} the American {{states were}} obliged to write constitutions establishing how <b>each</b> <b>would</b> be governed. For three years, from 1778 to 1780, the political energies of Massachusetts were absorbed in drafting a charter of government that the voters would accept.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ship}} has reached its {{cruising}} speed of 0.8c, each twin would see 1second {{pass in the}} received image of the other twin for every 3seconds of his own time. That is, <b>each</b> <b>would</b> see {{the image of the}} other's clock going slow, not just slow by the ε factor 0.6, but even slower because light-time-delay is increasing 0.8seconds per second. This is shown in the figures by red light paths. At some point, the images received by each twin change so that <b>each</b> <b>would</b> see 3seconds pass in the image for every second of his own time. That is, the received signal has been increased in frequency by the Doppler shift. These high frequency images are shown in the figures by blue light paths.|$|E
25|$|To avoid confusion, {{note the}} {{distinction}} between what each twin sees and what <b>each</b> <b>would</b> calculate. Each sees an image of his twin which he knows originated at a previous time and which he knows is Doppler shifted. He does not take the elapsed time in the image as the age of his twin now.|$|E
50|$|In the Second Round, the 30 {{teams were}} divided in 5 groups of 6 teams each. Teams in <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> play against <b>each</b> {{other in a}} home-and-away basis. The team with most points in <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> qualify to the World Cup.|$|R

50|$|The {{preliminary}} round for the 14 {{teams would}} be played as 2 groups of single round-robin tournaments by 7 teams, where <b>each</b> team <b>would</b> play 3 home and 3 away games. The top 2 teams in <b>each</b> group <b>would</b> advance to quarter-finals.|$|R
25|$|In 1825 the {{government}} of the Dutch-Indies provided him with two assistants: apothecary and mineralogist Heinrich Bürger (his later successor) and the painter Carl Hubert de Villeneuve. <b>Each</b> <b>would</b> prove to be useful to Siebold's efforts that ranged from ethnographical to botanical to horticultural, when attempting to document the exotic Eastern Japanese experience. De Villeneuve taught Kawahara the techniques of Western painting.|$|E
25|$|By 293, Diocletian, {{conscious}} of the ambitions of his co-emperor for his new son-in-law, allowed Maximian to promote Constantius in a new power sharing arrangement known as the Tetrarchy. Diocletian divided {{the administration of the}} Roman Empire into two halves, a Western and an Eastern portion. <b>Each</b> <b>would</b> be ruled by an Augustus, supported by a Caesar. Both Caesars had the right of succession once the ruling Augustus died.|$|E
25|$|This show {{of force}} {{compelled}} the company to negotiate further, since Madras had been left nearly defenceless by military movements made to counter those of Hyder's main force. Hyder, who was seeking diplomatic leverage against the Marathas, wanted an alliance of mutual defence and offence. The company refused to accede to an offensive military treaty; the Treaty of Madras signed on 29 March 1769 had terms that <b>each</b> <b>would</b> support the other if attacked.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amount of}} funding <b>each</b> school <b>would</b> receive from its [...] "Local Education Agency" [...] for <b>each</b> year <b>would</b> be divided {{by the number of}} {{children}} with disabilities and multiplied by the number of students with disabilities participating in the schoolwide programs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{referral}} {{chain in}} lodging {{originated in the}} early 1930s, originally serving to promote cabins and tourist courts. A predecessor of the modern [...] "franchise chain" [...] model, a referral chain {{was a group of}} independent motel owners in which <b>each</b> member lodge <b>would</b> voluntarily meet a set of standards and <b>each</b> property <b>would</b> promote the others. <b>Each</b> property <b>would</b> proudly display the group's name alongside its own.|$|R

25|$|My {{point with}} these seven {{thousand}} trees was that <b>each</b> <b>would</b> be a monument, {{consisting of a}} living part, the live tree, changing all the time, and a crystalline mass, maintaining its shape, size, and weight.
