40|$|The main {{characteristics}} of the Portuguese economy since 2000 are low growth, a rising current account defcit and indebtedness. In the period 2000 – 2007 Portuguese GDP increased at an annual average rate of 1. 4 per cent. The current account defcit, which was 3. 5 per cent of GDP in 1995, quickly deteriorated under the EMU to reach 12. 5 per cent in 2008. The shift from fscal stimulus to austerity took place in March 2010. In April 2011, assistance was requested from the EU {{and in the same}} month a Memorandum of Understanding was negotiated with the troika. Austerity and structural adjustment policies were geared towards reducing the government defcit and debt and rebalancing the current account by cutting wages (»internal devaluation«). The austerity measures adopted since March 2010 are having a strong recessionary <b>impact.</b> <b>Unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> have climbed to unprecedented heights, reaching 15. 6 per cent in the frst quarter of 2012. Youth unemployment (15 – 24) has reached 36. 2 per cent. Nominal wages contracted by 3. 9 per cent between the third quarter of 2010 and the frst quarter of 2012. As it is becoming clear that austerity will fail to deliver its promises – the defcit is out of control and the public debt keeps growing – clear signs of what the IMF call »reform fatigue« are discernible. However, this discontent tends to take the form, not of the emergence of a political alternative, but rather of the increasing alienation of the public from what it perceives as a corrupt and dishonest political class...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{relationship}} between welfare expenditure by government and unemployment outcomes. Using a panel of 34 OECD countries from 1980 to 2010 and a two-way fixed effect model for panel data subject to endogeneity test and persistence test, the results of the paper suggest that total welfare expenditure as a percentage of GDP has a statistically significant positive <b>impact</b> on <b>unemployment</b> outcomes (total unemployment, long-term unemployment and youth unemployment). Among the four major components of national welfare expenditure, only income support and pension benefit are found to have the significant positive effect on all unemployment outcomes, public expenditure on health services has marginally significant positive <b>impact</b> on total <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate,</b> but not on long-term <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> and youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> and public social expenditures on other social services provided by government have no significant <b>impact</b> on <b>unemployment.</b> The econometric estimation results also provide evidence to support the hypothesis that one channel through which public social expenditure <b>impacts</b> <b>unemployment</b> is investment <b>rate</b> and the hypothesis that immigration can decrease a nation’s total <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate.</b> ...|$|R

This paper compares the influence of several economic variables on the total <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> and the youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate.</b> The countries that are studied are three countries with the highest youth unemployment rate: Greece, Croatia and Spain, and three countries with the lowest youth unemployment rate: Germany, Denmark and the Czech Republic. By implementing an Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) approach, this paper concludes that the youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> is significantly more affected by the increase of the public debt-to-GDP ratio in comparison to the total <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> in Croatia and Spain. This paper finds significant differences in the factors that <b>impact</b> youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> in comparison to total <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate.</b> Notably, the <b>impact</b> of economic growth is far stronger in decreasing total <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> than youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate.</b> The main conclusion of this paper is {{that there should be a}} new European economic framework that will focus on combating rising youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> in order to avoid potentially dangerous consequences and restore faith in the EU and national institutions which has still not recovered from the 2008 crisis...|$|R

Panel data from the 1993 to 20012 period {{were used in the}} analysis. One of the main factors of the differences in the <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> between the regions is the proportion of people aged from 15 to 29 years in the population.

40|$|The {{following}} is {{a study of the}} impact of migration on <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> for natives in Sweden, on municipal level. A cross sectional data set has been analyzed using multiple linear regressions. The regression analysis has searched for the <b>impact</b> on the <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> among natives {{of the size of the}} share of migrants in the municipalities as well as of the change in the size of the share of migrants during a time span of 13 years. The results show that migration has small or non-existent <b>impact</b> on the <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> of natives. The results vary depending on the period being investigated and also depending on the characteristics of the municipality that is investigated. When dividing the municipalities into three categories (city, urban and rural municipalities) significant impact of migration on native’s <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> is to be found in city and urban municipalities, but not in rural. The results also indicate that the most significant impact is to be found in the present period of time, while in the long term the impact diminishes to become less significant or not significant at all. 10 % migrants in a city municipality in 2015 increased natives’ unemployment level that same year by 0. 4 percentage units. More rapid increases of the share of migrants in the labor force have more impact as well.
