5|$|Arthur, who {{was looking}} to retain the BBBofC Lonsdale Belt, {{was seen as a}} rising star in British boxing. He was a strong {{favourite}} to win the bout against Gomez, who was perceived to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> too many battles and abused his body too much, and the fight was seen as a stepping stone on Arthur's way to a future world championship. However, Freddie Roach, Arthur's trainer, was criticised when he remained in the United States to coach another boxer instead of continuing to work with Arthur to prepare for his championship match.|$|E
5|$|Candide and Cacambo {{eventually}} reach Suriname, {{where they}} split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares {{to travel to}} Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local men who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.|$|E

Willow recites {{what he thinks}} is the {{appropriate}} spell, but turns the goat into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise, and finally a tiger, before returning her to normal. ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> the use of an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|The inner ward {{was created}} during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug {{to the west}} of the {{innermost}} ward, effectively doubling the castle's size. HenryIII created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day. Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt. Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward. The main entrance to the inner ward would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> a gatehouse, most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by EdwardI. The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans. The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13towers that stud the curtain wall. Anti-clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower. While these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making longbows, crossbows, catapults, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night.|$|E

25|$|The main conduit of Dionysian spirituality into ascetic-mystical {{literature}} on contemplative prayer in sixteenth-century prayer (such as that by John of the Cross and Teresa of Ávila appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> the recogido tradition of Francisco de Osuna, Bernardino de Laredo and others. Osuna’s focus on recogimiento (recollecting or {{gathering of the}} senses) {{as a means of}} prayer, bears similarity to John’s discussion of prayer, and may have been an influence. In terms of Spanish writing, it is notable that although {{the second half of the}} sixteenth century produced many great mystics, mysticism was not common in Spain before that.|$|E

For Series 7 & 8, where the Interviews was the final task, his decision determined who won the competition.|$|E

The Interagency Grizzly Bear Recovery Committee is one of many organizations committed to the recovery of grizzly bears in the lower 48 states. There are five recovery zones for grizzly bears in the lower 48 states including the North Cascades ecosystem in Washington state. The National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife initiated the process of an environmental impact statement that started in the fall of 2014 to begin the recovery process of grizzly bears to the North Cascades region. A final plan and environmental impact statement was released in the spring of 2017 with a record of decision to follow.|$|E

Although the Sterling Area no longer exists and the Commonwealth is much more an informal forum, India and the UK still have many enduring links. This is in part due to the significant number of people of Indian origin living in the UK. The large South Asian population in the UK results in steady travel and communication between the two countries. The British Raj allowed for both cultures to imbibe tremendously from the other. The English language and cricket are perhaps the two most evident British exports, whilst in the UK food from the Indian subcontinent are very popular. The United Kingdom's favourite food is often reported to be Indian cuisine, although no official study reports this.|$|E
