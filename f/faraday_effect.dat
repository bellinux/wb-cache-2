40|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of a pulsar {{is composed}} of relativistic plasmas streaming along the magnetic field lines and corotating with the pulsar. We study the intrinsic Faraday rotation in the pulsar magnetosphere by critically examining the wave modes and the variations of polarization properties for the circularly polarized natural modes under various assumptions about the magnetosphere plasma properties. Since {{it is difficult to}} describe analytically the <b>Faraday</b> rotation <b>effect</b> in such a plasma, we use numerical integrations to study the wave propagation effects in the corotating magnetosphere. <b>Faraday</b> rotation <b>effect</b> is identified among other propagation effects, such as wave mode coupling and the cyclotron absorption. In a highly symmetrical electron-positron pair plasma, the <b>Faraday</b> rotation <b>effect</b> is found to be negligible. Only for asymmetrical plasmas, such as the electron-ion streaming plasma, can the <b>Faraday</b> rotation <b>effect</b> become significant, and the Faraday rotation angle is found to be approximately proportional to λ^ 0. 5 instead of the usual λ^ 2 -law. For such electrons-ion plasma of pulsar magnetosphere, the induced rotation measure becomes larger at higher frequencies, and should have opposite signs for the emissions from opposite magnetic poles.

2500|$|Radio waves {{passing through}} the Earth's {{ionosphere}} are likewise subject to the <b>Faraday</b> <b>effect.</b> The ionosphere consists of a plasma containing free electrons which contribute to Faraday rotation {{according to the above}} equation, whereas the positive ions are relatively massive and have little influence. In conjunction with the earth's magnetic field, rotation of the polarization of radio waves thus occurs. Since the density of electrons in the ionosphere varies greatly on a daily basis, as well as over the sunspot cycle, the magnitude of the effect varies. However the effect is always proportional to the square of the wavelength, so even at the UHF television frequency of 500MHz (λ = 60cm), there can be more than a complete rotation of the axis of polarization. [...] A consequence is that although most radio transmitting antennas are either vertically or horizontally polarized, the polarization of a medium or short wave signal after reflection by the ionosphere is rather unpredictable. However the <b>Faraday</b> <b>effect</b> due to free electrons diminishes rapidly at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) so that at microwave frequencies, used by satellite communications, the transmitted polarization is maintained between the satellite and the ground.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{presence}} of strong electrostatic fields it is predicted that virtual particles become separated from the vacuum state and form real matter. The fact that electromagnetic radiation can be transformed into matter and vice versa leads to fundamentally new features in quantum electrodynamics. One {{of the most important}} consequences is that, even in the vacuum, the Maxwell equations have to be exchanged by more complicated formulas. In general, it will be not possible to separate processes in the vacuum from the processes involving matter since electromagnetic fields can create matter if the field fluctuations are strong enough. This leads to highly complex nonlinear interaction - [...] gravity will {{have an effect on the}} light at the same time the light has an effect on gravity. These effects were first predicted by Werner Heisenberg and Hans Heinrich Euler in 1936 and independently the same year by Victor Weisskopf who stated: [...] "The physical properties of the vacuum originate in the “zero-point energy” of matter, which also depends on absent particles through the external field strengths and therefore contributes an additional term to the purely Maxwellian field energy". Thus strong magnetic fields vary the energy contained in the vacuum. The scale above which the electromagnetic field is expected to become nonlinear is known as the Schwinger limit. At this point the vacuum has all the properties of a birefringent medium, thus in principle a rotation of the polarization frame (the <b>Faraday</b> <b>effect)</b> can be observed in empty space.|$|E
