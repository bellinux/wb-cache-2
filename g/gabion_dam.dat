Land cover and land use changes contribute to reef ecosystem degradation, which in turn, diminish many ecosystem services, including coastal protection, recreation, and food provisioning. The objectives of this work were to understand the role of coastal oceanic and biophysical processes in mediating the effects of sedimentation in shallow reef environments, and to assess the efficacy of land-based sediment remediation in the coastal areas near Maunalei reef, Lāna’i Island, Hawai’i. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this was the first study of sediment dynamics on an east-facing (i. e., facing the trade winds) reef in the Hawaiian Islands. We developed ridge-to-reef monitoring systems at two paired stream bed-to-reef sites, where one of the reef sites was adjacent to a community stream sediment remediation project. We found that the two reef sites were characterized by different processes that affected the sediment removal rates; the two sites were also exposed to different amounts of sediment runoff. The community stream sediment remediation project appeared to keep at least 77 tonnes of sediment off the reef flat in one wet season. We found that resuspension of sediments on this reef was similar to that on north-facing and south-facing reefs that also are exposed to the trade winds. We posit that sites with slower sediment removal rates due to slower current velocities or high resuspension rates will require more-robust sediment capture systems on land to reduce sediment input rates and maximize potential for reef health recovery. This suggests that interventions such as local sediment remediation and watershed restoration may mitigate sediment delivery to coral reefs, but these interventions {{are more likely to be}} effective if they account for how adjacent coastal oceanographic processes distribute, accumulate, or advect sediment away from reefs. Our results on the effectiveness of <b>gabion</b> <b>dam</b> sediment capture may help guide scalable solutions for erosion control on islands...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrology}} of the Kudumela Wetland, Limpopo Province of South Africa was studied from November 2005 to April 2007, involving both fieldwork {{and laboratory}} analyses. This study {{presents the results}} of an investigation of the hydrology of the Kudumela Wetland in South Africa, and its contribution to dry season flow in the Mohlapitsi and Olifants Rivers. Initially, 40 Piezometers were installed along seven transects and water levels monitored in order to understand water table level characteristics (fluctuations) with time. Water levels in transects one, three, the right bank portion of transect four and transect six showed fluctuations. Transect two, the left bank portion of transect four and transect five did not show significant temporal changes. The relationships between piezometer water levels, rainfall in the study area and stream flow observed at a river gauging station are not clear. The river within the wetland is a gaining stream because the water table level elevation is above that of the river. This indicates that the wetland is feeding the river. The northern part of the wetland (T 1 and T 2) is affected by artificial drains and most of the piezometers closest to the river channel showed the lowest variations. The relationships between rainfall, groundwater, and surface water at this site shows that stream flow did not respond quickly to precipitation as expected, even in months when rainfall increased (for example, 74 and 103 mm during 08 / 02 / 06 and 18 / 02 / 06 respectively), and the groundwater levels did not show fluctuations, indicating that groundwater responds gradually to precipitation, and that the relationship between rainfall, groundwater and surface water is complex. The environmental stable isotopes (deuterium and oxygen- 18) and the radioactive isotope (tritium) were analyzed, along with field observations of electrical conductivity (EC), pH, total alkalinity (Talka) and some major and minor dissolved ion analyses for tracing water dynamics in the study area. A total of 39 water samples was taken and analyzed from boreholes, auger holes, right bank and left bank drains, various points along the river and springs in four sampling visits to the wetland. The results did not clearly provide a temporal record of isotope and chemical variations in the various sources. Results from the most extensive sampling survey in April 2007 provide the most comprehensive overview of hydrological relationships. Clustering of the stable isotope data suggests that the water samples of upstream and downstream river, auger holes further south and most drains clustered together suggesting a common water source and almost all samples fall above the global (GMWL) and local (Pretoria MWL) meteoric water lines, while some fall between the global and Pretoria meteoric water lines. Six representative water samples were analyzed for major ion concentration. Both cation (Ca, Mg, K, and Na) and anion (HCO 3, SO 4, Cl, and NO 3) analyses in November 2007 confirmed conclusions reached from field observations. The analysis shows that a single type of water (Ca, Mg-HCO 3) is involved in the study area. In almost all major ion plots, the right bank drains, upstream river and downstream river samples grouped together in a single cluster. As the means for reliable river flow measurements were not available, except for the gauging station at the outlet of the valley, rough, semi-quantitative estimates were made during several field visits. These, suggest considerable losses of river flow into the gravel/boulder beds at and below a <b>gabion</b> <b>dam</b> {{at the head of the}} valley. Three major and several other left bank springs and right bank drains at transects T 1 and T 2 contributed to the river flow at all times. Along with the isotopic and chemical evidence, these observations have lead to a hypothesis that river water enters the wetland and flows back to the Mohlapitsi River through boulder beds underlying the wetland and through drains on the surface of the argillaceous aquitard covering the more conductive boulder beds. Deeper dolomitic groundwater does not appear to contribute to the water balance at least in the northern half of the wetland. Although environmental isotope and hydrochemistry results may not unequivocally prove this hypothesis they do not contradict it. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Runoff {{collected}} from Ottewell neighborhood discharges into Fulton Creek will increase discharge in the Creek and consequently brings {{in the environmental}} concerns. This paper summarized the environmental considerations in planning, designing, and implementing the Fulton Creek portion of the Ottewell/Kenilworth Sewer Upgrading Project at the City of Edmonton. The environmental considerations include the environmental review (ER) process, mitigation approaches, and the investigation of Best Management Practice (BMP). The ER investigation indicated that this drainage project has minimal impact on the forest and wildlife while erosion and bank stability are major concern. The mitigation approach is to install <b>gabion</b> check <b>dams</b> and <b>gabion</b> blanket structures in the ravine. The BMP study has shown that this flood relief project will reduce Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) {{to the river and}} the quality of the stormwater into the North Saskatchewan River (NSR) will be improved after implementing this project. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gabion</b> check <b>dams</b> (GCDs) {{are among}} the most {{diffused}} soil and water conservation practices in Burkina Faso, used to cope with soil loss and reservoir siltation. Specifically, CGDs are flexible, permeable structures built in gullies to create a sedimentation bench that decreases the average upstream slope. The consequent slowing-down of the flowing water limits flood-wave sediment transport capacity reducing soil loss upstream, reduces the amount of trapped sediment in reservoirs and promotes water infiltration into the soil. The present work provides concise guidelines for the design and implementation of GCDs in Burkina Faso. This was achieved gathering the experience developed in the frame of several cooperation and development projects led by the Italian non-governmental organization. The theoretical elements and procedural steps to perform an appropriate design and implementation of GCDs are described and discussed, including hydrological and hydraulic methods to assess stream flow characteristics, spillway functioning, siltation rate, dimensions and stability of the structur...|$|R

40|$|Because of its simple form, its {{effectiveness}} as an energy dissipator, and {{its contribution to}} dam stability, the stepped spillway {{is one of the}} oldest drop structure used in the construction of small dams. With the relatively recent introduction of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) and particularly (rockfill) <b>gabions</b> as <b>dam</b> construction materials, the stepped spillways continues to be an attractive option among the various traditional forms of drop structure for small dams. The steps on the spillway's downstream face significantly increase the energy dissipation thereon over that would occur on the equivalent smooth (ogee-profile) version. As a consequence stilling basin structures, usually introduced at the toe of spillways (to reduce excess energy in the spillway floor) can be either reduced in size or eliminated entirely. Although stepped spillways were first introduced around 694 B. C., in most previous studies dealing with the hydraulic performance of stepped spillways are site-specific. This research, which includes both mathematical and physical elements, investigates the effect of different step configurations, in contribution with different spillway slopes, on the hydraulic performance of (ogee-profile) stepped spillways. The main goal of the research was to develop improved criteria for the design of stepped spillways. The numerical study, a 2 -D finite element model was developed to estimate, based on a trial-error procedure, the stepped spillway water surface for a given design head. In the supporting experimental programme three different spillway slopes (45 ∘, 50 ∘, and 60 ∘) were investigated and in each case the experiments were repeated for four different step configurations. This provides data set of 12 combinations of spillway slope and step arrangement. Improved criteria were developed to (i) distinguish between the possible flow regimes on stepped spillways, (ii) estimate both stepped spillway friction factors and energy dissipation rates, and (iii) determine optimum step configurations for a given set of boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|Gully erosion {{is known}} to be a key erosion process of land {{degradation}} in dryland environments. In Northern Ethiopia, gully networks rapidly developed since the 1960 s onwards, draining hillsides, jeopardizing in-situ and downstream agricultural production, causing downstream water pollution, reservoir sedimentation, enhancing environmental degradation, and hindering overland travel. In response to the negative impacts on humans and the environment, environmental rehabilitation programs were launched in Northern Ethiopia, including the region-wide implementation of soil and water conservation measures (SWC). As indicated in recent studies these measures are starting to be successful and about 25 % of the gully networks are currently stabilizing. However, under specific soillandscape conditions, the presence of Vertisols, with their swell-shrink properties, limits the effects of the SWC measures, as there, gully development is enhanced by soil piping. Alternative measures are therefore needed to control sub-surface drainage in Vertisol areas, especially upslope of existing gully heads. A new method that is being implemented in the catchment of May Ba’ati consists of introducing subsurface geomembrane (vertical) dams perpendicular to a gully channel segment, which are enforced with <b>gabion</b> check <b>dams</b> where they cross the gully. The subsurface dams extend 25 m at each side of the check dam and are inserted from 0. 3 to 2. 3 m deep. The outcome of this technique is that the groundwater level upslope from the subsurface geomembrane dams rises, and concomitantly, that soil cracking and hence soil piping decreases. In addition, flood retention ponds are constructed in the gully channel and peak flow discharges are diverted to a nearby exclosure. Piezometric measurements indicate that groundwater is retained longer in the Vertisol upslope of the dams after rainfall events. This is also apparent from field observations, which show green grass upslope of the subsurface dam as a result of improved moisture conditions. This low-cost intervention will not only improve gully stabilization but moreover, risen water tables will increase in-situ agricultural production and flood diversion will stimulate the growth of grasses, shrubs and trees in exclosures. By presenting such an integrated approach on gully erosion control in Vertisol areas, we believe that adaptation of the technique to other sites will be favoured and thus enhance the rehabilitation of gully networks...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change and}} global warming are major {{problems}} {{all over the world}} that anthropogenic greenhouse gases emission especially Co 2 {{is one of the main}} reasons. So it is vital to find methods to reduce Co 2 or increase Carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration by plants and in soils accounted as an effective way of reducing CO 2 emission to the atmosphere, but considerable amount of soil organic carbon is lost by erosion annually. One way to deal with these losses is mechanical practices that control erosion and stabilizes the soil. This study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of mechanical practices on carbon sequestration in Kardeh watershed of Mashhad, Iran. Rock check <b>dams,</b> <b>gabions</b> and small earth dams were considered as mechanical treatments comparing to natural rangeland.

These water management techniques are the subject of >, by Jean-Louis Chleq and Hugues Dupriez in the series Terres et Vie (Land and Life) by Macmillans. CTA has financed the translation of the book into English (by Bridaine O'Meara), and has promoted its distribution. The book, inspired by village schemes in Sahelian Burkina Faso, examines techniques which are not expensive in terms of equipment and supplies, which respond directly to the water needs of agriculture and livestock, and which are efficient in bringing life to these regions across subSaharan Africa. Furthermore, building smallscale dams, inaugurating bore holes, organizing anti-erosion campaigns, excavating ponds for surface water storage, apportioning off-season water supplies, constructing gabions and cast-linings for well shafts, all provide employment and increase artisanal skills Vanishing Land and Water describes, sometimes in considerable technical detail, schemes that are on-going, which can be developed and improved by local inhabitants. it urges cooperation between all concerned - water technicians and all who serve to use creatively and effectively what the elements bring - cooperate. Starting from the definition of terminology, this publication examines in Part I the hydrological cycle and the sources of soil, and proceeds to look closely in Part II at the mechanisms of erosion when the two elements - water and earth - meet in adverse conditions. Part II is devoted to erosion control to save villages - by eliminating both run-off in fields, and gullies and small streams. Practical detail abounds on the construction of barriers, <b>dams,</b> <b>gabions,</b> and so on. The rest of the book continues logically from the conservation of water to its storage and extraction from the ground by well-sinking, bores, by scoops and pumps, and the sources of energy needed for lifting water. A chapter is given over to surface water storage in traditional ponds called boulis Finally, the authors state their concern over the lack of development of water supplies and technology in semi-arid regions. There are still many communities where farming is in trouble because of lack of water, where people are ill because of drinking polluted water, and where people are so inwardlooking because of their many problems that intercommunication is rare. This book suggests concrete ways in which those interested and involved in water supplies and technology (villagers and craftsmen, headsmen and local government officials, government technical and training departments, and funding agencies) can work together for the benefit of all Vanishing Land and Water should prove an invaluable tool in the simplicity of its message, the clarity of its lay-out, and the practicalitiy of its instructions, diagrams, and illustrations.
