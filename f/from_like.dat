5|$|The album's {{photographs}} were shot by Steven Meisel. Madonna wanted the album title and the cover image to make provocative link between her own religious name Madonna, as the Roman Catholic title for Jesus' mother Mary, and the Christian {{concept of the}} virgin birth. While not a substantial musical departure from Madonna's first album, she felt that the material <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Virgin was stronger. Consisting of dance-pop music, the songs also incorporated new wave. After its release, Like a Virgin received mixed reviews from the critics, but was a commercial success. It became Madonna's first number one album on the Billboard 200, while reaching {{the top of the}} charts in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it diamond for shipment of ten million copies across the United States. Worldwide it has sold 21 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E

25|$|Again {{produced}} by Alkam films, Starewitch made Nose to Wind, which tells {{the adventures of}} Patapouf, a bear who escapes from school to play with his friends the rabbit and the fox. That year, his wife Anna died. Due to the success from the previous film, Winter Carousel was made, starring the bear Patapouf and the rabbit going through seasons. This was his last completed film. All his family co-labored on it, as remembers his granddaughter Léona Béatrice, whose hands {{can be seen in}} animation tests <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> Dog and Cat, Starewitch's unfinished film.|$|E
25|$|The ARM2 {{featured}} a 32-bit data bus, 26-bit address space and 2732-bit registers. Eightbits {{from the program}} counter register were available for other purposes; the top sixbits (available because of the 26-bit address space) served as status flags, and the bottom twobits (available because the program counter was always word-aligned) were used for setting modes. The address bus was extended to 32bits in the ARM6, but program code still had to lie within the first 64MB of memory in 26-bit compatibility mode, due to the reserved bits for the status flags. The ARM2 had a transistor count of just 30,000, compared to Motorola's six-year-older 68000 model with around 40,000. Much of this simplicity came {{from the lack of}} microcode (which represents about one-quarter to one-third of the 68000) and <b>from</b> (<b>like</b> most CPUs of the day) not including any cache. This simplicity enabled low power consumption, yet better performance than the Intel 80286. A successor, ARM3, was produced with a 4KB cache, which further improved performance.|$|E
500|$|The first track {{selected}} {{for use on}} the compilation album was [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Virgin (1984). The track was reworked by producer David Reitzas and features a different composition from the 1984 version. Madonna also included two soundtrack singles which had never been featured on her own album, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] from the 1992 film A League of Their Own and [...] "I'll Remember" [...] from the 1994 film With Honors. Other previously released material {{selected for}} the compilation were [...] "Crazy for You" [...] from Vision Quest (1985), [...] "Live to Tell" [...] from True Blue (1986), [...] "Oh Father" [...] <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer (1989), [...] "Something to Remember" [...] from I'm Breathless (1990), [...] "Rain" [...] from Erotica (1992), as well as [...] "Take a Bow" [...] and [...] "Forbidden Love", both from Bedtime Stories (1994). Two tracks on the compilation, [...] "Crazy for You" [...] and [...] "Live to Tell", were overlapping with her first greatest hits album, The Immaculate Collection (1990). According to Rikky Rooksby, the author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, the song selection creates a soft atmosphere, the music is downbeat and [...] "emotionally introverted" [...] with mellow vibes throughout.|$|E

500|$|... "Dear Jessie" [...] was {{released}} as the fourth single <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer in Europe, while {{it served as}} the fifth single from the album in Australia and Japan; it was never released in the United States. The single cover used a photo from 1987, taken by Herb Ritts. It showed Madonna in bed, clutching a bed sheet to her bosom and sporting a pair of Minnie Mouse ears. The photo was {{a reference to the}} early criticism of Madonna's work, when reviewers had described her voice as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium".|$|E
500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Madonna for her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984). It was released on January 23, 1985, by the Sire label as the second single <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Virgin. It also appears slightly remixed on the 1990 greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection, and in its original form on the 2009 greatest hits compilation, Celebration. The song was written by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, while Nile Rodgers produced the track. Madonna explained {{that the concept of}} the song was indicative of her life at that time. She felt that [...] "Material Girl" [...] was provocative in its content and was attracted to it.|$|E
500|$|After its release, {{the song}} {{received}} positive feedback from reviewers, who {{were surprised by}} the change of content and the lighter image of Madonna's music in contrast to her previous singles <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer, which incorporated themes such as religion and sexuality. They compared certain lyrics of the song to words spoken by Juliet in William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. [...] "Cherish" [...] was a commercial success, reaching the top-ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and the combined European chart. On the Billboard Hot 100, [...] "Cherish" [...] became Madonna's 16th consecutive top-five single, setting a record {{in the history of}} the Billboard Hot 100 chart.|$|E

500|$|In Australia, [...] "Keep It Together" [...] charted on the ARIA Singles Chart {{along with}} [...] "Vogue". It debuted {{on the chart}} at number 19 and reached the top the next week, {{remaining}} there for five consecutive weeks. The song was present {{for a total of}} 35weeks on the chart and reached number three on the Australian Year-end chart for 1990. It was certified double-platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 140,000copies of the single. After its release in Japan, [...] "Keep It Together" [...] appeared for two weeks on the Oricon Singles Chart, and reached number five. The single was not released in the United Kingdom, where [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] was the final single <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer instead.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{turned to}} her old friend and {{producer}} John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to help her remixing the songs, and also {{enlisted the help of}} Patrick Leonard, the producer of True Blue. Together they chose six of Madonna's old songs and decided to give it a remixed form. The songs chosen were [...] "Holiday", [...] "Everybody" [...] and [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] from Madonna (1983), [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and [...] "Over and Over" [...] <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Virgin (1984), and lastly, [...] "Where's the Party" [...] from True Blue. Along with the pre-released tracks, a never-before released song called [...] "Spotlight" [...] was included as a bonus. Madonna said that she was inspired by the song [...] "Everybody Is a Star" [...] (1970), by American rock band Sly and the Family Stone. Written by Madonna, Stephen Bray and Curtis Hudson, [...] "Spotlight" [...] was originally recorded during the True Blue recording sessions. It was omitted from the album because Madonna felt that it was similar in composition and structure to [...] "Holiday".|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers have {{compared}} [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] {{to the work}} of The Beatles. Allen Metz, {{one of the authors of}} The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, described the composition of the song as [...] "pastel-pretty, [...] richly orchestrated". He felt that the song would have fit better on The Beatles' 1969 soundtrack album, Yellow Submarine. The Beatles influence was also noted by Stephen Holden from The New York Times, who labeled [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] a [...] "stylish swatch of late Beatles-style psychedelia". Joey Levy from Spin characterized [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] as [...] "amazing", describing his reaction to the song as [...] "Wow! This is neat!" [...] He added that the song sounded like Prince singing for The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Kevin Phinney from the Austin American-Statesman compared the song to the solo work that Beatles' member John Lennon did later in his career. Phinney wondered how Madonna was able to come up with the song, since most of the tracks <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer are full of innuendo and double meanings.|$|E

500|$|Professor Maury Dean {{wrote in}} his book Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-Cyclopedia, that the main appeal of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] lay in its teen appeal, {{although}} he understood that at its core, it was addressing {{a very important issue}} of female liberation. Kevin Phinney from Austin American-Statesman commented that with [...] "Express Yourself", Madonna struck out her [...] "Material Girl" [...] persona, there by demonstrating once more that no image of hers is concrete. Based on the lyrics of the song, Ken Blakely of Philadelphia Daily News declared the song as a rare example of good taste and good advice <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer. Andy Goldberg from The Jerusalem Post was impressed with Madonna's vocals on the song, complimenting the soul inlfluences. Rolling Stones J. D. Considine called [...] "Express Yourself" [...] an unabashed groove tune and felt that it seemed [...] "smart and sassy, right down to Madonna's soul-style testimony on the intro: 'Come on, girls, do you believe in love?" [...] Don McCleese from Chicago Sun-Times declared the song as {{one of the highlights of}} the album, feeling that it would become anthemic. Sal Cinquemani from Slant magazine, while reviewing Like a Prayer, announced [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the most soulful performance of Madonna's career. He added that the song [...] "turned Madonna's 'Material Girl' image on its head, denouncing material things for a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic felt that the song consisted of [...] "deep funk" [...] music.|$|E
500|$|... "Cherish" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and released {{as the third}} single <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer (1989). The song is built around the themes of love and relationships, with William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet one of its major inspirations. Madonna was reading Romeo and Juliet during the breaks during rehearsals for Speed the Plow, a Broadway show {{in which she was}} starring in 1988. On the third day of the Like a Prayer recording sessions, she presented Leonard with the lyrics of [...] "Cherish", and explained that she had written the song [...] "one sunny afternoon by the beach", but later confessed that it was actually written in her make-up room. [...] "I wrote it in a superhyper-positive state of mind that I knew was not going to last", the singer recalled. Leonard introduced one line from the similar titled song by the 1960s band The Association, [...] "Cherish is the word I use", after which Madonna decided to include it on Like a Prayer. The B-side of the single release of [...] "Cherish" [...] was a previously unreleased track called [...] "Supernatural", initially composed during the recording sessions of her third studio album, True Blue and later completed in 1989. In 2009, during an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna confessed that she {{had never been able to}} predict if her songs would be successful, irrespective of her personal opinion of them. As an example, she cited [...] "Cherish" [...] as one of the most [...] "retarded" [...] songs she had written, but noted it became a commercial success. The song was also included on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and the two-disc edition of her 2009 compilation Celebration.|$|E
500|$|Following the song's {{release on}} January 23, 1985, {{as the second}} single <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Virgin, [...] "Material Girl" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Author Rikky Rooksby, in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, compared the song with those of Cyndi Lauper because of Madonna's shrill voice in the song. He added that the song was a [...] "pungent satire on the Reagan/Thatcher young-guns-go-for-it era. Which {{just goes to show}} that pop music and irony don't mix." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said that [...] "Material Girl" [...] was one of the songs that made Madonna an icon, the other being [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] from the same album, both remaining as a definitive statement. He added that both tunes overshadow the rest of the record, [...] "because they are a perfect match of theme and sound." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone, felt that the song portrayed Madonna as a more practical girl than previous female singers. Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly, while reviewing the album in 1995, felt that the song came off a bit repetitious and immature when compared to the present context. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly felt that the song provided then critics a way to criticize Madonna's work. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that Madonna had [...] "defined a generation with hits like 'Material Girl'." [...] Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine compared the song with [...] "Everything She Wants" [...] by Wham!. Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the song sustained a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum." [...] Nancy Erlick from Billboard said that [...] "singer and team conquer once more with their irresistible assembly of new and used pop hooks." [...] In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their Top 20 Madonna singles of all time for a special issue of Q magazine dedicated to Madonna. [...] "Material Girl" [...] was allocated the 15th spot on the list.|$|E

500|$|As {{the guitar}} intro of [...] "Gambler" [...] started, Madonna {{stood on the}} side-stage and started dancing energetically, as {{flashlights}} fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present {{on the side of}} the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Virgin. It was followed by [...] "Burning Up" [...] during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change. As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.|$|E

Upon its release, [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] received mixed reviews from critics, who complained about the overdone fantasy imagery of the song, but complimented its composition. The track was a moderate success commercially, reaching the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Ireland and the top 20 in Germany, Spain and Switzerland. [...] "Keep It Together" [...] {{was released}} on January 30, 1990 as the sixth and final single <b>from</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer. The song received mixed reviews from critics but was commercially successful; [...] reaching a peak of number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian charts, while topping the dance chart in the United States. In Australia it {{reached the top of the}} charts along with Madonna's next release, [...] "Vogue".|$|E

[...] In July, a remixed version of Miami was released through iTunes; Stradlin called the new mix [...] "much louder and more powerful sounding." [...] In November of that year, he released a second iTunes-only album, Fire, the Acoustic Album, which also featured Richards, Bentley, and Longoria.|$|E
