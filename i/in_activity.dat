40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the course of}} limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> over five years follow-up and identify predictors of future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> elderly patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. Relevance: Although cross sectional research on determinants of limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> is robust <b>in</b> patients with OA, high quality longitudinal research on the course of limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> over time and predictors of future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> is surprisingly limited. Knowledge about the courseof limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> over time and predictors of future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> is important for both patients and clinicians. Based on this information clinicians can identify patients {{who are at risk}} for future functional decline and prognosticate future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Furthermore, more insight in the course of limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> and predictors of future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> is the basis for improving treatments and rehabilitation of patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Participants: Elderly patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis according to radiological criteria or clinical criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (n = 288) were recruited at rehabilitation centres and hospitals. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study with five years follow-up was conducted. The main outcome measures were self-reported and performance based limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Prognostic factors were demographic and clinical data, body functions, co morbidity, cognitive functioning, avoidance of activity and social support. Measurements were conducted at baseline, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years follow-up. Analysis: All analyses were performed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). To identify predictors of future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities,</b> univariate GEE analyses were performed. Potential predictors with a univariate p-value that was {{less than or equal to}} 0. 15 were entered into a multivariable model, after which backward elimination of predictors was used to remove non-significant predictors (p to remove≥ 0. 10). All analyses were performed separately for patients with knee OA and patients with hip OA. Results: Both in patients with knee and hip OA, the course of limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> remained fairly stable over a period of five years. Avoidance of activity, increased pain, a higher morbidity count, a higher age, a longer disease duration, a reduced muscle strength and range of joint motion at baseline predicted more future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> patients with knee OA. In patients with hip OA, avoidance of activity, increased pain, a higher morbidity count, a higher age, a higher educational level and a reduced muscle strength at baseline predicted more future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Conclusions: The course of limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> remains fairly stable over a period of five years in elderly patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis. However, at individual level there is considerable variation. Predictors of more future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> include avoidance of activity, increased pain, higher morbidity count, lower muscle strength, and a higher age. Implications: The study findings can help clinicians prognosticate future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> patients with hip or knee OA and identify patients who are at risk for more future limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> (aut. ref. ...|$|R

Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted. Patients (n= 288) with hip or knee OA were recruited from rehabilitation centres and hospitals (departments of orthopaedics, rheumatology and rehabilitation). Apart from demographic and clinical data, physical impairments (pain, muscle strength and range of joint motion: ROM), comorbidity, cognitive dysfunction and limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> (both self reported (WOMAC) and observed (timed walking test) were assessed. Statistical analyses included multilevel analysis, univariate regression analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Results: Preliminary results showed that in operated patients self reported functioning improved, where as observed functioning remained unchanged. In patients, that had not undergone surgery, limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> did not change. No {{differences were found between}} hip and knee OA. The course of self reported limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> was significantly associated with change in ROM hip flexion {{during the first year of}} follow-up, change in pain during the first year of follow-up and morbidity count. Furthermore, muscle strength hip abduction, change in muscle strength hip abduction during the first year of follow-up, morbidity count, cognitive function, age and BMI were associated with observed limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Conclusion: Patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee show differences in the course of limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Some of the patients improve, where as others show no changes or worsening of limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> This difference can be partly explained by the fact that some of the patients underwent surgery and others did not. In not operated patients, the course of limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> remained unchanged. Patients that had had surgery reported improvement. Furthermore, protective factors and risk factors for the course of limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> were identified. Pain and morbidity count were found as risk factors for worsening where as an improvement in ROM could be seen as a protective factor for self reported limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Risk factors that were identified for observed limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> were morbidity count and BMI.

MethodsSelf-reported limitation <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> was assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA index (WOMAC) function subscale in 316 patients with knee or hip pain or evidence of OA on knee or hip radiographs. Body structures and functions were evaluated during clinical and radiological assessments. Illness perceptions and mental health were assessed with the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) and the mental component summary score of the RAND 36 -item Health Survey, respectively. For each patient an expected WOMAC function score was calculated, using an equation based on a multivariate model {{of the association of}} body structures and functions with limitation <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> ResultsThe median (interquartile) self-reported WOMAC function score was 22. 2 (9. 6 – 43. 5). Ninety-one patients reported more and 120 patients reported less limitation <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> than expected. Patients with lumbar spine degeneration, physical or exercise therapy and high IPQ-R identity, consequences and chronic timeline scores had an increased risk to report more limitation <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> than the expected range.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the course of}} limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> <b>in</b> elderly patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee over a follow-up period of 3 years, and to identify prognostic factors of the course of limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities,</b> focusing on body functions, comorbidity, and cognitive functioning. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study with 3 years of follow-up. Measurements were conducted annually. Statistical analyses included t tests, univariate regression analyses, and multivariate regression analyses. SETTING: Rehabilitation centers and hospitals (Departments of Orthopedics, Rheumatology, and Rehabilitation) in The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N= 237) with hip or knee OA. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient-perceived change, self-reported limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and observed limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> (timed walking test). Prognostic factors: demographic data, clinical data, body function (pain, muscle strength, range of motion [ROM]), comorbidity, and cognitive functioning (cognitive decline, memory, attention). RESULTS: Self-reported limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> measured by the WOMAC improved slightly after 3 -year follow-up. In knee OA, reduced ROM at 1 -year follow-up (beta=. 120), increased pain at 1 -year follow-up (beta=-. 177), and higher morbidity count (beta=-. 180) predicted worsening of self-reported limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>In</b> hip OA, reduced ROM at 1 -year follow-up (beta=. 201 for hip external rotation and beta=. 144 for knee extension), increased pain at 1 -year follow-up (beta=-. 134), higher morbidity count (beta=-. 220), or the presence of moderate to severe cardiac disease (beta=-. 214) and poorer cognitive functioning (beta=. 181) predicted worsening of self-reported limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> Performance-based limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> measured by the timed walking test did not change after 3 years of follow-up. In knee OA, decreased muscle strength at 1 -year follow-up (beta=-. 272) and higher morbidity count (beta=. 199) predicted worsening of performance-based limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>In</b> hip OA, better ROM (beta=. 182), higher morbidity count (beta=. 232), or the presence of moderate to severe cardiac and eye-ear-nose-throat disease (beta=. 210 and beta=. 188, respectively) and older age (beta=. 355) predicted worsening of performance-based limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Overall, at the group level, limitations <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> of patients with OA of the hip or knee recruited from hospitals and rehabilitation centers seem fairly stable during the first 3 years of follow-up. However, {{at the level of}} individual patients, considerable variation occurs.
