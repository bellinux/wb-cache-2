5|$|Hamilton {{felt the}} money from the bonds should not go to the soldiers, but the speculators that had bought the bonds from the soldiers, who had shown little <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country's future.

As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the national debt and label it as federal debt, for the sake of efficiency on a national scale.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} {{pledge not to}} run for re-election, retired {{to his home in}} Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform.

Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E

His habit of parroting the Führer's orders caused him {{to be viewed as}} a sycophant, even if he often undermined or ignored those orders in practice.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{greatest}} potential dangers of <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding {{what could be a}} sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as glaucoma.

Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.|$|E
