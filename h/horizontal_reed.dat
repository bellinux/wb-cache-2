50|$|The organ in the NCH was {{installed}} by the organ builders Kenneth Jones and Associates in 1991, {{ten years after}} the auditorium was built. It features prominently in various performances at the NCH. It {{is one of the largest}} organs in Ireland with 4 manuals and 50 stops. One of the notable features of the organ is the magnificent State Trumpet, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>reed</b> stop that faces out into the auditorium.|$|E
50|$|The organ has 7,952 pipes, with ca 900 {{classified}} as historical. It has 110 real stops, five 56-key manuals and a 32-key pedalboard. In December 1992, a two-year {{restoration of the}} organ was completed that fully computerized the organ under three LANs (Local Area Networks). The restoration also included a number of additions, notably two further <b>horizontal</b> <b>reed</b> stops en chamade in the Cavaille-Coll style. The Notre-Dame organ is therefore unique in France in having five fully independent reed stops en chamade.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the best-known}} organists at Notre-Dame de Paris was Louis Vierne, who held this {{position}} from 1900 to 1937. Under his tenure, the Cavaillé-Coll organ was modified in its tonal character, notably in 1902 and 1932. Léonce de Saint-Martin held the post between 1932 and 1954. Pierre Cochereau initiated further alterations (many {{of which were}} already planned by Louis Vierne), including the electrification of the action between 1959 and 1963. The original Cavaillé-Coll console, (which is now located near the organ loft), {{was replaced by a}} new console in Anglo-American style and the addition of further stops between 1965 and 1972, notably in the pedal division, the recomposition of the mixture stops, a 32' plenum in the Neo-Baroque style on the Solo manual, and finally the adding of three <b>horizontal</b> <b>reed</b> stops [...] "en chamade" [...] in the Iberian style.|$|E
50|$|The six organs (two in {{the main}} chapel, two in the {{northern}} transept, and two in the southern transept), although different, have several common features. Some, like the <b>horizontal</b> <b>reeds</b> and the divided keyboard, are common among Iberian instruments of the time. Other features, like the short-resonator reeds, the Italian voce umana, and especially the double-wind chest, (allowing the quick cancellation of the plenum stops) are typical {{of the school of}} Cerveira and Fontanes.|$|R
40|$|On-site {{research}} {{was carried out}} in Ireland to assess and compare the treatment capabilities of freely draining subsoils receiving both septic tank and secondary effluents in tandem with a treatment assessment of a <b>horizontal</b> subsurface-flow <b>reed</b> bed. This is due to recent concern being expressed as to whether a sufficient level of treatment is being achieved in the subsoil?s vadose zone coupled with doubts being raised as to the treatment capabilities of <b>horizontal</b> flow <b>reed</b> beds as stand-alone secondary treatment systems. Results over an 18 -month period have shown the reed bed to remove only 52 % of the organic load but achieve 2 - 3 log removal in total coliforms and E. coli. The majority of nitrification is seen to occur in the first 0. 3 m of subsoil for all sets of percolation trenches and, coupled with poor denitrification throughout the subsoil, has compromised groundwater quality in the form of nitrate infiltration. The research also shows that in general the septic tank effluent has received a comparable quality to the secondary effluent in terms of E. coli by the time the point of discharge to groundwater is reached in the subsoil...|$|R
40|$|In Ireland, {{the most}} {{prevalent}} domestic wastewater treatment application in unsewered areas is the conventional septic tank system with percolation area. However, concern has been expressed over on-site effluent discharging into highly permeable soils which, although permitted in current Irish EPA guidelines, has generated debate as to whether an insufficient level of treatment in the subsoil?s unsaturated zone is being achieved. In situations where a septic tank installation is considered unsuitable according to a rigorous site assessment, some form of secondary treatment system can be installed to improve the effluent quality before discharge to the subsoil. <b>Horizontal</b> subsurface-flow <b>reed</b> bed systems are one such technology receiving significant attention recently, being deemed an effective and low-cost alternative for secondary treatment applications. On-site research was thus carried out to assess and compare the treatment capabilities of freely-draining sandy subsoils receiving both septic tank and secondary effluents in tandem with a treatment assessment of a <b>horizontal</b> subsurface-flow <b>reed</b> bed receiving heavily loaded septic tank effluent. Results over a 12 -month period have shown the reed bed to remove only 47 % of the organic load but achieve 2 - 3 log removal in total coliforms and E. coli. The majority of nitrification is seen {{to occur in the}} first 0. 3 m of subsoil for both the trenches receiving septic tank effluent and secondary effluent respectively. The research also shows that in general the septic tank effluent has received a comparable quality to the secondary effluent in terms of E. coli by the time the point of discharge to groundwater is reached in the subsoil...|$|R

The Notre-Dame organ is therefore unique in France in having five fully independent reed stops en chamade. The church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais {{is one of the}} great shrines of organ music, thanks to the Couperin family; eight members of the family were organists there from 1656 until 1826. They included Louis Couperin (1626-1661), and François Couperin (1668-1733) authors of celebrated masses and other compositions for the instrument. The grand organ of Couperin is still in place on the Tribune above the entrance at the back of the church. The first organ was constructed by Mathis Languhedul of Flanders in 1601; followed by new organ made by the French dynasty of Pierre, Alexandre and François Thierry, between 1649 and 1714; then rebuilt by François-Henri Cliquot in 1769, with many restorations over the following years. The organ itself is a registered historic landmark.|$|E
40|$|Different {{options for}} {{wastewater}} treatment have different performance characteristics and also different direct {{impacts on the}} environment. These impacts occur over the whole life cycle of the treatment system. Natural wastewater systems such as the reedbed may offer reduced whole life cycle environmental impacts compared to systems with more technical and material sophistication. This paper describes {{a study of the}} life cycle impacts of two options for small-scale wastewater treatment which are a <b>horizontal</b> flow <b>reedbed</b> system and a package bio-filtration plant. The study is limited to impacts during the construction and operation phases. Energy use, CO 2 emission and solid emissions were chosen as the environmental aspects. It was found that overall the reedbed and conventional systems were quite similar in terms of life cycle energy use. Transport occurring during construction and operational maintenance was a key contributor to energy use and CO 2 emissions. The environmental impact of the reedbed reduced if the soil excavated on site was suitable for re-use in the infill. The effect on the results of the different assumptions made during the study was checked using sensitivity analysis. This analysis also helped us to identify recommendations for reducing the life cycle impact of the reedbed system...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} the quality fluctuations of leachate from municipal landfill in Gdansk (Poland) {{over the last}} 5 years and the evaluation of a wetland system designed for treatment of the leachate. The {{research has been conducted}} during a 5 -year period. The constructed wetland for leachate treatment was built in 2001; it consists of 2 <b>horizontal</b> subsurface flow <b>reed</b> beds, working in parallel. In the period 2005 – 2006 it underwent modernization due to unsatisfactory treatment results caused by bed clogging. After the modernization the treatment effectiveness is satisfactory. The effluent from bed I met Polish outflow standards, while in the effluent from bed II COD, total N and TSS exceeded the required concentrations. In spite of this, pre-treatment of leachate (iron removal) should be quickly introduced to protect the system against the reoccurrence of clogging problems...|$|R
40|$|Three {{discontinuous}} batch shallow constructed wetland {{systems with}} recirculating subsurface <b>horizontal</b> flow with <b>reed,</b> willow, and without plants {{were used to}} assess the removal of nitrogen from landfill leachate in relation to hydraulic retention time and climatic conditions. In all systems redox potential in the beds increased asymptotically from negative anoxic conditions to + 67 (reed bed), − 2 (willow bed), and + 17 mV (control bed), reaching a plateau in two wk. During the first 24 h after feeding the beds all forms of nitrogen decreased significantly. It has been shown that plants release O 2 and Norg which was then hydrolyzed to ammonia. Plant-available radiation significantly (p < 0. 05) increased the release of Norg and removal of ammonia after the 9 th day of the experiment. Low, and relatively constant concentrations of nitrite and nitrate indicated that denitrification had taken place in the beds...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the key biochemical mechanisms that occur within a reed bed system or constructed wetland during the treatment of landfill leachate. Soil respirations, dehydrogenase activities and urease activities within a <b>horizontal</b> subsurface flow <b>reed</b> bed were extensively examined to determine these mechanisms. Variations in biochemical parameters because of change in space and leachate applications were investigated. Correlations among the biochemical parameters and between biochemical parameters and pollutant removal efficiency were undertaken. No biochemical activities showed any horizontal variations across the reed bed. For both preloading and during-loading conditions, soil respirations and dehydrogenase activities {{did not have any}} vertical variations whereas urease activities at 5 cm depth were significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than those at 50 cm and 90 cm depth. When during-loading conditions were compared with preloading conditions, soil respirations showed no variation at any depth, whereas significant reductions were observed at 50 cm (P= 0. 034) for dehydrogenase activities and at 50 cm (P= 0. 018) and 90 cm (P= 0. 004) depths for urease activities.

40|$|Constructed wetland {{technology}} is gaining increasing attention as a low cost-efficient alternative to high-tech treatment systems for treating municipal and industrial wastewaters especially in small communities. However, its application for grey water reuse has been rarely investigated whilst performance for nutrients (N and P) still remains relatively poor. Pilot scale {{study was conducted}} in which three differently configured subsurface constructed wetlands: a <b>horizontal</b> flow <b>reed</b> bed (HFRB), vertical flow reed bed (VFRB) and a novel system - Green Roof Water Recycling System (GROW) were investigated for their suitability and robustness in treating grey water for reuse across a range of influent strengths to represent the limiting conditions observed in the literature. The HFRB and the GROW systems were found to be generally limited to comply with reuse standards especially at high strength. The release of iron from the HFRB media and particulates from the GROW system contributed to the poor turbidity of the final effluent from these systems. Overall, all wetland configurations were able to effectively treat low strength greywater but only the vertical flow system maintained its robustness when high strength greywater was treated. Analysis of the systems reveals this was {{due to the fact that}} aerobic metabolism is a more suitable treatment pathway for greywater. Ultimately, the performance of the vertical system was slightly lower but comparable to that of a membrane bioreactor making constructed wetlands a suitable technology for greywater recycling. Also, Bauxol, Red mud, Bayoxide, Ochre, Filtralite-P, Steel slag, concrete, Zeolite and various form of limestones were investigated for potential removal of soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP) and metals (Cu and Ni) in final sewage effluent for post Constructed Wetland System. P capacities exhibited by the different adsorbents correlated with type of metal (e. g. Fe, Al, Ca) and their cation exchange capacities. Ochre exhibited the best P removal ability with a P capacity of 26 g Kg- 1 based on a Freundlich isotherm model. The equilibrium sorption capacity of BauxolTM and Ochre based on a Dubinin-Radushkevich model was found to be 4. 1 and 4. 9 mg g- 1 for Cu and Ni unto BauxolTM respectively and 2. 6 and 10. 2 mg g- 1 for Cu and Ni onto Ochre respectively. Kinetic and thermodynamic study revealed a spontaneous and efficient adsorption process via a pseudo-second order mechanism where intraparticle diffusion was shown to be the rate limiting step. An aerobic post constructed wetland system using Ochre as the bed media for large scale applications is suggested. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
