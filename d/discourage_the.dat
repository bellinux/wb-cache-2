5|$|As {{part of a}} combined-force operation, the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) would {{contribute}} Ju 88As, Stukas, Messerschmitts, three light AA battalions, and three heavy AA battalions. Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine would cooperate by using U-boats to interfere with British naval movement and emplacing coastal batteries to further <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|Commander of the {{artillery}} Henry Knox persuaded Washington to transfer 400 to 500 soldiers, who lacked muskets or guns, to crew {{the artillery}}. In early June, Knox and Greene inspected the {{land at the}} north end of Manhattan and decided to establish Fort Washington. Fort Constitution, later renamed Fort Lee, was planned opposite Fort Washington on the Hudson River. The forts were hoped to <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> British ships from sailing up the Hudson River.|$|E

5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E

5|$|While {{some were}} {{executed}} quickly, others were tortured before being killed. The public torture of prisoners was a traditional ritual in many tribes of the Eastern Woodlands. Captives {{might have to}} endure excruciating torture for hours and even days. The British Indian Department used its influence to <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> killing and torturing of prisoners, with some success, but in 1782 the Indians revived the practice of ritual torture in order to exact revenge for the slaughter at Gnadenhütten.|$|E
5|$|During the {{operations}} {{along the south}} coast of New Britain the AIB officers sought to <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> Japanese from moving west of the Wide Bay area by circulating rumours among the local population that a large Australian base had been established at Jacquinot Bay. In reality no such base existed at this time. The AIB force continued to make guerilla attacks on Japanese positions until early October, when it was ordered to cease offensive operations and concentrate on intelligence gathering ahead of the landing of Australian infantry and support units at Jacquinot Bay. The AIB's operations from June to October were assisted by occasional air attacks and naval bombardments conducted by elements of the Allied air forces and navies.|$|E
5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E

5|$|In February 2001, {{the sale}} of bird seed in the square was stopped and other {{measures}} were introduced to <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> pigeons {{including the use of}} birds of prey. Supporters continued to feed the birds but in 2003 the mayor, Ken Livingstone, enacted bylaws to ban feeding them in the square. In September 2007 Westminster City Council passed further bylaws banning feeding birds on the pedestrianised North Terrace and other pavements in the area. Nelson's column was repaired from years of damage from pigeon droppings at a cost of £140,000.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks. To <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> spread of the uprising, Cass promptly invited Native Americans {{in the region to}} come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance {{that the only way to}} avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with other Native leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them to stay out of the war.|$|E

Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political arch-enemy {{to the end of}} Piłsudski's life. In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski much less than he had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, while the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.|$|E

5|$|In 1717, François-Marie Picoté de Belestre {{established}} {{the post of}} Ouiatenon (modern Lafayette, Indiana) to <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> Wea from coming under British influence. In 1732, François-Marie Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, established a similar post near the Piankeshaw in the town that still bears his name. Although the forts were garrisoned by men from New France, Fort Vincennes was the only outpost to maintain a permanent European presence until the modern day. Jesuit priests accompanied many of the French soldiers into Indiana {{in an attempt to}} convert the natives to Christianity. The Jesuits conducted missionary activities, lived among the natives and learned their languages, and accompanied them on hunts and migrations. Gabriel Marest, one of the first missionaries in Indiana, taught among the Kaskaskia as early as 1712. The missionaries came to have great influence among the natives and {{played an important role in}} keeping the native tribes allied with the French.|$|E
5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E
5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E

5|$|The NCAA {{considers}} all paid fantasy games—including daily fantasy—to {{fall under}} its prohibition of sports wagering by student athletes, punishable by ineligibility {{to participate in}} NCAA-sanctioned athletics for one year. Advertising for daily fantasy services are also forbidden from being broadcast during telecasts of the NCAA's tournaments. In August 2015, the NCAA {{and a group of}} ten conferences jointly campaigned against daily fantasy games featuring college sports, asserting that DFS is inconsistent with the NCAA's policies and values. The SEC had discussions with its broadcast partners in an attempt to <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> advertising of daily fantasy games during its telecasts, while both Big Ten Network and Pac-12 Network prohibited advertising for daily fantasy games involving college sports. On December 9, 2015, it was reported that ESPN had similarly agreed not to air advertising for daily fantasy services during telecasts of the College Football Playoff. On March 31, 2016, DraftKings and FanDuel jointly agreed to stop offering daily fantasy college sports following the conclusion of the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{advanced}} {{across the}} river and established two bridgeheads. The first was across the bridge {{on the main road}} near Khirbet Hadrah (also referred to as Khurbet Hadra) and the second was at Sheik Muanis, near the mouth of the river. These operations had two aims– to gain territory and <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Eighth Army from transferring troops into the Judean Hills to reinforce the Seventh Army. After successful actions by the New Zealand Mounted Brigade, two infantry battalions of the 54th (East Anglian) Division held these two bridgeheads on the northern bank until they were attacked by overwhelming forces on 25 November. The 3rd and 7th Divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army had driven in the bridgeheads and restored the tactical situation.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the use of anticoagulation to suppress blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Before these trials had been conducted, {{there had been a}} concern that small areas of hemorrhage in the brain would bleed further as a result of treatment; the studies showed that this concern was unfounded. Clinical practice guidelines now recommend heparin or low molecular weight heparin in the initial treatment, followed by warfarin, provided there are no other bleeding risks that would make these treatments unsuitable. Some experts <b>discourage</b> <b>the</b> use of anticoagulation if there is extensive hemorrhage; in that case, they recommend repeating the imaging after 7–10days. If the hemorrhage has decreased in size, anticoagulants are started, while no anticoagulants are given if there is no reduction.|$|E
