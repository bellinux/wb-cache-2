5|$|Hurricane Inga is {{the third}} longest-lived Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. The 11th tropical cyclone and 9th named storm of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Inga developed on September 20 in the central Atlantic and tracked westward. After attaining tropical storm status, the system deteriorated into a depression, but once again intensified several days later. The storm eventually peaked <b>in</b> <b>strength</b> on October 5, with winds corresponding to Category 3 on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Throughout its path, Inga underwent several changes in direction and oscillations <b>in</b> <b>strength,</b> before dissipating on October 15, 25 days after it formed. Despite its duration, Inga caused little damage, and mostly remained over open waters.|$|E

5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an inactive character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost <b>in</b> <b>strength</b> if they are tagged in. If the life bar of either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. If time runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E
40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: To {{examine whether}} protein intake is {{associated}} with change <b>in</b> muscle <b>strength</b> <b>in</b> older persons. Because systemic inflammation {{has been associated with}} protein catabolism, the study also evaluated whether a synergistic effect exists between protein intake and inflammatory markers on change <b>in</b> muscle <b>strength.</b> DESIGN: Longitudinal. SETTING: The Invecchiare in Chianti Study. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and ninety-eight older adults. MEASUREMENTS: Knee extension strength was measured at baseline (1998 - 2000) and during 3 -year follow-up (2001 - 2003) using a handheld dynamometer. Protein intake was assessed using a detailed food frequency questionnaire. The inflammatory markers examined were C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). RESULTS: The main effect of protein intake on change <b>in</b> muscle <b>strength</b> was not significant. However, a significant interaction was found between protein intake and CRP (P =. 003), IL- 6 (P =. 049), and TNF-α (P =. 02), indicating that lower protein intake was associated with greater decline <b>in</b> muscle <b>strength</b> <b>in</b> persons with high levels of inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: Lower protein intake was associated with decline <b>in</b> muscle <b>strength</b> <b>in</b> persons with high levels of inflammatory markers. These results may help to understand the factors contributing to decline <b>in</b> muscle <b>strength</b> with aging and to identify the target population of older persons who may benefit from nutritional interventions aimed at preventing or reducing age-associated muscle impairments and its detrimental consequence...|$|R

5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} for the right sector of the divisional defence, this meant that the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only for the left sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage.

5|$|Farther inland, Arlene {{turned to}} the west-southwest along the {{building}} ridge. The storm decreased <b>in</b> <b>strength</b> upon doing so; its mid- and low-level circulations became increasingly decoupled, with the latter turning elongated and ill-defined. Early on July1, the NHC downgraded Arlene to a tropical depression, and the cyclone dissipated over the high terrain of the Sierra Madre Mountains shortly thereafter. Arlene's remnants continued to produce heavy precipitation over central Mexico, and with high air pressures offshore a tight pressure gradient generated a strong easterly breeze along the country's Pacific coastlines.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 9th Division was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} towards Sio, further around the coast {{on the northern}} side of the Huon Peninsula.

Wootten considered that the threat posed by this force meant that Sattelberg would have to be captured before the 9th Division could undertake its advance towards Sio.|$|E
30|$|In this study, it {{was found}} that the SBS of the {{precoated}} bracket and bonding system was significantly higher than that of the conventional bracket system immediately after bonding. However, no differences <b>in</b> bond <b>strength</b> were found 24  h after bonding or after thermocycling, confirming the exponential increase <b>in</b> bond <b>strength</b> the first few minutes after treatment and a gradual increase <b>in</b> bond <b>strength</b> after the first 24  h, as previously reported by Braem et al. [19]. The ANOVA analysis, which was performed to determine any differences <b>in</b> bond <b>strength</b> within the same bracket system, demonstrated that the mean SBS of the conventional bracket system after 24  h was higher than that immediately after bonding.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after peaking <b>in</b> <b>strength,</b> Cindy {{began to}} {{interact}} with the mountains of nearby Hispaniola.

It became increasingly disorganized over land, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone on August17.
