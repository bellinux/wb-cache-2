Parameter observed were plant height (cm), number of leaves (strands), stem diameter (cm), leaf area (cm 2) and volume of plant roots (cm 3). The results showedthat giving ofcow urinehas significant effect onplant height, numberof leaves, stem diameter, leaf areaandvolume of plant roots. Givingcow urineat a concentration of 35 cc/literof water is the best concentration for all parameters tested.

Nursery activities essentially instrumental in the preparation of plant material (seeds) for planting in the field, so the breeding activities must be managed properly.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the effect of urea and cow urine application on the growth of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) in main nursery. The research used Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consist of 16 treatments with three replications. The treatment given is giving urea and cow urine with concentrations as follows: Factor I, giving urea; U 0 : 0 g urea/polybag with 10 kg of top soil, U 1 : urea 0. 91 g/polybag with 10 kg of top soil, U 2 : urea 1. 82 g/polybag with 10 kg of top soil and U 3 : urea 3. 64 g/polybag with 10 kg of top soil. Factor II, <b>giving</b> <b>cow</b> urine; K 0 : cow urine 0 cc/l of water, K 1 : cow urine 40 cc/l of water, K 2 : cow urine 45 cc/l of water and K 3 : cow urine 50 cc/l of water. Data obtained from this research were statistically analyzed by Analysis of Variance and further test DNMRT at 5 % level. Parameters observed were: plant height growth, diameter of hump growth, number of leaves gain, root volume and plant fresh weight. The results show that interactions of giving urea and cow urine significantly affect to parameters diameter of hump growth, number of leaves gain, root volume and plant fresh weight.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{tested in}} this experiment was that the structure and function of the small intestine of piglets given a milk liquid diet after weaning depends on their level of energy intake. At weaning (28 days), 42 piglets were allocated to one of five treatments: (1) control group killed at weaning; (2) piglets offered a dry starter diet ad libitum; (3) piglets <b>given</b> <b>cow's</b> fresh milk at maintenance energy intake (Ma); (4) piglets <b>given</b> <b>cow's</b> fresh milk at 2 - 5 Ma; and (5) piglets <b>given</b> <b>cow's</b> fresh milk ad libitum. On the 5 th day all piglets were killed and samples of gut were taken for histological and biochemical examination. Piglets given milk ad libitum grew faster (P < 0 · 001) than piglets on all other treatments. Piglets offered the dry starter diet ingested similar quantities of dry matter and energy, and grew {{at the same rate}} as piglets given cows' milk at 2 · 5 Ma. As predicted, piglets given milk at maintenance energy intake grew slower (P < 0 · 001) and consumed less food (P < 0 · 001) than piglets in all other treatments. For piglets given both cows' fresh milk and the dry starter diet, there were significant linear relationships (r = 0 · 72 to 0 · 82, P < 0 · 05) between villous height and crypt depth with dry matter (energy) intake after weaning. In turn, mean villous height in both milk-fed and starter-fed piglets was significantly correlated (r = 0 · 68 to 0 · 79, P < 0 · 05) to empty body-weight gain in the first 5 days after weaning. Estimates of digestive enzyme activity and absorptive capacity of the gut did not corroborate the large differences seen between treatments in villous height and crypt depth, and possible reasons are discussed. These data illustrate the interdependence between voluntary food intake and mucosal architecture in determining piglet performance after weaning...|$|R

Methodology: Descriptive cross sectional comparative study among 210 booked and 105 un-booked HIV positive women, to assess their compliance with pre-delivery infant feeding options preferred up to four months after delivery. Research instruments employed were semi structured, interviewer administered and pre tested questionnaires. Responses were analyzed using the SPSS software version 13. 0. Results: More booked women 153 (72. 9 %) preferred or selected exclusive replacement feeding as compared with un-booked women 29 (27. 6 %).
