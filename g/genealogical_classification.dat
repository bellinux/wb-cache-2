60|$|In {{confirmation}} of this view, let us {{glance at the}} classification of varieties, which are known or believed to be descended from a single species. These are grouped under the species, with the subvarieties under the varieties; and in some cases, as with the domestic pigeon, with several other grades of difference. Nearly the same rules are followed as in classifying species. Authors have insisted on the necessity of arranging varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the Swedish and common turnip together, though the esculent and thickened stems are so similar. Whatever part {{is found to be}} most constant, is used in classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less variable than the shape or colour of the body, etc.; whereas with sheep the horns are much less serviceable, because less constant. In classing varieties, I apprehend that if we had a real pedigree, a <b>genealogical</b> <b>classification</b> would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted in some cases. For we might feel sure, whether there had been more or less modification, that the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together which were allied in the greatest number of points. In tumbler pigeons, though some of the subvarieties differ in the important character of the length of the beak, yet all are kept together from having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any thought on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied in blood and alike in some other respects.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore whether {{matrices}} and MP trees used to produce systematic categories of organisms could be useful to produce categories of ideas in history of science. We study the history of the use of trees in systematics to represent the diversity of life from 1766 to 1991. We apply to those ideas a method inspired from coding homologous parts of organisms. We discretize conceptual parts of ideas, writings and drawings about trees contained in 41 main writings; we detect shared parts among authors and code them into a 91 -characters matrix and use a tree representation to show who shares what with whom. In other words, we propose a hierarchical representation of the shared ideas about trees among authors: this produces a "tree of trees. " Then, we categorize schools of tree-representations. Classical schools like "cladists" and "pheneticists" are recovered but others are not: "gradists" are separated into two blocks, one of them being called here "grade theoreticians. " We propose new interesting categories like the "buffonian school," the "metaphoricians," and those using "strictly <b>genealogical</b> <b>classifications.</b> " We consider that networks are not useful to represent shared ideas at the present step of the study. A cladogram is made for showing who is sharing what with whom, but also heterobathmy and homoplasy of characters. The present cladogram is not modelling processes of transmission of ideas about trees, and here it is mostly used to test for proximity of ideas of the same age and for categorization...|$|R
60|$|As the {{presence}} of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency {{in every part of}} the organisation, which has long existed, to be inherited--we can understand, on the <b>genealogical</b> view of <b>classification,</b> how it is that systematists have found rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high physiological importance. Rudimentary organs may be compared with the letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless in the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue in seeking for its derivation. On the view of descent with modification, we may conclude that the existence of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition, or quite aborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty, as they assuredly do on the ordinary doctrine of creation, might even have been anticipated, and can be accounted for by the laws of inheritance.|$|R
60|$|In {{confirmation}} of this view, let us {{glance at the}} classification of varieties, which are believed or known to have descended from one species. These are grouped under species, with sub-varieties under varieties; and with our domestic productions, several other grades of difference are requisite, {{as we have seen}} with pigeons. The origin of the existence of groups subordinate to groups, is the same with varieties as with species, namely, closeness of descent with various degrees of modification. Nearly the same rules are followed in classifying varieties, as with species. Authors have insisted on the necessity of classing varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the swedish and common turnips together, though the esculent and thickened stems are so similar. Whatever part is found to be most constant, is used in classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less variable than the shape or colour of the body, &c.; whereas with sheep the horns are much less serviceable, because less constant. In classing varieties, I apprehend if we had a real pedigree, a <b>genealogical</b> <b>classification</b> would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted by some authors.

In tumbler pigeons, though some sub-varieties differ from the others {424} in the important character of having a longer beak, yet all are kept together from having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any reasoning or thinking on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied in blood and alike in some other respects. If it could be proved that the Hottentot had descended from the Negro, I think he would be classed under the Negro group, however much he might differ in colour and other important characters from negroes.|$|E

60|$|Finally, as {{rudimentary}} organs, {{by whatever}} steps {{they may have}} been degraded into their present useless condition, are the record of a former state of things, and have been retained solely through the power of inheritance--we can understand, on the <b>genealogical</b> view of <b>classification,</b> how it is that systematists, in placing organisms in their proper places in the natural system, have often found rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high physiological importance. Rudimentary organs may be compared with the letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless in the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue for its derivation.

60|$|Of {{the gross}} defects in the {{execution}} of the Encyclopædia nobody was so sensible as Diderot himself. He drew up a truly formidable list of the departments where the work was badly done.[171] But when the blunders and omissions in each subject were all counted, the value of the vast grouping of the subjects was hardly diminished. The union of all these secular acquisitions in a single colossal work invested them with something imposing. Secular knowledge was made to present a massive and sumptuous front. It was pictured before the curious eyes of that generation as a great city of glittering palaces and stately mansions; or else as an immense landscape, with mountains, plains, rocks, waters, forests, animals, and a thousand objects, glorious and beautiful in the sunlight. Theology became visibly a shrivelled thing. Men grew to be conscious of the vastness of the universe. At the same time and by the same process the Encyclopædia gave them a key to the plan, a guiding thread in the immense labyrinth. The <b>genealogical</b> tree, or <b>classification</b> of arts and sciences, which with a few modifications was borrowed from Bacon and appeared {{at the end of the}} Prospectus, is seen to be faulty and inadequate. It distributes the various branches of knowledge with reference to faculties of the human understanding, instead of grouping them according to their objective relations to one another. This led to many awkward results, as when the art of printing is placed by the side of orthography as a subdivision of Logic, to which also is given the art of heraldry or emblazonment. There is awkwardness too in dividing architecture into three heads, and then placing civil architecture under national jurisprudence, and naval architecture under social jurisprudence, while under fine arts no kind of architecture has any place. But when we have multiplied these objections to the uttermost, the effect of the magnificence and vastness of the scheme remains exactly what it was.|$|R

50|$|In {{the most}} recent studies (forthcoming), Militarev has {{obtained}} an earlier date for Proto-Afrasian, namely the mid-11th millennium B.C.E., {{which is supposed to}} be more grounded, as this time his lexicostatistical and glottochronological analysis of 50 most stable words of Swadesh list was applied to many more (170) languages representing all Afrasian branches, groups and subgroups, and consistently includes the etymological background of every item whenever possible. In Militarev's scenario, Proto-Afrasian split into South Afrasian, diverging in the 9th millennium into Cushitic and Omotic (with controversial Ongota a separate sub-branch of the latter) and North Afrasian splitting also in the 9th millennium into Semitic and North African Afrasian falling in the early 7th millennium into Egyptian and Chadic-Berber diverging into Chadic and Berber-Canarian in the late 6th millennium. His updated analysis of 100-word standard Swadesh list (in print) applied to 30 Semitic languages mainly corroborated his previous unorthodox <b>genealogical</b> <b>classification</b> according to which Proto-Semitic split between 4,800-4,700 B.C.E. into South Semitic (represented by Modern South Arabian) and North Semitic falling about a thousand years later into Akkadian and West Semitic branching in early 3rd millennium B.C.E. into Proto-Ethiopian (dividing on the verge of 2nd and 1st millennia B.C.E. into North and South Ethiopian), Proto-Arabic, and Proto-Levantine falling between 2,400 and 2,300 B.C.E. into Ugaritic and South Levantine branching on the verge of 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C.E. into Aramaic, Epigraphic South Arabian (represented in the analysis by Sabaic) and Canaanite represented by Hebrew and Phoenician separated between 15th and 14th centuries B.C.E.

(African Languages) Africa {{encompasses}} such {{a variety}} of languages and language types that even today linguistic science is somewhat {{at a loss to}} describe the mutual relationships between all these languages. This study is concerned with the Sotho group of Bantu languages. The existing classifications of the Sotho group are examined with regard to the classification criteria employed and how consistently and correctly these have been applied. A critical consideration of these classifications brings to light a considerable number of problems which show the classifications to be inadequate. The conclusion is drawn that the various criteria need to be reconsidered and that the requirements for a well-founded, ideal classification of Sotho should be clearly spelled out. Three basic approaches to the problem are dealt with, namely: a purely synchronic linguistic. classification, a <b>genealogical</b> <b>classification</b> based on diachronic principles, and a sociolinguistic classification. In each case the applicability to Sotho of the method concerned, given the present state of knowledge, is evaluated. As regards a synchronic linguistic classification, it is shown that clarity is needed. concerning crucial terms such as "language" and "dialect"; that a hierarchy of criteria has to be determined; that mutual influences and the influences of non-related languages should be allowed for; and that different degrees of relatedness should be accounted for.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the gender system of Ɓə́ná-Yungur (glottocode: bena 1260), distinguishing noun classes proper, defined as agreement classes, from morphological classes, defined in terms of number marking on nouns.

All logically possible singular-plural pairings are attested, except one. Morphological classes are much more numerous than noun classes and they show a high degree of singular-plural polarity. We argue that many of the morphological class markers are historically stacked, and therefore that their high number does not reflect a complex proto-system.

40|$|Linguists {{have been}} {{responding}} to the sharp {{decline in the number}} of languages for fifteen years and more now. While individual languages have unique features, language families, by virtue of their shared heritage, often share typologically rare features. The endangerment of entire families, implicit in language loss, has not been explored to date. Here, we use population estimates as an indicator of endangerment of families. Historically, some languages have, seemingly, survived for centuries with only a few thousand speakers. Conversely, a language with a million speakers is endangered if the youngest is 50 years old. The isolation that fostered small languages is an increasingly rare commodity, so small languages are likelier than ever to be endangered. Gordon (2005) reports that 10 % of languages have 300, 000 or more speakers; Krauss's (1992 : 7) prediction that this century would "see either the death or the doom of 90 % of mankind's languages" would lead us to expect that languages smaller than this would be at risk. More conservative estimates call for a 50 % loss (e. g., Crystal 2000 : 19). There, language families whose largest language has fewer than 7, 000 speakers (the median number of speakers; Gordon 2005 : 15) would be at risk. Using Gordon's (2005) 94 language families, about three-quarters of the world's language families can be classified as endangered. 40 % of those language families have their most populous language spoken by fewer than 7, 000 speakers; another 33 % fall below 300, 000 in population. We plan a further analysis using Balthasar and Nichols' (2008) approximately 350 "stocks" (that is, families whose relations can be firmly established by the comparative method). The proportion of endangerment can only increase in those statistics: If we split a family into two stocks, one is bound to have a smaller language as its most populous. Some aspects of language unique to those disappearing families are outlined. Examples are the existence of OVS default word order, elaborated click inventories, grammatical metathesis and obligatory use of evidentials. Renewed efforts at documenting members of those language families seem justified. References BICKEL, BALTHASAR, AND JOHANNA NICHOLS. 2008.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{covers the}} experimentation of quantitative algorithmic {{procedures for the}} study of language evolution. In particular, the inquiry is based on the application of quantitative methods originally designed within molecular biology and population genetics to a parametric comparative dataset: The goal is to infer hypotheses regarding genealogical relationships between a specific set of languages, accounting for the role of areal convergence in linguistic variation, and to evaluate them in light of the traditional accounts provided by historical linguistics. The first focus is on the comparison between language evolution and biological evolution. The idea is that some important features of language development may also be identified drawing a parallel with the biological domain. On the whole, this analysis seems to show that language evolution and biological evolution are considerably different in some respects, but that the dissimilarities do not prevent the application of quantitative reconstruction procedures. Then most recent generative views on syntactic change are taken into consideration, showing that they are perfectly compatible with the evolutionary account outlined. To this end, basic notions regarding the cognitive-biolinguistic and the formal aspects of generative grammar are illustrated and, once the parametric perspective on synchronic language variation is clarified, the discussion is dedicated to the extension of the parametric approach to the explanation of diachronic phenomena, including genealogical development and contact. The successive step is the presentation of diverse methods of comparison adopted in historical linguistics and population genetics and, in particular, of the “Parametric comparison method”: The parallel between the latter and the procedures of investigation used in molecular biology paves the way to the introduction of the relevant quantitative techniques of phylogenetic reconstruction. After having outlined the overview of the principal datasets used so far to perform quantitative investigations on the history of languages, the parametric dataset is presented and overview of “traditional” and quantitative-based proposals regarding the <b>genealogical</b> <b>classification</b> of the languages included in the investigation is provided. The last section of the work covers the illustration of the quantitative analyses carried out. The preliminary character-based and distance-based review of the dataset is followed by the discussion on the choice of the phylogenetic methods adopted. Then the first outfit of phylogenies reconstructions on the full dataset is offered and commented on in detail. The successive focus is on possible strategies to account for homoplasy (i. e. chance and borrowing) : An empirically-based selection of parameters and suggestions regarding the way in which parameters might be weighted according to their genealogical relevance are proposed. Finally, some tentative analyses concerning the possibility of detecting and accounting for borrowing in phylogenetic trees, the reconstruction of ancestral states and the mapping of syntactic distances onto the diachronic and the diatopic dimensions of variation are introduced. On the whole, the quantitative analyses appear to provide good indications of diverse facts: That phylogenetic techniques are to a large extent effectively applicable to the study of syntactic evolution, that the parametric comparison may successfully help shedding light on both short- and long-range genealogical relationships, and that traces of proper genealogical relatedness are likely to be preserved (and to be recoverable despite homoplasy) at the level of “macro-comparison”, like that instantiated in the parametric data...|$|E
