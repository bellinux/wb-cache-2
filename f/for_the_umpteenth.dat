Bruce Fancher was suddenly part {{of two or three}} other start-ups, system repairs that should have taken hours, dragged on for weeks.

500|$|Todd Martens {{from the}} Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Celebration" [...] {{works as a}} throwaway, midsummer dance pop number. However, {{he felt that the}} song had modest goals, [...] "at least by Madonna's standards. Even when it gets a bit risque [...] silliness rules the day. She invites us 'to the dance of life,' and coasts over the chorus." [...] He went on to add that the song [...] "is an {{effective}} look back, a gliding, reassuring number that she [...] hasn't forgotten her beginning. But rather than instill a sense of nostalgia, everything feels a bit obligatory. The sound of an artist, hopefully, ready for the next chapter." [...] Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "unapologetically dance-y" [...] but felt [...] "disappointed that lyrically, Madonna seems to be revisiting the 'Party! Get on the floor!' theme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>umpteenth</b> time without even the slightest bit of linguistic flair." [...] Chris Williams from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's latest single won't start any new trends, but it does return the singer to her dance-floor roots." [...] It further added that [...] "'Celebration' [...] a score for Madonna's retro-futuristic fan base and a nice bookend to her collection of chart glories." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{was one of}} {{the opening}} acts on Britney Spears' June 16 – August 13 Femme Fatale Tour. She and Kesha {{appeared}} on the remix of Spears' [...] "Till the World Ends", which peaked at number-three on the Billboard Hot 100. On August 7, 2011, Nicki experienced a [...] "nip slip" [...] during a live performance on Good Morning America. Minaj was criticized for wearing the low-cut shirt during her performance which led to the brief exposure of her breast on a live telecast. ABC apologized for incident. Minaj, while interviewed on ABC's Nightline show, apologized for the incident and denied that she intentionally sought to expose herself on live television as a publicity stunt. The incident soaked protest from the Parents Television Council. President of the PTC president Tim Winter stated, [...] "the Parents Television Council has something to say about Nicki Minaj's wardrobe malfunction this morning. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>umpteenth</b> time in recent memory a morning news show has included inappropriate content for children and families." [...] Winter called out Good Morning America for not using the five-second delay to prevent the broadcast of the exposure. Minaj has been invited to perform at fashion events; Donatella Versace invited her to perform with Prince for the introduction of a Versace collection for H, and she performed [...] "Super Bass" [...] at the 2011 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.|$|E

Hazard, Jr. Or as {{he calls}} himself, when he answers his phone, simply 2 ̆ 2 Hazard. 2 ̆ 2 His name, like his personality, connotes danger, taking a chance, boldness {{in the face of}} risk. Meeting or talking to him, whether <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first or <b>umpteenth</b> time, always feels a bit intimidating and hazardous. Intimidating because he is so accomplished, quick, and deep. Hazardous because it is so likely you might get {{something}} just slightly wrong, only to be gently but firmly set straight by one of the most knowledgeable lawyers, legal scholars, and law reformers of our time...|$|R

2500|$|During the {{following}} seven-match ODI series, Strauss's contributions led England's batting {{to the extent}} that, following the series, Andrew Miller commented on [...] "England's guileless middle-order who, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>umpteenth</b> time this summer, treated the loss of Andrew Strauss's wicket with the same grief and disorientation that a clutch of baby chicks might greet the devouring of their mother by a fox."

2500|$|In {{the palace}} courtyard, {{the common people}} fear {{the arrival of the}} Moors (Scene 1), and the king tries to reassure them, {{inviting}} them to seek refuge in the palace. Suddenly, unexpected shouts of victory are heard (Scene 2). A herald enters and describes in detail the total defeat of the Moors, leading behind him a band of captive enemies, including two kings (Scene 3). When the King of Castile asks who is responsible, an officer tells him that Don Diegue wants to lead the victor into his presence in person. The king realises that it is Rodrigue, who is hailed as a saviour by everyone present (Scene 4). Rodrigue is then introduced by his father and welcomed into the arms of the king. Rodrigue says that, driven to despair by the tragedy that has divided him from Chimène, he had sought an honourable death in battle. The king tries to console him, suggesting that Chimene – who is still in love with him – might have second thoughts about her revenge, given the valour her beloved has just shown. The scene ends in choruses and dances of victory, during which Rodrigue is proclaimed [...] "El Cid" [...] (Scene 5). As the celebrations end, Chimène reappears. Having learned of Rodrigue's exploits, she fears she will now fail to achieve her revenge. In fact, the king wants to declare Rodrigue above the law, but the other knights are opposed, offering to take up the challenge on her behalf against the [...] "Cid" [...] in a trial by combat. It is also opposed by Don Diegue, who, in the name of honour, urges his son to fight <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>umpteenth</b> time. The king yields to the majority opinion and allows Chimène to accept the offer of Don Sanche, another knight who is in love with her, to represent her in combat. To Chimène's consternation, the king nevertheless sets one condition: she must accept the hand of the victor in marriage (Scene 7). The common people, left alone, sing a chorus of support for the [...] "Cid" [...] (Scene 8).|$|E

Thus, we will prioritize the interpretation of the protagonist and the city as <b>the</b> <b>umpteenth</b> postmodern re-reading of the Odyssey, in the journey of initiation of a Homeric character à la recherche of his lost Ithaca, Istanbul. The portrayal of the central character is completed with a sketch of the intertextual richness of the novel, and the vision of the Turkish capital is framed within the postmodern representation of the city, under a complex perspective that steers clear of the typical nineteenth-century exoticism. ...|$|R
5000|$|Dante, Brezner and Finnell {{agreed that}} Tom Hanks {{would be the}} most {{suitable}} actor to portray the harried Ray Peterson, a conservative man who tries to introduce excitement into his life by investigating the activities of his strange neighbors.

40|$|The current {{format of}} the OPCW {{proficiency}} tests has multiple sets of 2 samples sent to an analysis laboratory. In each sample set, one is identified as a sample, the other as a blank. This method of conducting proficiency tests differs from how an OPCW designated laboratory would receive authentic samples (a set of three containers, each not identified, consisting of the authentic sample, a control sample, and a blank sample). This exercise was designed to test the reporting if the proficiency tests were to be conducted. As such, {{this is not an}} official OPCW proficiency test, and the attached report is one method by which LLNL might report their analyses under a more realistic testing scheme. Therefore, the title on the report ''Report of <b>the</b> <b>Umpteenth</b> Official OPCW Proficiency Test'' is meaningless, and provides a bit of whimsy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> analyses and readers of the report...|$|R

5000|$|Writing in UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian in November 2014, Gould said, [...] "My own career {{is a fairly}} equal division between solo work and orchestral leading (with Aurora and Britten Sinfonia), with as much jazz and chamber music as time allows. I love the balance. I get to play pretty much <b>the</b> entire repertoire <b>for</b> <b>the</b> instrument, from Beethoven trios to Mahler symphonies to recording with Radiohead. I’m constantly playing new repertoire and working with new colleagues. Thats an enormous privilege.
