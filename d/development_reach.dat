40|$|To {{ensure that}} the {{benefits}} of economic <b>development</b> <b>reach</b> the African poor, action on income redistribution is necessary. In the mid- 1990 's, international aid funding was refocused from higher education into areas thought to be more directly compatible with the emergent poverty reduction priority. Recent ‘rehabilitation’ of higher education is exemplified by the report of the Commission for Africa, which asked the international community to commit US $ 5 billion to revitalise Africa's institutions of higher education with a view to developing professional elites as the basis for global competitiveness and good government. Universities can make direct contributions to poverty reduction but not as a consequence of their traditional activities. Such contributions can be achieved through technology management projects whose benefits are directly relevant to the income of poor communities. An example of such a project is described involving the development of export trading for garment manufacturing micro-enterprises. Resolving issues relating to design, standardisation and quality control and scaling up has enabled the development of export markets, which directly connect the spending power of affluent European populations with poor communities in Ghana...|$|E
40|$|Immunological {{competence}} {{is known to}} vary with age, and such age-related variations are often parabolic in nature. For example, both the level and avidity of the antibody response increase during postnatal <b>development,</b> <b>reach</b> a maximum in adulthood, and then decline during senescence (1). Cellular changes in the T lymphocyte compartment (both helper and suppressor T cell levels) appear to account for most variations in immunological competence (1, 2). Relatively few studies have attempted to correlate these functional changes with variations in the levels and nature of molecules expressed by immunocompetent lymphocytes. A study has therefore been undertaken to evaluate the glycosylation status of IgG during {{the natural history of}} human life. Human serum IgG has been reported to carry at least 30 different N-linked oligosaccharides, all of which are of the biantennary complex type, and most of which (> 95 %) carry N-acetylglucosamine in both outer arms (3, 4). Structural differences between these arise primarily from core-substitutions (i. e., fucose and the `bisecting ' G 1 cNAc), outer-arm galactosylation, and sialylation (Fig. 1 a). We have previously reported that the percentage incidence of agalactosyl structure...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: There is {{an urgent}} need for more {{effective}} and efficient depression treatments in diabetes.

Here, {{we report on the}} <b>development,</b> <b>reach,</b> patients' reasons for choosing our intervention and their characteristics. Methods: The CWD programme was amended for use in diabetes patients with co-morbid depression. Data were collected using a telephone interview, self-report questionnaires, and medical records. Results: Adding diabetes-specific topics to an effective web-based depression programme resulted in an 8 -lesson intervention (" www. diabetergestemd. nl"), with minimal guidance by coaches. In the framework of a randomised trial, the intervention attracted serious interest of 540 patients. After screening, 255 depressed diabetes patients were enrolled. Less than half had a history of depression treatment; 80 % reported the diabetes-specific approach to be an important reason for signing up. Conclusion: We successfully developed a diabetes-specific version of the web-based CWD course, which attracted a large group of patients. Our results affirm the importance of addressing diabetes-specific issues in the context of depression treatment. Practice implications: Our intervention could be implemented on a large scale at low costs, and may serve as a model on how to develop other illness-specific online self-help interventions. © 2010...|$|E

40|$|The {{later time}} phase of {{electrical}} breakdown in water is investigated {{for the purpose}} of improving understanding of the discharge characteristics. One dimensional simulations in addition to a zero dimensional lumped model are used to study the spark discharge. The goal is to provide better electrical models for water switches used in the pulse compression section of pulsed power systems. It is found that temperatures in the discharge channel under representative drive conditions, and assuming small initial radii from earlier phases of <b>development,</b> <b>reach</b> levels that are as much as an order of magnitude larger than those used to model discharges in atmospheric gases. This increased temperature coupled with a more rapidly rising conductivity with temperature than in air result in a decreased resistance characteristic compared to preceding models. A simple modification is proposed for the existing model to enable the approximate calculation of channel temperature and incorporate the resulting conductivity increase into the electrical circuit for the discharge channel. Comparisons are made between the theoretical predictions and recent experiments at Sandia. Although present and past experiments indicated that preceding late time channel models overestimated channel resistance, the calculations in this report seem to underestimate the resistance relative to recent experiments. Some possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} {{conducted}} as a thesis for a bachelor's {{degree in the}} program of Experience Production at Luleå University of Technology. The study involves destination development, Strategy 2020 and the intangible values in experience production. Strategy 2020 is developed by Svensk Turism AB {{as a basis for}} destinations to work with. The background to the study is based on the experience society and the experience economy. We have identified that people in the experience society today requires more than the basic needs and material values meanwhile the competition for destinations increases with globalization and urbanization. It is thus necessary to identify the destinations’ unique offerings by intangible values that add meaning to people's lives and satisfies their needs. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate whether the Swedish tourism industry can benefit from intangible values in order to in the purpose of destination <b>development</b> <b>reach</b> Strategy 2020. We have responded to the study's research questions by a qualitative research study that is made with a positivistic and deductive approach. We have through a selection of theories arrived at our results, featuring six experience production theories all of which concern the intangible values. Each of the theories have been analyzed where the results show that five of the theories could be applied to the theory The Six Senses. These theories along with the general concepts of tourism and destination development go, stay, eat and do have been shaped as a tool for actors within destination development. We thereby recognize that destination development can benefit from intangible values. Validerat; 20130626 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{embedding}} {{technology has evolved}} from a research subject to a hot topic in packaging industry. It provides outstanding features regarding miniaturization, electrical performance of interconnects and reliability. Today the concept of embedding has been adopted by Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturers, semiconductor houses and packaging services (OSATs). A variety of products is in manufacturing like chip packages and System-in-Packages (SiP) for power applications. Power electronics packaging applications have a strong demand regarding reliability and cost. The fields of <b>development</b> <b>reach</b> from low power converter modules, over single or multichip MOSFET or IGBT packages, up to high power applications, like needed e. g. for power inverters and automotive applications. For high power automotive applications, recent developments toward module realization will be described in detail. These developments will cover the screening and use of organic substrate materials for embedding and thermal management as well as interconnection materials for die, module and heat sink assembly. Here a strong focus is on newly developed low temperature low pressure Ag sinter materials. The continuous optimization of this process, as well as analytical results will be presented. The potential of the embedding technology for such an application will be discussed by the example of current and coming research activities. For upcoming hybrid cars and fully electrical vehicles automotive OEM and supplier together with research centres are currently developing a power converter for upper class hybrid cars. It contains embedded 200 A IGBTs and diodes and aims for 50 kW switching power. The current status regarding realization of first 10 kW switching power modules will be explained.

40|$|Primary {{spermatocyte}} nuclei {{of fixed}} testes of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit three large clusters of thread-like structures, each {{consisting of two}} long, continuous, loop-shaped filaments. No comparable intranuclear structures are observed in spermatogonia, secondary spermatocytes or spermatids. The threads begin to form in young spermatocytes, grow throughout spermatocyte <b>development,</b> <b>reach</b> their maximum size in mature spermatocytes and disintegrate prior to meiotic metaphase I. The presence of each cluster of threads depends upon {{the presence of a}} specific region of the Y chromosome; when this region is deleted the cluster is absent, and when it is duplicated the cluster is also duplicated. Together these observations strongly suggest that these structures represent giant Y chromosome lampbrush-like loops analogous to those described in Drosophila hydei. Two antibodies, one polyclonal and one monoclonal, differentially react with the three loops of D. melanogaster. Moreover, two of these loops are specifically stained by Giemsa at pH 10. By indirect immunofluorescence with these antibodies followed by Giemsa staining, each loop can be unambiguously identified and its presence and normality readily assessed. This enabled us to perform fine mapping experiments to determine the relationships between the Y chromosome fertility factors and the loops. The loop-forming sites map within the kl- 5, kl- 3 and ks- 1 fertility factors. Regions h 3 and h 21 of the Y chromosome correspond to the loop-forming sites of kl- 5 and ks- 1, respectively. Each of these regions contains about 1300 kb of DNA and spans about one-third of its locus. The loop-forming site of the kl- 3 locus is coextensive with region h 7 -h 9 which contains about 4300 kb of DNA and corresponds to the minimum physical size of this locus. These data suggest that each loop {{is an integral part of}} a different fertility factor, representing the cytological manifestation of its activity in primary spermatocytes. The kl- 2, kl- 1 and ks- 2 fertility regions do not produce any visible intranuclear structure and do not affect the kl- 5, kl- 3 and ks- 1 loops. Thus, these loci may either not form loops at all or produce loop-like structures that we are unable to see because they are physically minute, destroyed by our fixation procedure, or both...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a number}} of specific efforts by the United Nations to offer and administer development aid to newly independent and ‘underdeveloped’ countries from the Global South during the decades following World War Two. Broadly, this thesis casts light on the competitive nature of postwar international development. In doing so, it examines development as a contest, whereby, the United Nations sought to stake out a claim to {{its share of the}} global development process during the 1950 s and early 1960 s. Crucially, this thesis sets this struggle {{against the backdrop of the}} increasing demand for development aid that accompanied the advent of mass decolonization in Africa by 1960. Consequently, this gave rise to a heightened competition over what type of aid best suited newly independent countries and who should administer it. Here, this study demonstrates how the UN contended with both bilateral and multilateral aid options outside the Organization, as well as, the challenges associated with providing development aid to countries that requested noncolonial assistance yet jealously guarded their newly acquired sovereignty. Finally, it was through the UN’s belief in its development directive, its unique ‘brand’ of aid and the value of its operational pursuits that it added a crucial dimension to the development discourse of the period. At the UN, this resulted in the expansion of the UN’s <b>development</b> <b>reach</b> and development becoming a primary, if not the chief focus of the Organization during the First UN Development Decade of the 1960 s. At the same time, it was during the postwar decades that the Organization helped to give development a global quality through a concerted effort towards the internationalization of development aid. Altogether, this thesis extends the boundaries of the study of postwar development by demonstrating how the UN functioned as an important autonomous institution and actor as it promoted economic and social development through multilateral development aid. Furthermore, this study challenges traditional interpretations of the UN that depict the Organization as solely a foreign policy tool of its member states or as an Organization predominantly concerned with peace and security issues during this era...|$|E
