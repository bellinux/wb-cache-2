5|$|Edgar Murray finds Threni less {{expressive}} {{than the}} Krenek, {{and more like}} the Lamentationes of Thomas Tallis. Stravinsky, however, while acknowledging that he <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> the Tallis settings and works by William Byrd and Palestrina, {{did not believe that}} they had influenced his music.|$|E
5|$|As Threni was {{intended}} for concert rather than liturgical use, Stravinsky chose the text freely from the early chapters of the Book of Lamentations. It has three movements: the large central movement is surrounded by two much shorter ones. Ernst Krenek composed a setting of the Lamentations in 1942, and Stravinsky acknowledged {{that it might have}} influenced him. He considered it less likely that works by Renaissance composers, including Tallis, Byrd and Palestrina, had influenced him, although he <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> such music.|$|E
5|$|As most of {{the songs}} are {{in the form of}} Ovee, Ranade decided to use the {{traditional}} musical format. He took help of Sarojini Babar, a Marathi writer-politician who <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> the songs of the period depicted in the film. Babar introduced Ranade to her sister, Kumud Pawar, who have made a collection of various traditional Ovee. For two situation songs, Ranade requested Kishor Kadam to write the lyrics.|$|E

5|$|By age sixteen, Sampson was {{teaching}} at Indian Creek School in Laurel County. He attended Union College in Barbourville, then enrolled at Valparaiso University. He was class president for three years, and earned an A.B. in 1894. Per university policy, {{he was also}} awarded and an LL.B. because, prior to graduation, he <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> {{for at least one}} year in a law office. He returned to Kentucky and was admitted to the bar in June 1895.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{returned}} to Somerset in 1903. There, he married Katherine Hale Waddle on June 18, 1903.

5|$|Pound {{was fascinated}} by the {{translations}} of Japanese poetry and Noh plays which he discovered in the papers of Ernest Fenollosa, an American professor who had taught in Japan. Fenollosa <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars; in 1913 his widow, Mary McNeil Fenollosa, decided to give his unpublished notes to Pound after seeing his work; she was looking for someone who cared about poetry rather than philology. Pound edited and published Fenellosa's The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry in 1918.|$|E

5|$|Weizmann's {{political}} efforts {{picked up}} speed, and on 10December 1914 {{he met with}} Herbert Samuel, a British Cabinet member and a secular Jew who <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> Zionism; Samuel believed Weizmann's demands were too modest. Two days later, Weizmann met Balfour again, {{for the first time}} since their initial meeting in 1905; Balfour had been out of government ever since his electoral defeat in 1906, but remained a senior member of the Conservative Party in their role as Official Opposition.|$|E
5|$|After briefly reading {{law with}} former New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury, a family friend, in Portsmouth, {{he spent a}} {{semester}} at Northampton Law School in Northampton, Massachusetts, followed by a period of study in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst, New Hampshire. He {{was admitted to the}} New Hampshire bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. Pierce lost his first case, but soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces served him well, as did his personal charm and deep voice. In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Barringer, Berg {{enrolled}} in New York University. He spent two semesters there and played baseball and basketball. In 1919 {{he transferred to}} Princeton University and never again mentioned that he had attended NYU for a year, presenting himself exclusively as a Princeton man. Berg received a B.A., magna cum laude in modern languages. He <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> seven languages: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Sanskrit, studying with the philologist Harold H. Bender. His Jewish heritage and modest finances combined to keep him {{on the fringes of}} Princeton society, where he never quite fit in.|$|E

5|$|After the {{kick-off}} {{there was}} soon a scrum ordered The All Blacks were repeatedly penalised by the referee whenever {{they had a}} scrum. The reason for this was the All Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation where they had only two front-rowers. The Welsh team used a three-man front row, and <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> the All Blacks scrummaging technique. The Welsh countered the All Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation by setting their front row after the All Blacks, and hence preventing the All Blacks from gaining the loosehead. Consequently, every time the All Blacks tried to hook the ball they were penalised, and this prompted their captain Gallaher to order his team not to contest the scrums, and to instead let the Welsh win the ball.|$|E
5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch. He <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> geometry thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised {{the virtues of the}} catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of suspension bridges. Gaudí was the first to use this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E
5|$|Before World War II, J. Robert Oppenheimer {{had been}} {{professor}} of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. The scion of a wealthy New York family, he was a graduate of Harvard University, and <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> in Europe at the University of Cambridge in England, the University of Göttingen in Germany (where he had earned his doctorate in physics under the supervision of Max Born at the age of 23), and the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. As one of the few American physicists with a deep understanding of the new field of quantum mechanics, he was hired by the University of California in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Câmpineanu, who had {{proposed}} a reformist constitution {{to replace the}} Regulament entirely, was forced into exile, but remained an influence on a younger generation of activists, both Wallachian and Moldavian. The latter group, comprising many young boyars who <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> in France, also took direct inspiration from reformist or revolutionary-minded societies such as the Carbonari (and even, through Teodor Diamant, from Utopian socialism). It was this faction who would first explicitly publicize the demands for national independence and Moldo-Wallachian unification, which it included in a wider agenda of political reforms and European solidarity. Societatea Studenților Români (the Society of Romanian Students) was founded in 1846, having the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine for its honorary president.|$|E
5|$|Deodato also hired Perry Pirkanen {{and another}} actor from the Actors Studio to play Jack Anders and Alan Yates, respectively. The latter dropped out {{shortly before the}} {{production}} team left for the Amazon, although he appears in the film as an ex-colleague of Yates. Casting director Bill Williams subsequently chose Carl Gabriel Yorke to replace him for the role. Yorke, a stage actor who <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> under Uta Hagen and appeared in three national tours of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, was chosen {{in part because he}} was the right size for the costumes and boots, which had already been purchased. Because Cannibal Holocaust was a non-Union production, Yorke originally wanted to be credited under the alias Christopher Savage, but ultimately decided against doing so.|$|E
30|$|There {{have been}} some works on limit theorems for tree-indexed {{stochastic}} process. Benjamini and Peres [3] have given {{the notion of the}} tree-indexed Markov chains and studied the recurrence and ray-recurrence for them. Berger and Ye [4] <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> the existence of entropy rate for some stationary random fields on a homogeneous tree. Pemantle [5] proved a mixing property and a weak law of large numbers for a PPG-invariant and ergodic random field on a homogeneous tree. Ye and Berger [6, 7], by using Pemantle's result and a combinatorial approach, <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> the Shannon-McMillan theorem with convergence in probability for a PPG-invariant and ergodic random field on a homogeneous tree. Yang and Liu [8] <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> a strong law of large numbers for the frequency of occurrence of states for Markov chains field on a Bethe tree (a particular case of tree-indexed Markov chains field and PPG-invariant random field). Yang [9] <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> the strong law of large numbers for frequency of occurrence of state and Shannon-McMillan theorem for homogeneous Markov chains indexed by a homogeneous tree. Yang and Ye [10] <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> the strong law of large numbers and Shannon-McMillan theorem for nonhomogeneous Markov chains indexed by a homogeneous tree. Huang and Yang [11] <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> the strong law of large numbers and Shannon-McMillan theorem for Markov chains indexed by an infinite tree with uniformly bounded degree. Recently, Shi and Yang [12] <b>have</b> also <b>studied</b> some limit properties of random transition probability for second-order nonhomogeneous Markov chains indexed by a tree. Peng et al.
