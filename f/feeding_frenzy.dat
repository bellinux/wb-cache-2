5|$|Groups often {{form when}} {{individuals}} converge on a food source, whereupon a <b>feeding</b> <b>frenzy</b> may occur. This {{seems to be}} triggered not by blood in the water or by bloodlust, but by the species' highly strung and goal-directed nature (conserving energy between infrequent feeding opportunities {{when it is not}} slowly plying the open ocean). The oceanic whitetip is a competitive, opportunistic predator that exploits the resource at hand, rather than avoiding trouble in favour of a possibly easier future meal.|$|E
5|$|Following his birth, Nemo {{develops}} a smaller right fin due to {{damage to his}} egg, which limits his swimming ability. Worried about Nemo's safety, Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip. Nemo disobeys his father and sneaks away from the reef towards a boat, and is captured by scuba divers. As the boat departs, a diver accidentally knocks his diving mask overboard. While attempting to save Nemo, Marlin meets Dory, a good-hearted and optimistic regal blue tang with short-term memory loss. Marlin and Dory meet three Australian sharks– Bruce, Anchor and Chum– who claim to be vegetarians. Marlin discovers the diver's mask and notices an address written on it. When he argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the blood causes Bruce to lose control of himself and enter a violent <b>feeding</b> <b>frenzy.</b> The pair escape from Bruce, but the mask falls into a trench in the deep sea.|$|E
5|$|Whitetip reef sharks hunt {{primarily}} at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, groups of sharks methodically scour the reef, often breaking off pieces of coral in their vigorous pursuit of prey. Multiple sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route {{from a particular}} coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. Unlike blacktip reef sharks and grey reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks do not become more excited when feeding in groups and {{are unlikely to be}} stirred into a <b>feeding</b> <b>frenzy.</b> Despite their nocturnal habits, whitetip reef sharks will hunt opportunistically in daytime. Off Borneo, this species gathers around reef drop-offs to feed on food brought up by the rising current. Off Hawaii, they follow Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi) and attempt to steal their catches. A whitetip reef shark can survive for six weeks without food.|$|E

25|$|Sardines {{have a short}} life-cycle, living {{only two}} or three years. Adult sardines, about two years old, mass on the Agulhas Bank where they spawn during spring and summer, {{releasing}} tens of thousands of eggs into the water. The adult sardines then make their way in hundreds of shoals towards the sub-tropical waters of the Indian Ocean. A larger shoal might be 7 kilometres (4mi) long, 1.5 kilometres (1mi) wide and 30 meters (100ft) deep. Huge numbers of sharks, dolphins, tuna, sailfish, Cape fur seals and even killer whales congregate and follow the shoals, creating a <b>feeding</b> <b>frenzy</b> along the coastline.|$|E
25|$|Most years, off {{southern}} Africa between May and July, {{billions of}} sardines (specifically the Southern African pilchard Sardinops sagax) spawn {{in the cool}} waters of the Agulhas Bank and move northward along {{the east coast of}} South Africa. This great fish migration is called the sardine run. Their sheer numbers create a <b>feeding</b> <b>frenzy</b> along the coastline. The run, containing millions of individual sardines, occurs when a current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to Mozambique where it then leaves the coastline and goes further east into the Indian Ocean. During the sardine run, as many as 18,000 dolphins, behaving like sheepdogs, herd the sardines into bait balls, or corral them in shallow water. Once rounded up, the dolphins and other predators take turns ploughing through the bait balls, gorging on the fish as they sweep through. Seabirds also attack them from above, flocks of gannets, cormorants, terns and gulls. The sardine run is featured in the first episode of the 2001 BBC nature documentary The Blue Planet and in the 2008 3D IMAX documentary film Wild Ocean.|$|E

25|$|Teeth and {{a number}} of skeletons {{belonging}} to the bird-like carnivorous theropod Deinonychus have often been discovered associated with Tenontosaurus tilletti remains. Tenontosaurus specimens have been found at over 50 sites, and 14 of those also contain Deinonychus remains. According to one 1995 study, only six sites containing Deinonychus fossils contain no trace of Tenontosaurus, and Deinonychus remains are only rarely found associated with other potential prey, like Sauropelta. In all, 20% of Tenontosaurus fossils are found in close proximity to Deinonychus, and several scientists have suggested that this implies Deinonychus was the major predator of Tenontosaurus. Adult Deinonychus, however, were much smaller than adult Tenontosaurus, and it is unlikely a single Deinonychus would have been capable of attacking a fully grown Tenontosaurus. While some scientists have suggested that Deinonychus must therefore have been a pack hunter, this view has been challenged based on both lack of evidence for coordinated hunting (rather than mobbing behavior as in most modern birds and reptiles) as well as evidence that Deinonychus may have been cannibalizing each other, as well as the Tenontosaurus, in a <b>feeding</b> <b>frenzy.</b> It is likely that Deinonychus favored juvenile Tenontosaurus, and that when Tenontosaurus reached a certain size, it passed out of range as a food source for the small theropods, though they may have scavenged larger individuals. The fact that most Tenontosaurus remains found with Deinonychus are half-grown individuals supports this view. It also lived in the same area as the large carnivorous dinosaur Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet.

They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken.

500|$|Inquisitive and persistent, the Galapagos shark is {{regarded}} as potentially dangerous to humans. However, several live-aboard boats take divers to Wolf and Darwin, the northernmost Galapagos islands, every week specifically to dive in open water with these sharks where they and the scalloped hammerheads accumulate in numbers, and no incidents have been reported.

2500|$|Most krill, small shrimp-like crustaceans, form large swarms, {{sometimes}} reaching {{densities of}} 10,000–60,000 individual animals per cubic metre. Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller predators {{that would like}} to pick out single individuals. The largest swarms are visible from space and can be tracked by satellite. One swarm was observed to cover an area of 450 square kilometers (175 square miles) of ocean, to a depth of 200 meters (650 feet) and was estimated to contain over 2 million tons of krill. Recent research suggests that krill do not simply drift passively in these currents but actually modify them. Krill typically follow a diurnal vertical migration. By moving vertically through the ocean on a 12-hour cycle, the swarms play a major part in mixing deeper, nutrient-rich water with nutrient-poor water at the surface. Until recently it has been assumed that they spend the day at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. It has been found that the deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Later work suggested that swimming activity in krill varied with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefor sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce faeces which may mean that they have an important role to play in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs were found to swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. This implies that vertical migration may be a bi- or tri-daily occurrence. Some species form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators. Dense swarms may elicit a <b>feeding</b> <b>frenzy</b> among fish, birds and mammal predators, especially near the surface. When disturbed, a swarm scatters, and some individuals have even been observed to moult instantaneously, leaving the exuvia behind as a decoy. [...] In 2012, Gandomi and Alavi presented {{what appears to be a}} successful stochastic algorithm for modelling the behaviour of krill swarms. The algorithm is based on three main factors: [...] " [...] (i) movement induced by the presence of other individuals (ii) foraging activity, and (iii) random diffusion." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{were several}} {{problems}} with the early reliability of this cable during its first 2 years of operation. The cable was buried on the continental shelf on the European and the American side of the ocean. It was snagged and damaged by fish trawling fleets where burial was ineffective. AT&T laid a trial optical cable in the Canary Islands in 1983. This cable {{did not have an}} electrical screen and was attacked by sharks. It was never proved whether these attacks were due to the sharks sensing the electrical radiation from the cable or the vibration of the cable moving on the sea floor where it might have been suspended. TAT-8 did have the screen conductor because of the possible effect of shark attacks. Because the cable was the first fiber optic cable and not coaxial cable, the electrical interference shielding for the high voltage supply lines was removed. This removal did not affect the fiber, but it did cause <b>feeding</b> <b>frenzies</b> in sharks that swam nearby. The sharks would then attack the cable until the voltage lines killed them. This caused numerous, prolonged outages. Eventually, a shark shielding was developed for the cable. PTAT-1, the next cable to go in the Atlantic was put in with the shark shielding and it proved much more reliable than TAT-8.|$|R
40|$|Sociologists often model social {{processes}} as interactions among variables. We review {{an alternative approach}} that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another {{in response to the}} influence they receive. These agent-based models(ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes,fads, and <b>feeding</b> <b>frenzies.</b> ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from "factors" to "actors" in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology,a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach...|$|R
40|$|Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis) {{are able}} to feed on large prey items by inject-ing a dose of toxic {{bacteria}} with their bite that, over time, kills the prey by systemic infection.

In addition, the serum was treated with protease, chelators of divalent metal ions, or with mild heat to determine the mechanism of antibac-terial activities. Treatment of bacterial cul-tures with serum from Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis) resulted in a volume-dependent decrease in bacterial growth. Cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella oxytoca exhibited mod-erate-strong growth inhibition by V. komodoen-sis serum, while cultures of Streptococcus epi-dermitis, Salmonella typhimurium, Providen-cia stuartii, and Shigella flexneri were nearly completely obliterated for 24 h by only 10 % (v/v) serum. The antibacterial activity of V. komodensis serum occurred very rapidly, as 18 % of E. coli growth was inhibited by a five min exposure to serum. Furthermore, 10 - and 20 -min incubations of E. coli with serum from V. komodoensis resulted in 43 and 68 % inhibi-tion of bacterial growth, respectively. The bac-tericidal capacity of the serum against E. coli was 2, 075, 000 bacteria/µL serum, and was inhibited by mild heat treatment, pronase, EDTA, and phosphate, indicating that the anti-bacterial action is most probably due to the presence of a potent serum complement pro-tein system...|$|R
