6000|$|This theory, however, is {{scarcely}} more tenable than the other. It cannot be concluded with any certainty, that formations in which similar organic remains are found, were of contemporaneous origin; {{nor can it}} be safely concluded that strata containing different organic remains are of different ages. To most readers these will be startling propositions; but they are fully admitted by the highest authorities. Sir Charles Lyell confesses that the test of organic remains must be used [...] "under {{very much the same}} restrictions as the test of mineral composition." [...] Sir Henry de la Beche, who variously illustrates this truth, remarks on the great incongruity there must be between the fossils of our carboniferous rocks and those of the marine strata deposited at the same period. But though, in the abstract, the danger of basing positive conclusions on evidence derived from fossils, is recognized; yet, in the concrete, this danger is generally disregarded. The established convictions respecting the ages of strata, have been formed in spite of it; and by some geologists it seems altogether ignored. Throughout his Siluria, Sir R. Murchison habitually assumes that the same, or kindred, species, lived {{in all parts of the}} Earth at the same time. In Russia, in Bohemia, in the United States, in South America, strata are classed as belonging to this or that part of the Silurian system, because of the similar fossils contained in them--are concluded to be everywhere contemporaneous if they enclose a proportion of identical or allied forms. In Russia the relative position of a stratum is inferred from the fact that, along with some Wenlock forms, it yields the Pentamerus oblongus. Certain crustaceans called Eurypteri, being characteristic of the Upper Ludlow rock, it is remarked that [...] "large Eurypteri occur in a so-called black grey-wacke slate in Westmoreland, in Oneida County, New York, which will probably be found to be on the parallel of the Upper Ludlow rock:" [...] in which word [...] "probably," [...] we see both how dominant is this belief of universal distribution of similar creatures at the same period, and how apt this belief is to make its own proof, by raising the expectation that the ages are identical when the forms are alike. Besides thus interpreting the formations of Russia, England, and America, Sir R. Murchison thus interprets those of the antipodes. Fossils from Victoria Colony, he agrees with the Government-surveyor in classing as of Lower Silurian or Llandovery age: that is, he takes for granted that when certain crustaceans and mollusks were living in Wales, certain similar crustaceans and mollusks were living in Australia. Yet the improbability of this assumption may be readily shown from Sir R. Murchison's own facts. If, as he points out, the fossil crustaceans of the uppermost Silurian rocks in Lanarkshire are, [...] "with one doubtful exception," [...] all [...] "distinct from any of the forms known on the same horizon in England;" [...] how can it be fairly presumed that the forms existing on the other side of the Earth during the Silurian period, were nearly allied to those existing here? Not only, indeed, do Sir R. Murchison's conclusions tacitly assume this doctrine of universal distribution, but he distinctly enunciates it. [...] "The mere presence of a graptolite," [...] he says, [...] "will at once decide that the <b>enclosing</b> <b>rock</b> is Silurian;" [...] and he says this, notwithstanding repeated warnings against such generalizations. During the progress of Geology, it has over and over again happened that a particular fossil, long considered characteristic of a particular formation, has been afterwards discovered in other formations. Until some twelve years ago, Goniatites had not been found lower than the Devonian rocks; but now, in Bohemia, they have been found in rocks classed as Silurian. Quite recently, the Orthoceras, previously supposed to be a type exclusively palæozoic, has been detected along with mesozoic Ammonites and Belemnites. Yet hosts of such experiences fail to extinguish the assumption, that the age of a stratum may be determined by the occurrence in it of a single fossil form. Nay, this assumption survives evidence of even a still more destructive kind. Referring to the Silurian system in Western Ireland, Sir R. Murchison says, [...] "in the beds near Maam, Professor Nicol and myself collected remains, some of which would be considered Lower, and others Upper, Silurian;" [...] and he then names sundry fossils which, in England, belong to the summit of the Ludlow rocks, or highest Silurian strata; [...] "some, which elsewhere are known only in rocks of Llandovery age"--that is, of middle Silurian age; and some, only before known in Lower Silurian strata, not far above the most ancient fossiliferous beds. Now what do these facts prove? Clearly, they prove that species which in Wales are separated by strata more than twenty thousand feet deep, and therefore seem to belong to periods far more remote from each other, were really co-existent. They prove that the mollusks and crinoids held to be characteristic of early Silurian strata, and supposed to have become extinct long before the mollusks and crinoids of the later Silurian strata came into existence, were really flourishing at the same time with these last; and that these last possibly date back to as early a period as the first. They prove that not only the mineral characters of sedimentary formations, but also the collections of organic forms they contain, depend, to a great extent, on local circumstances. They prove that the fossils met with in any series of strata, cannot be taken as representing anything like the whole Flora and Fauna of the period they belong to. In brief, they throw great doubt upon numerous geological generalizations.|$|E

The <b>enclosing</b> <b>rock</b> shows no trace of rnetasomatic change or heat effects of any kind, nor do the crystals appear to show replacement features, but rather they suggest formation in the calcareous muds of the sea floor during deposition and compaction ofthe sedi-ment. Complete chemical analyses of the feldspar collected at random from several different parts of the Lowville rock show no potash but an unusually high soda content. Some years ago, ~ while making a petrographic examination of the Lowville limestone at Bellefonte, Pa., attention was directed to the presence of many small well-formed crystals occurring with quartz in the insoluble residues of the rock. A careful study of this material showed it to be a surprisingly pure form of alblte. It was not possible at the time to make a thorough study of the albite occurrence, and further examination of the crystals was discontinued. During re-cent months the quarry rock at Belle-fonte was resampled by the present writers, and the study of carefully pre-pared residues resumed. The writers are pleased to acknowl-edge the helpful suggestions of Dr. Will-iam M. Meyers and Dr. Paul Krynine with whom this paper has been discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{interstitial}} {{character of}} ilmenite in common gabbroidic rocks {{has led to}} the idea that the last drop of liquid to crytallize in a rock could be pure ilmenite. When injected into <b>enclosing</b> <b>rocks</b> this liquid could give rise to ilmenite-pure veins. Fractional crystallization or immiscibility cannot produce a pure ilmenite melt. Actually, ilmenite is a liquidus mineral, which is the first or among the first mafic minerals to crystallize in Fe-Ti rich magmas. This is clearly shown by the sequence of crystallization in the Bjerkreim-Sokndal layered intrusion, by quantitative modelling of the liquid line of descent of jotunitic (hypersthene monzodioritic) magmas, and by experimental work. The interstitial character of ilmenite is therefore acquired subsolidus. Deformation can enhance the process. The synemplacement deformation linked to the diapiric uprise of anorthosite massifs is a suitable environment for the formation of layers of Cr- and Mg-rich ilmenite and their subsequent deformation and mobilization in discordant veins of pure ilmenite...|$|R

The rectangular fort was built to <b>enclose</b> the <b>Rock,</b> one of several natural outcrops of volcanic gneiss which rise abruptly from the plain.|$|R
