5|$|Baptism in the Holy Spirit occurs {{elsewhere}} in Acts. The gospel had been proclaimed in Samaria and the apostles Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem. The new believers had been baptized in water, but the Holy Spirit {{had not yet}} fallen on them. The Samaritans received the Holy Spirit when Peter and John laid their <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> them. The Apostle Paul was also filled with the Holy Spirit when Ananias of Damascus laid <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> him, and afterwards Paul was baptized with water.|$|E

5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever they could get their <b>hands</b> <b>on,</b> at the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.|$|E

5|$|In 1669, the Jewel House was {{demolished}} and the Crown Jewels {{moved into}} Martin Tower (until 1841). They were displayed here for viewing by the paying public.

Although they laid their <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the Imperial State Crown, Sceptre and Orb, they were foiled when the keeper's son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm.|$|E

5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile.

While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E
