40|$|ABSTRACT: Drawing on {{evolutionary}} psychological logic, {{we describe}} {{a model that}} links evolved mechanisms of disease-avoidance to contemporary prejudices against individuals with physical disabilities. Because contagious diseases were often ac-companied by anomalous physical features, humans plausibly evolved psychologi-cal mechanisms that respond heuristically to the perception of these features, trig-gering specific emotions (disgust, anxiety), cognitions (negative attitudes), and behaviors (avoidance). This disease-avoidance system is over-inclusive: Anomalous features that are not due to disease (e. g., limb amputation due to accident) may also activate it, contributing to prejudicial attitudes and behaviors directed toward peo-ple with disabilities. This model implies novel hypotheses about contemporary vari-ables that may amplify or reduce disability-based prejudice. We discuss past re-search within this context. We also present new evidence linking chronic and temporary concerns about disease to implicit negative attitudes toward and behav-ioral avoidance of disabled others. Discussion focuses on the conceptual and prac-tical implications of this evolutionary approach. KEY WORDS: disability; disgust; <b>evolved</b> <b>disease</b> avoidance; prejudice; stigmatiza-tion.
