40|$|AbstractBolt {{connection}} {{is an important}} part of pressure vessel and plays a very important role in its normal operation. Proper preload should be provided for pre-tightening of the threaded connection. In this study, precise three-dimensional finite element models of bolt and nut have been established, considering helix angle for threaded connections. Pre-tightening process was simulated using ABAQUS to obtain relation curves of <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and preload. Results obtained through finite element method agree well with the theoretical ones with the error within 5 %. Then contact stress distribution on contact surfaces of threaded flanges under preload and work load was analyzed.

30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} typical {{relationships}} obtained for tightening angle versus clamp force, <b>tightening</b> <b>torque,</b> and thread torque. In C. japonica, <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and thread torque follow {{the profile of}} clamp force: first rising, then falling after reaching a peak value. The initial, sharp rise in <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and thread torque is likely the initial driving torque when the lag screw head pressed against the bearing surface. Similar behavior was observed in P. menziesii at all tightening speeds and in C. obtusa at tightening speeds of 10 and 20  rpm. In all test specimens of C. obtusa at tightening speeds of 1 and 4  rpm, however, jagged, ‘sawtooth’ patterns are apparent in the relationships between tightening angle and clamp force, <b>tightening</b> <b>torque,</b> and thread torque. During the experiments, the wooden members were heard to creak, suggesting these fluctuations were due to stick-slip behavior between the lag screw thread and the main member. When major stick-slip occurs, the resultant clamp force is predicted to be highly variable, even if a torque control method were applied.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{equipment}} for bolting, {{there are two main}} methods for increasing bolt’s prestress (Kang and Wang 2007): one is to increase the bolt-nut tightening torque; the second is to use a bolt tensioning device, which is similar to imposing large prestresses on anchor bolts. The methods for improving bolt-nut <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> include: (1) high torque jumbolter. With a high torque jumbolter, it can not only increase the bolt <b>tightening</b> <b>torque,</b> but also achieve an integration of bolt installation to improve installation speed. For instance, the torque of the jumbolter used with continuous miner can reach more than 300  N m. The rated torque of a single jumbolter in China is not greater than 150  N m, and unable to meet the requirement of high <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> of the bolt. (2) Torque multiplier. In order to improve the installation torque of the jumbolter, a torque multiplier can be used on the jumbolter to multiply the nut <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> when installing bolt. (3) Torque wrench. Using a large torque preload wrench to tighten the bolts and nuts is an effective way to improve the prestress of anchor bolts.|$|R

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the mechanical properties of piano pin blocks. Three pin block types were used, all made from multi-layered beech-plywood. Pin block were divided to eight sections, drilled and fitted by tuning pins. <b>Tightening</b> <b>torque</b> of tuning pins was measured using a torque wrench, depending on the diameter of the hole. Mechanical resistance of the material was measured by microdrill Resistograph. Density distribution in pin blocks and moisture content were determined with gravimetric method. The universal testing machine was used for determination of Janky's and Brinell's hardness, the mechanical properties in compression in plane of the board. Results of tests were evaluated using statistical methods and cross-correlated. A finite-element model in ANSYS software was built, in ordner to clarify the degree and distribution of stress around the hole for tuning pin. Statistically significant differences were found for properties of individual types of pin blocks (especially the density, hardness and compressive strength and <b>tightening</b> <b>torque).</b> Hardness differs significantly when tested perpendicular to the fibers in the plane and along the fibers in the edge. Measurements in individual sections of pin block brought uneven results and did not show statistically significant differences.

40|$|Background: The final {{position}} of the abutment changes {{with the amount of}} <b>tightening</b> <b>torque.</b> This could eventually lead to loss of passivity and marginal misfit of prostheses. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of three different <b>tightening</b> <b>torques</b> on the marginal adaptation of 3 -unit cement-retained implant-supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). Materials and Methods: Two implants (Straumann) were inserted in an acrylic block so that one of the implants was placed vertically and the other at a 15 ° vertical angle. A straight abutment and a 15 ° angulated abutment were connected to the vertically and obliquely installed implants, respectively, so that the two abutments were parallel. Then, 10 cement-retained FDPs were waxed and cast. Abutments were tightened with 10, 20, and 35 Ncm torques, respectively. Following each <b>tightening</b> <b>torque,</b> FDPs were luted on respective abutments with temporary cement. The marginal adaptation of the retainers was evaluated using stereomicroscope. FDPs were then removed from the abutments and were sectioned at the connector sites. The retainers were luted again on their respective abutments. Luting procedures and marginal adaptation measurement were repeated. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and least significant difference tests (α = 0. 05). After cutting the FDP connectors, the independent samples t-test was used to compare misfit values (α = 0. 05). Results: Following 10, 20, and 35 Ncm <b>tightening</b> <b>torques,</b> the marginal discrepancy of the retainers of FDPs significantly increased (P 0. 05). The marginal gap values of angulated abutment retainers (ANRs) were significantly higher than those of the straight abutment after cutting the connectors (P = 0. 026). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the marginal misfit of cement-retained FDPs increased continuously when the <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> increased.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{rotating}} machinery it is often necessary to bolt components together with a known preload since the same controls the system dynamics considerably. Since a major percentage bolt <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> is resisted by frictional forces especially {{towards the end of}} tightening, and since the coefficient of friction in threads and under the bolt head to a large degree is indeterminate, the best method of ensuring desired clamping load is by measurement of bolt elongation, or by a load cell. However in large number of cases the incorporation of load cell is not practical and bolt elongation is insufficient to allow accurate measurement. ln such cases it becomes necessary to produce the desired end load by applying a specified torque to the bolt leading to the determination of nut factor. for each of the cases Here an attempt has been made to obtain the quantitative values of nut factors for bolted joints as a function of bolt diameter and <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> applied on bolted joints. A simple test rig 1 was designed and fabricated for the purpose in which the experiments were conducted.

In order to apply appropriate torque, the relationship between <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and initial load should be determined. In this study, a detailed three-dimensional finite element model of bolted joints was established with consideration of helix angle, pitch, thread type, tooth-type angle, and other details. The process of pre-tightening of bolted joints was simulated to validate the finite element model. The curves for the relationship between the torque and initial load obtained from finite element analysis agree well with those calculated from theoretical equations. Then, the influence of the friction coefficient, pitch, elastic modulus, assembly clearance, and strain-hardening exponent on the relationship was studied. The results show that the friction coefficient between nut and joint has great influence on the relationship between torque and initial load, that is, the larger the friction coefficient, the smaller the initial load of bolt at the same <b>tightening</b> <b>torque.</b> In contrast, the pitch, assembly clearance, Young’s modulus, and strain-hardening exponent have little influence on torque–initial load relation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reversed {{shoulder}} arthroplasty is {{an accepted}} treatment for glenohumeral arthritis associated to rotator cuff deficiency. For most reversed shoulder prostheses, the baseplate of the glenoid component is uncemented and its primary stability {{is provided by}} a central peg and peripheral screws. Because {{of the importance of}} the primary stability for a good osteo-integration of the baseplate, the optimal fixation of the screws is crucial. In particular, the amplitude of the tightening force of the nonlocking screws is clearly associated to this stability. Since this force is unknown, it is currently not accounted for in experimental or numerical analyses. Thus, the primary goal of this work is to measure this tightening force experimentally. In addition, the <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> was also measured, to estimate an optimal surgical value. METHODS: An experimental setup with an instrumented baseplate was developed to measure simultaneously the <b>tightening</b> force, <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and screwing angle, of the nonlocking screws of the Aquealis reversed prosthesis. In addition, the amount of bone volume around each screw was measured with a micro-CT. Measurements were performed on 6 human cadaveric scapulae.

The relationship between the <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> and the bone volume was not statistically significant.

30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{etiology}} of screw loosening, several causes are to be considered [8]. Screw-nut systems generally become unstable when the load that {{is applied to the}} system exceeds that of the preload of the screw that causes a clamping force preventing separation of the joint [9]. Preload is proportional to the <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> at placement. Hence, <b>tightening</b> <b>torque</b> on the one hand has a significant effect on screw loosening [10]. Embedment relaxation or settling can be overcome by retorquing abutment screws after a certain period of time, increasing joint stability [9, 11]. On the other hand, the magnitude of forces applied to the system is of major influence. The transfer of high forces can be generated by bruxers, through non-occlusal loading or because of a non-passive fit of suprastructures [8, 12 - 15]. Other factors that are of influence of a systems’ resistance to screw loosening include lubrication, screw design, screw material, and surface characteristics [16 - 20]. Especially implant designs with an external hex configuration are prone to abutment screw loosening [21].|$|R
