5|$|<b>Hamburg</b> {{had once}} been Germany's main seaport, the fourth largest in the world, but in 1943 {{virtually}} the entire city {{had been reduced to}} rubble by World War II bombing raids. By 1960, when they arrived, the <b>Hamburg</b> that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established a reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity. In contrast to an economically depressed post-war Liverpool, <b>Hamburg</b> was a wealthy city.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' five residencies in <b>Hamburg</b> during 1960 to 1962 {{allowed the}} Liverpool band {{to develop their}} {{performance}} skills and widen their reputation.

5|$|After {{playing for}} more than 16 hours per week, the group were {{contacted}} by Allan Williams, who wanted {{them to go to}} <b>Hamburg.</b> Derry and the Seniors were successful there, and Williams wanted an additional group. As Storm and the group were committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did Gerry and the Pacemakers) so Williams sent the Beatles to <b>Hamburg</b> instead. After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to <b>Hamburg,</b> replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in <b>Hamburg</b> on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles. Storm and The Hurricanes were later presented with a special certificate by Bruno Koschmider (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances.|$|E

5|$|Berlin was {{withdrawn}} from service in 1916 and disarmed. München was badly damaged by a British mine in October 1916, and thereafter decommissioned {{for use as}} a barracks ship. <b>Hamburg</b> was also used as barracks ship later in the war, and Leipzig became a training ship in 1917. Danzig was the last ship to leave active service, in late 1917. Of the five surviving ships, Berlin and <b>Hamburg</b> were retained by the newly reorganized Reichsmarine as training ships. The remaining three, Lübeck, München, and Danzig, were surrendered as war prizes to the United Kingdom, which sold them for scrapping in the early 1920s. <b>Hamburg</b> and Berlin soldiered on as training cruisers into the late 1920s and early 1930s; by the mid-1930s, they had again been converted into floating barracks. <b>Hamburg</b> was sunk by British bombers in 1944, and later raised and broken up for scrap in 1949. Berlin survived World War II and was loaded with chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skaggerak after the war to dispose of the munitions.|$|E
5|$|By 1926, {{however, the}} Buffalo to Albany section of NY5 was {{relocated}} onto the Genesee Road alignment, replacing NY5A. NY5's former, more southerly alignment was redesignated as NY7. In 1927, {{the establishment of}} the U.S. Highway System created more numbering changes. US20, which mainly followed the Yellowstone Trail elsewhere in the country, was designated in New York along NY5 southwest of <b>Hamburg</b> and east of Albany and along old NY7 from Skaneateles to Albany. Between the towns of <b>Hamburg</b> and Avon, the new US20 used an even more southerly alignment, running via East Aurora and Warsaw. This truncated both ends of NY5 to Athol Springs (south of Buffalo in the town of <b>Hamburg)</b> in the west, and to Albany in the east.|$|E
5|$|Following his loan spell at Fulham, Holtby {{returned}} to Tottenham {{and by the}} end of August 2014 had made three appearances, included in which were two in the Europa League. However, having struggled to make an impact at White Hart Lane with Spurs, and after the club signed Benjamin Stambouli from Montpellier, Holtby elected to return to Germany to join <b>Hamburg</b> on loan the following month. In terms of the loan agreement, <b>Hamburg</b> retained the option to purchase Holtby outright for a fee of ₤6.5 million. Despite breaking his collarbone during the Rückrunde, Holtby made 22 Bundesliga appearances in his debut season for <b>Hamburg</b> and started in both legs of the club's relegation playoff victory over Karlsruher SC.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, a {{moderate}} Republican, Daniel Henry Chamberlain, was elected South Carolina's governor, attracting even some Democratic votes. When Chamberlain sought re-election in 1876, Gary recruited Wade HamptonIII, a Confederate war hero {{who had moved}} out of state, to return and run for governor as a Democrat. That election campaign of 1876 was marked by violence, of which the most notorious occurrence was {{what became known as}} the <b>Hamburg</b> massacre. It occurred in <b>Hamburg,</b> South Carolina, a mostly black town across the river from Augusta, in Aiken County, bordering Edgefield County. The incident grew out of a confrontation on July 4 when a black militia marched in <b>Hamburg</b> and two white farmers in a buggy tried to ride through its ranks. Both sides filed criminal charges against the other, and dozens of armed out-of-uniform Red Shirts, led by Butler, traveled to <b>Hamburg</b> on the day of the hearing, July 8. Tillman was present, and the subsequent events were among his proudest memories.|$|E
5|$|In Berks County, {{snow and}} sleet along with very cold {{temperatures}} combined with some accidents {{and other aspects}} to cause a 50-mile backup on Interstate 78. Many motorists, including more than 100 trucks, were stuck on the interstate for nearly 24 hours, without food, water and running out of fuel. At 12:26 PM on the 14th, a caller tells a 911 center he???s been stuck in traffic on westbound Interstate 78 near the Berks-Lehigh county line {{for more than an}} hour. At 1:02 PM, a truck driver tells the Berks Communications Center about a seven-mile backup on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 78 near <b>Hamburg.</b> At 4:40 PM, a 911 caller asked to speak to the Berks Emergency Management Agency. The Berks Deputy Coordinator took the call. At 4:59 PM, The Berks Deputy Coordinator called the State Emergency Operations Center and was told the center learned of the backup at 4:33 PM. At 5:22 PM, Berks Emergency Management calls the state police at the <b>Hamburg</b> barracks but cannot get through, so he decided to drive there. At 6:08 PM, the Berks Emergency Management Deputy Coordinator finds that the <b>Hamburg</b> barracks is without power and phones. At 6:27 PM, a senior decision-maker from PennDOT is requested to arrive at the <b>Hamburg</b> state police barracks to help with communications.
