5|$|The three {{principal}} {{cities of}} the Bay Area represent different employment clusters and are dominated by different, but commingled, industries. San <b>Francisco</b> <b>is</b> home to the region's financial and business industry, tourism, and is host to numerous conventions. The East Bay, centered around Oakland, is home to heavy industry, metalworking, oil, and shipping, while Silicon Valley is a major pole of economic activity around the technology industry. Furthermore, the North Bay is {{a major player in}} the country's agriculture and wine industry. In all, the Bay Area is home to the second highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies, second only to the New York metropolitan area, with thirty such companies based throughout the region. In 2014, the greater twelve-county statistical area had a GDP of $758.5 billion, the third-highest among combined statistical areas. The smaller nine-county Bay Area had a GDP of $721 billion, which nonetheless would rank it 6th among U.S. states and 16th among countries.|$|E
