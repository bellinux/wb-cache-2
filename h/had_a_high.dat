5|$|Houtteman {{remained}} a reliever during the 1956 Cleveland Indians season.

5|$|It {{has been}} found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R.

Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the thorax. Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E

5|$|Several egg {{clutches}} of C. dughii are known, containing {{as many as}} 25 fossilized eggs. Unfortunately, taphonomical alterations (changes during the fossilization process) {{make it difficult to}} determine the original structure of the nest. Cousin (2002) hypothesized that Cairanoolithus eggs were laid {{on the surface of the}} ground, possibly buried beneath a mound of plant matter. Tanaka et al. (2015) noted that the shell <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> rate of water vapor conductance. Therefore, they concluded that Cairanoolithus nests were covered by organic or inorganic material, similar to modern eggs with high vapor conductance.|$|E
