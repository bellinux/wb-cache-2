5|$|Most {{bees are}} polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen {{from a range}} of {{flowering}} plants, however, some are oligoleges (specialists), in that they only <b>gather</b> pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants.

Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even electromagnetic fields. Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.|$|E

30|$|I present {{two methods}} for {{constructing}} angle <b>gathers</b> in 3 -D seismic imaging by downward extrapolation. Angles in angle <b>gathers</b> {{refer to the}} scattering angle at the reflector and provide a natural access to analyzing migration velocity and amplitudes. In the first method, angle <b>gathers</b> are extracted at each downward-continuation step by mapping transformations in constant-depth frequency slices. In the second method, one extracts angle <b>gathers</b> after applying the imaging condition by transforming local offset <b>gathers</b> in the depth domain. The second approach generalizes previously published algorithms for angle-gather construction in 2 -D and common-azimuth imaging.|$|R
