2500|$|In Australia, {{self-defence}} {{might be}} considered the most appropriate defence to a charge of murder {{for a woman who}} kills to protect her life or the lives of her children in a domestic violence context. It is about the rational act of a person who kills in order to save her (or his) own life. [...] But the lack of success in raising self-defence in Australia <b>for</b> <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> has meant that provocation has been the main focus of the courts [...] In 2005, based on the Victorian Law Reform Commission's Defences to Homicide: Final Report, the Victorian government announced changes to the homicide laws in that jurisdiction, which are intended to address this perceived imbalance. Under the new laws, victims of family violence will be able to put evidence of their abuse before the court as part of their defence, and argue self-defence {{even in the absence of}} an immediate threat, and where the response of killing involved greater force than the threatened harm.|$|E

My thesis seeks to discover how architecture can empower abused women to independence, building self esteem and stronger family units. Design principles were derived from research of the both the impact of domestic violence on women and historic examples of affordable housing. The design solution focused on three primary design principles: Security, Community and Individuality, a design integrating a two year program of support services within a courtyard building...|$|R

40|$|There is sparse {{research}} on the battering phenomena {{as it relates to}} African-American women. Therefore, this study was undertaken in order to determine whether a relationship existed between battering, depression and low levels of self-esteem in African-American women. Another {{purpose of this study was}} to obtain a profile of demographic characteristics of these <b>battered</b> African-American <b>women.</b> The study was conducted in two <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> shelters located in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. The actual site locations were in Fulton and DeKalb counties. A quasi-experimental design was used. The non-random sample consisted of 53 African-American women who resided in the <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> shelters during the research period. The Beck Depression Inventory, the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and the Questionnaire <b>for</b> <b>Battered</b> African- American <b>women</b> were administered. l Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. Statistical procedures that were used to analyze the data from this study were frequency analysis and the Pearson R. The results indicated that there was a relationship between battering and depression in African- American women. There were also variations in the demographic data of these women. Limitations of this research and implications for counselors are included. Recommendations for future research conclude this work...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} Taiwanese {{female and male}} police officers' perceptions of handling domestic violence. Specifically, it assessed officers' attitudes toward whether female officers, male officers, {{or a combination of}} female and male officers are more suited for handling cases of <b>battered</b> <b>women,</b> offenders, and domestic violence overall. Survey data were collected from 96 female and 156 male officers from two police departments in Taiwan. Frequency distributions showed that a combination of male and female officers were most preferred by officers for handling abused women, offenders, and domestic violence overall. Regression analysis found that female officers were significantly more likely than male officers to favor a combination of male and female officers over female officers alone <b>for</b> handling <b>battered</b> <b>women.</b> Female officers were found to be more likely than male officers to favor male over female officers and a combination of male and female officers for handling offenders. Police supervisors' attitudes toward domestic violence also influenced officers' attitudes toward who is more suited for handling offenders. Implications for future research and policy are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} {{violence against women}} in the Palestinian society as a multidimensional phenomenon. An index of a 60 -item scale (developed by the researcher) used to measure violence against women was administrated to three hundred and sixty-three randomly selected married women at Jericho & Al-Aghwar governate. The research revealed that Palestinian women are still subject to many forms of violence mostly, physical, psychological and sexual. Of the Palestinian women surveyed, seven in ten women (74. 4 %) reported partner violence. The study concluded {{that it is difficult}} <b>for</b> a <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> to seek redress or help with any guarantee of privacy. Furthermore, the under-reporting of violence is widespread in a society of patriarchal patterns of kinship, legalized inequality, social subordination and ingrained male dominance. The implications of the findings and probabilities for future empirical research are briefly discussed. </p...|$|R

Life After Billy focuses on Hurshman's experience following the non-guilty verdict and her work as a fighter against domestic abuse.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} detailed examination of African American women’s experiences with intimate partner abuse, {{the methods used}} to contend with abusive mates, and the immediate and enduring consequences resulting from the maltreatment. As an exploratory study, these matters were considered as they are framed by Black culture and the social structure. Using in-depth interviews with 40 <b>battered</b> Black <b>women,</b> the analysis identifies similarities and variations in their experiences based on socioeconomic class, education level, and age of the participants. In particular, the respondents’ self-perception as “Strong Black Women,” and not as “victims,” is considered to account for their efforts of resistance to their battering and other life stressors. Included in this resistance is the propensity for the women to verbally and physically retaliate against their abusers. The theoretical model, called multiplicative resistance, addresses the numerous forms of domination and discrimination with which <b>battered</b> Black <b>women</b> are confronted based on their interwoven identity of race, gender, and class, and their abusive circumstances. By providing concrete information that identifies more relevant treatment strategies and resource referrals, this dissertation leads to improved assistance <b>for</b> <b>battered</b> Black <b>women.</b> These findings also allow for crime processing agents, such as police officers, judges, attorneys, victim advocates, and corrections officials, to be better informed on how African American women respond to abuse and the systemic controls for this social problem...|$|R
40|$|Today {{several things}} {{point to the}} fact that many young women are being abused and sexual harassed. Despite that there is no {{knowledge}} about how the girls handle the violence or how the <b>battering</b> affects them. <b>For</b> that reason {{the purpose of this study}} is to describe and give a picture of some girl’s experiences of being battered of men they have or have had a relationship with. In focus is also how these girls identities are affected of the battering. These girls were between 16 - 24 years old when the battering started. One important conclusion in this study is that if the attitudes of <b>women</b> <b>battering</b> can change, the power structure between the sexes be evident and the knowledge about <b>women</b> <b>battering</b> increase it might be easier for a lot of women. It could increase the possibility for girls and women to counter men’s power and <b>for</b> <b>battered</b> girls and <b>women</b> to change their situation at an earlier stage than they are able to today...|$|R
