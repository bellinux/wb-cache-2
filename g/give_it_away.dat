25|$|It {{was around}} this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by {{merchandising}} offers and, underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away.</b> Seltaeb was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles merchandising rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrne’s favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which eventually cost NEMS an estimated $100 million in licensing fees.|$|E
500|$|Although jams {{had always}} been an {{integral}} aspect of song creation for the Chili Peppers, Blood Sugar Sex Magik saw songs being created with more structure. One specific jam {{would lead to the}} breakout song on the album: Frusciante, Flea and Smith were all playing together—with Kiedis at another part of the room watching—when [...] "...Flea started playing this insane bass line, and Chad cracked up and played along... I always had fragments of song ideas or even specific isolated phrases in my mind. I (Kiedis) took the mic and belted out 'Give it away, <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> now." [...] The philosophy behind the lyrics originated from a conversation Kiedis had with Nina Hagen, regarding selflessness and how insignificant material possessions were in his life. It, thus, gave birth to the song [...] "Give It Away." [...] He'd also been reminiscing about late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak, composing [...] "My Lovely Man" [...] in his tribute. Kiedis wrote [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy" [...] to be an over-zealous and overly exaggerated version of himself; a figure that could get any woman, and do anything he pleased to them. [...] "The Power of Equality" [...] confronted topics concerning racial equality, prejudice and sexism. Kiedis wrote [...] "I Could Have Lied" [...] to document the brief relationship he had with Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor.|$|E

500|$|During the chorus, Kiedis sings [...] "Give it away, <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> now" [...] {{repeatedly}} over a {{more rapid}} guitar riff before Frusciante provides, according to Steve Huey of Allmusic, a [...] "sudden contrast to Kiedis' hyperactivity {{in the form}} of a languid solo pre-recorded and dubbed backwards over the rhythm track." [...] The solo was recorded in one take because Frusciante had developed a preference towards speedy execution and a raw feeling; according to Flea, [...] "We did very little fix-up stuff. John's philosophy was that he would only play a solo twice. He'd play it once, and if he didn't like it or we didn't like it, he'd play it again—completely different. And that was it." [...] "Give It Away" [...] also makes use of other instruments like the jew's harp, which was played by band friend Pete Weiss. The song continues through several verses and choruses before reaching a bridge that introduces the outro, which consists of [...] "a hard-rocking riff" [...] that, according to Huey, strongly resembles the main riff from Black Sabbath's [...] "Sweet Leaf" [...] from their 1971 record Master of Reality. Kiedis repeats [...] "Give it away now" [...] for several measures before the guitar, bass and drums drop out.|$|E

500|$|Guitarist John Frusciante and bassist Flea wrote much of [...] "Give It Away" [...] during jam {{sessions}} {{in the early}} 1990s. Following the Chili Peppers' tour in support of Mother's Milk (1989), the duo spent time in a side project called H.A.T.E. with members of Fishbone. During their tenure in the group, the guitarist and bassist created the main riff and accompanying bassline for [...] "Give It Away". The rhythm was played at several H.A.T.E. performances shortly thereafter, but when the side project disbanded Frusciante and Flea believed the track would be appropriate for the Chili Peppers' upcoming record. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis agreed, and upon hearing {{the rest of the}} Chili Peppers play the song he began chanting [...] "give it away, <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> now". The phrase had been something the vocalist intended to incorporate into a song for the band's new record, {{but it was not until}} he heard the bassline that the lyrics fit. Kiedis said, [...] "I was so struck by Flea's bass part, which covered the whole length of the instrument's neck, that I jumped up and marched over to the mic, my notebook in tow. I always had fragments of songs and ideas or even specific isolated phrases in mind." ...|$|E

Mars rapped the words [...] "give it away, <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> now" [...] as the Red Hot Chili Peppers made their cameo. Idolator's Carl Williott complemented the singer's [...] "strong live vocals and stellar footwork". American singer and actress Carly Rose Sonenclar covered the song on her YouTube channel. In 2017, Anatalia Villaranda covered [...] "Runaway Baby" [...] during her Blind Audition at The Voice. Mars also performed the track on The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour (2010–12), The Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013–14) and on the 24K Magic World Tour (2017).

500|$|Dudley {{negotiated}} a separate {{peace with the}} Abenakis at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1713. [...] He hoped to separate the western Kennebec tribe from French influence and consequently adopted a fairly hard line, threatening to withhold trade that was vital to their survival and reiterating claims of British sovereignty over the Abenaki. [...] The Treaty of Portsmouth resulted from those negotiations and repeats the claims of sovereignty. Dudley claimed that the French had ceded Abenaki lands as part of Acadia, and one sachem responded: [...] "The French never said anything to us about it, and we wonder how they would <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away</b> without asking us". [...] Nevertheless, Dudley and succeeding governors treated the Abenaki as British subjects, and friction persisted over British colonial expansion into Maine which flared into Dummer's War in the 1720s.|$|E

Santer confirmed the clues in an interview on the EastEnders website: on Christmas Day Stacey disappears and it is never explained why, and then reappears on Boxing Day appearing [...] "not quite with it"; Stacey is the only character still sufficiently angry enough to spit on Archie's grave at his funeral; and Stacey is the first character to feature in the Christmas Day trailers.|$|E
500|$|However, {{according}} to the authorized biography Prism of the Night, by Katherine Ramsland, Rice's father {{was the source of}} his daughter's birth name: [...] "Thinking back to the days when his own name had been associated with girls, and perhaps in an effort to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> Howard named the little girl Howard Allen Frances O'Brien." [...] Rice became [...] "Anne" [...] on her first day of school, when a nun asked her what her name was. She told the nun [...] "Anne," [...] which she considered a pretty name. Her mother, who was with her, let it go without correcting her, knowing how self-conscious her daughter was of her real name. From that day on, everyone she knew addressed her as [...] "Anne", and her name was legally changed in 1947. Rice was confirmed in the Catholic Church when she was twelve years old and took the full name Howard Allen Frances Alphonsus Liguori O'Brien, adding the names of a saint and of an aunt, who was a nun. [...] "I was honored to have my aunt's name," [...] she said, [...] "but it was my burden and joy as a child to have strange names." ...|$|E

[...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did praise Chris Owens' acting, writing that he did a [...] "great job". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode and derided its plot. He heavily criticized the idea that Scully would offer William up for adoption. Kessenich did however praise Duchovny's directing, noting that [...] " [...] did a masterful job of luring me back to this world of The X-Files". Aaron Kinney from Salon wrote that the episode [...] "scuttled the entire" [...] baby William subplot. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the decision to conclude the William subplot but called the episode's conclusion [...] "sappy".|$|E
