2500|$|The Daily Mail Australia {{reported}} that, {{according to}} Jim Clemente, JonBenét 's nine-year-old brother Burke had a [...] "history of scatological problems". [...] Investigators claimed that Burke had covered his sister's walls and her Christmas present with feces, which was found when her room was sealed off and examined {{as a crime}} scene.

2500|$|<b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Ramsey were sued in two {{defamation}} lawsuits {{arising from}} the publication of their book, The Death of Innocence. These suits were brought by two persons named in the book who {{were said to have}} been investigated as suspects by Boulder police. The Ramseys were defended in those lawsuits by Lin Wood and three other Atlanta attorneys, James C. Rawls, Eric P. Schroeder, and S. Derek Bauer. They obtained the dismissal of both lawsuits, including an in-depth decision by U.S. District Court Judge Julie Carnes that [...] "abundant evidence" [...] in the murder case pointed to an intruder having committed the crime.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second group}} of {{theories}} is that a family member was involved in her death. Boulder police initially concentrated almost exclusively upon <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> Ramsey. According to Gregg McCrary, a retired profiler with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, [...] "statistically, it is a 12-to-1 probability that it's {{a family member or}} a care giver" [...] who is involved in the death of a child. From the police's perspective, they did not see evidence of a forced entry, saw evidence of staging, such as the ransom note, and did not find the Ramseys cooperative in helping them solve the death of their daughter. The Ramseys had stated that their reluctance was due to their fear that there would not be a full investigation for intruders and that they would be hastily selected as the key suspects in the case, according to Daily Camera.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the police}} and the DA {{particularly}} said in 1998 that JonBenét's brother Burke, who was 9 {{years old at the time}} of her death, was not a suspect. [...] The Ramseys gave several televised interviews, but resisted police questioning except on their own terms. In October 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 grand jury had recommended filing charges against <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation and hindering the prosecution of an unidentified person who had [...] "committed ... the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death". However, the DA determined there was insufficient evidence and did not pursue an indictment. In 2002, the DA's successor took over investigation of the case from {{the police and}} primarily pursued alternative theories of a non-family intruder committing the killing. In 2003, a trace DNA taken from the victim's clothes was found to belong to an unknown male, inducing the DA in 2008 to send the Ramseys a letter of apology declaring the family [...] "completely cleared". In February 2009, the Boulder Police Department took the case back from the DA and reopened the investigation.|$|E

[...] "Not only have we the full sanction of the American Red Cross Society, but I have {{letters to the}} different branches in the war zone, asking for us every consideration. Not only that, but your senator proved himself a brick. What do you think? Here's a letter from our secretary of state--another from the French charge d'affairs--half a dozen from prominent ambassadors of other countries!

In a 2012 interview, Clegg praised Kensit's performance but noted, [...] "in general it’s {{not a very good}} movie." ...|$|R

60|$|Both Uncle <b>John</b> <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> {{were amazed}} at the rapidity with which Maud was {{acquiring}} information of a really important character.

25|$|<b>John,</b> <b>Patsy</b> <b>and</b> Burke {{have denied}} {{involvement}} {{in the death of}} JonBenét. No charges have been filed in the case, as of September 2016. Several days prior to the airing of this mini-series, Burke Ramsey was interviewed on the Dr. Phil show in a three-episode series about the death of his sister. It was his first public interview. The Ramsey family lawyer, L. Lin Wood, has threatened to sue CBS for libel (defamation) based on its conclusion that JonBenét was killed by Burke.|$|R

50|$|Clegg {{finished}} {{writing his}} first novel, Goat Dance, in 1987.

Pocket also published his second, third, and fourth novels, Breeder (1990), Neverland (1991) and Dark of the Eye (1994). Clegg's next novel, The Children's Hour (1995), was published by Dell, but the imprint dropped its horror line four months later, leaving him without a publisher. His sixth novel, Bad Karma (1997), written under the pseudonym Andrew Harper, was published by Kensington Books, and later adapted for the screen by Randall Frakes. The resulting 2002 film, directed by <b>John</b> Hough <b>and</b> starring <b>Patsy</b> Kensit, was released as Bad Karma internationally and as Hell's Gate in the United States.|$|R

60|$|Despite {{the glories}} of the Amalfi road our {{tourists}} decided it was more pleasant to loiter around Sorrento for a time than to undertake further excursions. The mornings and evenings were chill, but {{during the middle of}} the day the air was warm and delicious; so the girls carried their books and fancy-work into the beautiful gardens or wandered lazily through the high-walled lanes that shut in the villas and orange groves. Sometimes they found a gate open, and were welcomed to the orchards and permitted to pluck freely the fragrant and rich flavored fruit, which is excelled in no other section of the south country. Also Uncle <b>John,</b> with Beth <b>and</b> <b>Patsy,</b> frequented the shops of the wood-workers and watched their delicate and busy fingers inlaying the various colored woods; but Louise mostly kept to the garden, where Count Ferralti, being a semi-invalid, was content to sit by her side and amuse her.|$|R
60|$|Beth {{answered}} the {{knock at the}} door. The living room was brightly lighted; Uncle <b>John</b> <b>and</b> the Major were playing checkers in a corner <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> was softly drumming on the piano. Louise had a book and Beth had been engaged upon some fancy-work.|$|R
60|$|Between the infant, the {{excitement}} of arrival and admiration for the Weldon establishment, so far surpassing their most ardent anticipations, Beth <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> had little desire for food. Uncle <b>John</b> <b>and</b> the major, however, did ample justice to an excellent repast, which was served by two more Mexican maids.|$|R

60|$|Uncle <b>John</b> laughed <b>and</b> {{drew his}} chair {{up to the}} table. Then he emptied his trousers' pockets upon the cloth, <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> gravely {{separated}} the keys and jackknife from the coins and proceeded to count the money.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} crowd began to disperse. Uncle <b>John</b> <b>and</b> the Major took Beth <b>and</b> <b>Patsy</b> away early, {{as soon as}} their booth was closed; but Louise stayed for a final waltz or two with Arthur. She soon found, however, that the evening's work and {{excitement}} had tired her, and asked to be taken home.|$|R
50|$|The next win for Glenealy was a Junior hurling {{title in}} 1971 when they beat Newcastle 4-6 to 2-2 in the final.
