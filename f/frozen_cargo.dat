50|$|Dongdao (东岛, meaning East Island) class {{reefer ship}} is {{a class of}} naval {{auxiliary}} ship currently in service with the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), and at least three units were completed and entered service with PLAN from 1960 thru 1962. This class can carry between seven hundred to eight hundred tons of <b>frozen</b> <b>cargo.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1960, {{while still}} in the Knesset, Meridor set up the deep-sea fishing company [...] "Atlantic" [...] jointly with {{businessman}} Mila Brenner. In 1962, they set up the shipping company [...] "Maritime Fruit" [...] for transporting <b>frozen</b> <b>cargo</b> around the world. The company grew rapidly, and at its height, operated 42 ships, and also extended its operations to oil shipping {{and the construction of}} tankers. As a result of his business activities, Meridor became wealthy. In his book Terror out of Zion, J. Bowyer Bell noted: ...|$|E
2500|$|Aragon {{had five}} cargo holds, {{some of which}} were {{refrigerated}} to carry meat and fruit from South America. Number 5 hold and the lower levels of numbers 1 and 2 holds were for <b>frozen</b> <b>cargos.</b> The 'tween decks of numbers 1 and 2 holds and upper 'tween deck of number 5 hold were for chilled cargos. A steam-powered refrigerating plant used [...] "carbonic anhydride" [...] as the refrigerant, and the holds were insulated with [...] "silicate cotton". Her bunkers held 2,000 tons of coal and she had water tanks with a capacity of about 2,000 tons.|$|R
50|$|The Port of Esbjerg {{covers a}} total land area of 3.5 million m2 (1.35 sq miles), has 10 km of quays and an {{alongside}} depth of some 4.5 m. The Tauruskay offshore wharf has {{a depth of}} 6.3 m while the bulk cargo Australienkaj, the Europakaj and the Vestkraftkaj for containers all have an alongside depth of 10.5 m. The Englandskaj serving passenger traffic has a length of 310 m and an alongside depth of 7.6 m while the Færgehavn handling containers, passengers and ferries over a length of 420 m has an alongside depth varying from 4.4 m to 9.3 m. Other wharfs include the Humberkaj for <b>frozen</b> <b>cargoes,</b> the Containerkaj for roll-on, roll-off containerized cargoes and the Oliebro for liquid bulk carriers.|$|R

50|$|CSAV {{operates}} {{in the five}} continents, offering line services {{for which it is}} able to provide permanent traffic to certain ports, fixed itineraries and ships designed for carrying large numbers of containers and a wide variety of conventional cargo. The company therefore has especially designed vessels for <b>frozen</b> <b>cargo,</b> vehicles, bulk cargo and forestry products. Intermodal services, which combine different means of transport, have been introduced by the company, as well as complementary services like port storage and services, etc. This door-to-door service, to any destination, is normally provided together with the CSAV subsidiaries.|$|E
50|$|On 1 September 1945, {{with the}} war in its closing hours, Richland -- still fully loaded with the {{exception}} of the <b>frozen</b> <b>cargo</b> that she had been able to discharge in early August -- found herself attached simultaneously to ServRon 7 and ServRon 8, in addition to Service Division (ServDiv) 73. On 2 September, amidst those organizational concerns, an insulation fire demolished her Vapor Clarkson-manufactured auxiliary boiler, after which Lt. Hills “called for, and received,” an inspection by NOB Subic Bay’s maintenance officer. Since the Bureau of Ships (BuShips) had already ordered a replacement boiler, repairs would not be forthcoming.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{propelled}} {{by a large}} triple expansion steam engine built by Wallsend Shipway and Engineering Co., which drove a single propeller. Official top speed was recorded as 15.8 kn, although Yongala was recorded to have reached 17 kn on multiple occasions. Five single ended steel boilers working under natural draught supplied steam of [...] pressure. At 15 knots, Yongalas engines burned approximately 67 tonnes of coal per day. A direct acting steam windlass and capstan was fitted on the forecastle head. Cargo handling was done with two steam cranes, along with seven winches with derricks and derrick-posts. Electric lighting was fitted throughout the ship with a duplicate generating plant. She was also provided with refrigeration facilities for the carriage of <b>frozen</b> <b>cargo.</b> A specially arranged steam and hand steering gear was fitted in a house at the after end of the fantail and controlled from the bridge.|$|E
5000|$|With quick {{resolution}} of the foregoing administrative issues, Richland completed loading [...] of chilled and <b>frozen</b> army <b>cargo</b> in her number four auxiliary hold on 3 October 1945. With 1,500 tons of Navy cargo and 100 tons for the Army on board, she sailed from Manila the following day, setting course for Mindoro, her Army orders endorsed by ComServDiv 73. Dropping anchor off Mindoro at 1025 on 5 October, the ship began unloading the meat she had brought from Manila, a process that continued until completed on the 7th, after which she sailed {{an hour before the}} end of the afternoon watch that day to return whence she had come.|$|R
2500|$|The Topeka, Kansas shops of the Santa Fe Railway built five {{experimental}} refrigerator cars employing {{liquid nitrogen}} as the cooling agent in 1965. A mist induced by liquified nitrogen was released throughout the car if the temperature rose above a pre-determined level. Each car carried [...] of refrigerant and could maintain {{a temperature of}} minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit (30°C). During the 1990s, a few railcar manufacturers experimented {{with the use of}} liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) as a cooling agent. The move was in response to rising fuel costs, and was an attempt to eliminate the standard mechanical refrigeration systems that required periodic maintenance. The CO2 system can keep the <b>cargo</b> <b>frozen</b> solid as long as 14 to 16 days.|$|R
60|$|I was, as the French say, biting my fists with impatience {{for that}} <b>cargo</b> <b>frozen</b> up-country; with rage at that canal set fast, at the wintry and deserted aspect {{of all those}} ships that seemed to decay in grim {{depression}} for want of the open water. I was chief mate, and very much alone. Directly I had joined I received from my owners instructions to send all the ship's apprentices away on leave together, because in such weather {{there was nothing for}} anybody to do, unless to keep up a fire in the cabin stove. That was attended to by a snuffy and mop-headed, inconceivably dirty, and weirdly toothless Dutch ship-keeper, who could hardly speak three words of English, but who must have had some considerable knowledge of the language, since he managed invariably to interpret in the contrary sense everything that was said to him.|$|R
50|$|Operating from San Francisco, California, and Pearl Harbor in 1944, {{the ship}} {{discharged}} her chilled and <b>frozen</b> <b>cargo</b> {{to the fighting}} fleet and shore bases in the Ellice, Gilbert, Marshall, and New Hebrides Islands. Stopping at Espiritu Santo, Milne Bay, Finschhafen, and Biak with fresh holiday provisions from San Francisco in early October, she finished unloading her cargo at San Pedro Bay, Leyte. The first reefer ship at Leyte Gulf after the invasion, she arrived before receiving facilities were ready {{on the beach and}} thus dodged Japanese aircraft until able to unload. From San Pedro Bay, she proceeded to the Admiralties and New Zealand. For almost a year, she carried food supplies to New Guinea ports, the Philippines, Palaus, Admiralties, Solomons, and Russell Islands. With the end of war in sight, she headed for Pearl Harbor, where she received word of the victory. In October she departed San Francisco with fresh holiday food for forces on Leyte.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{potential}} energy saving by adaptation to daily ambient temper-ature differences for <b>frozen</b> <b>cargo</b> in reefer containers are studied using {{a model of}} the Star Cool reefer. The objective is to create a controller that can be imple-mented on an embedded system and a range of methods are used to reduce the computational load. A combination of MPC and traditional control is used and the accuracy of the MPC is enhanced with an online update of model parameters. Simulation experiments showing potential energy savings of up to 21 % where the MPC is allowed to control both the cooling capacity and the ventilation of the cargo are. The largest cost reduction is achieved through a reduced ventilation rate...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{two methods}} to analyse {{the effect of}} sloshing on ship motions. The first method applies linear potential theory on both the barge and the internal tanks. For the barge the radiation, diffraction and incoming wave potentials are solved. For the internal tanks only the radiation potential is calculated, as there are obviously no incoming or diffracted waves in the tanks. The potentials are then used to solve the added mass, damping and wave forces for the coupled barge-tank system in the frequency domain. By comparing the frequency domain results with the scale model tests results a good agreement was identified for all loading conditions. On top of this the frequency domain approach is very fast and relatively easy to set up. However, linearity is assumed while in the scale model test non-linear sloshing was observed. It is expected that non-linearity will damp out the roll motion of the vessel and it is therefore expected that for increasing wave height the frequency domain solution will overestimate the response. It was also found that both roll RAO peaks {{are very sensitive to}} the wave direction. By comparing the roll RAO’s for liquid and <b>frozen</b> <b>cargo</b> in the tanks it was found that sloshing significantly decreases the height of the main roll RAO peak and also creates a lower barge natural frequency. The second method is a more complex time domain model that is based on a coupling between Volume of Fluid solver ComFLOW and ship motions solver aNySIM. In the coupled model the motions of the barge due to waves, without internal tanks, are obtained by using linear potential flow and are calculated in aNySIM. The ship motions calculated in aNySIM are used as input in ComFLOW that calculates the more complex and potentially non-linear motions of the liquid in the spherical cargo tanks. The resulting sloshing loads are again used as input in aNySIM, creating a two-way coupling between the dynamics of the ship and cargo tanks. The time domain results showed a reasonably good agreement with the scale model tests. However, the second, sloshing induced, roll RAO peak is underestimated in the coupled model. This might be due to the type of waves used in the test, uncertainty in the RAO’s and due to the properties of the coupling between ComFLOW and aNySIM. The time domain method is time consuming and complex to set up, but offers more insight in what is really happening. It was shown that non-linear motions of the barge occur due to sloshing in the tanks. It was also found that with partially filled tanks the response of the barge is irregular when exposed regular waves. The influence of the pump tower was also investigated, which showed that due to the damping created by the pump tower the overall roll response is lower and the barge natural frequencies moves to a lower frequency.
