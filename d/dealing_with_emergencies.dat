In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, about which the board had been unenthusiastic, alongside Whitehouse's equipment. However, Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the Agamemnon had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858. Back in London, the board was on the point of abandoning the project and mitigating their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, Cyrus West Field and Curtis M. Lampson argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>emergencies</b> and being unafraid to lend a hand in manual work.

5000|$|Like both {{legislative}} {{statutes and}} regulations promulgated by government agencies, executive orders {{are subject to}} judicial review and may be overturned if the orders lack support by statute or the Constitution.

50|$|Given these notions, {{emergency}} managers must identify, contemplate, {{and assess}} possible man-made threats and natural threats {{that may affect}} their respective locales.

Thus, although similarities may exist, no two emergency plans will be completely identical. Additionally, each locale has different resources and capacities (e.g., budgets, personnel, equipment, etc.) for <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Each individual community must craft its own unique emergency plan that addresses potential threats that are specific to the locality.|$|E

DIR, an acronym for Doing It Right, is a holistic approach to scuba diving. According to the DIR approach fundamental skills, teamwork, environmental awareness, and the use of highly optimized and streamlined equipment configuration are the primary fundamentals of diving.

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE MEDLINE was searched from January 1980 to December 2001. Articles were selected based on their clinical relevance, quality of evidence, and date of publication.

Consensus statements by specialty professional groups were used to identify accepted emergency medical treatments.
