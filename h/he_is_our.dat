500|$|Planet B is {{the largest}} ever {{original}} drama commission for BBC Radio 7, with the first series being ten episodes long. It was broadcast {{as part of a}} science fiction season on BBC Radio. Broughton acts as the head writer for the show. Dromgoole, the series producer, describes the character of John as being, [...] "a real character trapped in a sci-fi. So in a sense, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> guide into it. He's very skeptical about it and he's innocent about everything he encounters there." ...|$|E
500|$|Next, Senator Daniel W. Voorhees of Indiana {{spoke on}} behalf of Thomas A. Hendricks, praising Hendricks as a {{candidate}} of national unity: [...] "o the South, who has been more faithful? To the North, who has been truer? To the East, who has been better, wiser, more conservative and more faithful? And to the West I need not appeal, for <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> own son." [...] The next few states made no nominations. When the roll reached New York, there were cries from the crowd for Tilden, and some confusion when that state's delegation made no nomination.|$|E
5000|$|On the Colts Official Website, Tony Dungy quoted [...] "He {{did a lot}} for us, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> third {{back and}} a very good runner. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a guy who could go in and play {{tailback}} and win games for us. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> fullback in short-yardage and goal-line situations and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a very good special teams player."

5000|$|Bachman {{later said}} the 1929 team [...] "was {{as good as}} the 1928 team and would have been better had we not lost Carl Brumbaugh from the year before. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> passer, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> thinker. <b>He</b> could get the ball to Van Sickel. In those days the halfbacks passed more than the quarterback. And boy did we pass. In the flats a lot, like they do now." ...|$|R
500|$|Heikkinen was the {{one bright}} spot in the Wolverines’ 1937 season. In early November 1937, Anderson {{described}} Heikkinen as “the smallest but best lineman in the Michigan forward wall.” Anderson continued in his praise for Heikkinen: “Heik has shown the stuff in both of our tough games against Minnesota and Northwestern [...] [...] [...] Minnesota didn’t split our guards more than twice during the game. Heik was responsible {{for a lot of}} that. My conception of a good guard is one that stops anything that comes his way on defense and leads the blocking on offense. Heik has done just that. When we have the ball <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> fifth man in the backfield. He pulls out most of our plays and bowls over the opposition. We have made most of the gains through the line over his position.” ...|$|E
500|$|After {{establishing}} {{himself as}} a premier player in France and an international during the 2004–05 campaign, Benítez declared that Diarra still had a future at Liverpool stating [...] "I think it's still early days for him, but it's good news {{for us to see}} a young player doing so well. If he continues to play well for his club and is in the national team, we will be reminding everyone <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> player". However, in April 2005, Diarra revealed that he wanted to stay with Lens for the long-term. After finishing the season, on 24 June 2005, Liverpool granted his request after Lens reached an agreement with the club on a transfer fee, purported to be €3.2million. Diarra finished his Liverpool career with no first-team appearances and only one club appearance, which came in a pre-season friendly.|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{opted to}} remain at Accrington ahead of the 2007–08 season, signing a {{contract}} extension in May 2007. He played his {{first game of the}} campaign in late August 2007, a 2–0 defeat at Lincoln City. Following Accrington's 4–1 home win against Grimsby Town in September 2007, a game in which Edwards appeared as a 90th-minute substitute, he did not feature in the first-team for two months. He returned to first-team action on 17 November 2007, playing in the club's 1–0 home defeat to Rotherham United. Following a spate of late substitute appearances, Edwards was ever present in the first-team from December 2007 onwards. He scored his first goal of the 2007–08 season on 4 April 2008, scoring the winner in a 1–0 win against Dagenham & Redbridge. The goal all but guaranteed League Two survival for Accrington. It was Edwards' only goal of the season, playing 32 games in all competitions. Edwards started in Accrington's first game of the 2008–09 season, a 1–0 home loss to newly promoted Aldershot Town. In October 2008, Accrington manager John Coleman praised Edwards for his form during the start of the season, [...] "I couldn't pay him enough compliments. I think the last six months he has been absolutely magnificent. I am convinced if he was three inches bigger he would be playing in the Premier League. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> best defender and hopefully he'll continue to be a great player for us for a long time". Edwards remained ever present in the Accrington first-team, but was taken off after 17 minutes in Accrington's 2–1 win against Shrewsbury Town. Despite needing eight stitches in his knee, Edwards played in Accrington's following league match four days later, a 1–0 home defeat to Wycombe Wanderers. He provided the assist for Paul Mullin's goal in a defeat at Wycombe Wanderers, as well as assisting Jamie Clarke's second goal in a 3–1 home win over Grimsby Town. Edwards played in every one of Accrington's 50 games during the 2008–09 season, with the club finishing 16th in the league table.|$|E
