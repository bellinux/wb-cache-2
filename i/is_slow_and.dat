5|$|Slow second movement, {{in a key}} {{different}} from the tonic, and in A–B–A (ternary) or A–B–A–B–A form. The main sections (A and B) are contrasted in key and character, A <b>is</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> meditative; B is more intense and animated. The movement begins and ends slowly and quietly.|$|E
5|$|Taxes and tariffs {{are high}} for private {{enterprises}}, while state enterprises are strongly subsidised. State regulation is costly to companies; starting or closing a business <b>is</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> costly. Government spending was predicted to reach 67% of GDP in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Growth <b>is</b> <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E

5|$|The {{flight of}} the {{fieldfare}} <b>is</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been called both a {{platform}} game and an action-adventure game. GameSpot asserts that it combines elements of ToeJam & Earl and its platformer sequel, ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, while GameNOW and Electronic Gaming Monthly liken it to the former game. The game features both single- and two-player modes; in both, players control {{one of the three}} protagonists. ToeJam moves quickly and jumps high, but has weak attacks; Earl is tougher and has more powerful attacks, but <b>is</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> jumps lower than ToeJam; Latisha ranks between the two in terms of athleticism, and gains additional power-ups later in the game. In the game's two-player mode, the camera moves between single and split-screen as players maneuver their characters away from each other. Characters can share power-ups when in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{currents}} only {{affect the}} top few hundred meters (yards) of the sea, {{but there are}} also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep ocean current flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt. This movement <b>is</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. At high latitudes, the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. Both these factors make it denser and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface, and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.|$|E

5|$|The pair's {{pumpkins}} growth <b>is</b> <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> Seth and Emma often clash {{during their}} collaboration. They grow closer while watching old films together and discussing their pasts. Seth {{talks about his}} degree in engineering from Stanford University and his decision {{to move out of}} the city in favor of the country, and Emma reveals her childhood dream of hosting her own talk show. When they are interviewed by Emma as part of her show, the Pumpkin Widows share stories of their husbands' obsessions with growing pumpkins. Emma and Seth sneak onto the mayor's farm to find out his pumpkin growing secrets. Emma asks Seth on a date while they appear at a promotional photo shoot in Seattle. Their date is interrupted by Emma accepting an offer from a television executive to be an anchor on a New York City morning news program. The pair's pumpkin starts growing larger; Emma finds the real pumpkin growing journal and learns that the other book was actually Walt's poems to his wife. Emma and Seth win the contest, and beat the record. Rejecting the New York job offer, Emma starts her own talk show in Valleyville along with Seth. Emma pays off Walt's debt with the prize money, and Seth opens his own car repair shop. The film ends with the couple becoming engaged.|$|E

25|$|This darkness, however is {{interrupted}} {{by the appearance of}} a chorus. The chorus is accompanied by folk instruments such as the mandolin and guitar in order to give the music a more authentic feel. However, the music <b>is</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> intentionally sweet in quality, reflecting the kind innocence of Desdemona.|$|E

25|$|C. difficile toxins have a {{cytopathic}} effect in cell culture, and neutralization of any effect observed with specific antisera is the practical {{gold standard for}} studies investigating new CDI diagnostic techniques. Toxigenic culture, in which organisms are cultured on selective media and tested for toxin production, remains the gold standard and is the most sensitive and specific test, although it <b>is</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> labor-intensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{phosphor}} {{drops off}} in efficiency during use. By around 25,000 operating hours, it will typically be half {{the brightness of}} a new lamp (although some manufacturers claim much longer half-lives for their lamps). Lamps that do not suffer failures of the emission mix or integral ballast electronics will eventually develop this failure mode. They still work, but have become dim and inefficient. The process <b>is</b> <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> often becomes obvious only when a new lamp is operating next to an old one.|$|E
25|$|Cirrhosis {{has many}} {{possible}} manifestations. These {{signs and symptoms}} may be either {{a direct result of}} the failure of liver cells, or secondary to the resultant portal hypertension. There are also some manifestations whose causes are nonspecific but which may occur in cirrhosis. Likewise, the absence of any signs does not rule out the possibility of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis of the liver <b>is</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> gradual in its development. It is usually well advanced before its symptoms are noticeable enough to cause alarm. Weakness and loss of weight may be early symptoms.|$|E
