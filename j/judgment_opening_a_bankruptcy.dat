The investigation aims at exploring and discussing the need – mostly neglected by the Courts and rarely taken in due consideration by legal doctrine – to frame, under a «bankruptcy perspective», different problems that arise in this field, through a preliminary test of compatibility between insolvency law principles and civil procedure law rules «imported» in the bankruptcy proceeding...|$|R

The issue has been taken to court by both parties in November 2015 and December 2015. After a tentative court-mediated settlement in March 2016, the national government sued Okinawa governor Takeshi Onaga in July, and obtained a High Court ruling in September determining that it was illegal for Onaga to revoke his predecessor's permission for landfill work at the new site.

40|$|Both in the Netherlands and the United States of America {{a change}} in the {{dynamics}} of bankruptcy procedures is taking place. In the Netherlands, the <b>opening</b> of <b>a</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> procedure (faillissement) traditionally leads to the sale of the assets of the debtor and a distribution of the proceeds among creditors. In recent years, however, there has been increased attention for reform of Dutch bankruptcy law as to enhance its reorganizational possibilities and enable the saving of viable businesses. In the United States a trend in the opposite direction can be seen. Bankruptcy law of this country has traditionally been known for its reorganizational possibilities, but in recent years there has been a marked increase in asset sales and efforts have been undertaken to limit the abilities to rescue any businesses. These changed dynamics warrant a fundamental discussion about bankruptcy law. Not every business in trouble should be liquidated, but not every business in trouble should be saved either. Rather, the challenge is to ensure that if <b>a</b> business enters <b>bankruptcy,</b> this <b>bankruptcy</b> leads to <b>an</b> efficient outcome by formulating the right rules. That is what this dissertation does. By establishing an assessment framework and assessing different bankruptcy procedures (asset sale, pre-pack and reorganization plans) the (in) efficiency of Dutch bankruptcy is laid out. In this respect, U. S. bankruptcy law is used as inspiration for solutions to inefficiencies...|$|R
