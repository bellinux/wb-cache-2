40|$|Sedimentary bedding {{planes in}} a {{succession}} of Lower Jurassic (Bucklandi Biozone) limestone-shale alternations at Nash Point, South Wales are represented by omission surfaces intermittently developed on the upper surfaces (limestone-shale contacts) of limestone beds. Other lithological contacts (shale-limestone contacts {{and the majority of}} limestone-shale contacts) are devoid of positive indications of an associated break in sedimentation. Statistical analysis of (a) limestone-shale contacts and (b) recorded omission surfaces suggests that limestone-shale contacts are regularly spaced and omission surfaces randomly distributed. Limestone-shale contacts and omission surfaces are interpreted as proxies for sedimentary bedding and shale-limestone contacts interpreted as pseudo-bedding planes, with the alternation of limestones and shales arising from the <b>diagenetic</b> <b>differentiation</b> of beds of lime mud. No short- or long-term cyclicities at a scale greater than that of an individual couplet can be detected by the statistical methods employed, and it is therefore unlikely that a Milankovitch-type cyclicity is present. Evidence of stratigraphical environmental succession, exhibited both by ichnotaxa and body fossil assemblages in the biofacies of omission surfaces, suggests that the succession represents part of a third-order shallowing event. It is proposed that beds of lime mud were deposited as a consequence of episodic storm action on a hemipelagic shelf, and <b>diagenetic</b> <b>differentiation</b> was `steered' by this episodicity and not by any orbital control...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Alternating {{cemented}} and uncemented, fine-grained layers from Pliocene periplatform carbonates of the Great Bahama Bank have {{fundamentally different}} diagenetic features. The cemented layers consist predominantly of microspar, {{interpreted as an}} early marine, shallow-burial cement. The intercalated, uncemented, softer layers are devoid of microspar cement and exhibit signs of mechanical compac-tion. Precursor sediments of both cemented and uncemented layers apparently consisted largely of aragonite needles. The needles in the compacted layers show signs of dissolution, suggesting that the calcium carbonate required for cementation of the uncompacted layers was provided by aragonite dissolution within the compacted layers. The lack of compaction in the cemented layers shows that cementation, and hence aragonite dissolution in the adjacent compacted layers, {{took place in the}} shallow-burial realm. The dissolved carbonate was trans-ported by diffusion to adjacent layers and reprecipitated as calcite cement, thereby preventing significant compaction of these layers. These processes are not yet complete in the material examined, and some aragonite remains in the compacted layers. The sedimentary composition of the two rock types (compacted and uncompacted) is similar, indicating a similar precursor sediment for both. Between 1. 5 and 7 times the concentration of palynomorphs oc-curs in the compacted layers, apparently the result of passive diage-netic enrichment. Although the trigger for <b>diagenetic</b> <b>differentiation</b> has not been determined, the pure limestone succession studied here appears to serve as a clay-free analog to limestoneâ€“marl alternations...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{properties}} {{determined from}} logs and discrete measurements along a borehole transect across {{the slope of}} the western Great Bahama Bank margin (ODP Leg 166) show a distinct relationship with primary sediment composition and noncarbonate content. Dominant sediment types are alternating cemented and uncompacted calciturbidites with shallow-water derived grains, and poorly to uncemented and compacted periplatform ooze of globigerinid-dominated wackestone to packstone. Comparison of the velocity-porosity variation from logs and discrete measurements reveals that both tend to follow the trend of generally accepted velocity transforms. Primary control on the acoustic velocity is exerted by total porosity, whereas the remaining variation in velocity is explained by differential diagenesis. The less cemented to uncemented and compacted background sediments have velocities that, at a given porosity, fall below the time- average equation for calcite. The cemented turbidites, however, have velocities that are higher than those predicted by the time-average equation. Although it is unclear whether the original volume of aragonite or presence of organic matter controlled this difference, it is suggested that the acoustic properties reflect an input signal. The presence of noncarbonate material, some of which is clay, increases basinward and further reduces the acoustic velocities in the background sediment. In contrast, earlier work on the more proximal slope, and nearly pure carbonate, intervals in Clino and Unda cores documents <b>diagenetic</b> <b>differentiation</b> in compositionally similar sediment, resulting in alternating acoustically fast and slow layers. Marginal and nearly pure limestones have a more complex acoustic behavior and hence are difficult to predict. Though both velocity logs and discrete velocity measurements show comparable general trends, logging data show a considerably larger variation at a given porosity value (up to 3. 5 km/s) than discrete data, which ranges between 1. 0 and 2. 5 km/s. To improve the quality of velocity logs it is suggested to groundtruth these data with other logging data, general velocity transforms, and, ideally, discrete measurements on core plugs...|$|E
