This paper examines how two types of <b>earned</b> media, traditional (e. g., publicity and press mentions) and social (e. g., blog and online community posts), affect sales and activity in each other. Fourteen months of daily sales and media activity data from a microlending marketplace website are analyzed using a multivariate autoregressive time series model. The authors find that (i) both traditional and social <b>earned</b> media affect sales, (ii) the per-event sales impact of traditional <b>earned</b> media activity is larger than for social <b>earned</b> media, (iii) however, because of the greater frequency of social <b>earned</b> media activity, after adjusting for event frequency social <b>earned</b> media’s sales elasticity is significantly greater than traditional <b>earned</b> media’s, and (iv) social <b>earned</b> media appears {{to play an important}} role in driving traditional <b>earned</b> media activity...|$|R
