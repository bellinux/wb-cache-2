5|$|The {{reforms of}} Djedkare Isesi played an {{important}} role in flourishing of the arts during the later Old Kingdom, as artisans and craftsmen could now find many wealthy patrons beyond the king. This created a surge in the number of commissions leading to a <b>general</b> <b>improvement</b> of the artistic works. This also provided the artisans with a new wealth, which they used to build their own large funerary complexes.|$|E

5|$|After {{screening}} at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival on October 20, 2007, Boogeyman 2 {{was released}} direct-to-video in the United States on January 8, 2008; {{it was later}} released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered {{it to be a}} <b>general</b> <b>improvement</b> over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human-like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was preferable to monsters in other contemporary creature features, including the previous film. Despite a mediocre commercial performance, recouping slightly less than its budget, the film received a sequel, Boogeyman 3, the following year.|$|E

5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a <b>general</b> <b>improvement</b> in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E

5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a <b>general</b> <b>improvement</b> of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 2004, Hyundai Rotem, Mitsui, RM Transit Technology and dU LexBuild {{received}} {{an order to}} refurbish all 396 carriages, costing S$142.7 million in total. The works included the refurbishment of interior fixtures, the addition of wheelchair spaces, the upgrading of onboard communications equipment, enhancement of the public announcement system, and <b>general</b> <b>improvement</b> of the cars' appearance. SMRT Corporation said the reasons for refurbishment were wear and damage of important components {{over the past two}} decades and water leaks from the air-conditioning system on some trains. The company chose this option instead of buying new rolling stock, which would have cost S$792 million. The first refurbished train began revenue service on 5 November 2006, and all remaining trainsets had been refurbished by the end of 2008.|$|E

25|$|In the 10th and 11th centuries, though, {{there appears}} to have been a <b>general</b> <b>improvement</b> in the {{political}} stability and economy. This made it possible for trade and craft to grow and for the monetary economy and urban culture to revive. Initially, urban culture recovered particularly in existing settlements, often in remnants of Roman towns and cities, but later on, ever more towns were created anew. Meanwhile, the population of western Europe increased rapidly and the utilised agricultural area grew with it. The agricultural areas of existing villages were extended and new villages and towns were created in uncultivated areas as cores for new reclamations.|$|E
25|$|There were {{no further}} censuses but {{statistics}} were maintained by counting births, deaths and migration. By {{the end of}} 1936 the total population was approximately 1,300,000, the Jews being estimated at 384,000. The Arabs had also increased their numbers rapidly, mainly {{as a result of}} the cessation of the military conscription imposed on the country by the Ottoman Empire, the campaign against malaria and a <b>general</b> <b>improvement</b> in health services. In absolute figures their increase exceeded that of the Jewish population, but proportionally, the latter had risen from 13 per cent of the total population at the census of 1922 to nearly 30 per cent at the end of 1936.|$|E
25|$|On February 15, 2006, Pandemic {{released}} a patch for the PC version, which included support for mods and <b>general</b> <b>improvement</b> to the game. Mod tools for the Windows {{version of the}} game were subsequently released on February 21, 2006. Included in the download were many of the game's assets, several tutorials, and the tools required to make content for the PC version of the game. A plugin for Softimage XSI included in the mod tools allows users to create new 3D models and animations for the game. The Battlefront II mod tools provide {{a wider range of}} capabilities to the end user than the original Battlefront, allowing a user to create anything from user interface changes, to additional gameplay levels, to large-scale modifications. The original assets used to build the retail version of the game were shipped with the mod tool package that was {{released a}}nd allowed users to either modify an existing level or create an entirely new map from scratch. Subsequently, modifications have been created which expand the game further into the Star Wars expanded universe, adding additional locales, characters, Star Wars eras, and fan-created stories.|$|E

25|$|Relations {{between the}} two {{countries}} were further strained after the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid. On 2 September 2011, Turkey downgraded ties with Israel to second secretary level and suspended military co-operation between the countries. Turkey demanded an apology from Israel over the flotilla incident, which Israel was interested in providing, but Turkey also demanded Israel end its blockade of the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, which Israel has stated is a non-possibility. After some diplomatic activity by U.S. President Barack Obama, Israeli PM Netanyahu did issue an apology over the flotilla events and Israel and Turkey agreed on financial compensation; in return, Turkey dropped its demand that the Gaza Strip blockade end and also removed state support from several lawsuits in Turkey that demanded the arrest and trial of Israeli military and political leaders who were in charge in 2010 during the flotilla incident. Turkey's numerous regional problems, ranging from the coup that ousted the Muslim Brotherhood regime in Egypt in 2013 and the increasingly disruptive effects of its border from the Syrian conflict, were the main reason for this <b>general</b> <b>improvement</b> in relations, as Ankara wanted more stability and allies than it had when Erdogan had initiated his plans years earlier to move Turkey away from the pro-Israel (and generally pro-West and/or pro-EU) camp and improve ties to groups like Hamas and countries like Iran.|$|E

500|$|The remastered soundtrack {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews.

Renaudin said that, while the soundtrack was crisper, fans of the original [...] "might not immediately notice the acoustic alterations." [...] Eternal Calm, Last Mission and Will received mixed responses. Caires called Last Mission [...] "a good little distraction", but called Will [...] "incomprehensible". Sullivan didn't enjoy Eternal Calm or Last Mission, while finding Will [...] "incredibly weird and confusing.", recommending players to stay clear of it. Wallace called Last Mission [...] "a nice diversion, but not incredibly engaging.", while North noted that it [...] "may not have as much appeal to fans of your typical Final Fantasy game." ...|$|E
