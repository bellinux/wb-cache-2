Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E

5|$|Failed {{oxygen and}} {{ethylene}} glycol pipes near the fire's origin point continued burning an intense secondary fire which melted through the cabin floor. By the time firefighters {{were able to}} open the hatch, the fire had extinguished itself. The back of Chaffee's couch {{was found in the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>position,</b> with the lower portion angled towards the floor. His helmet was closed and locked, his restraints were undone, and the hoses and electrical connections to the suit remained connected. As he was farthest from the origin of the fire, he suffered the least burn and suit damage.|$|E
5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and a roughly <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> of the back. Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E
30|$|At PEEP 1, pleural {{effusion}} reduced FRC by 191 [*]±[*] 136  ml or 39 % of non-PLEF FRC (p[*]<[*] 0.0001). This volume loss represented 56 % of the instilled PLEF volume. Regarding the laterality of PLEF, {{there was no}} significant difference in FRC between right PLEF and left PLEF. For PLEF-PEEP 1 and PLEF-PEEP 10, no differences in FRC were observed among the <b>horizontal</b> <b>positions.</b> Compared to <b>horizontal</b> <b>positions,</b> semi-Fowler's position increased FRC by 131 % and 98 % for PEEP 1 and PEEP 10, respectively.

5|$|For {{temperate}} living bats, births typically {{take place}} in May or June in the northern hemisphere while births in the southern hemisphere occur in November and December. Tropical species give birth {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. In most bat species, female carry and give birth to one pup per litter. For bat embryos, apoptosis only affects the hindlimbs, while the forelimbs retain webbing between the digits which form into the wing membranes. At birth, a bat pup can be up to 40 percent of the mother's weight, and hence the pelvic girdle of the female expands during birth as the two halves are connected by a flexible ligament. Females typically give birth in a heads-up or <b>horizontal</b> <b>position,</b> using gravity to make birthing easier. The young emerges rear-first, possibly to prevent the wings from getting tangled, and the females cradles it in her wing and tail membranes. In many species, females give birth and raise their young in maternity colonies and individuals may assist others in their birthing process.|$|E
5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a <b>horizontal</b> <b>position,</b> with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{a robust}} control {{consists}} in designing a controller that stabilizes both {{the process for}} its nominal parameters values and the process when its nominal parameters vary. In this paper we present {{the design of a}} sub-optimal H? robust controller for an uncertain <b>horizontal</b> <b>positioning</b> control of an unloading machine. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>positioning</b> model was obtained from first-principle knowledge. The mass of the unloading machine was considered as an approximation of the real value, thus, uncertainties in the model were introduced. In order to improve the unloading rate of the furnace, and therefore to increase positioning process stability, the robust controller was designed using multiplicative uncertainties. The assessment of the robust controller is made via simulation considering both the nominal and the perturbed parameters cases...|$|R
50|$|Stereopsis {{was first}} {{explained}} by Charles Wheatstone in 1838: “… the mind perceives {{an object of}} three dimensions {{by means of the}} two dissimilar pictures projected by it on the two retinæ …”. He recognized that because each eye views the visual world from slightly different <b>horizontal</b> <b>positions,</b> each eye's image differs from the other. Objects at different distances from the eyes project images in the two eyes that differ in their <b>horizontal</b> <b>positions,</b> giving the depth cue of horizontal disparity, also known as retinal disparity and as binocular disparity. Wheatstone showed that this was an effective depth cue by creating the illusion of depth from flat pictures that differed only in horizontal disparity. To display his pictures separately to the two eyes, Wheatstone invented the stereoscope.|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the development of a}} visual stimulus generator to be used in neuroscience experiments with invertebrates such as flies. The experiment consists in the visualization of a fixed image that is displaced horizontally according to the stimulus data. The system is capable of displaying 640 x 480 pixels with 256 intensity levels at 200 frames per second (FPS) on conventional raster monitors. To double the possible <b>horizontal</b> <b>positioning</b> possibilities from 640 to 1280, a novel technique is presented introducing artificial inter-pixel steps. The implementation consists in using two video frame buffers containing each a distinct view of the desired image pattern. This implementation generates a visual effect capable of doubling the <b>horizontal</b> <b>positioning</b> capabilities of the visual stimulus generator allowing more precise and movements more contiguous.
