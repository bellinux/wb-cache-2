40|$|After {{a review}} of {{literature}} {{on the subject of}} vocational interests the authors go on to define the main problem investigated in this Study, that of determining the relationship between expressed and tested vocational interests of four groups of people (disadvantaged males and females and non disadvantaged males and females), in this case with grade students. A list of. 24 <b>interest</b> <b>areas</b> was used. The findings are tabulated, analyzed and discussed in detail. Differences were found with respect to expressed vs. tested <b>interest</b> <b>areas</b> as follows: disadvantaged males, three areas; advantaged males, ten areas; disadvantaged females, eleven areas; and advantaged females, two areas. Disadvantaged males showed greater <b>interest</b> in all <b>areas</b> than advantaged males, while the findings were mixed for female subjects. Males and females of both groups gave similar rank ordering to the <b>interest</b> <b>areas.</b> Some differences were found between high and low ability students. In comparison with national norms disadvantaged males displayed consistently higher scores. Recommendations for counselors, and others who interpret vocational interest information, are made in the following areas: sex differences, sociocultural differences, and ability differences.
