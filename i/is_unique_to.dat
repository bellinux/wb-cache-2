5|$|Molecular phylogenetics {{have shown}} that C.cirrhata forms a {{monophyletic}} clade with the remaining two species of Collybia. Because C.cirrhata {{is the only one}} of the three Collybia species lacking sclerotia, it has been suggested that this character trait is an anapomorphy—that <b>is,</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> a single, terminal species within a clade.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most {{successful}} insect groups, such Endopterygota, use a system of complete metamorphosis. Complete metamorphosis <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> a group of certain insect orders including Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. This form of development is exclusive and not seen in any other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The call or croak of a frog <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> its species. Frogs {{create this}} sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, {{the sound is}} amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of the}} mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E
5|$|Amman has {{a mostly}} Sunni Muslim population, {{and the city}} {{contains}} numerous mosques. Among the main mosques is the large King Abdullah I Mosque, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> Jordan. The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-coloured walls and Persian carpets. It was built by a Circassian resident of Amman. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, Ibadi, tassawuf-related Sufism, Muwahhidism and Salafism. Amman also has a small Druze community.|$|E
5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> argasid ticks.|$|E

5|$|Features that {{differentiate}} {{an animal}} from {{most or all}} others are called a diagnosis. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> a given organism. According to Xu (2010), Sinoceratops can be distinguished based on the following diagnostic characteristics: {{there are at least}} ten robust, strongly curved hornlike processes along the rear margin of the combined parietals, {{while at the same time}} at least four hornlike processes on the combined squamosals are present; there is a large accessory fenestra in front of the antorbital fenestra (differing from all other known centrosaurines); the external margin of the parietals is only weakly undulating (differing from all other known centrosaurines); and the presence of broad-based epoccipitals (differing from all other known centrosaurines).|$|E
5|$|In Victoria {{groups of}} {{locomotives}} {{of the same}} design are classed together by letter, in a system introduced in 1886. Initially low letters were given to passenger classes, and high letters for goods classes, but from about 1916 this pattern was discarded. Within classes locomotives are individually numbered, in a continuous number block which <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the class. In some cases locomotives have been renumbered to keep number blocks continuous, {{and in some cases}} there is no correlation between the number blocks used for the steam and diesel locomotives of the same class letter. In addition, some classes start the number series with a 0, while others start with a 1.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{amalgamation}} {{of design}} features from other revolvers {{made during the}} time period. The revolver has a design flaw in that the cylinder freewheels when not engaged, so during movement (such as in combat) it may rotate to an already fired chamber. Five distinct phases of production have different markings depending on the time and individual Type 26 produced. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the weapon. The Type 26 has a double-action only mechanism and is therefore difficult to aim accurately. The Type 26 {{was replaced by the}} Nambu pistol {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E
5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the Avon Gorge {{can be seen}} {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the breed. Historically however, {{there have also}} been examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E
40|$|Atmospheres of {{enclosed}} {{environments in}} which 20 m 2 stands of wheat, potato, and lettuce were grown were characterized and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A large number (in excess of 90) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified in the chambers. Twenty eight VOC's were assumed to be of biogenic origin for these were {{not found in the}} chamber atmosphere when air samples were analyzed in the absence of plants. Some of the compounds found <b>were</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> a single crop. For example, only 35 % of the biogenic compounds detected in the wheat atmosphere <b>were</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> wheat, while 36 % <b>were</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> potato and 26 % <b>were</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> lettuce. The number of compounds detected in the wheat (20 compounds) atmosphere was greater than that of potato (11) and lettuce (15) and concentration levels of biogenic and non-biogenic VOC's were similar...|$|R

5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene are unique to sebum and not produced as final products {{anywhere else in the}} body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> humans, and is implicated in the development of acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E
5|$|Settlers cleared {{much of the}} Catlins' coastal {{vegetation}} for farmland, but in {{some areas}} the original coastal plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges {{and some of the}} bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the forest. Plant life here includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds found in this exposed region. The Catlins coastal daisy (Celmisia lindsayii) <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the region, and is related to New Zealand's mountain daisies. Tussocks, hebes, and flaxes are common, as are native gentians, though sadly the endangered native sedge pingao can now rarely be found. In years when the southern rātā flowers well, the coastal forest canopy turns bright red. The rātā also thrives in some inland areas.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to video}} fluoroscopy, X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3mm in size, {{are placed in}} and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the University of Wisconsin.|$|E
