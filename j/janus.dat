5|$|Gottfried John as General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov: Commander of Russia's Space Division, {{secretly}} {{an agent}} of <b>Janus</b> who nefariously misuses his authority and position to assist <b>Janus</b> {{to gain access to}} the GoldenEye.|$|E
5|$|<b>Janus</b> and Epimetheus {{are called}} co-orbital moons. They are of roughly equal size, with <b>Janus</b> being {{slightly}} larger than Epimetheus. <b>Janus</b> and Epimetheus have orbits {{with only a few}} kilometers difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Janus</b> {{soon began}} getting {{requests}} for theatrical screenings of the film. <b>Janus</b> initiated a small tour of theatrical showings, including two sold-out {{shows at the}} 2009 New York Asian Film Festival. In January 2010, a remastered print of House by <b>Janus</b> began being shown theatrically across North America, with {{the first of the}} showings taking place at the IFC Center in New York City.|$|E

5|$|Frederick {{realized}} the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00pm, the entire Prussian army had struck camp, loaded their tents and gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry {{and moved toward}} the <b>Janus</b> and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. Except for a few moments, the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller's battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the <b>Janus</b> between the infantry's left and the cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Bond and Alec Trevelyan—agent 006—infiltrate an illicit Soviet {{chemical}} weapons facility and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes {{from the facility}} as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond witnesses the theft by criminal organisation <b>Janus</b> of a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an electromagnetic pulse. <b>Janus</b> uses the helicopter to steal the control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons, using the GoldenEye to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse; there are two survivors of the attack, a programmer, Natalya Simonova, and Boris Grishenko.|$|E
5|$|In London, M assigns Bond to {{investigate}} the attack. He flies to Saint Petersburg to meet CIA operative Jack Wade, who suggests that Bond meet with Valentin Zukovsky, a former KGB agent and business rival of <b>Janus.</b> Zukovsky arranges a meeting between Bond and <b>Janus.</b> Onatopp surprises Bond at the Grand Hotel Europe and attempts to kill him, but he overpowers her. She takes Bond to <b>Janus,</b> who reveals himself as Trevelyan; he faked his death at Arkhangelsk but was badly scarred by the explosion. A descendant of the Cossack clans who collaborated with the Nazi forces in the Second World War, Trevelyan had vowed revenge against the British after they betrayed the Cossacks, which drove his father to kill Trevelyan's mother and himself. Just as Bond is about to shoot Trevelyan, Bond is shot with a tranquilizer dart.|$|E
5|$|<b>Janus</b> Films {{released}} a restored {{version of the}} film on DCP that premiered on January 1, 2016, at Film Forum in New York City and Cinefamily in Los Angeles. This restored version is not derived from the Distribpix print.|$|E
5|$|Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan (006) / Janus: Initially another 00 {{officer and}} Bond's friend, he fakes his death at Arkhangelsk and then {{establishes}} the <b>Janus</b> crime syndicate {{in the following}} nine years.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the game takes place in 1995. Bond visits Monte Carlo to investigate the frigate La Fayette, where he rescues several hostages and plants a tracker bug on the Eurocopter Tiger helicopter before it is stolen by the <b>Janus</b> crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with Natalya Simonova, who has been betrayed to <b>Janus.</b> The two escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the GoldenEye satellite's EMP. Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet {{the chief of the}} <b>Janus</b> organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan – his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military archives for interrogation. Bond eventually manages to escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya, and communicate with Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery. Natalya is recaptured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase through the streets of St. Petersburg, eventually reaching an arms depot used by <b>Janus.</b> There Bond destroys its weaponry stores and then hitches a ride on Trevelyan's ex-Soviet missile train, where he kills Ourumov and rescues Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|While at Ashworth, in 2001 Brady wrote The Gates of <b>Janus,</b> {{which was}} {{published}} by Feral House, an underground US publisher. The book, Brady's analysis of serial murder and specific serial killers, sparked outrage when announced in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 66, Tiridates visited Rome {{to receive}} his crown and was lavishly {{received}} by Nero, {{who used the}} occasion to boost his own popularity. He ordered {{the gates of the}} Temple of <b>Janus</b> to be shut, thus declaring that peace reigned throughout the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{was staying}} in Moravia {{when he was}} {{informed}} {{that a group of}} Hungarian prelates and barons had offered the throne to Casimir, a younger son of King Casimir IV of Poland. The conspiracy was initiated by Archbishop John Vitéz and his nephew <b>Janus</b> Pannonius, Bishop of Pécs, who opposed war against the Catholic Vladislaus Jagiellon. Initially, their plan was supported by the majority of the Estates, but nobody dared to rebel against Matthias, enabling him to return to Hungary without resistance. Matthias held a Diet and promised to refrain from levying taxes without the consent of the Estates and to convoke the Diet in each year. His promises remedied most of the Estates' grievances and almost 50 barons and prelates confirmed their loyalty to him on 21 September. Casimir Jagiellon invaded on 2 October 1471. With Bishop <b>Janus</b> Pannonius's support, he seized Nyitra (now Nitra in Slovakia), but only two barons, John Rozgonyi and Nicholas Perényi, joined him. Within five months Prince Casimir withdrew from Hungary, Bishop <b>Janus</b> Pannonius died while fleeing, and Archbishop John Vitéz was forbidden to leave his see. Matthias appointed the Silesian Johann Beckensloer to administer the Archdiocese of Esztergom. Vitéz died and Beckensloer succeeded him in a year.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, in Monte Carlo, Bond follows Xenia Onatopp, {{a member}} of the <b>Janus</b> crime syndicate, who has formed a {{suspicious}} relationship with Charles Farrel, a Canadian Navy admiral. As Onatopp crushes the admiral to death with her thighs during sex, his credentials are stolen by Ourumov, who uses them to board a French Navy destroyer with Onatopp to steal a Eurocopter Tiger helicopter. Ourumov and Onatopp later fly the helicopter to a bunker in Severnaya, Siberia, where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the GoldenEye satellites, two Soviet electromagnetic weapon satellites from the Cold War. They program the first GoldenEye (Petya) to destroy the complex, and escape with programmer Boris Grishenko. Natalya Simonova, the lone survivor, contacts Boris and arranges to meet him in Saint Petersburg, where he betrays her to <b>Janus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{movie was}} also {{released}} by <b>Janus</b> Films {{as part of}} The Criterion Collection in both a single-disc CLV and a DualDisc CAV Laserdisc format. The additional features section on the CAV edition include the original theatrical trailer, an interview with Richard Lester, and his The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the outer planets has since been {{revolutionized}} {{by the use of}} unmanned space probes. The arrival of the Voyager spacecraft at Saturn in 1980–1981 resulted in the discovery of three additional moons—Atlas, Prometheus and Pandora, bringing the total to 17. In addition, Epimetheus was confirmed as distinct from <b>Janus.</b> In 1990, Pan was discovered in archival Voyager images.|$|E
5|$|The use of long-exposure {{photographic}} plates {{made possible}} the discovery of additional moons. The first to be discovered in this manner, Phoebe, was found in 1899 by W.H. Pickering. In 1966 the tenth satellite of Saturn was discovered by Audouin Dollfus, when the rings were observed edge-on near an equinox. It was later named <b>Janus.</b> A few years later it was realized that all observations of 1966 could only be explained if another satellite had been present {{and that it had}} an orbit similar to that of <b>Janus.</b> This object is now known as Epimetheus, the eleventh moon of Saturn. It shares the same orbit with Janus—the only known example of co-orbitals in the Solar System. In 1980, three additional Saturnian moons were discovered from the ground and later confirmed by the Voyager probes. They are trojan moons of Dione (Helene) and Tethys (Telesto and Calypso).|$|E
5|$|Upon Matthias's initiative, Archbishop John Vitéz and Bishop <b>Janus</b> Pannonius persuaded Pope Paul II {{to authorize}} them {{to set up}} a {{university}} in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) on 29 May 1465. The Academia Istropolitana was closed shortly after the Archbishop's death. Matthias was contemplating establishing a new university in Buda but this plan was not accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} attack and travels to Russia where he locates Simonova and learns that Trevelyan, who had faked his own death, {{was the head of}} <b>Janus.</b> Simonova tracks {{computer}} traffic to Cuba and she and Bond travel there and locate Trevelyan, who reveals his plan to steal money from the Bank of England before erasing all of its financial records with the GoldenEye, concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy. Bond and Simonova destroy the satellite facility, killing Trevelyan and Grishenko in the process.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{started the}} {{systematic}} {{collection of books}} after the arrival of his first librarian, Galeotto Marzio, a friend of <b>Janus</b> Pannonius from Ferrara in around 1465. The exchange of letters between Taddeo Ugoleto, who succeeded Marzio in 1471, and Francesco Bandini contributed {{to the development of}} the royal library because the latter regularly informed his friend of new manuscripts. Matthias also employed scriptors, illuminators, and book-binders. Although the exact number of his books is unknown, his Bibliotheca Corviniana was one of Europe's largest collections of books when he died.|$|E
5|$|The first {{high-resolution}} electron micrographs {{appeared in}} 1952, replacing the <b>Janus</b> Green stains as the preferred way of visualising the mitochondria. This {{led to a}} more {{detailed analysis of the}} structure of the mitochondria, including confirmation that they were surrounded by a membrane. It also showed a second membrane inside the mitochondria that folded up in ridges dividing up the inner chamber and that the size and shape of the mitochondria varied from cell to cell.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{photographs}} {{have led}} to other significant discoveries. They have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and Erings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off <b>Janus</b> and Epimetheus. In July 2006, Cassini images provided evidence of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, additional images near Titan's north pole revealed hydrocarbon seas, the largest of which is almost {{the size of the}} Caspian Sea. In October 2006, the probe detected an 8,000km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.|$|E
5|$|Stokvis {{was close}} to the {{influential}} German pathologist Rudolf Virchow. In 1879 Stokvis was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he served as vice-president of the Academy in 1896. He was awarded received an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Edinburgh in 1884. Stokvis also chaired the 1883 International Colonial Medicine Congress in Amsterdam. He was one of the founders (in 1896) of <b>Janus,</b> an international journal for the history of medicine. He is regarded as an illustrious member of Holland's medical dynasty, and as a pioneer in the fields of chemical physiology and chemotherapy. Together with Samuel Siegmund Rosenstein, professor of medicine in Leiden, he was a supporter of Aletta Jacobs, the first woman to qualify as a doctor in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The Act of Killing {{garnered}} {{awards and}} nominations {{primarily in the}} Best Documentary category and for Oppenheimer's direction, but also audience awards, special awards, and recognition for Signe Byrge Sørensen's production and editing by <b>Janus</b> Billeskov Jansen and Niels Pagh Andersen. Among its Best Documentary awards are a BAFTA, European Film Award, and a Robert Award, along with nominations for an Academy Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, Directors Guild of America Award, Independent Spirit Award, and International Documentary Association Award. Included {{in many of the}} awards was the anonymous Indonesian co-director, who was unable to share in the recognition because of the danger posed by his or her participation.|$|E
5|$|The French {{crews of}} Henri IV {{received}} a telegraph from Admiral de Gueydon, {{suggesting that the}} bombardment of the city would begin soon, which the crews welcomed with enthusiasm. By then, a large crowd of people in Rabat and Salé had gathered to observe the French ships after they were spotted by Moroccan artillery operators. Admiral de Gueydon decided against starting the bombardment until consul Elton was aboard Caton; the consul did not come aboard the ship until four hours later. At dawn on 26 November though, the British steamer <b>Janus</b> joined Caton, and took the consul as its passenger.|$|E
5|$|When Blake {{finds the}} bodies, he calls Nelson, who {{comes out to}} {{identify}} them. After Blake angrily demands an explanation, Nelson reluctantly reveals West's condition. Nelson believes West is somehow getting stronger the more his body decomposes. Back at Nelson's house, West attacks and kills Perry, although Judy is not harmed. Nelson and Blake arrive just as West escapes. West then stumbles upon {{the home of a}} married couple (played by Jonathan Demme and <b>Janus</b> Blythe). West kills the man and attacks his wife, but she drives him away after chopping his arm off with a cleaver. Blake receives a call about the attack and takes Nelson with him to investigate. They follow West to a giant power plant, and then up several flights of outside stairways.|$|E
5|$|When the Prussians broke camp, {{they left}} {{a handful of}} light troops to {{demonstrate}} before the French advance post commanded by the Comte de Saint Germain. These light troops constituted the flank guard on the Schartau hill, which lay {{at right angles to}} the <b>Janus</b> and Pölzen. Frederick had no intention of either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit twice as fast as the Allies' army. If, at the moment of contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.|$|E
5|$|Danielle {{arrives in}} Walford, having left her {{hometown}} of Telford and is befriended by local resident Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), who gives her a job on her market clothing stall and offers her the spare room in her family's home. Danielle quickly develops a crush on fellow stall-trader Callum Monks (Elliott Jordan), who leads her on {{in an attempt to}} make Stacey jealous but he helps her get a second job, cleaning at The Queen Victoria public house, where she gets caught in the feud between Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha <b>Janus)</b> and Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). Both try to use Danielle to get information from the other, with Archie persuading Danielle to steal Ronnie's post. Ronnie is furious when she realises and sacks Danielle after publicly berating her. Danielle is devastated, and is later seen clutching a locket containing a photograph of Ronnie, revealing herself to be Ronnie's long-lost daughter, Amy.|$|E
5|$|Halstead {{brought his}} prizes back to Britain, where both Argo and Mercury were {{purchased}} for service by the Royal Navy as HMS <b>Janus</b> and HMS Hermes respectively as {{both of the}} Batavian names were already in use by the Royal Navy. British losses in the engagement were one man killed and three wounded, all suffered on Phoenix during the engagement with Argo. Apart from the losses in that exchange, no other casualties, either British or Batavian were reported. The action was the only significant engagement fought off the Batavian coast during 1796 as Duncan's force kept the main Batavian fleet contained within its anchorage in the Texel. In October 1797 however the main Batavian fleet was able to break out and sail on a raiding cruise towards the English coast. Duncan intercepted the fleet on its return to the Texel and inflicted a decisive defeat on the Batavians on 11 October at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} playable {{characters}} are Frog and Magus. Frog originated in AD 600. He {{is a former}} squire once named Glenn, who was turned into an anthropomorphic frog by Magus, who also killed his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in AD 600 {{is in a state}} of conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals who wage war against humanity under the leadership of Magus, a powerful sorcerer. Magus's seclusion conceals a long-lost past; he was formerly known as <b>Janus,</b> the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, Schala. Lavos, the game's main antagonist who awakens and ravages the world in AD 1999, is an extraterrestrial, parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, {{receiving a}} severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still {{waiting at the}} <b>Janus,</b> into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an oblique angle. The mêlée drifted rapidly southward, past the Allied infantry. Part of the Allied reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring {{to catch up with}} the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but the sweep of horses and Allied infantry pulled them into the fighting. The Allied reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in echelon from the left. Those Allied units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry's infantry. Attempted French counterattacks dissolved into confusion. Most of the Allied cavalry units in front were smashed by the initial charge and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field was littered with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Janus</b> Chess is a chess variant {{played on}} a 10×8 board. It {{features}} one variant chess piece, the <b>janus,</b> with the combined moves of a bishop and a knight. The piece is named after the Roman god <b>Janus</b> because this god was usually depicted with two faces looking in opposite directions. The game starts with two januses on the board for each color. The <b>janus</b> {{is also known as}} an archbishop, cardinal, or princess, which varies based on the game it is used in. <b>Janus</b> Chess was invented in 1978 by Werner Schöndorf from Bildstock, Germany.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1797 <b>Janus</b> {{returned}} to Britain as escort to the homeward bound convoy. On 6 October 1797 <b>Janus</b> brought her convoy safe into The Downs.|$|E
25|$|M. Renard {{advanced}} {{the view that}} <b>Janus</b> and not Juppiter was the original paredra or consort of Juno, {{on the grounds of}} their many common features, functions and appearance in myth or rites as is shown by their cross coupled epithets <b>Janus</b> Curiatius and Juno Sororia: <b>Janus</b> shares the epithet of Juno Curitis and Juno the epithet <b>Janus</b> Geminus, as sororius means paired, double. Renard's theory has been rejected by G. Capdeville as not being in accord with the level of sovereign gods in Dumézil's trifunctional structure. The theology of <b>Janus</b> would show features typically belonging to the order of the gods of the beginning. In Capdeville's view it is only natural that a god of beginnings and a sovereign mother deity have common features, as all births can be seen as beginnings, Juno is invoked by deliverers, who by custom hold a key, symbol of <b>Janus.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Janus</b> {{particles}} are special types of nanoparticles whose surfaces {{have two or}} more distinct physical properties. This unique surface of <b>Janus</b> nanoparticles allows {{two different types of}} chemistry to occur on the same particle. The simplest case of a <b>Janus</b> nanoparticle is achieved by dividing the nanoparticle into two distinct parts, each of them either made of a different material, or bearing different functional groups. For example, a <b>Janus</b> nanoparticle may have one-half of its surface composed of hydrophilic groups and the other half hydrophobic groups. This gives these particles unique properties related to their asymmetric structure and/or functionalization.|$|E
