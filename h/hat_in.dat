5|$|In {{the western}} churches, the mitre was placed above the shield of all persons who were {{entitled}} to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the helmet of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops and not an ecclesiastical <b>hat.</b> <b>In</b> the Roman Catholic Church, {{the use of the}} mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat, and even in the arms of a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.|$|E
5|$|The Rio 2016 Organizing Committee {{originally}} {{estimated that}} the mascots could make up 25 percent of licensed merchandise sales in Rio. Overall, merchandise sales were 11 {{percent higher than the}} original targets, according to Rio 2016 spokesperson Mario Andrada. Two products, a <b>hat</b> <b>in</b> the shape of Vinicius's head and a pair of Havaianas bearing Vinicius, were, respectively, the best-selling and second-best-selling merchandise items during the 2016 Summer Olympics. Reporting for state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV), Lucrécia Franco at what was CCTV America back then commented that merchandise of the mascots, among other Olympic merchandise, has contributed to strengthened trade relations between China and Brazil.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears at a vanity, putting Curious on and {{earrings}} by Bulgari. She is then seen holding a top <b>hat</b> <b>in</b> {{front of her}} face, while doves fly out of another hat. Spears starts singing in the vanity but stands up and puts on a ringmaster jacket. She walks through an aisle while dancing suggestively with several circus dancers. Throughout the video, there are interspersed scenes of different circus performers, including ribbon dancers, contortionists, clowns and a mime on stilts. There are also scenes of Spears singing with the top hat, wearing a nude body stocking {{in front of a}} red curtain, with a spotlight on her. This is followed by a group dance scene {{in the middle of a}} circus ring, where Spears wears the ringmaster jacket, sequined hot pants and a feathered top <b>hat.</b> <b>In</b> the second verse, she dances with a chair and a whip wearing a nude bra covered in leaves. The video continues with a series of intercut scenes, such as Spears in slow motion in front of a shower of sparks, her surrounded by a pair of lions and in front of an elephant. During the bridge, Spears and her dancers perform a routine in front of flames. In the last chorus, Spears returns to the circus ring, surrounded by two elephants, many more circus performers, dancers and fire breathers. The video ends with Spears in the spotlight, laughing with the top hat over her head.|$|E
5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical <b>hat.</b> <b>In</b> England in 1976 a system for deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red tassels on each side. A priest uses {{a black and white}} cord with a single tassel on each side, and a deacon a hat without tassels. A Doctor of Divinity may have cords interwoven with red and a hat appropriate to the degree, and members of the Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose {{on the front of the}} hat. According to Boutell's Heraldry, this system represents the practice of the Church in England in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The prince found {{fulfillment}} {{in activities}} that required physical skills, {{rather than in the}} classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent farrier. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a frock coat and a top <b>hat</b> <b>in</b> more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.|$|E

25|$|Until recently, most sheriff's {{officers}} wore {{a standardized}} uniform (black pants and shirt with dark gray straw Stetson <b>hat</b> <b>in</b> {{the summer and}} a black felt Stetson <b>hat</b> <b>in</b> the winter with a black Class A jacket for the dress uniform and a black leather jacket for the winter) and all patrol vehicles were marked {{in the same manner}} (white with red stripes, etc.). Several counties have moved away from these practices. Patrol cars in these counties have different vehicle markings, and deputy sheriffs wear different uniforms. Some examples are Ulster County, which has dark gray uniforms similar to the New York State Police; and Warren County, whose deputy sheriffs wear tan shirts with dark brown pants. Dutchess County Deputy Sheriffs wear tactical Class B uniforms consisting of black shirts and black pants and a Class A uniform with light blue shirts with darker blue pants. In Suffolk County, the sheriff vehicles are black and white (similar to the police/sheriff vehicle scheme used in California). In New York City, deputy sheriffs wear a uniform very similar to sworn NYPD personnel. Ontario County Sheriff's deputies wear the traditional uniform; black pants, black shirt with brass buttons, and a black stetson.|$|E
