"ven 27years ago, {{there was}} nothing all that {{original}} or appealing about an ethnologically-minded mix of various world rhythms and random vocal snippets captured via shortwave radio. Anyone who claims these boys invented sampling clearly never heard Can or musiqueconcrete. Right off the bat, Everything ThatHappens WillHappen Today {{is a much more}} accessible, enjoyable and arguably better album than MyLifeintheBushofGhosts--at least <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> about conventional pop/rock songcraft." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to St. James's Palace, Churchill's {{attention}} was drawn towards other matters, and to a fresh face at court. [...] "I beg you will let me see you {{as often as you}} can", pleaded Churchill in a letter to Sarah Jennings, [...] "which I am sure you ought to do <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> for my love..." [...] Sarah Jennings' social origins were in many ways similar to Churchill's – minor gentry blighted by debt-induced poverty. After her father's death when she was eight, Sarah, together with her mother and sisters, moved to London. As Royalist supporters (despite the fact that Sarah's great uncle, James Temple, was convicted of regicide), the Jennings' loyalty to the crown, like the Churchill's, was repaid with court employment, and in 1673 Sarah followed her sister Frances into the household of the Duchess of York, Mary of Modena, second wife to James, Duke of York.|$|E

In India, {{there is this}} image that if you dress shabbily, you are a serious sportsperson. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> about dressing up, you aren't one. People are under the impression I lead an exciting life but honestly, all I do is sleep, eat and practice". Gutta is also a celebrity endorser and {{has been associated with}} several brands and services, also appearing on the covers of numerous magazines.|$|E
