50|$|A <b>hive</b> <b>frame</b> or honey {{frame is}} a {{structural}} element in a beehive {{that holds the}} honeycomb or brood comb within the hive enclosure. The <b>hive</b> <b>frame</b> is {{a key part of}} the modern movable-comb hive. It can be removed in order to inspect the bees for disease or to extract the excess honey.|$|E
50|$|Petro Prokopovych (1775-1850, Петро Прокопович) was {{the founder}} of {{commercial}} beekeeping. He introduced novelties in traditional beekeeping that allowed great progress in the practice. Among his most important inventions was a <b>hive</b> <b>frame</b> in a separate honey chamber of his beehive. He also invented a crude queen excluder between brood and honey chambers.|$|E
5000|$|Robert [...] "Bert" [...] Orlando Beater Manley (1888-1978) was a British beekeeper, an {{authority}} on commercial honey farming and developer of the popular Manley moveable <b>frame</b> <b>hives</b> and <b>frame</b> systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{commercial}} honey producers use Langstroth <b>hive</b> <b>frames.</b> The {{honey extraction}} process yields beeswax from the uncapping process. The highest quality beeswax is almost white. Lower quality beeswax from older cappings or comb is yellow or brown. Beeswax should be rendered and filtered {{before it is}} sold.|$|R
5000|$|In 1814 Petro Prokopovych {{invented the}} world's first beehive which used <b>hive</b> <b>frames.</b> Early prototypes {{had a large}} {{distance}} between frames, and the frame lay on supporting strips of wood. As a result, the frames were cross-attached by burr comb and propolized to the supporting strips and were difficult to remove. In Prokopovych's design, the frames were placed only in the honey chamber. In the brood chamber, the bees built the combs in free style.|$|R
40|$|The {{complex social}} {{structure}} of the honey bee hive {{has been the subject}} of inquiry since the dawn of science. Studying bee interaction patterns could not only advance sociology but find applications in epidemiology as well. Data on bee society remains scarce to this day as no study has managed to comprehensively catalogue all interactions among bees within a single hive. This work aims at developing methodologies for fully automatic tracking of bees and their interactions in infrared video footage. H. 264 video encoding was investigated as a means of reducing digital video storage requirements. It has been shown that two orders of magnitude compression ratios are attainable while preserving almost all information relevant to tracking. The video images contained bees with custom tags mounted on their thoraxes walking on a <b>hive</b> <b>frame.</b> The hive cells have strong features that impede bee detection. Various means of background removal were studied, with the median overone hour found to be the most effective for both bee limb and tag detection. K-means clustering of local textures shows promise as an edge filtering stage for limb detection. Several tag detection systems were tested: a Laplacian of Gaussian local maxima based system, the same improved with either support vector machines or multilayer perceptrons, and the Viola-Jones object detection framework. In particular, this work includes a comprehensive description of the Viola-Jones boosted cascade with a level of detail not currently found in literature. The Viola-Jones system proved to outperform all others in terms of accuracy. All systems have been found to run inreal-time on year 2013 consumer grade computing hardware. A two orders of magnitude file size reduction was not found to noticeably reduce the accuracy of any tested system...|$|E
5000|$|Heating method, {{first used}} by beekeepers in Eastern Europe in the 1970s, {{later became a}} global method. In this method, <b>hive</b> <b>frames</b> are heated to at least 104 °F (40 °C) for several hours at a time, which causes the mites to drop from the bees. [...] When {{combined}} with the perforated bottom board method, this can control varroa sufficiently to aid colony survival. In Germany, anti-varroa heaters are manufactured for use by professional bee keepers. A thermosolar hive has been patented and manufactured in the Czech Republic.|$|R

40|$|The {{sole purpose}} of a hive is to {{encourage}} the bees to build their nests {{in such a way}} that it is easy to manage and maintain them. This study examined four beehive types: namely improved <b>frame</b> <b>hive</b> (Zander model), Kenya Top Bar Hive (KTB), Ethio-ribrab hive and traditional log hives based on honey yield performance, honeybee colony strength and profitability under environmental condition of Bonga, southwest Ethiopia. The overall average annual honey yield performance clearly revealed both improved <b>frame</b> <b>hive</b> (30. 09 ± 2. 69 kg/hive) and Ethio-ribrab hive (29. 22 ± 2. 69 kg/hive) were significantly higher (p < 0. 0001) than KTB hive (15. 71 ± 2. 22 kg/hive) and traditional log hive (15. 36 ± 0. 86 kg/hive). In addition, the strength of honeybee colonies in the present study found to be higher in improved <b>frame</b> <b>hive</b> and Ethio-ribrab hive but medium in KTB hive and Traditional log hive. The total cost of production and gross return of improved <b>frame</b> <b>hive</b> was higher than Ethio-ribrab, KTB hive and traditional log hives.

Apart from this, {{on the ground floor}} there is a display of agricultural implements (for sowing, reaping, threshing), bread-making equipment (millstones, kneading boards, proving troughs, bread-stamps), bee-keeping equipment (<b>hives,</b> <b>frames,</b> an extractor for centrifuging the honey from the cells, skeps), carpentry equipment (vices, moulds for rooftiles and bricks, files, planes). On the mezzanine floor is the wherewithal for preparing and serving coffee, and on the first floor weaving equipment (a loom, a distaff, cards, a spinning wheel, carding machines), and tools and utensils for everyday use (cooking utensils, receptacles for carrying water, cauldrons, washing troughs, a brazier).|$|R
50|$|Other inventors, notably François Huber in 1789, had {{designed}} <b>hives</b> with <b>frames</b> (the so-called leafe or book hive), but Langstroth's hive was a practical movable <b>frame</b> <b>hive,</b> which overcame {{the tendency of}} the bees to fill empty spaces with comb and to cement smaller spaces together with propolis. In contrast to August von Berlepsch's frame-movable side-opened hive (May 1852, Germany), Langstroth's hive was top-opened, as was the Bevan top-bar hive (1848, UK). These combined adaptations led to the Langstroth hive design being preferred by beekeepers over all others, and his hive is used throughout the world.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the better hygienic behaviour determination method that is used in controlling against bee diseases and pests. Total forty honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera anatoliaca) were used and they were randomly divided into two groups (each group consists of twenty colonies) in first year. Liquid nitrogen method was used in the first group' colonies and pin-killing (needling process) method was used in the second group’ colonies to determine the effectiveness of methods for hygienic behaviour. Average clearance rate was found as 66. 25 % and 78. 10 % in the first (Liquid nitrogen application) and the second (pin-killing) groups respectively. In the second year, forty colonies were divided into five equal groups and each group consisted eight colonies. The first group consisted of 9 frames bees in standard langstroot <b>hive</b> (10 <b>frame</b> capacity), the second group consisted of 5 frames bees in standard langstroot <b>hive</b> (10 <b>frame</b> capacity), the third group consisted of 5 frames bees in ruşet <b>hive</b> (5 <b>frame</b> capacity), the forth group’s consisted of 3 frames bees in ruşet <b>hive</b> (5 <b>frame</b> capacity) and the fifty group consisted of queen mating hive. The pin-killing (needling process) method, tested in first year, was used for all groups to determine the effectiveness of colony population and the size of hive. Average clearance rates of the first, second, third, forth and fifth groups were 70. 54 %, 58. 38 %, 70. 63 %, 54. 96 % and 58. 21 % respectively. The colonies that belonged to the pin-killing (needling) group showed a higher cleaning behaviour rate than the other colonies. The density of bees in hive had an important effect on the clearance rate of colonies.

50|$|In entomology, {{the term}} brood {{is used to}} refer to the embryo or egg, the larva and the pupa stages in the life of {{holometabolous}} insects. The brood of honey bees develops within a bee hive. In man-made, removable <b>frame</b> <b>hives,</b> such as Langstroth <b>hives,</b> each <b>frame</b> which is mainly brood is called a brood frame. Brood frames usually have some pollen and nectar or honey in the upper corners of the frame. The rest of the brood frames cells may be empty or occupied by brood in various developmental stages. During the brood raising season, the bees may reuse the cells from which brood has emerged for additional brood or convert it to honey or pollen storage. Bees show remarkable flexibility in adapting cells to a use best suited for the hive's survival.|$|R
50|$|A technical-vocational program {{developed}} {{through the school}} in 1985 established a small iron and wood workshop in a modest building. With funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), tools were procured, and the first seven apprentices were trained. The workshop produced furniture, seedling racks, a sand sifter, bee-keeping <b>hives</b> and <b>frames,</b> and decorative and protective ironwork for windows and gates. However this program ceased around 2002 when the schools program focused on primary grades.|$|R
50|$|A top-bar hive is a single-story {{frameless}} beehive {{in which}} the comb hangs from removable bars. The bars form a continuous roof over the comb, whereas the frames in most current hives allow space for bees to move up or down between boxes. <b>Hives</b> that have <b>frames</b> or that use honey chambers in summer but which use similar management principles as regular top-bar hives are sometimes {{also referred to as}} top-bar hives. Top-bar hives are rectangular in shape and are typically more than twice as wide as multi-story <b>framed</b> <b>hives</b> commonly found in English speaking countries. Top-bar hives usually include one box only, and allow for beekeeping methods that interfere very little with the colony.|$|R
50|$|Natural queen {{exclusion}} occurs {{more frequently}} in top-bar hives, because the brood nest is separated from the honey section by at least a full bar of honey comb, {{and not just a}} few centimetres of honey as may be the case in a multi-storey <b>framed</b> <b>hive.</b> And the more honey is gathered, the further the brood nest becomes from newly created comb.|$|R
50|$|The white, finely-grained wood {{is not a}} {{structurally}} strong material but {{a classic}} choice for refined woodcarvings such as those by Grinling Gibbons for medieval altars. Linden wood was the prime choice for the carvings in St. Paul's Cathedral, Windsor Castle, and Chatsworth. It is also commonly used for lightweight projects such as carved spoons, light furniture, bee <b>hives</b> and honeycomb <b>frames.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In modern beekeeping, a Langstroth hive is any {{vertically}} modular bee <b>hive</b> that accepts <b>frames</b> {{that are}} locally {{referred to as}} [...] "Langstroth" [...] frames. The actual dimensions of so-called Langstroth frames differ by region or manufacturer. These modern Langstroth hives {{have little in common}} with Rev. L. L. Langstroth's bee hive that was originally patented in 1852 and manufactured until approximately 1920.|$|R
50|$|A small {{after-swarm}} {{has less}} {{chance of survival}} and may threaten the original hive's survival {{if the number of}} individuals left is unsustainable. When a hive swarms despite the beekeeper's preventative efforts, a good management practice is to give the reduced <b>hive</b> a couple <b>frames</b> of open brood with eggs. This helps replenish the hive more quickly and gives a second opportunity to raise a queen if there is a mating failure.|$|R
50|$|Of similar {{design is}} the {{standard}} beehive used {{in many parts of}} the world for beekeeping. The advantage of this hive is that the bees build honeycomb into frames, which can be moved with ease. The frames are designed to prevent bees from attaching honeycombs where they would either connect adjacent frames, or connect frames to the walls of the <b>hive.</b> The movable <b>frames</b> allow the beekeeper to manage the bees in a way which was formerly impossible.|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess beekeeping management practices and challenges in eastern zone of Tigray. A semi-structured questionnaire, field observation and focal group discussion were employed to collect primary data. Randomly selected three districts were used for the study. A total of 120 respondents were selected from the zone and 40 beekeepers from each district for the study. Both primary and secondary data were collected. Beekeepers indicated that <b>frame</b> <b>hive</b> technology was most preferred. Even though, some equipments such as casting mold and honey extractor were not durable and available as required. Study reveals <b>frame</b> <b>hive</b> was more productive than tradition in the study area. Trees, shrubs and herbs were major honey bee flora identified in the study area. Accordingly, honey produced specially from Leucas abyssinica is a special white and highly demanded honey in Tigray. Beekeepers indicated large amount of honey was harvested in September and October. However, low amount of honey harvested in July and August of the year. Bee forage and absconding due to pestes are major constraint honey bee production in the study area. Honey bees required feed supplementation during dry season; higher supplements were made during February to March and followed by December to January. The commonly used supplements were sugar, shuro and barely flour (besso). The study suggests that bee forage, absconding and pests and predators were the most constraints in the study area...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the Langstroth hive is {{commonly}} used. The Langstroth {{was the first}} successful top-opened <b>hive</b> with movable <b>frames.</b> Many other <b>hive</b> designs {{are based on the}} principle of bee space first described by Langstroth. The Langstroth hive is a descendant of Jan Dzierzon’s Polish hive designs. In the United Kingdom, {{the most common type of}} hive is the British National, which can hold Hoffman, British Standard or Manley frames. It is not unusual to see some other sorts of hive (Smith, Commercial, WBC, Langstroth, and Rose). Dadant and Modified Dadant hives are widely used in France and Italy where their large size is an advantage. Square Dadant hives - often called 12 frame Dadant or Brother Adam hives - are used in large parts of Germany and other parts of Europe by commercial beekeepers. The Rose hive is a modern design that attempts to address many of the flaws and limitations of other movable <b>frame</b> <b>hives.</b> The only significant weakness of the Rose design is that it requires 2 or 3 boxes as a brood nest which infers a large number of frames to be worked when managing the bees. The major advantage shared by these designs is that additional brood and honey storage space can be added via boxes of frames added to the hive. This also simplifies honey collection since an entire box of honey can be removed instead of removing one frame at a time.|$|R
5000|$|Some top bar hives do stack vertically, {{much like}} the Langstroth, National, or other <b>frame</b> <b>hives,</b> {{although}} vertical designs use bars with gaps between them, unlike the adjacent bars of the horizontal design. Vertical top bar hives have been largely unknown in the United States until about 2010. This {{is largely due to}} the work by Dr David Heaf, who, along with wife Patricia, translated a book by Abbé Emile Warré (~1852) from French and implemented some hives in 2007. These are commonly referred to as Warré Hives, but the abbé named them, [...] "The People's Hive," [...] for their intended economy and simplicity of construction.|$|R
50|$|In 1814, Petro Prokopovych, {{the founder}} of {{commercial}} beekeeping in Ukraine, invented {{one of the very}} first beehive frames. However, for easy operations in beehives the spaces between elements need to be correct. The correct distance between combs was described in 1845 by Jan Dzierżon as 1½ inches from the center of one top bar {{to the center of the}} next one. In 1848 Dzierzon introduced grooves into the hive's side walls replacing the strips of wood for moving top bars. The grooves were 8 x 8 mm, the spacing later termed bee space. The Langstroth hive was the first successful top-opened <b>hive</b> with movable <b>frames.</b> Langstroth <b>hive</b> was however a direct descendant of Dzierzon's hive designs.|$|R
5000|$|The Leaf Hive, {{invented in}} Switzerland in 1789 by François Huber, was a fully movable <b>frame</b> <b>hive,</b> but had solid frames that were {{touching}} {{and made up}} the [...] "box". The combs in this hive were examined like pages in a book. Langstroth acknowledged Huber's contribution: [...] "The use of the Huber hive had satisfied me that, with proper precautions, the combs might be removed without enraging the bees, and that these insects were capable of being tamed to a surprising degree. Without knowledge of these facts, I should have regarded a hive permitting {{the removal of the}} combs as quite too dangerous for practical use." [...] (Langstroth on the Honey-Bee, 1860) ...|$|R
5000|$|Prokopovych {{studied the}} biology of bee colonies and strove to improve {{existing}} methods of beekeeping. His main intention was to develop methods that allowed the least disturbance and damage to bees. These efforts resulted in 1814 in {{the invention of the}} world's first <b>frame</b> <b>hive,</b> which allowed an easier honey harvest. [...] Another invention was a wooden partition with apertures passable only by worker bees, now called a queen excluder. It made possible the harvest of pure honey from the frames. Prokopovych's inventions represented a landmark in the history of beekeeping and marked the beginning of commercial beekeeping. His scientific work resulted in more than sixty articles in printed media such as newspapers and magazines.|$|R
50|$|The charity is also {{assisting}} an area resident {{with her}} attempts {{to preserve a}} Monmouthshire farm. The resident had established a hive at her farm three years ago after taking a beekeeping course. In the summer of 2011, the colony was thriving. However, the following mild winter led to increased bee activity and ultimately {{the death of the}} colony, as determined by Nicola Bradbear of Bees for Development. The charity recommends a somewhat hands-off approach to beekeeping, suggesting top-bar hives that approximate a wild bee nest, in lieu of more traditional <b>frame</b> <b>hives.</b> The organisation is assisting the farmer with establishing an apiary that has both types of hives. Visitors to the farm will learn about two different approaches to beekeeping. In addition, plants beneficial to both hive and wild bees, including borage and phacelia, are being planted.|$|R
50|$|Langstroth {{constructed}} his hives so {{that the}} frames, in which the bees were to make their combs, could easily be separated from all adjacent parts of the hive — {{the walls of the}} hive, the floor of the hive, the cover of the <b>hive,</b> and other <b>frames</b> within the <b>hive.</b> To extract a frame from such a hive will not require any comb to be cut. Usually the most trouble a beekeeper encounters in removing a frame from such a hive results from the bees using propolis to bond frames to the brackets they rest upon. Being able to remove and replace combs so easily makes it possible — and practical — for beekeepers to inspect all of their hives on a regular basis. Such inspections, to check for signs of disease and/or parasites, imminent swarming, an aging queen, and other conditions requiring intervention, are essential to successful bee husbandry.|$|R
40|$|Ethiopia is {{a leading}} honey {{producer}} in Africa {{and one of the}} ten largest honey producing countries in the world. Despite the favorable agro-ecology for honey production and the number of bee colonies the country is endowed with, the level of honey production and productivity in the country is still low. The annual average honey production per hive is as low as 6 - 7 kg. One of the prominent factors for this low honey productivity is traditional hive and lack of improved beekeeping management techniques. With the aim of enhancing the level of honey production both in quantity and quality, the Improving Productivity and Market Success (IPMS) project introduced a participatory market oriented value chain development approach in Fogera and with a group of stakeholders worked on improving production, input supply and marketing. The project partners trained beekeepers on colony splitting, hive making and seasonal bee colony management practices. In addition, the project facilitated the establishment of beekeeping input supply shop and advised beehive producers (carpenters) on the proper design of top-bar and frame-type hives. The adoption rate of the improved beekeeping has been improved substantially after the skill development trainings and production of appropriate beehives in the district. The number of improved beehives adopted in the district increased from 200 in 2006 to 882 in 2009, following the 2007 and 2009 beekeeping training through technical and financial support of IPMS project. Through the beekeeping technology transformation, the average annual honey productivity per hive has also increased from 7 to 13 kg by changing the hives from traditional to top-bar <b>hives</b> and <b>frame</b> <b>hives.</b> In addition to what has been achieved in enhancing the level of honey production, the technology transformation also improved honey quality substantially. At present, productivity is at a level which leaves room for improvement. Challenges ahead will concern marketing of honey production as prices do not yet reflect the use of improved beehives. Accordingly, better linkages to appropriate markets, introduction to different markets for liquid honey, establish honeybee products marketing cooperatives still have to be investigated and/or developed. From this intervention we have learned that the introduction of improved beekeeping technology and associated practices coupled with strengthening the involvement of other stakeholders along the value chain will enhance productivities of beekeeping business. Smallholders’ beekeepers household income maximized through honey and beeswax productivity increment per hive and input suppliers improved their income through selling of hives, top-bars, and other accessories {{as a result of the}} project intervention.

5000|$|A {{growing number}} of amateur beekeepers are {{adopting}} various top-bar hives similar to the type commonly found in Africa. Top bar hives were originally used as a traditional beekeeping method in Greece and Vietnam with a history dating back over 2000 years. These <b>hives</b> have no <b>frames</b> and the honey-filled comb is not returned after extraction. Because of this, the production of honey {{is likely to be}} somewhat less than that of a frame and super based hive such as Langstroth or Dadant. Top bar hives are mostly kept by people who are more interested in having bees in their garden than in honey production per se. Some of the most well known top-bar hive designs are the Kenyan Top Bar Hive with sloping sides, the Tanzanian Top Bar Hive with straight sides, and Vertical Top Bar Hives, such as the Warre or [...] "People's Hive" [...] designed by Abbe Warre in the mid-1900s.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{harvested}} {{by humans}} by stimulating colonies with movable <b>frame</b> <b>hives</b> to produce queen bees. Royal jelly is collected from each individual queen cell (honeycomb) when the queen larvae are about four days old. It is collected from queen cells {{because these are}} the only cells in which large amounts are deposited; when royal jelly is fed to worker larvae, it is fed directly to them, and they consume it as it is produced, while the cells of queen larvae are [...] "stocked" [...] with royal jelly much faster than the larvae can consume it. Therefore, only in queen cells is the harvest of royal jelly practical. A well-managed hive during a season of 5-6 months can produce approximately 500 g of royal jelly. Since the product is perishable, producers must have immediate access to proper cold storage (e.g., a household refrigerator or freezer) in which the royal jelly is stored until it is sold or conveyed to a collection center. Sometimes honey or beeswax {{is added to the}} royal jelly, which is thought to aid its preservation.|$|R
50|$|In modern {{removable}} <b>frame</b> <b>hives</b> {{the nursery}} area {{is in the}} brood chamber, which beekeepers prefer {{to be in the}} bottom box. In the late winter and early spring as the brood cycle begins, the queen starts to lay eggs within the winter cluster in proximity to available honey stores. Honey bees tend to greatly expand the brood chamber as the season progresses. The relative location of the brood chamber within the beehive may also change as bee keepers add more boxes or as wild bees build fresh comb into available cavities. Some beekeepers ensure that the queen will not go into the upper boxes (called supers or honey supers) by placing a screen called a queen excluder between the boxes. The screen has precisely measured open spaces through which a worker bee can pass, but not a queen. Some beekeepers do not use excluders, but try to keep the queen within the intended brood area by keeping a honey barrier of capped honey, which the queen is reluctant to cross, above the brood. In feral hives the honey bees tend to put the brood at bottom center of the cavity, and honey to the sides and above the brood, so beekeepers are trying to follow the natural tendency of the bees.|$|R
