5|$|The {{early part}} of the 20th century saw a number of {{implants}} made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket). Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by Per-Ingvar Brånemark). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal's positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} a {{critical}} and commercial success; with more than 3.5 million copies of the game sold, {{it is the most}} successful game by developer id Software to date. Critics praised the game's graphics and presentation, although reviewers were divided by <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> gameplay was to that of the original Doom, focusing primarily on simply fighting through large numbers of enemy characters. The game was followed by , an expansion pack developed by Nerve Software in April 2005, while a Doom film loosely based on the series was released in October 2005. A series of novelizations of Doom 3, written by Matthew J. Costello, debuted in February 2008. An expanded and improved BFG Edition was released {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} ultimately stayed {{far away}} from the coast, and the heavy rainfall and thunderstorms remained at least 50miles (85km) offshore. While nearly stationary, Hurricane Ella produced waves of 5 to 9feet (2 to 3metres) in height, as well as rip currents along the coast. The highest wind gust from the storm over land was 31mph (50km/h) at Diamond Shoal Light. The waves reached the dunes along most beaches, causing some minor beach erosion; the depleted sand returned within a few days. Further north, along the coast of Virginia, no large waves were reported, which was considered unusual for <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> hurricane was to the state.|$|E

25|$|The Speaker is {{required}} to perform his or her office impartially, but does not resign {{from his or her}} party membership upon taking office, as is done in the United Kingdom. Speaker Lucien Lamoureux decided to follow the custom of the Speaker of the British House of Commons and ran in the 1968 election as an independent. Both the Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative Party agreed not to run candidates against him. The New Democratic Party, however, declined to withdraw their candidate. Lamoureux was re-elected and continued to serve as Speaker. However, in the 1972 election, the opposition parties did not come to an agreement and ran candidates against him. Lamoureux was again returned but no subsequent Speakers have repeated his attempt to run as an independent. The opposition parties may have chosen not to follow the 1968 precedent because of <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> election was: it produced a Liberal minority government with just two more seats than the Conservatives.|$|E

25|$|Drifting {{competitions}} {{are judged}} based on line, angle, speed, style and show factor. Line involves taking the correct line, {{which is usually}} announced beforehand by judges. The show factor is based on many things, such {{as the amount of}} smoke, <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> car is to the wall or designated clipping point, and the crowd's reaction. Angle is the angle of a car and more importantly the turned wheels in a drift, speed is the speed entering a turn, the speed through a turn, and the speed exiting the turn; faster is better. Style is scored on a combination of a rate-to-angle during the initiation, how fluid the car looks through the course, and how committed the driver is through the course. The rate-to-angle is how quickly during initiation or Furidashi (振り出し:starting point) and transitions or Furikaeshi (振替し:transfer) a car gets to its sliding angle. Fluidity is how smoothly a driver maneuvers their car around the course, taking into account the amount of correction that a driver applies through the turn(s), and the smoothness with which the car transitions from one corner to the next. Commitment is about how much throttle the driver applies, and the confidence and dedication the driver shows when approaching track edges and barriers. That is the quicker the driver is able to come to angle, the more speed and angle they can carry through the course, the fewer corrections they apply through the course and the closer they drive to the track edges or barriers, the higher the style score.|$|E
500|$|Accuracy of {{coupling}} factor {{depends on the}} dimensional tolerances for the spacing of the two coupled lines. For planar printed technologies this {{comes down to the}} resolution of the printing process which determines the minimum track width that can be produced and also puts a limit on <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> lines can be placed to each other. [...] This becomes a problem when very tight coupling is required and [...] couplers often use a different design. [...] However, tightly coupled lines can be produced in air stripline which also permits manufacture by printed planar technology. [...] In this design the two lines are printed {{on opposite sides of the}} dielectric rather than side by side. [...] The coupling of the two lines across their width is much greater than the coupling when they are edge-on to each other.Matthaei et al., pp.585–588, 776–778 ...|$|E
500|$|The two central {{characters}} {{can fight}} off and defeat spirits using the series' recurring Camera Obscura, a camera that captures spirits. Shots {{taken by the}} Camera Obscura deal varying amounts of damage based on <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> ghost is, {{the angle of the}} shot, and the film used. These factors are taken together to determine how many points the player is awarded for a shot. The most damaging type of shot is the [...] "Fatal Frame", which is achieved if a shot is taken when the ghost is attacking. Points are used as the in-game currency, which can be used to at save points to purchase items such as medicine and other items. Blue gems scattered around the environment can be used to upgrade the Camera Obscura, with some upgrades speeding reload time or enabling shots to deal more damage. Types of film range from an unlimited low-quality film that deals little damage to rarer and more powerful film types.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2015, Garland participated in The Basketball Tournament (TBT), a five-on-five, single-elimination {{basketball}} tournament in which the winner out of the 96 teams wins a total of $1 million. He competed for a team made up of former La Salle men's basketball players, called 20th & Olney, reuniting with Ramon Galloway, Steve Zack, and Tyreek Duren. Explorers video coordinator Andrew McGlynn, who acted as the team's general manager and coach, said, [...] "The main reason [...] is <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> program is here.

500|$|Skills {{are usually}} {{improved}} by gaining experience orbs, which are released from defeated enemies. The type of orb released varies, {{depending on how}} the player dispatched the foe; for instance, killing an enemy with a gun will earn Firearms orbs, while running them over with a vehicle earns Driving orbs. More powerful enemies release more experience orbs. However, Agility orbs are awarded differently: they can be earned by either climbing buildings and seeking them on rooftops, or by killing an enemy from a high altitude. The player can also compete in [...] "rooftop races"—a race through a series of waypoints across the rooftops of Pacific City—or car races to gain Agility and Driving orbs, respectively. A few special orbs, well-hidden, increase all character abilities when found. A final way to collect orbs is by earning Xbox Live Achievements, which rewards the player with orbs from every skill category. Each skill has five levels—beginning with zero stars, and ending with four—with a numeric gauge on the display to indicate <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> player is to the next level. Should the character die, or injure civilians or Agency peacekeepers, their experience gain will be slowed, making it temporarily harder to improve the character's traits.|$|E
500|$|The game {{itself is}} {{presented}} in a more realistic and immersive style; the rendered stages and characters of previous games are replaced by full motion video, shot from the first-person perspective of the lead guitarist, simulating real-world concert settings. The video footage is dynamic, and can transition between versions featuring positive or negative reactions by the crowd and band members based upon the player's performance. The first-person footage utilizes session musicians as actors playing the remaining members of the band, and is filmed using a Bolt robotic camera system, programmed to simulate the motions of a guitarist on stage. The Bolt ran along a [...] track, {{and was able to}} move and turn quickly, mimicking the speed of a musician's movements. Prior to filming with the Bolt, an actor outfitted with motion and position detectors acted out the song with the other band actors; these movements were recorded and then used to direct the Bolt as it replaced the actor in subsequent takes. To avoid injury to the other actors from the motions of the camera, the routines were all choreographed based on the camera's motions and used as cues for the other actors. To enable smoother transitions between positive and negative versions of the band footage, multiple takes were performed for each song using the same camera motions. Groups of 200 to 400 actors were filmed using a green screen to construct crowds; using varying takes and other editing techniques, the groups of actors could be made to cover much larger areas. To simulate larger crowds, these shots were superimposed on a combination of live footage from actual rock concerts and 3D models constructed by FreeStyleGames. The effects studio Framestore helped with editing and assembling the digital live-action footage. Positional audio effects are also used as part of the footage, varying the volume of certain instruments depending on <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> player is to them on-screen in the footage.|$|E
