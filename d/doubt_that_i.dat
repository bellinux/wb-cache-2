500|$|The Rio Branco Cabinet, {{increasingly}} divided, {{resigned in}} June 1875 after having served for four years. The Cabinet's viability had been impaired by the ongoing crisis with the Catholic Church {{and an international}} financial crash that caused the failure of several Brazilian banks. The Emperor attempted, without success, to convince Paranhos to continue {{as head of the}} government. Paranhos replied in a letter: [...] "Your Majesty knows that I wish to deliver my post to whoever is better to occupy it. If I have not become sick in public thus far, there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am tired." [...] PedroII had no intention on naming the 2nd Viscount of Uruguai as Rio Branco's replacement, to prevent the ultraconservative faction from coming to power. Instead, he called on the Duke of Caxias to head a new cabinet.|$|E
500|$|Posted to RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, Jones was put {{in charge}} of the Motor Transport Repair Section and made acting (later permanent) Officer Commanding Workshops. He was highly {{regarded}} for his technical and administrative ability but rated only [...] "average" [...] in command and dealing with personnel. In 1926 he took up flight instruction and within a year had been graded a 1A Flying Instructor. He was promoted to squadron leader on 31 March 1927 and given command of Flying Squadron at No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS). Jones spent two years in Britain from 1928, attending the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and graduating top of his class at the RAF's Central Flying School. He later recalled of this posting, [...] "The social life was new to me, as was the etiquette... I learned as fast as I could, but I have no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> unwittingly committed many a social blunder." [...] As the RAAF's senior officer in the UK, Jones had expected to be invited to accompany the airship R101 on its maiden flight to India. Instead another Australian officer was nominated to make the trip, and Jones avoided the disaster which followed.|$|E

500|$|Friction emerged at McLaren {{over the}} race weekend. Fernando Alonso {{publicly}} criticised the power unit provided by local company Honda. When being overtaken by Max Verstappen on lap 27, Alonso yelled [...] "GP2 engine, GP2!" [...] {{on the team}} radio, comparing his power unit with those of Formula One's feeder series. Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: [...] "I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating {{when you see the}} other cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. You look in the mirror on the straight to look for them and they are already side by side with you. The deficit we have on power is like another category." [...] Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: [...] "It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show." [...] Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner. The row in the team, which The Daily Telegraph described as being a [...] "complete meltdown", came amidst speculation about the future of both drivers. Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in [...] earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later. After the race, Alonso had also left his future with the team open, but made it clear a day later that he intended to end his career with the team, writing: [...] "No one should have any <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have three years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything." [...] About his comments on the team radio he said: [...] "We keep working hard. We all want to win and sometimes transmit the team radios, but it should be private chats." ...|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{formed a}} {{formidable}} centre-back pairing with Jon Ashton the following {{season as the}} team started putting a decent run of form together during late August and throughout September 2009; with the defence being particularly tight. He scored his first goal of the 2009–10 season on his 50th appearance for the club, giving Stevenage the lead in a 3–1 victory over Salisbury City in October 2009. A month later, he doubled his goal tally, scoring the second goal in Stevenage's 2–0 victory against Chester City, before notching his third goal {{of the season in}} a 6–0 win over Vauxhall Motors in the FA Trophy. Roberts' fourth goal of the campaign came during another 6–0 win, this time at Eastbourne Borough, side-footing the ball into the net from a well-worked free-kick. He scored his fifth goal of the season in a 3–0 win over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow, sliding the ball into the net from close range. Roberts led the side out in their 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough in April 2010; the game that ultimately secured promotion to the Football League {{for the first time in}} the club's history, winning the league with two games to spare. Roberts played a total of 49 times during the season, scoring five times from defence. He was also named as the Conference Premier Player of the Month for April 2010. Stevenage had the best defensive record in the league, conceding just 24 goals in 46 league matches, as well as ending the season having not conceded in their last six games; and conceding just two goals in their last 15 league matches. In May 2010, Roberts signed a new two-year contract with Stevenage. On signing the new deal, Roberts said [...] "there was never any <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to stay here, I love the club and love the fans. It will be a privilege to lead the team in the Football League". At the Football Conference's Annual Presentation Dinner, he was named in the Team of the Year, alongside fellow Stevenage defenders Ronnie Henry and Scott Laird.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{criticized by}} rivals for his {{perceived}} levels of wealth, Bajatović once remarked, [...] "I am a Socialist, but I {{do not want}} to be a social case." [...] On another occasion, he said, [...] "I have no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am one of the most strongly attacked and criticized figures in the country, who is believed to be immensely rich. Sometimes I am accused of being overbearing because I am opinionated and do not flinch from expressing my views.

2500|$|In 2007, Roy Hattersley, former Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and minister, {{reported}} {{on a visit to}} Charterhouse in the Guardian newspaper. After describing his impression that [...] "'s geometric spires and minarets proclaim complete confidence that Charterhouse educates men who are destined to rule the universe", he said: [...] "Academically and pastorally, it is near to beyond criticism. And after only a brief glimpse of the school, I have no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would have been ecstatically happy there. But its existence allows the rich and the powerful to ignore the world beyond its boundaries."

2500|$|On November 22, 1963, Connally {{was seriously}} wounded while riding in President Kennedy's car at Dealey Plaza in Dallas when the {{president}} was assassinated. Connally suffered three broken ribs, a punctured lung and a shattered wrist and had a bullet lodged in his leg. He underwent four hours of surgery after the shooting and recovered from his wounds. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–64 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by 24 year old ex-Marine Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. Connally did not dispute this conclusion but did {{for the rest of}} his life question the single bullet theory. In 1966, he told the press, [...] "I am convinced beyond any <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not struck by the first bullet," [...] and added, [...] "but just because I disagree with the Warren Commission on this one finding does not mean I disagree with their overall findings." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Tansman's letters {{states that}} [...] "it {{is obvious that}} I owe much to France, but {{anyone who has ever}} heard my {{compositions}} cannot have <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been, am and forever will be a Polish composer." [...] After Chopin, Tansman may be the leading proponent of traditional Polish forms such as the polonaise and the mazurka; they were inspired by and often written in homage to Chopin. For these pieces, which ranged from lighthearted miniatures to virtuoso showpieces, Tansman drew on traditional Polish folk themes and adapted them to his distinctive neoclassical style. However, he did not write straight settings of the folk songs themselves, as he states in a radio interview: [...] "I have never used an actual Polish folk song in its original form, nor have I tried to reharmonize one. I find that modernizing a popular song spoils it. It must be preserved in its original harmonization." ...|$|E
