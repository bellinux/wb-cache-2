2500|$|Patrick recounts {{that he had}} {{a vision}} a few years after {{returning}} home:I saw a man coming, as it were from Ireland. His name was Victoricus, and he carried many letters, and he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of them. I read the heading: [...] "The Voice of the Irish". As I began the letter, I imagined in that moment that I heard the voice of those very people who were near the wood of Foclut, which is beside the western sea—and they cried out, as with one voice: [...] "We appeal to you, holy servant boy, to come and walk among us." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My 25 {{years in}} {{literature}} {{have not been}} easy. While fully aware of how weak and inadequate my efforts have been, I still feel like I've every reason to continue: I never came under somebody else's flag, and my writing, good or bad, it's {{not for me to}} judge, contained only what I myself felt and thought. I remained true to my own understanding of things, never violating for any fleeting reason the modest talent nature <b>gave</b> <b>me.</b> <b>One</b> of my guiding lights has always been my desire to tell my country the truth about itself. Whether or not I succeeded, is not for me to tell," [...] Pisemsky said in reply.|$|E
60|$|He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> other nod, {{compressed}} the post-office exceedingly, <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> last nod, {{and went}} on with his breakfast.|$|E

60|$|This time he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of his searching looks, {{and it was}} not unmixed with astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Poirot <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> look, which {{conveyed}} a wondering pity, and {{his full}} {{sense of the}} utter absurdity of such an idea.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't," [...] Hawtrey answered. [...] "She <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one,</b> {{but somehow}} it got mislaid on house-cleaning. That's rather an admission, isn't it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{raised her}} face all {{streaming}} with tears, all disordered with emotion, and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> appealing look--"False to you!--they {{told me you}} were dead!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>ONE,</b> {{for one of}} my sons. The {{first choice}} is Sam's right, {{even if he had}} not {{deserved}} it by his brave patient obedience." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of his stern glances; {{you will}} say, perhaps, I {{deserved}} it; but I think the deuce prompts me with teasing questions on some occasions.|$|E
60|$|LORD LOAM. Certainly, certainly. Still, you know, as a peer of the realm--(with dignity)--I think, Ernest, {{you might}} have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of your adventures.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} myself," [...] was the quick response. [...] "I thought Dad {{would be so}} mad that he would <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> {{everlasting}} licking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one comes}} from Than Kosis without {{carrying}} an order or the password. You must <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> {{or the other}} before you may pass." ...|$|R
60|$|I don't {{remember}} how {{soon it was}} I spoke to Geoffrey Dawling; his sittings were irregular, but it was certainly the very next time he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The Countess <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of her serious looks. [...] "Come," [...] she said, [...] "what was it--this famous {{situation}} of yours? I have heard {{you mention it}} before." ...|$|E
60|$|I sought fervidly {{to reassure}} her on this point.... At length when {{we went into the}} house she drew away from me at arm's length and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> long searching look, as though seeking to read my soul.|$|E

6000|$|... "But I want a kiss," [...] he protested. [...] "You'd have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> {{the other}} night. You'd have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> {{as many as}} I'd liked. You almost clung to me--that night under the cedar tree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be horrid," [...] {{she said}} in a low tone. [...] "Of course I wanted to see you. I wanted to explain. <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of your cigarettes." ...|$|R
6000|$|I bowed, {{and left}} Betteredge {{to show him}} to his room. Betteredge <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> look at parting, which said, as if in so many words, [...] "You have caught a Tartar, Mr. Jennings--and the name of him is Bruff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She did,' replied Robert; 'I {{was going}} to tell you. She <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of her sweetest, {{brightest}} smiles, such as only she can give. You know them, Phoebe. No assumed welcome, but a sudden flash and sparkle of real gladness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He doesn’t care a bit," [...] said Mrs. Negget, {{somewhat}} sadly. [...] "He {{used to keep}} buttons in {{that box}} with the lozenges until one night he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> by mistake. Yes, you may laugh—I’m glad you can laugh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was here," [...] said Topsy, {{wiping the}} tears from her eyes. [...] "O, Miss Eva, I've been a bad girl; but won't you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one,</b> too?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Do <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> {{of those}} hares,' she said; 'we have just got {{visitors}} {{who are going}} to stay to dinner, and there's nothing we can give them to eat.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he decided, [...] "there's a crack {{some way}} up that should {{give me a}} hold, {{and a bit of}} a {{projection}} you could rest a foot on yonder. Then if you <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> hand, I could lower you down." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{took him}} over to the oak, and Polly Ann told him the story. He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> look, I remember, and there was more of {{gratitude}} in it than in a thousand words. Then he seized a piece of cold cake from the stone.|$|E
60|$|She <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>one</b> look--the wickedest look I ever saw, {{and burst}} out laughing--the harshest laugh I ever {{heard from a}} woman's lips. Turning away from me {{directly}} after, she said no more, and never referred to the subject again on any subsequent occasion.|$|E
