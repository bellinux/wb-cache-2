5|$|In mid-2005, Salzgeber's then-current Grand Prix mount, Wall Street, was euthanized {{following}} {{an episode of}} colic. This, combined with the recent retirement of Rusty, left her with no Grand Prix-level horses. Wall Street, while a relatively successful dressage horse, had suffered health problems and {{had never been able}} to compete with Rusty as Salzgeber's top horse. In 2008, Salzgeber again began competing at the Grand Prix level on Herzruf's Erbe, who would develop into one of her top international horses. In that year, the pair won the Otto Lorke Prize, given each year to the best German Grand Prix horse under 10 years old. During 2008, Salzgeber and Herzruf's Erbe had won 10 Grand Prix competitions. In 2009, the pair were expected to compete at the European Dressage Championships, but were not chosen for the German team after Herzruf's Erbe sustained an injury at a competition in July. The immediate <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> a severely pulled tendon, although a later <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> that the horse had strained a suspensory muscle, expected to heal in about three months. By early 2010, the horse was again able to be ridden, but was still not in top condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a {{granulated}} surface {{on the left side of}} Cleveland's hard palate. Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> recorded, it is {{designated}} either Present on Admission (POA) or not. If the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> POA, {{it is not}} demoted.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the acute}} hemodynamic {{deterioration}} associated with myocardial rupture, the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> generally made based on physical examination, {{changes in the}} vital signs, and clinical suspicion. The <b>diagnosis</b> can <b>be</b> confirmed with echocardiography. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> ultimately made at autopsy.|$|R
50|$|A {{definitive}} <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> chronic non-malignant lymphoproliferation and/or elevated {{peripheral blood}} DNTs plus one primary accessory criterion. A probable <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> the same but with one secondary accessory criterion.|$|R
5|$|Sheila's {{mental health}} {{continued}} to decline, with episodes of banging {{her head against}} walls. In 1983, her family doctor referred her to Dr. Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who had treated June. Ferguson said she was in an agitated state, paranoid and psychotic. She was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, a private psychiatric facility in Northampton, where {{she was diagnosed with}} schizoaffective disorder, although Ferguson said this <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> a mistake and that she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were {{much closer to}} those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> not then well established. Amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last year has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called caf√© au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E
50|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} {{based on}} symptoms. Conditions {{that may result}} in similar symptoms include testicular torsion, inguinal hernia, and testicular cancer. Ultrasound can be useful if the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> unclear.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> often {{suspected}} {{in patients}} in extremis (close to death) with abdominal trauma or with relevant risk-factors. <b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> confirmed {{quickly in the}} Emergency room by ultrasound or CT scan.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> clinical, {{seeking a}} history of eye injury. An {{important}} differential <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), which {{is thought to have}} the same pathogenesis, without {{a history of}} surgery or penetrating eye injury.|$|R
5|$|In 1990, Wilkinson's wife, Martha, {{announced}} that she would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1991. The move was widely seen as a surrogate candidacy so that her husband could continue his administration for a second consecutive term. Her challengers included Lieutenant Governor Jones, Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler, and Dr. Floyd G. Poore, the former Kentucky highway director. With polls consistently showing little support for her candidacy, Mrs. Wilkinson {{dropped out of the}} race in May 1991. Earlier in the year, Wallace Wilkinson was diagnosed with limited-stage Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> also a factor in Ms. Wilkinson's withdrawal from the race. Wallace underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, then received radiation therapy at the University of Kentucky. These treatments eliminated all signs of the disease by 1993, and doctors gave Wilkinson an excellent chance of recovery.|$|E
5|$|Not {{included}} in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on {{by the use of}} gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims. The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached , enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases. A total of 42workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December, one of Albert's doctors, William Jenner, {{diagnosed}} typhoid fever. Albert died at 10:50p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in {{the presence}} of the Queen and five of their nine children. The contemporary <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> typhoid fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert was ill for at least two years before his death, which may indicate that a chronic disease, such as Crohn's disease, renal failure, or abdominal cancer, was the cause of death.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{contemplated}} {{based upon}} patient symptoms. <b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> confirmed during intravenous urography, by obtaining erect and supine films. The renal DMSA scan may show decreased counts {{in the sitting}} position compared with supine scan.|$|R
5000|$|Criteria for <b>diagnosis</b> <b>were</b> {{agreed in}} 1999. For instance, an {{antibody}} deficiency can be diagnosed {{in the presence}} of low immunoglobulins, recurrent infections and failure of the development of antibodies on exposure to antigens. The 1999 criteria also distinguish between [...] "definitive", [...] "probable" [...] and [...] "possible" [...] in the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency. [...] "Definitive" [...] <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> made when it is likely that in 20 years, the patient has a >98% chance of the same diagnosis being made; this level of <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> achievable with the detection of a genetic mutation or very specific circumstantial abnormalities. [...] "Probable" [...] <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> made when no genetic <b>diagnosis</b> can <b>be</b> made, but the patient has all other characteristics of a particular disease; the chance of the same diagnosis being made 20 years later is estimated to be 85-97%. Finally, a [...] "possible" [...] <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> made when the patient has only some of the characteristics of a disease are present, but not all.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} made by {{a combination}} of blood antibody tests and intestinal biopsies, helped by specific genetic testing. Making the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> not always straightforward. Frequently, the autoantibodies in the blood are negative and many people have only minor intestinal changes with normal villi. People may have severe symptoms and be investigated for years before a <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> achieved. Increasingly, the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> being made in people without symptoms as a result of screening. Evidence regarding the effects of screening, however, is not sufficient to determine its usefulness. While the disease is caused by a permanent intolerance to wheat proteins, it is not a form of wheat allergy.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recognition of}} pancreatic cancer has {{been attributed to}} the 18th-century Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the historical father of modern-day anatomic pathology, who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some case reports were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine histopathologic <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> eventually recorded by the American clinician Jacob Mendes Da Costa, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the pancreas had become a well-established diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA‚Äîautism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear. The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may not reflect {{the true nature of}} the spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from the outset. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate <b>diagnosis,</b> <b>was</b> eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E
5|$|Though Wiggins did {{not give}} up hope {{for a return to}} baseball, he began to study the {{real-estate}} market after his suspension from the game. In the late 1980s, Wiggins began to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children. He told one of his former teammates that he was getting into computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss.|$|E

50|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} difficult because the early {{phases of the}} disease often resemble eczema or even psoriasis.

Several biopsies are recommended, to be more certain of the <b>diagnosis.</b> The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> made {{through a combination of}} the clinical picture and examination, and is confirmed by biopsy.|$|R
5|$|Wigner Jen≈ë P√°l {{was born}} in Budapest, Austria-Hungary on November 17, 1902, to middle class Jewish parents, Elisabeth (Einhorn) and Anthony Wigner, a leather tanner. He had an older sister, Bertha, known as Biri, and a younger sister Margit, known as Manci, who later married British {{theoretical}} physicist Paul Dirac. He was home schooled by a professional teacher {{until the age of}} 9, when he started school at the third grade. During this period, Wigner developed an interest in mathematical problems. At the age of 11, Wigner contracted what his doctors believed to be tuberculosis. His parents sent him to live for six weeks in a sanatorium in the Austrian mountains, before the doctors concluded that the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> mistaken.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{may include}} {{abdominal}} pain or vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. As this is nonspecific {{in areas where}} ultrasound is not available the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> often only discovered during surgery to investigate the abnormal symptoms.

25|$|Compound {{heterozygosity}} {{is one of}} {{the causes}} of variation in genetic disease. The diagnosis and nomenclature for such disorders sometimes reflects history, because most diseases were first observed and classified based on biochemistry and pathophysiology before genetic <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> available. Some genetic disorders are really a family of related disorders that occur in the same metabolic pathway, or in related pathways.
