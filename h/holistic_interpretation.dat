500|$|Most New Age groups {{believe in}} an Ultimate Source {{from which all}} things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine. Various {{creation}} myths have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and everything in it. In contrast, some New Agers emphasise {{the idea of a}} universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source. The New Age worldview emphasises holism and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole, in doing so rejecting both the dualism of Judeo-Christian thought and the reductionism of Cartesian science. A number of New Agers have linked this <b>holistic</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the universe to the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock. The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as [...] "droplet of divinity", [...] "inner Godhead", and [...] "divine self". Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding 'subtle bodies', a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a [...] "Higher Self" [...] which {{is a part of the}} human but which connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through intuition.|$|E

But the theoretical status of these concepts is ambiguous; they suppose too much ontology and are invoked by two opposed sociological stands, namely, individualistic and <b>holistic</b> <b>interpretations</b> of social phenomena. In this paper, we propose a theoretical alternative that not only might clarify those concepts, but also keep their heuristic and interpretative value for computational sociology. We do so by advancing two proposals. Firstly, we suggest a non-ontological framework that allows modellers to identify emergent processes. This framework asserts the macro level and micro level as the emergent by-products of an instrumental prompting (the very modellers’ act of distinguishing). Secondly, {{in order to support}} analytically the modellers’ simulations, we link this non-ontological framework with the theory of self-referential social systems. This theory gives an account of the emergence of the social realm from the bottom-up as communication and describes the process by which society limits the possible selections of individuals. These two proposals are well-positioned to overcome some epistemological drawbacks, although they also generate new challenges to computational sociology. </p...|$|R

In the 20th century, Vladimir Vernadsky (1863-1945) saw the functioning of the biosphere as a geological force generating a dynamic disequilibrium, which in turn promoted the diversity of life. In the mid-1960s, James Lovelock first postulated a regulatory role for the biosphere in feedback mechanisms within the Earth system. Initially named the [...] "Earth Feedback hypothesis", Lovelock later renamed it the Gaia hypothesis, and subsequently further developed the theory with American evolutionary theorist Lynn Margulis during the 1970s. In parallel, the field of systems science was developing across numerous other scientific fields, driven in part by the increasing availability and power of computers, and leading to the development of climate models that began to allow the detailed and interacting simulations of the Earth's weather and climate. Subsequent extension of these models has led to the development of [...] "Earth system models" [...] (ESMs) that include facets such as the cryosphere and the biosphere.|$|R

40|$|Relevance of <b>Holistic</b> <b>Interpretations</b> of Indian Classical Traditions for Modern Socio-Economic Leadership Wisdom This {{contribution}} {{will explore}} the <b>holistic</b> <b>interpretations</b> of Indian philosophical and religious traditions and {{apply them to}} modern socio-economic leadership wisdom. Other interpretations have already been considered in a previous contribution. Traditions like Sikhism, Sufi Islam, Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism (Vedic traditions and Vedanta) contain concepts and rituals which can be relevant not only for medicine or psychology, but also for contemporary business and leadership wisdom. All these traditions refer to a basic oneness of existence whereby {{the inner and outer}} worlds merge into one reality. The success of new religious movements (NRMs) and the New Age Movement (NAM), both frequently inspired by Indian traditions, in Europe and elsewhere since the 1960 s reflects the need for the “unchurched but spiritual". However, the “integration of the whole person" has been interpreted either as “intensified concentration" and eventually as “greater job efficiency", or as a way for extreme alienation from society. My methodology is to go to the origins of concepts, principles, and rituals, and thereby uncovering their spiritual meanings and their relevance for mainstream socio-economic ethics, and observe if there is any difference with mainstream West-European Christian inspired humanism. It involves the concept of “self-help through remembering God" (constant remembrance and respect for origin and historical perspective), the concept of “Darshan" (seeing the divine image in everything and its implications for ecological awareness, e. g. the Rajasthani community of Baishnoyis), the concept of “Prasad" (blessed offering to the God as a reflection of the right product, salary and price), the tradition of gurus and pilgrimages (e. g. the Maha Kumbha Mela for rishis or gurus which every 12 years attracts up to 30 million people starting from Jan. to April 2010, allowing both gurus and followers to cleanse themselves, reflecting the need of mutually beneficial interactions, e. g. fair play relations), the principle of Ahimsa (reflecting non-violent interactions), connected to the law of “Karma" (of cause and effect, e. g. violent interactions invite more violent interactions), and the concept of “Dharma" (emphasizing the “path", e. g. the way of doing business, rather than the outcome, e. g. the profits). There may also be a common reference point in the concept of the duality of action/Karma and structure/Dharma. It is argued that the duality of action-structure is a particularly fertile 'bridgehead' for cultural translation and comparison between Hinduism and capitalism. Finally, also the essence of the Hindu goddess of Wisdom, Saraswathi (female consort of Brahma, representing the creator) will be explored. Interestingly Brahma himself is not worshipped but only Saraswathi, as she translates spiritual wisdom in worldly arts, literature, and the academic field. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the current {{evidence}} base on barriers to inclusion and successful engagement of parents in mainstream preventive services. Design/methodology/approach: Evidence was generated using a narrative review which uses different primary studies from which conclusions are produced into <b>holistic</b> <b>interpretations.</b> It provides an interpretative synthesis of findings based upon an exhaustive inclusion and exclusion criteria and systematic selection of literature. Findings: The paper identifies barriers to successful engagement as: structural; social and cultural; and suspicion and stigma. In terms of successful engagement, it identifies personal relations between staff and service users, practical issues, service culture, consultation, information and targeting, service delivery, and community development and co-production approaches. Research limitations/implications: The paper demonstrates that the evidence base is limited and not adequately theoretically grounded. It argues for more research based within a pragmatic approach, which is more theoretically and epistemologically informed. Practical implications: The paper demonstrates that more theoretically and epistemologically informed research needs to be addressed in order to design mainstream services on behalf of service practitioners and researchers. Originality/value: Such an approach would assist policy makers and practitioners to develop interventions to reduce potential barriers and facilitate successful engagement and is grounded within users’ experiences. It would also reflect the complexity of working within a late modern environment, attend to the multiple needs of users, and address the complex layers intrinsic to the construction and reproduction of services, as well as widening the current evidence base...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} {{to the development of}} tools and methods for assessing sustainability and applies them to an assessment of the Swedish sugar production system. The thesis’ aims are to compile an overview of the existing approaches for assessing sustainability, to suggest a method(s) for structuring and analyzing complex sustainability issues, and to appraise sustainability impacts from Swedish sugar production. The sugar sector analyses uncovered a number of regional to global sustainability challenges stemming from the production system. An analysis using an integrated assessment model calculated the impacts for a number of social and ecological indicators accompanying the ongoing decrease in the sugar production quota and beet and sugar prices for Sweden. A GIS-based proximity analysis tool was used to calculate beet transport distances. Distance results are then used to estimate diesel fuel consumption and air emissions for five pollutants during the movement of beets from field to processing facility. The assessment tool survey and categorization showed that many available approaches for assessing sustainability are incomplete when more <b>holistic</b> <b>interpretations</b> of sustainability are considered, but that development to address the deficiencies is ongoing with many of the approaches.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{work from}} a national Centre for Excellence in Assessment for Learning (AfL). The AfL approach {{is based on a}} set of theoretically underpinned principles. These promote: authenticity and complexity in the methods of assessment; advocate a sparing use of summative assessment and increased provision of formative assessment; aim to build students’ confidence and sense of autonomy; and promote informal feedback and peer interaction. The research programme investigates AfL practice in real-world settings within higher education. A case study design is used with multiple methods of data collection, and a fine-grained, interpretive approach. Initial analysis is at the case level to generate <b>holistic</b> <b>interpretations,</b> taking into account a range of perspectives. Cross-case analysis identifies key themes and illuminates theoretical constructs. Findings identify ways in which perceptions of students, teachers and others are crucial to the experience and outcomes of AfL. In the English Literature case study, students perceive significant value in peer feedback and discussions but the research also reveals the fragile sense of self amongst students and identifies circumstances in which students feel silenced within the peer discourse. The fine-grained detail of students’ observed learning behaviour provides essential contextualisation and moves away from generic findings about the student group. One example is variation in students’ discernment of principles and concepts within English Literature. Students’ approaches to writing assignments showed some recognising a ‘pattern’ between the texts they were analysing and the ideas and perspectives of the course, whilst others concentrated on the task they had been set, ‘checking off’ the elements achieved, but failing to address wider issues and concepts. We also highlight AfL as an evolving process, influenced by teacher reflection-in-action, student responses and a wide range of contextual factors, many of which are unpredictable...|$|R

40|$|The {{acceptance}} of Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection is not complete {{and it has been}} pointed out its limitation to explain the complex processes that constitute the transformation of species. The darwinian paradigm had its origin in the free market theories and concepts of Malthus and Spencer. Nature was explained on the basis of market theories moving away from an accurate explanation of natural phenomena. It is common that new discoveries bring about contradictions that are intended to be overcome by adjusting results to the dominant reductionist paradigm using all sorts of gradations and combinations that are admitted for each case. Modern findings represent a challenge to the interpretation of the observations with the Darwinian view of competition and struggle for life as theoretical basis. New <b>holistic</b> <b>interpretations</b> are emerging related with the Net of Life, in which the interconnection of ecosystems constitutes a dynamic and self-regulating biosphere: Viruses are recognized as a macroorganism with a huge collection of genes, most unknown, that constitute the major planet's gene pool with a fundamental role in evolution. The hologenome theory considers an organism and all of its associated symbiotic microbes as a result of symbiopoiesis. Microbes, helmints, that normally are understood as parasites, are cohabitants and they have cohabited with their host and drives the evolution and existence of the partners. Each organism is a result of integration of complex systems. The eukaryotic organism is the result of combination of bacterial, virus and eukaryotic DNA and the interaction of its own genome with the genome of its microbiota resulting in an intertwined metabolism (a superorganism) along evolution.

40|$|Farmers are {{important}} stakeholders to be enrolled in national {{efforts to control}} and eliminate endemic livestock diseases by state veterinary authorities. Their co-operation (or otherwise) has significant influence {{on the success of}} statutory disease control efforts, and when accomplishment does not meet aspiration, farmers may be blamed by the state for perceived failures. Approaching disease control within a political ecology framework and using a qualitative social science investigation of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Northern Ireland as a case study, this empirical paper explores the rationales and sensibilities of cattle farmers and the agricultural political economy and regulatory framework within which they operate in this region of the United Kingdom. This is important for understanding the farming context within which bTB is located, and this context is a feature of the disease landscape which has been under-developed in the bTB literature to date. Examining the premise that farmers are part of the problem of bTB, and a link in the chain of explanation as to why the disease has not yet been eliminated from the region, the paper will trace what everyday life is like for farmers living with multiple uncertainties and indeterminacies in their farming presents and futures. bTB as a disease is but one important influence on their farming lives – there are competing others which attract their attention and employ their resources, often pushing bTB down the list of priorities, despite its substantial cost to the economy. It will also demonstrate that farmers are embedded within wider structures, particularly global markets and European Union regulatory regimes, which profoundly condition and shape their actions, often elucidating resistance and a perceived loss of autonomy. A political ecology approach to investigating the complex multidimensional problems of First World agriculture, such as the effective control of endemic livestock disease in intensive production systems, is recommended if <b>holistic</b> <b>interpretations</b> and workable solutions are to be found and implemented...|$|R
40|$|This thesis employs phenomenological {{hermeneutic}} circle analysis, {{to investigate}} structure versus agency and adult identity change in lifelong learning. Achieving transformed agency and enhanced identity is argued {{to be about}} other ways of doing and other ways of seeing (Mezirow 2000 : 21). It proceeds by exploring if curricula employed in education can provide structure and/or the catalyst which allows ‘other’ to be revealed, agency to be regained, and to explicate what contribution curricula might make in transforming adult identities. Drawing upon the disciplines of sociology and psychology it provides <b>holistic</b> <b>interpretations</b> of participant accounts in the contemporary competitive world and explores the interstices in the duality of tensions between the utilitarian, and pragmatic adult, who employs education as a developmental pathway of choice. Interviews with six participants tell individual stories to provide holistic data of their erudition and experiences of cognitive and social change. Data are then employed to essentialise similarities, differences, themes, and congruent essences, and to distil factors which exemplify growth in understanding and expectations of the self. Growth in self-assurance and identity change capability is then contrasted with the fragility of adult identity; whereupon, this thesis critically positions fragility causation amongst the instrumental policies and forces of lifelong learning. Mezirow contends that agency is achieved by elaborating existing frames, learning new frames, transforming habits, and transforming points of view. This thesis moves to discuss the connected nature of these developmental factors and ‘glass ceilings’, and how immanent personal potential is (re) revealed to the adult self. Employing an archaeological hermeneutic research tool which suggests reflection is a central and developing feature in adult’s educational development the thesis finally contends that education {{is important in the}} personal delivery of agency over structure, and that curricula of any structurally legitimate form make a significant contribution to allowing persons to both flourish and confront a range of ‘other’ life circumstances and dilemmas.

40|$|Secularized {{religion}} {{within the}} Christian tradition {{is a response}} to an <b>holistic</b> theological <b>interpretation</b> and to a perceived need to be socially significant. Although it tends to reflect social progress rather than promote social change, there have been instances of social responses and social change which were actually initiated by ministers within the New South Wales Methodist tradition who were committed to the presentation of secularized religion. There is an increasing tendency to differentiate secularization from secularism. Historically, secularism denies belief in God and spiritual values, especially in relation to the Christian faith. Secularization, however, is a process which derives its meaning from the Latin, saecularis, meaning belonging to the particular time or age. It has come to denote involvement with 2 ̆ 7 this present age 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 this world 1, as opposed to the emphasis on a supernatural 2 ̆ 7 other world 2 ̆ 7. Although Warren Wagar acknowledged the potential of secularization to threaten religion, he also claimed that logically it can signify bringing religion itself into the world. Religion which is intrinsically involved with the world qualifies as authentic secularized religion. Belief in the intrinsic involvement of religion with the world has its basis in an <b>holistic</b> theological <b>interpretation</b> which views God as immanent in the whole of creation, totally involved in every aspect of the human situation, and supremely incarnate in Jesus who ministered compassionately to the whole person. This interpretation contrasts with a dualist theological interpretation, generally associated with traditional Western theism, which emphasizes belief in a supernatural God, and can, though it need not, separate religion from involvement with the world. Although most New South Wales Methodist ministries have been committed to the theology of traditional Western theism with a tendency towards dualism, there have been, within the Methodist tradition, examples of ministries which belong to the category of authentic secularized religion. They generally have accepted modern liberal views, and in several instances have been perceived as heretical. The exemplar for their secularized ministries has been the ministry of Jesus, which they interpreted as essentially the love and care for all humanity in its total need within this present world situation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{collaborative research}} undertaken with the Kuna indigenous peoples in Kuna Yala, a semi-autonomous indigenous territory in Panama. The Kuna experience of ongoing governance through traditional practices {{was chosen as}} an informative example through which to build understanding of the underlying processes that support endogenous development {{with the objective of}} contributing to a reframing of development and supporting self-determination of indigenous peoples. Complexity theory and a complex adaptive systems (CASs) analytical framework provide the theoretical grounding for a reframing of development as an endogenous process interacting across scales. The CASs framework guides a multi-scale analysis of Kuna Yala described as an indigenous biocultural system (IBCS) through merging complexity and biocultural approaches to working with indigenous territories. Through this framing, Kuna adaptive capacity which supports self-organisation becomes the central focus of the study. Participatory action research methodology facilitated iterations of learning cycles with a reflection group of Kuna leaders, through which conceptual clarity of adaptive capacity as an emergent phenomenon was sought. Three key groups of practices where simultaneously analysed through in-depth qualitative inquiry at multiple levels of collectivity: (i) leadership development, (ii) personhood development, and (iii) networking. Findings from analysis of key practices enable <b>holistic</b> <b>interpretations</b> of Kuna adaptive capacity and governance processes and understanding of how they support endogenous development. A key finding is that two levels of adaptive change support endogenous development. One level is consistent with adaptive management models, and I term the deeper level transformative change. Both operate through ongoing processes of reflection and interaction creating relational spaces, while transformation requires deeper levels of reflection which are facilitated through rituals. Findings on Kuna governance inform reflexive governance models by highlighting processes for linking between knowledge systems and scales for transdisciplinarity.
