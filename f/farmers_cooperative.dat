40|$|To {{understand}} decisionmaking in <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperative</b> firms, it {{is first}} {{necessary to understand}} how cooperative firms differ from other types of businesses. This paper outlines the distinguishing structural characteristics of <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> and, based on those characteristics, it develops hypotheses about how the behavior of <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> is likely to differ from that of investor-owned firms (IOFs). The term "structure, " as used in the paper, is defined to include not only the organizational components of cooperative firms but also basic operating rules common to these firms, such as distributing net margins via patronage. The first part of the paper briefly reviews alternative definitions of <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> and identifies several characteristics common to these organizations. The second, and largest, part of the paper traces through some of the consequences of these characteristics for the behavior of participants in <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> and develops hypotheses regarding how that behavior will vary in different circumstances. The final section briefly summarizes the major conclusions of the paper.

40|$|<b>Farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> {{development}} {{is an important}} direction of rural economic growth in developing countries which attracts serious international attention of both practitioners and scholars {{in the face of}} global “food demand”.

40|$|<b>Farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> are {{businesses}} {{owned and}} controlled by (and for) their members {{in order to create}} welfare and satisfaction beyond simple profitability. In developing countries, <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> have been formed in rural areas in an effort to improve social integration, social equity, market and information transfer. Additionally, cooperatives have reduced the negative economic impact of market power and uncertainty through lower transaction costs, higher incomes and collective bargaining power. However in Mexico, cooperatives have faced an increasingly competitive and dynamic environment and have not adhered to the principles and values, such as solidarity, self-help and mutual aid, established by cooperative legislation. There is a lack of education, training and culture in relation to cooperatives. In addition, there is limited government support for financing, no stimulation for their creation and development and no public technical assistance. Despite this situation, in the state of Jalisco, there are successful consumer <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> whose main objective is to supply feed input (concentrates) to their members at the lowest possible cost. They have been able to achieve this by leveraging the collective bargaining power of members via the cooperative union. In order to identify factors for success in relation to the <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Jalisco, a mixed methodology study was undertaken, using three case studies and a survey. Three <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Los Altos, Jalisco were selected for the research: Pedro Ezqueda, Nutrimentos and Prolea. The results from the study showed that the following factors influence the success of <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Jalisco: leadership; member knowledge and continuity; effective communication; member satisfaction; training; and government support. Additionally, challenges faced by these cooperatives include: poor understanding of cooperative principles among members; low enthusiasm for attending training; individualistic members with limited trust between them; lack of member commitment and participation in their cooperative; lack of young people joining the agriculture industry (including cooperatives); and no clear public policies regulating the agricultural sector. Despite these issues, <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> have been successful within the challenging and dynamic environment in Mexico.

30|$|In general, {{competitive}} advantage is {{often based on}} cost leadership or (product) differentiation. There {{is good reason to}} assume <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> struggle with both strategies. First, <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> have several disadvantages in terms of supply and quality control, which is why non-cooperatives are expected to be more competitive in the differentiated market (Hovelaque et al. 2009; Mérel et al. 2009). Open membership cooperatives face uneven supply, while closed or defined cooperatives do not always have enough producer interest. Many of the original NGCs formed during the 1990 s in the Upper Midwest operated below plant capacity and failed (Grashuis and Cook 2018). Second, most <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> have an upstream bias or user-orientation and therefore do not make large investments in branding or marketing (Hardesty 2005; Beverland 2007; Kontogeorgos 2012; Grashuis 2017). Land O’Lakes (butter), Ocean Spray (cranberries), Blue Diamond (almonds), and Organic Valley (organic milk) are some examples of the few <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> for which differentiation is the source of {{competitive advantage}}. The general lack of differentiation by <b>farmer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> is problematic as market orientation is more likely than ownership or governance to positively impact performance (Benos et al. 2016).|$|R
