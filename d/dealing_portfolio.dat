40|$|We {{show that}} {{significant}} portfolio return and variance biases arise when adopt-ing a rebalancing strategy {{rather than using}} a buy-and-hold approach in <b>dealing</b> with <b>portfolios</b> spanning across multiple periods. We extend the result in Liu and Strong [2008] for bias in average portfolio returns, and derive bias in variance of portfolios. We show that the magnitude of portfolio variance bias, defined as a dif-ference between the variance of portfolio constructed using rebalanced returns and the decomposed buy-and-hold returns, depends on average portfolio returns, the average returns of its constituents, {{as well as the}} autocovariances of the portfolio and its individual stocks. Empirical evidence based on S&P 500 constituents for the period from 2003 to 2011 confirms that bias in variance of portfolios can become significant. In particular, we observe negative and significant bias during 2003, 2005 and 2010, and positive and significant bias in more turbulent 2008 and 2011. The existence of portfolio variance biases have important implications not only in evalu-ating the risk of such portfolios, but also in measuring their performance (e. g., when using Sharpe ratio). We vary the frequency of price quotations and estimate average return and variance biases for 5 -minute, daily, weekly and monthly data. Our find-ings indicate that one should exercise caution when adopting a rebalancing strategy when <b>dealing</b> with <b>portfolio</b> returns, as resulting biases can lead to spurious results when analyzing investment strategies or testing asset pricing models. A popular methodology adopted by researches when <b>dealing</b> with <b>portfolio</b> returns is a simple rebalancing strategy, which suggests to rebalance portfolio back to its initial weights {{at the beginning of each}} period. Despite its simplicity and popularity, this strategy may lead to mis-estimation of decomposed returns and, as such, cumulating ∗We are grateful to AFAANZ for funding the project...|$|R

40|$|The Insider Trading Act of 1999 and JSE {{regulations}} require {{transparency in}} director dealings {{and as a}} result create an unprecedented dissemination of investment signals to the market. This research study used director dealing information and a portfolio time series approach that included the entire population of 13, 840 JSE All Share Index (ALSI) director dealings during a 130 - month period between 2002 and 2013. With the assistance of a style engine and through an experimental research approach, an optimal Buy and Sell investment style was established. The equal weighted ALSI provided a comparative benchmark. Most studies on JSE director dealings, using an event study methodology, have not identified an investment style to be followed successfully during certain periods. The results have at best shown statistically significant, but economically insignificant, abnormal returns. The results of this study were visually, statistically and economically significant in comparison. It was proven that outside investors should, rationally, acquire shares when directors acquire shares but they should, counter intuitively, purchase shares when directors sell shares. The optimal director dealing investment style for creating a director <b>dealing</b> Buy <b>portfolio</b> includes applying a holding period of four months, a lookback period of three months and a minimum percentage of market capitalisation traded of 0. 0013 % or more.

50|$|Finance as {{a subject}} has emerged to be an {{extremely}} involved branch of knowledge with growing number of stock exchanges and investors in the field. Risk and return that constitute cardinal aspects of the subject, remain as a major concern for every investor, individual as well as institutional.

In apparently erratic behaviors of the market, however the mathematicians try to capture patterns vis- a-vis predictability, which may help investors decide on their investment.

30|$|So, in {{attempts}} <b>dealing</b> with <b>portfolio</b> selection problems, randomness and fuzziness are considered {{as the two}} basic types of uncertainty contained in security returns. It has become a common practice that when security returns cannot be reflected by historical data, fuzzy variables {{can be used to}} show experts' knowledge and estimation of security returns. However, illogicality will come into view if fuzzy variables are used to describe the subjective estimation of security returns. For example, a stock return is considered as a triangular fuzzy variable ξ = (− 0.2, 0.3, 0.7). Using possibility theory (or credibility theory), the return is exactly 0.3 with belief degree 1 in possibility measure (or 0.5 in credibility measure). However, this conclusion is unacceptable because the belief degree of exactly 0.3 is almost 0. In addition, the return being exactly 0.3 and not exactly 0.3 has the same belief degree in either possibility measure or credibility measure, which implies that the two events will happen equally likely. This conclusion is quite astonishing and hard to accept.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{financial}} risk {{from the point}} of view of a brokerage company, who exposes itself to risk by lending assets or money to its clients for allowing short-selling or leveraged operations (firm-wise risk). We develop analytical models for control of firm-wise risk, by defining both specific margin factors for single assets and a global margin factor that takes into account the overall riskiness of a complex portfolio. In the first part of this work we derive a model to evaluate leverage factors, by linking them with the probability for the client's portfolio value to go below a certain safety threshold, using Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall approaches. Further, we present optimization models based on these two approaches in order to determine the optimal leverage factors. In the second part, we present a model for margin control based on the concept of marginal availability. A global margin factor considering the overall riskiness of a complex portfolio is derived, and we show the effectiveness of the approach also when <b>dealing</b> with <b>portfolios</b> containing options...|$|R

Meta-heuristic techniques which belong to the class of Global Optimisation techniques will enable us to solve the investor‘s program. In order to model the uncertainty of future returns we generate Monte-Carlo scenarios using conditional copula and Generalised Hansen skewed-t distribution. It allows us to take into account three fundamental characteristics of financial markets: (i) Departure from Gaussian World, (ii) Time-varying dependence and volatility,(iii) Extreme joint movements in financial markets.
