500|$|Though {{the lyrics}} of the song like [...] "Do {{you want to see}} me down on my knees?" [...] portray female helplessness, the video {{performance}} acts as a counter-text to it. When this line is sung, Madonna is shown kneeling on the road in front of the advancing car, then turns <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> while exposing her throat back in a posture of submission. However, her voice tone and her look at the camera portray a hardness and defiance that contradict the submissiveness of her body posture and turn the question of the line into a challenge for her lover.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have attempted to}} find a real-world correspondence for Gawain's journey to the Green Chapel. The Anglesey islands, for example, are mentioned in the poem. They exist today as a single {{island off the coast}} of Wales. In line 700, Gawain is said to pass the [...] "Holy Head", believed by many scholars to be either Holywell or the Cistercian abbey of Poulton in Pulford. Holywell is associated with the beheading of Saint Winifred. As the story goes, Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances. Her uncle, another saint, put <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> in place and healed the wound, leaving only a white scar. The parallels between this story and Gawain's make this area a likely candidate for the journey.|$|E
500|$|The tigress is a {{solid-cast}} statuette weighing [...] {{and measuring}} [...] {{from head to}} tail. She {{was designed to be}} soldered onto some other object as its handle; traces of tin were found beneath her rear paws, which have a [...] "smoothly concave curve". She looks most aesthetically pleasing when the serpentine curves of <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>back,</b> rump, and tail form a line at an angle of about 45°, when the rear paws are flat, allowing for their curve. Her gender is obvious as there are six engorged teats under her belly. She is carefully decorated on her back, but her underside is [...] "quite perfunctorily finished". Her stripes are represented by two engraved lines, with a black niello inlay between them, in most places not meeting the engraved lines. Neither her elongated body, nor the distribution of the stripes are accurate for the species; she has a long dorsal stripe running from the skull along the spine {{to the start of the}} tail, which is typical of tabby cats rather than tigers. The figure has no stripes around her tail, which thickens at the end, suggesting a thick fur tip as in a lion's tail, which tigers do not have, although Roman art usually gives them one.|$|E

500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from music critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised it for capturing [...] "Pharrell Williams' flair for slim, sleek grooves" [...] and labelled it a highlight from Hard Candy. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone, {{noted that the}} [...] "creative tension between Madonna and the Neptunes' Pharrell Williams crackles on the innuendo-laden opener 'Candy Shop'". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern criticized the lyrics but praised its catchiness, [...] "set to a nice, punchy beat, Madonna weaves her voice around a hypnotic groove that practically dares you not to sing along. [...] is all about letting loose {{and having a good}} time". He also opined that while it wouldn't work as a single [...] "it more than serves its purpose as an introduction to Hard Candy". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Pharrell makes his presence known a little too much [...] he manages to get Madonna to stretch vocally in ways she hasn't since Evita. That is, when she's not doing cheeky drag queen impersonations, with trannie-fierce moments sprinkled liberally throughout 'Candy Shop' (“My sugar is raw”) [...] The song is neither sexy nor campy, and somewhere, Dita is throwing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> laughing hysterically, and cracking her whip in disapproval", the last part being a reference to the alter ego Madonna incorporated for her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992).|$|E
2500|$|At 12:35 Seneca left Wellington and {{rejoined the}} convoy. [...] {{was on her}} way to assist Wellington, expecting to reach her by 17:00. Arriving aboard Wellington, Lieutenant Brown posted lookouts, broke out {{ammunition}} and started drilling a gun crew, for they were still in sub-infested waters, and on a stricken ship carrying valuable cargo to the allies. Repairs were made below decks and by 12:50 hours the ship began to move ahead. By 14:10 the speed was increased until they were making [...] The ship was taking water in the number 2 hold, but by driving the pumps, the crew held it to a level of [...] At 18:46 the ship was down by the head, and although Lieutenant Brown was able to stop her and bring <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> up long enough to regain his course, her head went down again and her engines were helpless.|$|E
