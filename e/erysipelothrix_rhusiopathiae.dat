50|$|The mites are blood feeders {{and attack}} resting birds at night. They are {{generally}} white or greyish in colour, becoming darker or redder when engorged with blood. After feeding, they hide in cracks and crevices away from daylight, where they mate and lay eggs. The mite progresses through 5 life stages: egg, larva, protonymph, deutonymph and adult. Under favourable conditions this life cycle {{can be completed}} within seven days, so populations can grow rapidly - causing anaemia in badly affected flocks of poultry. Young birds are most susceptible. The mites can also affect {{the health of the}} birds indirectly, as they may serve as vectors for diseases such as Salmonellosis, avian spirochaetosis and <b>Erysipelothrix</b> <b>rhusiopathiae.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Amsterdam {{albatross}} {{is listed}} as critically endangered, by the IUCN, with an occurrence range of 4400000 km2 and a breeding range of only 7 km2. The population upon discovery was just five breeding pairs; with conservation this has increased to eighteen to twenty-five breeding pairs. Monitored continuously since 1983, the world population is estimated at 80 mature individuals {{and a total of}} some 130 birds. The island on which the albatross breeds has undergone a significant decline in habitat condition due to the introduction of ship rats, feral cats and cattle, while the birds are threatened at sea by the practice of longline fishing. The draining of a peat bog on the plateau has degraded the breeding environment, and because there is only one breeding location, they are also especially vulnerable to diseases such as Pasteurella multocida (avian cholera) and <b>Erysipelothrix</b> <b>rhusiopathiae.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Erysipelothrix</b> <b>rhusiopathiae</b> is a Gram-positive, catalase-negative, rod-shaped, nonspore-forming, nonacid-fast, nonmotile bacterium. The {{organism}} {{was first}} {{established as a}} human pathogen late in the 19th century. It may be isolated from soil, food scraps, and water contaminated by infected animals. It can survive in soil for several weeks. In pig faeces, the survival period of this bacterium ranges from 1 to 5 months. It grows aerobically and anaerobically and does not contain endotoxin. Distributed worldwide, E. rhusiopathiae is primarily considered an animal pathogen, causing a disease known as erysipelas in animals (and erysipeloid in humans - see below). Turkeys and pigs are most commonly affected, but cases {{have been reported in}} other birds, sheep, fish, and reptiles. In pigs, the disease is known as [...] "diamond skin disease". The human disease called erysipelas is not caused by E. rhusiopathiae, but by various members of the genus Streptococcus.|$|E

Methods: The susceptibility of 60 E. rhusiopathiae isolates was determined using a recommended agar dilution procedure. Susceptibility to disinfectants was achieved using a broth microdilution method. Results: Penicillin and ceftriaxone, with low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (MIC 90 0. 03 mg/l and 0. 125 mg/l, respectively), remained active against E. rhusiopathiae and should continue to be recommended for treatment.
