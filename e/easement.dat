She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was no longer able to do so, and then once Alvarez was no longer able to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation <b>easement</b> running with the land, and attempts made to find a buyer that would also be interested in maintaining the Arabian horse breeding program.|$|E
5|$|As rail {{service and}} {{industry}} declined, Ayer made an awkward {{transition from a}} rail-centered town to a car-centered town. Both depots were demolished around 1960; the former northern depot and surrounding land was sold to a local business owner on September 29, 1960. The provisions of the sale and later transactions included deed restrictions requiring the purchaser to provide an <b>easement</b> for public station access {{as well as a}} station facility for 100 years. Service along the Fitchburg main line was cut back to Fitchburg that same year, leaving Fitchburg Line commuter service between Fitchburg and Boston as the sole remaining passenger service through Ayer when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was created in 1964 to subsidize suburban commuter services.|$|E
40|$|The use of exacted {{conservation}} <b>easements</b> is widespread. Yet, {{the study}} of the implications of their use has been minimal. Conservation <b>easements</b> are nonpossessory interests in land restricting a landowner’s ability to use her land in an otherwise permissible way, with the goal of yielding a conservation benefit. Exacted conservation <b>easements</b> arise in permitting contexts where, in exchange for a government benefit, landowners either create conservation <b>easements</b> on their own property or arrange for conservation <b>easements</b> on other land. To explore the concern associated with the enforceability of exacted conservation <b>easements</b> in a concrete way, this article examines exacted conservation <b>easements</b> in California, demonstrating that despite their frequent use in the state, their enforceability is uncertain. The three California statutes governing conservation <b>easements</b> limit the ability to exact conservation <b>easements.</b> California caselaw, although thin, indicates that courts may be willing to uphold exacted conservation <b>easements</b> even when they conflict with the state statutes. This examination of the California situation highlights California-specific concerns while providing a framework for examining exacted conservation <b>easements</b> in other states. This article illustrates not only challenges of enforceability that arise with exacted conservation <b>easements,</b> but uncertainty in their fundamental validity and concerns about public accountability. This exploration illustrates that enforceability is not straightforward. This raises significant concerns about using exacted conservation <b>easements</b> to promote conservation goals, calling into question specifically the use of conservation <b>easements</b> as exactions...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the legal {{institute}} of <b>easements.</b> These are rights in rem to another person's property which restrict the owner of immovable property {{in favor of a}}nother person so that he is obliged to tolerate something, to refrain from something or to perform something. <b>Easements</b> serve more beneficial usage of immovable property or in favor of a particular person. The thesis consists of ten chapters. The first chapter describes the historical development of <b>easements</b> in five sub-chapters. The second chapter {{deals with the}} definition and function of <b>easements.</b> The third chapter examines their sorting. The fourth chapter deals with the content of <b>easements.</b> The most common <b>easements</b> - the right of way and the right to use a flat or a room - are described in two sub-chapters. The fifth chapter deals with an issue of recording <b>easements</b> in the land register. The sixth chapter, the largest, successively pays attention to individual ways of their creation in six sub-chapters. In three sub-chapters of the seventh chapter modification of <b>easements</b> (in their subjects, content and object) is analysed. The eighth chapter examines individual ways of termination of <b>easements</b> in six sub-chapters. Separately, in the ninth chapter, limitation of time of <b>easements</b> is dealt with. The final chapter describes [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Conversely, an <b>easement</b> {{in gross}} {{benefits}} {{an individual or}} a legal entity, rather than a dominant estate. The <b>easement</b> can be for a personal use (for example, an <b>easement</b> to use a boat ramp) or a commercial use (for example, an <b>easement</b> to a railroad company to build and maintain a rail line across property). Historically, an <b>easement</b> in gross was neither assignable nor inheritable, but commercial easements are now freely transferable to a third party. They are divisible but must be exclusive (the original owner no longer uses it and exclusive to <b>easement</b> holder) and all holders of the <b>easement</b> must agree to divide. If subdivided, each subdivided parcel enjoys the <b>easement.</b>|$|E

The thesis is divided into four chapters, the first chapter is devoted to a brief definition of <b>easements</b> and the kinds of <b>easements.</b> The second chapter analyzes the historical development of the <b>easements.</b> In the first part of the chapter the Roman law, which was the first to regulate the <b>easements,</b> is discussed. Furthermore, the chapter deals with the development of the <b>easements</b> during the Middle Ages, when the <b>easements</b> were joined by the institute of real burdens. The third part of the chapter discusses the legislation of <b>easements</b> in the General Civil Code, which is an inspiration for the current legislation; the relevant case law is not omitted. Finally, the chapter contains a section dealing with the legislation of <b>easements</b> in the so called Middle Civil Code from 1950 and the legislation in the Civil Code from 1964. The third chapter, which forms the main part of the thesis, is devoted to a detailed analysis of the current legislation of <b>easements</b> contained in the Civil Code. The chapter is [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Because {{this method}} of {{creating}} an <b>easement</b> requires imposing a burden (the <b>easement)</b> upon another party {{for the benefit of}} the landlocked owner, the court looks to the original circumstances in weighing the relative apportionment of benefit and burden to both lots in making its equitable determination whether such <b>easement</b> shall be created by the court. This method of creating an <b>easement,</b> being an active creation by a court of an otherwise non-existent right, may be automatically extinguished upon termination of the necessity (for example, if a new public road is built adjacent to the landlocked tenement or another <b>easement</b> is acquired without regard to comparison of ease or practicality between the imposed <b>easement</b> and any valid substitute).|$|E

25|$|Despite the name, {{necessity}} {{alone is}} an insufficient claim to create any <b>easement.</b> Parcels {{without access to}} a public way may have an <b>easement</b> of access over adjacent land if crossing that land is absolutely necessary to reach the landlocked parcel {{and there has been}} some original intent to provide the lot with access, and the grant was never completed or recorded but is thought to exist. A court order is necessary to determine the existence of an <b>easement</b> by necessity. To obtain this generally the party who claims the <b>easement</b> files a lawsuit, and the judge weighs the relative damage caused by enforcing an <b>easement</b> against the servient estate against the damage to the dominant estate if the <b>easement</b> is found not to exist and is thus landlocked.|$|E

I study <b>easements</b> from both the theoretical perspective, {{with respect to}} their position in the legal system, legal relations and their corresponding implications and the function they fulfill; and the practical perspective, elaborating on their establishment, changes, termination, recordkeeping and protection of the rights they imply. I consistently strive to map all the legislation related to <b>easements,</b> and present the changes that will affect the legal code of the Czech Republic with regards to the ongoing re-codification of private law. These changes affect the context of current legislation related to <b>easements</b> and its interpretation, consisting mainly of court rulings. In the new Civil Code which will come into force at the start of 2014, as opposed to the current Civil Code, legislation related to <b>easements</b> is approached from a very wide perspective, almost casuistically.
