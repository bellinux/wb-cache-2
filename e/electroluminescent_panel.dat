50|$|Early {{electrical}} nightlights used small {{incandescent lamps}} or small neon lamps to provide light, and were much safer than small candles using an open flame. The neon versions consumed very little energy {{and had a}} long life, but {{had a tendency to}} flicker on and off (reminiscent of a candle), which some users liked and others found annoying. In the 1960s, small nightlights appeared that featured a low-power <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>panel</b> emitting soft green or blue light; similar lights are still available today.|$|E

He also wrote articles on political issues, including Yugoslav politics and the Middle East conflict, such as Israel's development of a biological warfare program, and on Islamic theology and religious matters. He was also interested in experimental or parapsychological topics; building upon the work of Walter John Kilner and under the sponsorship of the Metaphysical Research Group of the United Kingdom, he published a book on aura phenomena, based on research he {{carried out in the}} 1950s on the human energy field with a device utilizing a semiconductor and an <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>panel</b> called an optron.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Menaker {{provided}} {{evidence for the}} existence of extra-retinal photoreceptors that were sufficient for photoentrainment by measuring rhythmic locomotor behavior as the output signal of the house sparrows (Passer domesticus) circadian clock. He demonstrated that photoentrainment could occur in the absence of optic neurons, evidence for the presence of an extra-retinal photoreceptor(s) coupled to the House Sparrow circadian clock. In this experiment, bilaterally enucleated house sparrows were exposed to an artificial light-dark cycle. They were kept in constant darkness to determine their free-running period and subsequently allowed to entrain to light cues. Locomotor activity was recorded through observing perching behavior of the sparrows. He tested three possible confounding variables for entrainment: (1) temperature fluctuation, (2) post-enucleation retinal fragments remaining in the eye, and (3) ectoparasites that might transfer light information through their movements in the birds' skin. To study the effects of temperature on circadian rhythms, Menaker exposed the enucleated sparrows to an <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>panel.</b> Menaker treated sparrows with Dry-Die, an anti-parasitic agent, to eliminate any possible effects of light transferring by ectoparasites. Since the sparrows did not entrain during tests of temperature fluctuation and the sparrows remained entrained 10 months after enucleation, a point at which any excess of the functional retina would have degraded, Menaker ruled out these possible confounding variables. Menaker's lab concluded the sparrows were able to entrain to environmental light cues. These results demonstrate that retinal light receptors are not necessary for photoentrainment, indicating there is an extra-retinal photoreceptor(s) contributing to circadian locomotor activity. Menaker's findings in enucleated sparrows were consistent with Aschoff’s Rule, and he concluded that the retinae and the extra-retinal receptor(s) both contribute to the photoentrainment process.|$|E

50|$|Powder phosphor-based <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>panels</b> are {{frequently}} used as backlights to liquid crystal displays. They readily provide a gentle, even illumination {{to the entire}} display while consuming relatively little electric power. This makes them convenient for battery-operated devices such as pagers, wristwatches, and computer-controlled thermostats, and their gentle green-cyan glow is a common sight in the technological world. They do, however, require relatively high voltage (between 60 and 600 volts). For battery-operated devices, this voltage must be generated by a converter circuit within the device; this converter often makes an audible whine or siren sound while the backlight is activated. For line-voltage-operated devices, it may be supplied directly from the power line. Electroluminescent nightlights operate in this fashion. Brightness per unit area increases with increased voltage and frequency.|$|R

40|$|Barium {{titanate}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important and widely studied ferroelectric ceramics with ABO 3 type perovskite structure. Due to its promising ferroelectric properties, it has been used in several applications such as positive temperature coefficient resistors (PTCR) called thermistor, sensors, electro-optical devices, multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>panels,</b> etc. Barium titanate shows a significant phase transition below and above Curie temperature (120 °C for pure barium titanate) from tetragonal to the cubic crystal structure. This phase transition however is strongly dependent on the microstructural properties such as density, grain size distribution, type of dopants and sintering conditions. In this research, extensive characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to study the microstructural and compositional characteristics of 8 industrial samples. We have employed state of the art spark plasma sintering that offer rapid consolidation of powders, enabling significantly improved or even completely novel materials on barium titanate samples containing Ca, Sr and Pb as a dopant.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the alternating current electroluminescent properties of zinc sulfide powders the following experiments were conducted: synthesis of zinc sulfide phosphors (comprised of zinc, sulfur and copper dopant); thermal shocking of phosphor materials (sudden cooling, using liquid nitrogen, of phosphor particles heated up to 500 oC) and analysis of their alternating current electroluminescent properties as well as studies of particle crystal structures by synchrotron and conventional X-ray powder diffraction techniques. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was utilized {{to investigate the}} concentration of co-activator atoms within the zinc sulphide crystal lattice. <b>Electroluminescent</b> <b>panels</b> were prepared and the emission properties were evaluated theoretically {{in order to obtain}} a mathematical relationship between various parameters involved in the electroluminescent process. Thermal quenching of zinc sulfide phosphor alters its photoluminescent and electroluminescent properties. The dominant wavelength of the material alters from 504 nm to 517 nm. It appears that the blue centres are vulnerable to the thermal quenching procedure carried out as the blue emission deteriorates and the overall blue emission of the material is reduced due to the role that the interstitial Cu+ species play in this mechanism. The interstitial Cu+ is not as stable in its location within the lattice compared to substitutional Cu+ and hence a thermal shock is prone to effect its location or association with the surrounding atoms. The green emission centre, however, appears to be unaffected. Results obtained from layer by layer analysis of the material demonstrate that the surface of the phosphor particles contain most of the copper content (copper to zinc molar ratio of 0. 08...|$|R
40|$|The initial aim of {{this work}} was the {{preparation}} of sensitized photoconductor layers for use in conjunction with d. c. <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>panels</b> to develop an optically triggered bistable system for sustaining pixel states during the frame time of dynamically addressed flat panel displays. More than 200 CdSe powder samples and devices were prepared in attempts to achieve the required response speed of approximately 1 millisecond and photocurrent density of at least 10 mA cm(^- 2) under expected operating conditions. Powder samples were sensitized by various dopant incorporation and heat treatment processes. Copper and halogen ions were introduced {{in the form of}} dilute solutions. Correlations between preparation conditions and photoelectronic behaviour were sought, additional information being obtained from various physical and chemical analytical techniques. Devices were prepared from sensitized powder samples by compression, sintering or mixing with a nitrocellulose binder. A screen printing process was employed to deposit powder-binder layers 40 - 70 microns in thickness. Although an optically triggered bistable element was not experimentally demonstrated, sensitized powder characteristics were successively improved to within an order of magnitude of those required. Response times of 2 - 10 milliseconds were recorded, and photo-response in a sandwich type powder-binder device was finally achieved with photocurrent density of approximately 100 mA cm(^- 2). Simple power law relationships between conductivity and applied voltage, pressure and photoexcitation intensity were experimentally established. Prolonged ball milling of CdSe powder was found to cause a wurtzite to sphalerite phase transition which was reversible by firing in air for 2 hours at 500 ºC. The estimated sphalerite lattice parameter was 6. 051 A. Long term variations in sample conductivities and photosensitivies were attributed primarily to oxygen adsorption in the presence of water vapour during storage. Photoelectronic characteristics indicative of both oxygen photoadsorption and photodesorption were observed, and explained in terms of dopant levels. Photoconductive processes in sensitized CdSe powder were shown to be dictated principally by surface chemistry and inter particle contacts...|$|R

The UV-induced EL gain is particularly pronounced for EL operation ear threshold, and tends to saturate asthe panel is operated well above threshold. The magnitude ofthe EL gain is also dependent on the time relationship of the external, pulsed UV radiation and the voltage pulses used to drive the panel into EL operation.

40|$|The {{observation}} of cathodoluminescent (CL) emission in a {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) generally offers {{a wealth of information}} as it allows the study of materials on a nanoscale, thus separating effects which are disguised in macroscopic luminescence measurements. In combination with elemental analysis (e. g. EDX) or with structural analysis (e. g. EBSD), even more information can be extracted [1, 2]. 	Here we report {{on the use of the}} silicon detector, normally used for the energy-dispersive analysis of the characteristic x-rays, for the detection of (CL) light [3]. When visible light is absorbed by this detector, electron-hole pairs are generated which introduce a spurious signal in the low-energy part of the EDX spectrum. The intensity of this signal was studied as a function of the detector settings and the wavelength and intensity of the incoming light. This behaviour was then explained based on the working principle of the EDX setup and confirmed by numerical simulations with a purposely written software program. Although the detection of CL with the EDX detector can be a nuisance for elemental analysis, we show that the signal in the low-energy part of the EDX spectrum can readily be used to obtain CL mappings along with simultaneously recorded elemental mappings. 	We illustrate this CL mapping technique with experiments on both thin films and powders. The hydrolysis behaviour of blue-emitting BaAl 2 S 4 :Eu 2 + thin films, which are used in flat <b>panel</b> <b>electroluminescent</b> displays, was studied. For several powder phosphors (Ca 2 SiS 4 :Eu 2 +, SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2 +, [...] .) elemental analysis with EDX was readily correlated with the CL emission mappings. In all cases, the CL emission was also observed with a conventional CL setup using a CCD to check the validity of the CL mapping with the EDX detector. 	In conclusion, we explained and simulated why an EDX detector can be used for panchromatic CL mappings. The main advantage is that no additional software or hardware is required to obtain the mappings. Furthermore, this method allows mapping of the CL on samples with strong and inhomogeneous electric charging as a repeated, fast scanning of the sample surface can be used...|$|R
