5|$|In 1915, after {{most of his}} {{students}} in Trieste were conscripted {{to fight in the}} First World War, Joyce moved to Zurich. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an <b>exit</b> <b>permit</b> for the Joyces, who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.|$|E
5|$|The GDR's {{government}} nonetheless remained {{opposed to}} emigration {{and sought to}} dissuade would-be émigrés. The process of applying for an <b>exit</b> <b>permit</b> was deliberately made slow, demeaning, frustrating and often fruitless. Applicants were marginalised, demoted or sacked from their jobs, excluded from universities and subjected to ostracism. They faced the threat of having their children taken into state custody {{on the grounds that}} they were unfit to bring up children. The law was used to punish those who continued to apply for emigration; over 10,000applicants were arrested by the Stasi between the 1970s and 1989.|$|E

25|$|In July 2012, Cuba {{received}} its first American goods shipment in over 50 years, following the partial relaxation of the U.S. embargo to permit humanitarian shipments. In October 2012, Cuba announced {{the abolition of}} its much-disliked <b>exit</b> <b>permit</b> system, allowing its citizens more freedom to travel abroad. In February 2013, after his reelection as President, Raúl Castro stated that he would retire from government in 2018 {{as part of a}} broader leadership transition. In July 2013, Cuba became embroiled in a diplomatic scandal after a North Korean ship illegally carrying Cuban weapons was impounded by Panama.|$|E
25|$|Individuals of Iranian {{nationality}} {{resident in}} Iran are subject to tax on all their income whether earned in Iran or abroad. Foreign nationals working in Iran are also {{subject to the same}} income tax based on their salary. Non-resident individuals are liable to pay tax only on their Iranian-sourced income. Foreign employees cannot obtain an exit visa from Iran unless they provide proof that they have paid their due taxes, and since they need to obtain an <b>exit</b> <b>permit</b> when their presence in Iran is based on a work permit, the government can easily enforce this rule. The government assumes a certain salary for employees depending on their position and country of origin. The assumed minimum monthly salaries in 2004 range from US$2,500 for unskilled European workers to US$7,000 for European managing directors.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union resumed {{diplomatic}} relations. In June 1956, {{during an}} official visit to Soviet Union, Tito handed Khruschev {{a list of}} 113 Yugoslav communists who had disappeared during the Great Purge, and asked about their fate. Khrushchev promised he would answer in two days, when he found out. Two days later, Khrushchev informed Tito that exactly one hundred of the persons on the list were dead by then. Then, the remaining thirteen were located by the KGB in Siberia, and eleven of them returned to Yugoslavia. Štajner was among them. Shortly before that, the Supreme Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR rehabilitated him. He traveled from Maklakovo to Moscow to meet his wife. Soon afterwards, he returned to Yugoslavia, which he considered his home country. He was issued an <b>exit</b> <b>permit</b> to leave the Soviet Union on 30 July 1956. After return to Yugoslavia he was awarded a state pension, and he {{spent the rest of}} his life living in Zagreb. He visited Soviet Union once more in 1966. Štajner died on 1 March 1992, and was buried in Zagreb.|$|E
50|$|Human Rights Watch {{reported}} various violations {{perpetrated by}} Israeli authorities on students, {{in the academic}} and educational environment. In 2007, 670 students from Gaza were prevented from achieving higher education {{in countries such as}} Egypt, Jordan, Germany, Britain and United States, by being denied the <b>exit</b> <b>permits.</b> In total, the number of Gazans who have been denied to exit Gaza has reached 6400 people and this due to Hamas’ take over of the territory and Israel controlling Gaza’s border. Those students that manage to leave for their studies, they remained once again trapped when their returned home for the summer. Even when they obtained <b>exit</b> <b>permits,</b> students have been stopped at the passenger crossing in Erez, with the justification of “security concerns”.|$|R
25|$|After the war, when {{a wave of}} anti-Jewish {{violence}} {{swept the}} country, the WJC prevailed upon the Polish government to remove all obstacles faced by Jews who sought {{to leave the country}} {{and for the most part}} Jews were able to emigrate unhindered until about 1950. Most left without visas or <b>exit</b> <b>permits</b> thanks to a decree of Gen. Spychalski.|$|R

On February 17, 2013, Sánchez traveled to more than twelve countries in Europe and The Americas, including Brazil and the United States, where, in Miami, she criticized the inadequacy of Cuba's reforms as well as the United States embargo against Cuba. She returned to Cuba on May 30.|$|E

50|$|The Vietnamese {{government}} and its officials profited from the outflow of refugees, especially the often well-to-do Hoa. The price for obtaining <b>exits</b> <b>permits,</b> documentation, and a boat or ship, often derelict, to leave Vietnam {{was reported to be}} the equivalent of $3,000 for adults and half that for children. These payments were often made in the form of gold bars. Many poorer Vietnamese left their country secretly without documentation and in flimsy boats, and these were the most vulnerable to pirates and storms while at sea.|$|R
5000|$|During the Rwandan genocide, Pierantonio Costa was the Italian Consul in Kigali. From 6 April to 21 July 1994, Costa first saved Italians and Westerners, then {{he moved}} to his brother's {{property}} in Burundi and from there he travelled a lot across Rwanda in an unfaltering effort to rescue the people. For this purpose he used his diplomatic role, his network of friendships and acquaintances and his own money (more than 3 million dollars) to get <b>exit</b> <b>permits</b> for those who asked him for help.|$|R

2500|$|The regime {{sought to}} dissuade would-be émigrés {{through a variety}} of measures. The process of {{applying}} for an <b>exit</b> <b>permit</b> was deliberately intended to be slow, demeaning and frustrating, with a low chance of success. Applicants were pushed to the margins of society. They were demoted or sacked from their jobs, excluded from universities and subjected to ostracism. If the applicants were parents, they could face the threat of having their children taken into state custody {{on the grounds that they}} were unfit to bring up children. The heavily politicised East German law code was used to punish those who continued to apply for emigration despite repeated rejections. Those who repeatedly submitted emigration applications faced charges of [...] "impeding ... the state and social activity". If they sought assistance from contacts in the West, such as relatives or West German state bodies, they were guilty of [...] "illegal contact" [...] or [...] "traitorous information transfer or activities as an agent." [...] Criticising the political system was a crime of [...] "public disparagement". Over 10,000applicants were arrested by the Stasi between the 1970s and 1989 on such charges.|$|E

25|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, Polish Jews began to leave Poland soon after the Second World War ended. Many left {{because they did not}} want to live under a Communist regime, which confiscated all private property. Some left because {{they did not want to}} live where their family members had been murdered, instead {{choosing}} to live with relatives in different countries. Many wanted to go to British Mandate of Palestine, soon to be the new state of Israel, especially after Gen. Spychalski signed a decree allowing Jews to leave Poland without visas or <b>exit</b> <b>permits.</b> Yet others left because many Poles viewed Jews with hostility due to antisemitic prejudice.|$|R
50|$|Kalmanovich {{was born}} in Kaunas, Soviet Lithuania to an impoverished Jewish family in 1947. His mother was a Holocaust {{survivor}} who had been sheltered by a Lithuanian family after escaping Nazi captivity in the Ninth Fort.

When his commanders learned that his family was planning to emigrate to Israel, he was summoned to the Jewish administration of the KGB, and was recruited as a spy in exchange for expediting the emigration procedures {{for himself and his}} family.

50|$|The {{restriction}} {{of the movement}} of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories by the Israeli government is {{an issue in the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict. According to B'Tselem, following the 1967 war, the Occupied Territories were proclaimed closed military zones. In 1972, general exit orders were issued allowing residents of those territories to move freely between the West Bank, Israel and Gaza. Following the first Intifada by 1991, these general exit orders were revoked, and personal <b>exit</b> <b>permits</b> were required. According to B'Tselem, a measure of overall closure of the Occupied Territories was enacted {{for the first time in}} 1993, and would result in total closures following rises in Palestinian political violence.|$|R
50|$|The ghetto {{inhabitants}} - most of {{whom were}} killed during Operation Reinhard - possessed Polish citizenship before the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland, which in turn enabled over 150,000 Holocaust survivors registered at CKŻP {{to take advantage of the}} later repatriation agreements between the governments of Poland and the Soviet Union, and legally emigrate to the West to help form the nascent State of Israel. Poland was the only Eastern Bloc country to allow free Jewish aliyah without visas or <b>exit</b> <b>permits</b> upon the conclusion of World War II. By contrast, Stalin forcibly brought Soviet Jews back to USSR along with all Soviet citizens, as agreed to in the Yalta Conference.|$|R
25|$|On 6 November 1965, Cuba and the United States {{agreed to}} an airlift for Cubans who wanted to emigrate to the United States. The first of these {{so-called}} Freedom Flights left Cuba on 1 December 1965, and by 1971 over 250,000 Cubans had flown to the United States. In 1980 another 125,000 came to United States during a six-month period in the Mariel boatlift, including some criminals and people with psychiatric diagnoses. It was discovered that the Cuban government was using the event to rid Cuba of the unwanted segments of its society.
