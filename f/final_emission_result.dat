40|$|The {{estimation}} of measurement uncertainty {{with regards to}} hazardous air pollution emissions from stationary sources is currently the most uncertain element associated with respect to obtaining relevant, valid particulate matter (PM) emission data in South Africa. This project is aimed at developing an appropriate method to evaluate the uncertainty associated with PM measurements conducted for stationary source emissions in the South African context. A series of In-Stack measurements were taken in accordance with recognized international methodology (ISO 9096 : 1992 and 2003) on two different industrial processes, representing a compliant and non-compliant scenario. A comparison between the two scenarios was made {{in an attempt to}} establish what components of the sampling technique have the greatest error. The overarching goal of this project was to establish an estimate of the cumulative uncertainty on the <b>final</b> <b>emission</b> values obtained, inclusive of both analytical, field sampling and process related variables that may result in a cumulative error associated with quantifying stationary source PM <b>emission</b> values. The <b>results</b> of the study found that the estimated combined expanded uncertainty for both sets of data was calculated to be between 62 – 72 %. Upon closer analysis of the data it was ascertained that the data obtained were inadequate and the calculation of the uncertainty of the results both with the compliant and non-compliant sampling campaigns revealed that the variability of the results was too great for both scenarios to make any statistically valid observations or conclusions about the data. In lieu of this the author has developed an alternative tool (a sampling suitability matrix) for assessing the quality and reliability of reported emission figures. It is expected to add significant value to the interpretation of the quality and reliability of the <b>final</b> <b>emission</b> <b>results</b> reported. The intention of this tool is to be incorporated as supplementary information into all emission reports in future. This will enable the plant operator and regulator to assess the quality of reported data and <b>final</b> <b>emission</b> <b>results,</b> thus assisting in establishing whether the plant is in compliance with their Air Emission License (AEL) requirements or not...|$|R

The engine was equipped with high pressure diesel injection, a Variable Geometry Turbine (VGT) and an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system. This engine was targeted at meeting EURO 4 <b>emission</b> requirements. The <b>final</b> <b>emission</b> <b>results</b> were 2. 4 g/kWh NOx and 0. 107 g/kWh particulates for the European 13 mode test.

In the design of the EGR system the model provided initial asessments of the properties of this system. Associated engine and turbocharger behaviour as well as optimal control strategies were predicted. A transient engine control algorithm was developed using the dynamic engine model. The VGT is closed loop controlled and EGR is shut off during a short time after a load increase.

40|$|STATCONT is a python-based tool {{designed}} to determine the continuum emission level in spectral data, in particular for sources with a line-rich spectrum. The tool inspects the intensity distribution of a given spectrum and automatically determines the continuum level by using different statistical approaches. The different methods included in STATCONT are tested against synthetic data. We conclude that the sigma-clipping algorithm provides the most accurate continuum level determination, together with information on the uncertainty in its determination. This uncertainty {{can be used to}} correct the <b>final</b> continuum <b>emission</b> level, <b>resulting</b> in the here called `corrected sigma-clipping method' or c-SCM. The c-SCM has been tested against more than 750 different synthetic spectra reproducing typical conditions found towards astronomical sources. The continuum level is determined with a discrepancy of less than 1 % in 50 % of the cases, and less than 5 % in 90 % of the cases, provided at least 10 % of the channels are line free. The main products of STATCONT are the continuum emission level, together with a conservative value of its uncertainty, and datacubes containing only spectral line emission, i. e., continuum-subtracted datacubes. STATCONT also includes the option to estimate the spectral index, when different files covering different frequency ranges are provided. Comment: 16 pages, 13 figures and 2 tables.

40|$|The Kyoto Protocol {{created a}} {{framework}} of responsibilities and mechanisms to mitigate climate change by reducing the {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} (GHGs) into the atmosphere. The Protocol stipulates accounting and reporting of GHG emissions and removals, such as energy use, industrial processes, agriculture, waste and net <b>emissions</b> <b>resulting</b> from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities. Emissions reported according to the rules set by the Kyoto Protocol do not include GHG emissions outside a country's boundaries resulting from the production of imported goods or services. As a result, GHG accounts constructed according to the Kyoto Protocol reflect the GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>resulting</b> from the production system of a country, but not all the <b>emission</b> <b>resulting</b> from the consumption of goods and services within the country.
