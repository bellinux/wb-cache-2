40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} colorectal carcinoma with liver metastasis {{are not well}} known. Metastasizing colon <b>carcinoma</b> <b>cells</b> express more FasL than primary colon <b>carcinoma</b> <b>cells</b> and cancer cells induce apoptosis in hepatocytes by the Fas/FasL pathway. Therefore, this study focused on Fas/FasL expression and functionality in rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and CC 531 <b>s</b> colon <b>carcinoma</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro and in vivo. RT-PCR and immunochemistry revealed Fas and FasL in LSECs and CC 531 s, respectively. Functionality of Fas was assessed in vitro by incubation with human recombinant FasL (1 - 100 ng/ml) with or without enhancer. At concentrations of 10 and 100 ng/ml with enhancer, respectively 21 % and 44 % of endothelial cells showed signs of apoptosis using Hoechst 33342 /propidium iodide staining and electron microscopy. In co-cultures, apoptosis could be detected in endothelial cells neighboring the CC 531 s and could be inhibited by an antagonistic FasL antibody. Moreover, 18 h after mesenteric injection of CC 531 s, the sinusoidal endothelium revealed disruption. In conclusion, (i) CC 531 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> induce apoptosis in LSECs in vitro by using Fas/FasL; (ii) CC 531 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> damage the sinusoidal endothelial lining in vivo; and (iii) this might provide FasL-positive tumor cells a gateway towards the hepatocytes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background and Significance There {{is a need}} {{to develop}} {{non-invasive}} diagnostic tools to achieve early and accurate detection of skin cancer in a non-surgical manner. In this study, we evaluate the capability of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, a potentially non-invasive optical imaging technique, for identifying the pathological features of <b>s</b> squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (SCC) tissue. Study Design We studied ex vivo SCC and healthy skin tissues using SRS microscopy, and compared the SRS contrast with the contrast obtained in reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and standard histology. Results and Conclusion SRS images obtained at the carbon-hydrogen stretching vibration at 2945 cm - 1 exhibit contrast related protein density that clearly delineates the cell nucleus from the cell cytoplasm. The morphological features of SCC tumor seen in the SRS images show excellent correlation with the diagnostic features identified by histological examination. Additionally, SRS exhibits enhanced cellular contrast in comparison to that seen in confocal microscopy. In conclusion, SRS represents an attractive approach for generating protein density maps with contrast that closely resembles histopathological contrast of SCC in human skin. Lasers Surg.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hepatic natural killer (NK) cells, {{the most}} {{cytotoxic}} {{cells of the}} natural occurring NK cells, {{are located in the}} liver sinusoids and are thus in a strategic position to kill arriving metastasising tumour <b>cells,</b> like colon <b>carcinoma</b> <b>cells.</b> It is known that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I on tumour cells negatively regulates NK cell-mediated cytolysis, but this is found using blood- or spleen-derived NK cells. Therefore, using isolated rat hepatic NK cells and the syngeneic colon <b>carcinoma</b> <b>cell</b> line CC 531 s, we investigated whether this protective role of MHC class I is also operative in hepatic NK cells, and addressed the mechanism of MHC class I protection. RESULTS: When MHC class I on CC 531 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> was masked by preincubation with monoclonal antibody OX 18, hepatic NK cell-mediated cytolysis (51 Cr release) as well as apoptosis (DNA fragmentation, nucleus condensation and fragmentation) increased. When hepatic NK cells were preincubated with the granzyme inhibitor 3, 4 -dichloroisocoumarin, or when extracellular Ca 2 + was chelated by ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N, N-tetraacetic acid, the enhanced cytolysis and apoptosis were completely inhibited. The involvement of the perforin/granzyme pathway was confirmed by showing that the enhanced cytolysis was caspase-independent. CONCLUSIONS: MHC class I expression protects CC 531 <b>s</b> colon <b>carcinoma</b> <b>cells</b> from hepatic NK cell-mediated apoptosis and cytolysis, by blocking the perforin/granzyme pathway.

40|$|The atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) is {{a powerful}} tool to investigate surface and submembranous structures of living cells under physiological conditions at high resolution. These properties enabled us to study the interaction between live hepatic natural killer (NK) cells, also called pit <b>cells,</b> and colon <b>carcinoma</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro by AFM. In addition, the staining for filamentous actin and DNA was performed {{and served as a}} reference, because actin and nuclear observations at the light microscopic level during the cytotoxic interaction between these two cell types have been presented earlier. In this study, we collected evidence that conjugation of hepatic NK cells with CC 531 <b>s</b> colon <b>carcinoma</b> <b>cells</b> results in a decreased binding of CC 531 <b>s</b> <b>cells</b> to the substratum as probed with the AFM in contact mode as early as 10 min after cell contact (n = 11). To avoid the lateral forces and smearing artefacts of contact mode AFM, non-contact imaging was performed on hepatic NK/CC 531 <b>s</b> <b>cell</b> conjugates, resulting in identical observations (n = 3). In contrast, the first cytotoxic signs, as determined with the nuclear staining dye Hoechst 33342, could be observed 3 h after the start of the co-culture. This study illustrates that the AFM can be used to probe early cytotoxic effects of effector to target cell contact in nearby physiological conditions. Other routine cytotoxicity tests detect the first cytotoxic effects after 1. 5 - 3 h co-incubation at the earliest. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

Some {{cases can}} be {{attributed}} to individuals with hereditary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> usually consisting of the clear cell subtype. In addition, two syndromes with hereditary papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> have been described. One is the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> which is characterized by cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> mostly consisting of the papillary renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> type II with a worse prognosis.

Materials and Methods: We studied 8, 030 patients with renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> based on the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. The SIR of second cancer was calculated by comparing it to the rate of first cancers. Followup was started in 1993 and continued through 2006. Results: A total of 677 patients had second cancers after the first renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> including 89 second renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> In 776 patients renal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> was diagnosed after another primary cancer.

Twenty basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 20 squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 10 basosquamous carcinomas and 2 collision tumors of the skin were stained with Ber-EP 4 immunohistochemically. All basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were stained strongly and diffusely with Ber-EP 4, whereas squamous <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were not, and basosquamous carcinomas were partially stained. Our results suggest that, distinction of basal <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and basosquamous carcinoma can be achieved with routine immunohistochemical Ber-EP 4 staining...|$|R
