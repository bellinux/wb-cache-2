5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E
500|$|David's {{interest}} in cooking was sparked by a 21st birthday gift {{from her mother}} of The Gentle Art of Cookery by Hilda Leyel, her first cookery book. She later wrote, [...] "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ever learned to cook at all if I {{had been given a}} routine Mrs Beeton to learn from, instead of the romantic Mrs Leyel with her rather wild, imagination-catching recipes." ...|$|E
500|$|From Oxford, David {{moved to}} the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park, London, the {{following}} year. She rented rooms in a large house near the park, spent a generous 21st birthday present on equipping the kitchen, and learned to cook. A gift from her mother of The Gentle Art of Cookery by Hilda Leyel was her first cookery book. She later wrote, [...] "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ever learned to cook at all if I {{had been given a}} routine Mrs Beeton to learn from, instead of the romantic Mrs Leyel with her rather wild, imagination-catching recipes." ...|$|E

60|$|The later one of 6.15 P.M., {{suggesting}} {{the probability of}} your being overwhelmed by two hundred thousand, and talking of where the responsibility will belong, pains me very much. I give you all I can, and act on the presumption that you will {{do the best you}} can with what you have, while you continue, ungenerously I think, to assume that I could give you more <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> omitted, and shall omit, no opportunity to send you reinforcements whenever I possibly can.|$|R
500|$|In {{modern times}} Mrs. Beeton's {{practice}} has been criticised as plagiarism; Beeton's modern biographer Kathryn Hughes talks of her [...] "lifting" [...] and [...] "brazenly copying" [...] recipes from others, {{and says that}} this was [...] "the way that cookery books had been put together from time immemorial ...". The New York Times said, [...] "Isabella [...] plagiarised only the best". [...] This led to the comment that [...] "Mrs Beeton couldn't cook but she could copy". Hughes recounts that Beeton's [...] "first recipe for Victoria sponge was so inept that she left out the eggs" [...] and that her work was [...] "brazenly copied... almost word for word, from books {{as far back as}} the Restoration". The influential 20th-century food writer Elizabeth David dismissed her as [...] "a plagiarist" [...] and later wrote: [...] "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ever learned to cook at all if I had been given a routine Mrs Beeton to learn from".|$|E
500|$|In a {{surprising}} choice, former Maryland assistant coach and Citadel head coach Bobby Ross, {{who was not}} a big name at the time, was selected as head coach in 1982. In contrast to Claiborne's style, Ross implemented a high-powered offense. He replaced the I-veer triple option with an NFL-style offense that emphasized dropback passes, bootlegs, and play action passes. This change in tactics and strategy enabled starting quarterback Boomer Esiason the opportunity to excel to a degree not seen under Claiborne the season prior. Esiason said, [...] "Ross has an uncanny knack of putting players in a position to not only succeed, but to overachieve [...] [...] [...] If he didn't show up at Maryland, I don't know what would have happened to me. I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> turned into the player I was and played in the NFL." [...] In the following years, several Maryland quarterbacks went on to careers in the National Football League (NFL), and the school was nicknamed [...] "Quarterback U" [...] as a result.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{was given}} special mention by Diana Athill in her memoir Stet, {{covering}} her decades {{as an editor}} with UK publisher Andre Deutsch: [...] "Having to read Beowulf almost turned me against Oxford, so when a New York agent offered me this novel I could hardly bring myself to open it. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> hadn't, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> missed a great pleasure - a really powerful feat of imagination." ...|$|R

2500|$|Monica's career {{came to a}} {{slow down}} in 1999 due to {{relationship}} problems with her ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems. In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, {{who had died in}} an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998, when Weems, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide. [...] "Afterward, I felt, 'What else could I have done?' You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: Maybe if I had said this, or <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done that,'" [...] {{she said in an interview}} with The Cincinnati Enquirer the following year. [...] "It's just something that it's never possible for me to go back and change." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl. After {{the success of the}} video, Lee received some film offers. Talking about the video, Stölzl said: [...] "On the one hand, it brings out the most catchy part of the song, the bridge, the duet with the male and female vocals. On the other hand, it reflects the [...] soundtrack background of the song. I did not know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to use a stunt double for most of the angles, which would have restricted me a lot, but then it turned out that Amy did everything herself, hanging on Paul's arm for hours without getting tired. In the end, she is the one who made that shot strong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Set to {{work and}} produce abortions!" [...] cried Roderick with ire. [...] "Preach that to others. Production with me must be either {{pleasure}} or nothing. As I said just now, I must either stay in the saddle or not go at all. I won't do second-rate work; <b>I</b> can't <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no cleverness, apart from inspiration. I am not a Gloriani!

2500|$|In the Tour de France, I took steroids. That {{is not a}} stimulant, just a strengthener. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> hadn't, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to give up. [...] On {{the first}} rest day, before {{we went into the}} Pyrenees, I had a first hormone injection. I had another one on the second day, {{at the start of the}} last week. You can't call that {{medically}} harmful, not if it's done under a doctor's control and within reason.|$|R

2500|$|During a December 3, 2009 {{interview}} on Rusty Humphries' radio talk show, Humphries asked Sarah Palin {{if she would}} make Barack Obama's birth certificate a campaign issue in 2012, should she decide to run. Palin responded, [...] "I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't {{have a problem with}} that. I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." [...] Humphries followed up, asking whether she thinks Obama's birth certificate is a fair question to be looking at. Palin answered, [...] "I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records– all of that is fair game. The McCain–Palin campaign didn't do a good enough job in that area." ...|$|E

I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." [...] When asked if people had a legitimate reason to question the certificate, she stated, [...] "I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records– all of that is fair game." [...] She also stated that the questions were 'fair play' because, [...] "the weird conspiracy theory freaky thing that people talk about that Trig isn't my real son– 'You need to produce his birth certificate, you need to prove that he's your kid,' which we have done. [...] Maybe we can reverse that." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{years during}} Gwynn's career, media preseason {{predictions}} declared that [...] "this season" [...] {{he would become}} {{the first player to}} hit [...]400 since Williams in 1941. Relatively healthy in 1994, Gwynn batted [...]394, his career-high and the highest in the National League since Bill Terry hit [...]401 in 1930; he also had a league-leading [...]454 OBP. From April 22 through the 24 against Philadelphia, he had eight consecutive hits and reached base nine straight times, tying Padres records held by Winfield and Bip Roberts, respectively. Gwynn was batting [...]383 at the All-Star break; however, talk of a strike by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) was looming, and he wanted to get to [...]400 before that date. He hit [...]423 over 28 games in the second half, and heated up to [...]475 though 10 games in August, when the season ended prematurely on August 11 due to the baseball strike. He was 6-for-9 in the last two games and 3-for-5 in the eventual finale, falling short of batting [...]400 by three hits. Fans were awaiting an end to the strike and for Gwynn to resume his quest for [...]400, but hopes of the season restarting were dashed when the World Series was canceled. He later commented, [...] "I'm not unhappy or bitter that the strike came. I look at it this way: I would have sooner fell short due to the strike than <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> hit [...]400 and then the strike came. Then people would have thought I would have collapsed down the stretch, instead of being at [...]390 when the strike came and being so close." [...] That year, Gwynn pulled the ball with greater regularity. He was 10th in the league with a slugging percentage of [...]568, which was also his career-high. His 12homers in 419at-bats was a higher rate than in 1986, when he hit a then-career high 14homers in 642at-bats. He won another batting title (.368) in 1995. For the second straight year, he did not go longer than two games without a hit. He led the NL in batting {{with runners in scoring position}} (.394), and he had a then-career high 90 RBI. Gwynn hit in 15 straight games in July, his longest hitting streak since his 18-game run in 1988. He hit 28-for-65 (.431) with 15 RBI during the streak. Although he missed batting [...]400 in 1994, he batted [...]403 during a 179-game stretch between July 3, 1993 and May 9, 1995.|$|E
