500|$|A {{simplified}} two-dimensional {{model for}} the spread of wildfires that used convection to represent the effects of wind and terrain, as well as radiative heat transfer as the dominant method of heat transport led to reaction-diffusion systems of partial differential equations. More complex models join numerical weather models or computational fluid dynamics models with a wildfire component which allow the feedback effects between the fire and the atmosphere to be estimated. [...] The additional complexity in the latter class of models translates to a corresponding increase in their computer power requirements. In fact, a full three-dimensional treatment of combustion via direct numerical simulation at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling is not currently practical because of the excessive computational cost such a simulation would require. [...] Numerical weather models have limited forecast skill at spatial resolutions under , forcing complex wildfire models to parameterize the fire in order to calculate how the winds will be modified locally by the wildfire, and to use those modified winds to determine {{the rate at which}} the fire will spread locally. [...] Although models such as Los Alamos' FIRETEC solve for the concentrations of fuel and oxygen, the computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve the combustion reaction, so approximations must be made for the temperature distribution within each <b>grid</b> <b>cell,</b> as well as for the combustion reaction rates themselves.|$|E

40|$|Theta rhythmic {{fluctuations}} in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit are believed to reflect rapid transitions between modes of mnemonic processing. Specifically, activity at the trough and peak of CA 1 pyramidal layer theta is thought to correspond to retrieval and encoding related processing, respectively. Spatially tuned ‘grid cells’ in layers II and III of the medial entorhinal cortex preferentially spike during the trough and peak phases of theta, respectively. Such differences suggest differential involvement of these layers to the processes of retrieval and encoding. It remains unknown, however, if the properties of <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> that spike preferentially at the trough versus the peak of theta differ systematically. Such putative differences would offer insights into the differential processing that occurs during these two phases. The goal of the present work was to contrast these types of <b>grid</b> <b>cells.</b> We found that significant functional dissociations do exist: trough locked <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> carried more spatial information, had {{a higher degree of}} head direction tuning, and were more likely to phase precess. Thus, <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> that activate during the putative retrieval phase of theta (trough) have a greater degree of location, orientation and temporal tuning specificity relative to <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> that activate during the putative encoding phase (peak), potentially reflecting the influence of the retrieved content. Additionally, trough locked <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> had a lower average firing rate, were more likely to burst, and were less phase locked to high-gamma (~ 80 Hz). Further analyses revealed they had different waveforms profiles and that systemic blockade of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors reduced the spatial tuning of both types, although these differences were only significant for the peak locked <b>grid</b> <b>cells.</b> These differences suggest that trough and peak locked <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> are distinct populations of neurons...|$|R

40|$|<b>Grid</b> <b>cells</b> {{recorded}} in the parahippocampal formation of freely moving rodents provide a strikingly periodic representation of self-location whose underlying mechanism {{has been the subject}} of intense interest. Our previous work(1) showed that <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> represent the most stable subset of a larger continuum of spatially periodic cells (SPCs) which deviate from the hexagonal symmetry observed in <b>grid</b> <b>cells.</b> Recently Navratilova et al(2) suggested that our findings reflected poor isolation of the spikes from multiple <b>grid</b> <b>cells,</b> rather than the existence of actual non-grid SPCs. Here we refute this suggestion by showing that: (i) most SPCs cannot be formed from hexagonal grids; (ii) all standard cluster isolation measures are similar between recorded <b>grid</b> <b>cells</b> and non-grid SPCs, and are comparable to those reported in other laboratories; (iii) the spikes from different fields of band-like SPCs do not differ. Thus the theoretical implications of the presence of cells with spatially periodic firing patterns that diverge from perfect hexagonality need to be taken seriously, rather than explained away on the basis of hopeful but unjustified assumptions.
