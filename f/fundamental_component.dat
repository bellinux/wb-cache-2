5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a <b>fundamental</b> <b>component</b> in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E

25|$|It {{is unclear}} {{to what extent}} fish {{played a role in}} the cuisine, but it is {{apparent}} that fish became steadily more available during the Israelite and Judean monarchies. Fish products were salted and dried and sent great distances. However, even in the later Persian, Greek and Roman periods, the cost of preserving and transporting fish must have meant that only wealthier inhabitants of the highland towns and cities could afford it, or those who lived close to the sources, where it was less expensive. In the Galilee, small-scale fishing was a <b>fundamental</b> <b>component</b> of the agrarian economy.|$|E
500|$|Along with Arab nationalism, anti-imperialism {{was also}} a {{defining}} feature of Gaddafi's regime during its early years. He believed in opposing Western imperialism and colonialism in the Arab world, including any Western expansionism through the form of Israel. For many years, anti-Zionism was a <b>fundamental</b> <b>component</b> of Gaddafi's ideology. He believed that the state of Israel should not exist, and that any Arab compromise with the Israeli government was a betrayal of the Arab people. In large part due to their support of Israel, Gaddafi despised the United States, considering the country to be imperialist and lambasting it as [...] "the embodiment of evil." [...] He rallied against Jews in many of his speeches, with Blundy and Lycett claiming that his anti-Semitism was [...] "almost Hitlerian". His views later shifted; in 2009, he stated that [...] "the Jews have been held captive, massacred, disadvantaged in every possible fashion... want and deserve their homeland." [...] He called for both Jews and Palestinians to [...] "move beyond old conflicts and look to a unified future based on shared culture and respect", forging a single-state that he termed [...] "Isratin".|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} model for the {{computer}} representation of the Pān. inian system of sanskrit grammar. Based on this model, we render the grammatical data and simulate the rules of As. t. ādhyāyī on computer. We then employ these rules for generation of morpho-syntactical components of the language. These generated components we store in a p-subsequential automata. This we use to develop a lexicon on Pān. inian principles. We report briefly its implementation. 1 A Representation of As. t. ādhyāyī The general grammatical process of As. t. ādhyāyī (Katre, 1989) can be viewed as consisting of the following three basic steps: 1. Prescription of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>components</b> which constitute the language. 2. Characterization of these <b>fundamental</b> <b>components</b> by assigning them a number of attributes. 3. Specification of grammatical operations based on the <b>fundamental</b> <b>components</b> and their attributes. 1. 1 <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Components</b> In his grammar Pān. ini furnishes a number of elements (phonemes/morphemes/lexemes) which constitute the building blocks of the language. We assign each of them a unique key in our database. Thus the phoneme /a / has the key a 0, the kr. t suffix /a / has the key a 3 and the taddhita suffix /a / is represented by the key a 4. Given such a collection of unique keys, we define the set of <b>fundamental</b> <b>components</b> as follows: Definition 1 The collection of unique keys corresponding to the basic constituents of the language, we define as the set F of <b>fundamental</b> <b>components.</b> Further, we decompose this set F into two disjoint sets P and M, where P is the set of keys corresponding to the phonemes and M containing the keys {{of the rest of the}} constituting elements (morphemes/lexemes). P = {a 0, i 0, u 0, [...] . } M = {bhU a, tip 0, laT 0, [...] . ...|$|R

[...] is the <b>fundamental</b> <b>component</b> of the current and [...] {{is the total}} current – both are root mean square-values (distortion power factor {{can also be used}} to describe individual order harmonics, using the corresponding current in place of total current). This definition with respect to total harmonic distortion assumes that the voltage stays undistorted (sinusoidal, without harmonics). This simplification is often a good approximation for stiff voltage sources (not being affected by changes in load downstream in the distribution network). Total harmonic distortion of typical generators from current distortion in the network is on the order of 1–2%, which can have larger scale implications but can be ignored in common practice.|$|E

2500|$|Anthony J. Bryant {{describes}} the encounters between Saishō and the Chūnagon, and the Emperor {{and the former}} Chūnagon as rape. Margaret Childs believes that in love relationships in ancient Japan, showing vulnerability was highly prized and erotic, unlike in modern American society. She believes that for both sexes, nurturing was [...] "a <b>fundamental</b> <b>component</b> of love". Thus, when a woman expresses distress at a man's overtures, she becomes erotic to him. Childs contrasts the different ways that Naishi no Kami, Shi no Kimi and the female Chūnagon resist the overtures of Saishō. Naishi no Kami, the only successful resistant, resists by remaining cold and [...] "impassive". [...] Saishō becomes distressed, but Naishi no Kami remains unmoved. [...] Although {{it is important to}} the plot that Naishi no Kami should not be discovered as a man, Childs believes that Naishi no Kami's tactic would have been considered plausible by the audience. [...] Shi no Kimi, on the other hand, is initially frightened of Saishō, and so he [...] "assaults" [...] her, and then afterwards comforts her. [...] He coerces a servant into letting him into Shi no Kimi's quarters. [...] Eventually, as Saishō shows his own vulnerability through their encounters, she becomes attracted to him. Saishō found Chūnagon attractive, both through 'his' own beauty and because Chūnagon reminds Saishō of Shi no Kimi and Naishi no Kami. One evening as they were talking, and Chūnagon was [...] "affectionately" [...] listening to Saishō's love problems, Saishō embraces Chūnagon, and tells the Chūnagon that he loves 'him', thinking she is a man. The Chūnagon becomes angry with Saisho and tells him off, but Saishō only becomes more fervent in his embrace, and discovers the Chūnagon is a woman. Chūnagon then loses her courage - though she remains cold, she no longer actively resists him.|$|E

40|$|The topic {{commonly}} referred to as trombone technique consists of four separate but related components. Those are Breathing and Air Support, Embouchure Control and Flexibility, Slide Precision and Timing, and Articulation. Regardless of the difficulty of the music to be performed, or of the trombonists’ skill level, mastery of these <b>fundamental</b> <b>components</b> is essential to successful performance. Throughout the twenty years that I have practiced, studied, and taught trombone performance technique, I have identified several technical deficiencies that seem to be common among many trombonists, myself included. I believe these deficiencies may be traced to flaws in the four <b>fundamental</b> <b>components</b> mentioned above. This dissertation seeks to explain the four <b>fundamental</b> <b>components,</b> identify the common deficiencies related to each component, and offer a method of addressing these deficiencies. There are three parts to this project. The first is the written element, the second consists of musical exercises, and the third element is an audio recording demonstration of the musical exercises. Contained within the written element, are the results of a survey conducted to determine the validity of the concepts of the four <b>fundamental</b> <b>components.</b> This dissertation project provides a clear and concise explanation of the four <b>fundamental</b> <b>components</b> of trombone performance technique. It also identifies common technical deficiencies. Furthermore, it prescribes a practical, systematic approach to eliminate these deficiencies through the development of necessary fundamentals.

2500|$|However, {{some recent}} {{scholarship}} {{has argued that}} attempts by Salafis and Jihadis to portray the figure of Ibn Taymiyyah as being a direct classical precursor of their own beliefs are flawed inasmuch as they are often borne, according to these same scholars, of a limited reading of the theologian's substantial corpus of works, {{many of which have}} not yet been translated from the original Arabic. James Pavlin, for example, has argued: [...] "Ibn Taymiyya {{remains one of the most}} controversial Islamic thinkers today because of his supposed influence on many fundamentalist movements. The common understanding of his ideas have been filtered through the bits and pieces of his statements that have been misappropriated by ... alleged supporters." [...] Additionally, Abdul Haq Ansari has argued that the ubiquitous notion that Ibn Taymiyyah rejected Sufism outright is erroneous, for while [...] "the popular image of Ibn Taymiyyah ... that he [...] Sufism indiscriminately ... deadly against the Sufis, and ... no place for Sufism in Islam," [...] it is historically known, according to the same scholar, that Ibn Taymiyyah actually considered Sufism an essential part of Islam, being on the whole [...] "sympathetic" [...] towards what everyone at the time considered an integral part of Islamic life. Indeed, [...] "far from saying [...] has no place in Islam," [...] Ibn Taymiyyah, according to the same author, seems to have wanted to reform the practice of medieval Sufism as part of his wider aim to reform Sunni Islam (of which Sufism was a <b>fundamental</b> <b>component</b> at the time) by divesting both these traditions of what he perceived to be heretical innovations within them. Moreover, these scholars also point out that Ibn Taymiyyah had a deep reverence and appreciation for the works of such major Sufi saints as Junayd, Sahl al-Tustari, Abu Talib al-Makki, and even Bayazid Bastami, and was part of the Qadiriyya Sufi order himself.|$|E
