5|$|After {{his defeat}} in the 2000 presidential {{election}} by George W. Bush, Gore returned his focus to the topic. He edited and adapted a slide show he had compiled years earlier, and began featuring the slide show in presentations on global warming across the U.S. and around the world. At {{the time of the}} film, Gore estimated <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> the presentation more than one thousand times.|$|E
5|$|Thorkildsen's {{relationship}} with the Norwegian hurdler Christina Vukicevic generated some unwanted publicity on his part. When Thorkildsen and Vukicevic won the King's Cup {{for men and women}} respectively at the 2006 Norwegian championships, Thorkildsen left the stadium to avoid photographers, whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> the finger the previous day. In March 2011 Vukicevic and Thorkildsen announced in the Norwegian media that they no longer were a couple.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{promising}} start Reid failed {{to recapture the}} form <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> at Forest and {{had to wait until}} May before netting for his new club, coming against Aston Villa in a 5–1 win {{at the end of the}} season. Making only 20 starts in 26 appearances he scored just one goal for Tottenham leading him to be listed by one journalist as one of the worst signings of the January Transfer market.|$|E

5|$|After a brief stay in Europe, Atangana {{returned}} to his homeland in Cameroon, which by then was a League of Nations mandate territory under {{the administration of the}} French Third Republic. The French doubted his loyalties at first, but Atangana served them with the same ardour <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> the Germans and regained his post as paramount chief. During the remainder of his life, he oversaw the Westernisation of his subjects and the improvement of his domains despite the erosion of his powers due to French policies and unrest among his people. He never advocated resistance to the European powers, preferring to embrace the European as a means of personal enrichment and in the service of African interests. After his death in 1943, Atangana was largely forgotten. However, since Cameroon's independence in 1960, Cameroonian scholars have rediscovered his story.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{frustrated at}} {{his failure to}} make an impact at Newcastle, Chopra signed for Cardiff City in June 2006 for £500,000. On his decision to leave Newcastle, Chopra stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> loyalty to the club and expressed his desire to receive the same loyalty from the club. He also added that he would love to return to Newcastle in the future. During the season, Chopra scored 22 goals in 44 matches. He helped the club remain top of the Championship throughout September, earning the Championship Player of the month for September. He was also featured in the PFA Team of the season (an annual award given to a set of 44 footballers in the top four tiers of English football).|$|E
5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work {{was going to be}} his masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> many times in the past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along {{the west bank of the}} Bronx River.|$|E

Most of all <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> a disbelieving world that republican government could prosper without being spineless or disorderly or reverting to authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|Hooper has all {{the main}} {{attributes}} to play as a striker, he is strong and can hold up the ball well. He {{is also a good}} finisher, he has been described as being a 'penalty box striker'. However, he can also pass the ball well and this allows midfielders to play-off him. He has received praise since moving to Scotland. Newspaper The Daily Record described him as being one of the most skilled attackers in the SPL. They also said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> that he could deal with the physical nature of the Scottish game, due to his ability to ride a challenge well.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} University match, Mitchell-Innes made his fourth {{appearance}} {{in as many}} years for the Gentlemen against the Players, but after being asked to the open the innings was out for just four runs in the first innings. He improved in the second innings, scoring fifty runs after an indifferent start, {{but was unable to}} prevent his side losing by eight wickets. He subsequently top-scored for Scotland in a first-class match against the touring New Zealanders. In seven appearances for Somerset during the seasons, Mitchell-Innes was unable to replicate the form <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> with Oxford, and only passed fifty run in an innings once, scoring 135 runs at an average of under ten.|$|E

5|$|The band {{met at the}} Londonderry Hotel on Park Lane, {{overlooking}} the park, where they had booked a tenth-floor suite, and proceeded to the park in the armoured personnel carrier, together with their two official photographers, Michael Cooper and Spanish Tony Sanchez. They alighted from the carrier into a caravan-trailer behind the stage. Jagger, his face heavily made up and with a studded leather collar around his neck, was clad in a white dress. He had borrowed the dress, which had been made for Sammy Davis Jr. at the Mr. Fish boutique, and wore it to Prince Rupert Lowenstein's white ball, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> it to Princess Margaret. Jagger was only to wear it for half-an-hour at the Hyde Park concert, after which he tore it off to reveal a violet T-shirt and white loon pants.|$|E
5|$|After Parry-Jones's death Scott lived {{quietly for}} a while in the West Country. In January 1974 he met Tim Keigwin, Thorpe's Conservative {{opponent}} in North Devon, and gave his version of his relationship with Thorpe. Keigwin was advised by the Conservative leadership that the material should not be used. Scott also confided in his doctor, Ronald Gleadle, who was treating him for depression. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> Gleadle his dossier of documents; the doctor, without Scott's knowledge or consent, sold the papers to Holmes, who had assumed the role of Thorpe's protector after Bessell settled permanently in California in January 1974. Holmes paid £2,500 for the documents, which were promptly burned in the home of Thorpe's solicitor. A further cache of papers was discovered in November 1974, by builders renovating a London office formerly used by Bessell. They found a briefcase containing letters and photographs that apparently compromised Thorpe, among them Scott's 1965 letter to Ursula Thorpe. Undecided what to do with their find, they took it to the Sunday Mirror newspaper. Sidney Jacobson, the paper's deputy chairman, decided not to publish the material and passed the briefcase and its content to Thorpe. Copies of the documents were, however, kept in the newspaper's files.|$|E
5|$|Believing Mercer to {{have been}} captured, General Currie assumed command of the battle and {{with the use of}} {{saturation}} bombardment was able to retake the lost trenches and drive the Germans back to Mount Sorrel despite heavy casualties. On the 21 June a Canadian burial party found 30 bodies in a sector of trench, amongst them General Mercer's remains, only recognisable by his uniform decoration. Mercer was buried in a military grave at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery, later surmounted with a Commonwealth War Grave headstone. Mercer's funeral was attended by many men of his Division and from his old regiments as well as numerous Canadian and British officers who had worked alongside him. Mercer was posthumously mentioned in dispatches for his courage under fire, the third time he had been so mentioned, and his division was taken over by Major-General Louis Lipsett who was himself killed in action two years later. Mercer is remembered as an efficient and capable organiser who never got the opportunity to demonstrate the tactical nous <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> in training and exercises. He also remains the highest ranking Canadian officer to ever be killed in combat and reportedly by friendly fire.|$|E
