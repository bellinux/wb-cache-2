40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of treatments {{of the surface}} layer of novel foam core particleboards were evaluated by means of Cone calorimeter tests. Foam core particleboards with variations of surface layer treatment, adhesives and surface layer thicknesses under similar processing conditions were used to produce the test specimen for the Cone calorimeter tests. Ignitability, heat release rate profile, peak of heat release rate, total heat released, effective heat of combustion, mass loss rate, gaseous emissions and specific extinction area were measured using the cone irradiance of 50 kW/m 2. Additional analysis of this data provided fuel composition information that could reveal the pyrolysis events of the composite boards. Thermocouples at various depths were used to provide further verification of pyrolysis events. The unprotected foam core panels generally had much higher heat release rates, somewhat higher heat of combustion and much higher smoke production due to the EPS-foam component of tested panels, whereas time to ignition and total heat release were not pronounced from the veneer treated boards. Adding the commercial FRT veneer to the face particleboard provided a dramatic improvement to the measured flammability properties.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study to elucidate the mechanisms of the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> over a filter paper permeated with an adhesive. For this study, two typical adhesives used for general purposes are adopted. One is polyvinyl acetate resin, and the other is urea resin. The <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rates</b> and temperature profiles near leading flame edges were measured. Also, thermogravimetric analyses of the samples were performed. It was found that <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> depends strongly on the pyrolysis reaction of the permeated adhesive. The highest pyrolysis temperature is of the pure filter paper, and the pyrolysis temperature decreases with the increase of either of permeated adhesives. Also, the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> decreases with the increase of the permeated adhesive. The decrease of the heat flux from the gas phase to the sample surface is inferred to be a main cause to decrease the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> with the increase of the amount of the permeated polyvinyl resin. For urea resin, establishment of a residual carbon layer is inferred to be a main cause of the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> reduction. Carbon-dioxide ejection during pyrolysis reaction, which is inferred through the thermogravimetric analyses, is supposed to enhance the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> reduction...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Upward <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> and <b>flame</b> {{interactions}} over multiple {{solid fuels}} are experimentally studied, {{and the effects}} of flame interactions on the <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>rates</b> are analyzed. <b>Flame</b> <b>spreading</b> characteristics and <b>spreading</b> <b>rates</b> aremeasured and compared for six different geometric arrangements of thin solids at different solid width and separation distance between solids. The <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> increases as the separation distance between the parallel solids decreases because of the flow channeling effect and radiation interactions, which reaches the maximum at an intermediate separation distance and then decreases as the separation distance becomes smaller due to the flow resistance and limited thermal expansion.

40|$|The cone {{calorimeter}} {{is widely}} used for {{the determination of the}} heat release rate (HRR) of building products and other materials. As {{part of an effort to}} increase the availability of cone calorimeter data on wood products, the U. S.

We tested the specimens in accordance with ASTM E 1354 and used a heat flux of 50 kW/m 2. The twenty-nine commercial wood composites included untreated and fire-retardant-treated (FRT) particleboards, untreated and FRT medium density fiberboards, untreated high density fiberboards, untreated plywoods, and untreated oriented strand boards. Such FRT composites are made to have a Class A <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rating</b> when tested in the ASTM E 84 tunnel test. Fire retardant treatment of the wood products reduced the initial HRR, reduced the mass loss rate, increased the residual mass fraction, resulted in lower average effective heat of combustion values, and usually resulted in longer ignition times. For the untreated specimens, the results for residual mass fraction at the end of the test ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 28 with a mean result of 0. 23. In contrast, the results for the FRT samples ranged from 0. 33 to 0. 39 with a mean result of 0. 36.

40|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>spread</b> over polyethylene-insulated {{electrical}} wires was studied experimentally with applied alternating current (AC) by varying the inclination angle (θ), applied voltage (VAC), and frequency (fAC). For the baseline case with no electric field applied, the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> and the <b>flame</b> width of downwardly <b>spreading</b> <b>flames</b> (DSFs) decreased from the horizontal case for − 20 ° ≤ θ <  0 ° and maintained near constant values for − 90 ° ≤ θ < − 20 °, while the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> increased appreciably as the inclination angle of upwardly <b>spreading</b> <b>flames</b> (USFs) increased. When an AC electric field was applied, {{the behavior of}} <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> in DSFs (USFs) could be classified into two (three) sub-regimes characterized by various functional dependences on VAC, fAC, and θ. In nearly all cases of DSFs, a globular molten polyethylene formed ahead of the <b>spreading</b> <b>flame</b> edge, occasionally dripping onto the ground. In these cases, an effective <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> was defined to represent the burning rate by measuring the mass loss due to dripping. This effective <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> was independent of AC frequency, while it decreased linearly with voltage and was independent of the inclination angle. In DSFs, when excessively high voltage and frequency were applied, the dripping led to flame extinction during propagation and the extinction frequency correlated well with applied voltage. In USFs, when high voltage and frequency were applied, multiple globular molten PEs formed at several locations, leading to ejections of multiple small flame segments from the main flame, thereby reducing the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate,</b> which {{could be attributed to}} the electrospray phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effects of sample width and {{sidewalls}} on downward <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> over extruded polystyrene (XPS) slabs, a series of laboratory-scale experiments were conducted. <b>Flame</b> shape, <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate,</b> mass loss rate and temperature were recorded. For XPS without sidewalls, the average maximum flame height (H) and average flame area per unit of width (A/w) rise linearly with an increase in sample width (w) and mass loss rate per unit of width. When sidewalls are absent, <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> first drops and then rises with an increase in width. This trend is determined by gas-phase heat transfer. When sidewalls are present, <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> increases with a rise in width, and solid-phase heat conduction determines the trend. Sidewall effects are comprised of four aspects: oxygen concentration near the sidewalls and gypsum board is low, which leads to reduced flame heat flux; upward and front air flow is intensified; the flame is stretched, and the surface flame is weakened; and molten XPS mass decreases. For narrow samples, H and A/w with sidewalls are higher than those without sidewalls, while the reverse was observed in wider samples. The mass loss rate, preheating length and average <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> with sidewalls are smaller than those obtained without sidewalls. <b>Flame</b> <b>spread</b> acceleration with sidewalls occurs at a broader width than that without sidewalls.

This is in contrast to the normal-gravity extinction limit, which was found to be independent of fuel thickness.

In this study, {{the sample is}} ignited locally at {{the middle of the}} 4 cm wide sample and subsequent <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> reaches both open edges of the sample.

An apparatus was designed to be flown on a low gravity parabolic aircraft flight to assess the flammability of cotton and 50 % cotton/ 50 % polyester fabrics and the resulting skin burn injury that would occur if these fabrics were to ignite. The apparatus, modelled after a Canadian General Standards Board standard flammability test, was also used on the ground for experiments in 1 -g. Variables examined in the tests include gravity level, fabric type, air gap size, oxygen concentration, apparatus orientation, ignition source, and method used to secure the specimen. <b>Flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rates,</b> heat fluxes, and skin burn predictions determined from test results were compared. Results from test in 1 -g indicated that the orientation of the apparatus had a large effect on <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate,</b> heat flux and predicted skin burn times. <b>Flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rates</b> and heat fluxes were highest when the fabric was held in the vertical orientation, which resulted in the lowest predicted times to produce skin burns. <b>Flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rates</b> and heat fluxes were considerably lower in microgravity than in 1 -g, which resulted in higher predicted times to produce skin burns...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{experiments}} are performed {{to determine the}} influence of noncombustible coating material on the behavior of flame propagation over solid fuels. Thick polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) sheets are used as combustible materials, and sand layer is used as the solid coating material in the experiments. The results of the experiments show that the size of the sand and the thickness of the sand layer have significant effects on the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate.</b> The influence is through the amount of heat flux absorbed by the unburned fuel surface and the mass diffusion of the vaporized fuel to react with the oxygen in the ambient air. As the sand layer thickness increases, the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> decreases. An inverse trend is observed with the increase of the sand size. In this paper, a simplified heat transfer model is proposed for the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> over the combustible material with a layer of noncombustible porous material. The experimental results {{have been found to be}} in agreement with the results from the model. Results from this study can be used in two areas. One is in understanding how <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> is retarded by application of porous material as an extinguishing agent. Another aspect is that more and more household items nowadays have a noncombustible coating on the surface as a means of decoration, more fundamental information on how the <b>flame</b> <b>spreads</b> is useful in future building fire safety designs...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in which the burning of cylindrical materials in a flowing oxidant stream was studied. Plexiglas, Nylon, and Teflon fuel specimens were oriented such that the <b>flames</b> <b>spread</b> along the surface in a direction opposed to flowing gas. Correlations of <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> were obtained that were power law relations in terms of pressure, oxygen concentration, and gas velocity...|$|R
40|$|Experiments of <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> over {{a filter}} paper {{treated with a}} {{solution}} of flame retardant, NH,H,PO, or NaHCO,, were conducted in an upward opposed air flow. The <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> and temperature profiles of gas phase/paper surface were examined. Except promoted <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> with small addition of NH 4 %P 0,, these agents retarded the <b>flame</b> <b>spread</b> <b>rate</b> and reduced the critical flow velocity for spread. NH,H PO decreased the pyrolysis zone temperature more than 100 K while NaHCO, decreased 2 d or 30 K at most. With increasing add-on rate, the flame leading edge location receded and also the flame stand-off distance increased. The leading edge practically corresponded to 1400 K isotherm tip. The slowly ascending flame temperature distribution near the leading edge, observed for NH 4 H 2 P 04 addition, suggested diluted pyrolysis gas, and another type of flame temperature distribution observed for NaHCO, addition suggested inhibition effects in flame reaction zone...|$|R
