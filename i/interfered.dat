40|$|Gene {{silencing}} using small <b>interfering</b> RNA {{has been}} proposed as a therapy for cancer, viral infections and other diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether layer-by-layer polymer surface modification could deliver small <b>interfering</b> RNA to decrease fibrotic processes associated with medical device implantation. Anti-green fluorescent protein labelled small <b>interfering</b> RNA was applied to tissue culture plates and polyurethane using a layer-by-layer technique with small <b>interfering</b> RNA and poly-L-lysine. In vitro studies showed {{that the level of}} down-regulation of green fluorescent protein was directly related to the number of coatings applied. This layer-by-layer coating technique was then used to generate Rhodamine-Flii small <b>interfering</b> RNA-coated implants for in vivo studies of small <b>interfering</b> RNA delivery via subcutaneous implantation in mice. After two days, Rh-positive cells were observed on the implants' surface indicating cellular uptake of the Rhodamine-Flii small <b>interfering</b> RNA. Decreased Flii gene expression was observed in tissue surrounding the Rhodamine-Flii small <b>interfering</b> RNA coated implants for up to seven days post implantation, returning to baseline by day 21. Genes downstream from Flii, including TGF-β 1 and TGF-β 3, showed significantly altered expression confirming a functional effect of the Rhodamine-Flii small <b>interfering</b> RNA on gene expression. This research demonstrates proof-of-principle that small <b>interfering</b> RNA can be delivered via layer-by-layer coatings on biomaterials and thereby can alter the fibrotic process.

40|$|Friend leukemia virus {{suppresses}} mitogen-responsive {{cells in}} vitro by activating thymus-dependent suppressor cells. The interaction between T suppressor and mitogen-responsive cells is H- 2 D restricted {{by a third}} cell type, called an <b>interfering</b> cell. The <b>interfering</b> cells could be characterized as alloreactive T cells that functionally mature in the spleen at 2 weeks of age {{and that can be}} functionally inhibited by mitomycin C, irradiation, and cortisol. <b>Interfering</b> cells are stimulated by H- 2 D (and not H- 2 L) alloantigens of the mitogen-responsive cells. H- 2 D differences between <b>interfering</b> and T suppressor cells are unimportant. Induction of "tolerance" to H- 2 alloantigens in semi-allogeneic radiation marrow chimeras resulted in the specific loss of <b>interfering</b> cell function.
