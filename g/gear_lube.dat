40|$|Industrial {{oil spills}} into aquatic environments can have catastrophic {{environmental}} effects. First responders to oil spills {{along the coast}} of the Gulf of Mexico in the southern United States have used spunbond nylon fabric bags and fences to separate spilled oil and oil waste from contaminated water. Low area mass density spunbond nylon is capable of sorbing more than 16 times its mass in low viscosity crude oil and more than 26 times its mass in higher viscosity <b>gear</b> <b>lube</b> oil. Nylon bags separated more than 95 % of <b>gear</b> <b>lube</b> oil contaminate from a 4. 5 % oil-in-water emulsion. Field testing of spunbond nylon fences by oil spill first responders has demonstrated the ability of this material to contain the oily contaminate while allowing water to flow through. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of nylon as an oil filter {{is due to the fact}} that it is both more oleophilic and more hydrophilic than other commonly used oil separation materials. The nylon traps oil droplets within the fabric or on the surface, while water droplets are free to flow through the fabric to the water on the opposite side of the fabric...|$|E

The high {{reliability}} traditionally required of turbocompressors has {{become even more}} imperative in recent years, due to increased unit power and the extreme environmental conditions of many applications. These machines are now often used in highly demanding compression service, such as reinjection and sea pipelines. In these applications there have been, unfortunately, some examples of malfunctioning. As a result, machines are often requested to undergo all possible testing before leaving the factory. Full-load tests are now being requested {{in addition to the}} more traditional no-load mechanical and performance tests. In the field of natural gas machinery, full-load tests were initially performed mainly for the purpose of verifying the rotor-dynamic stability of compressors at high pressure, as well as their overall performance. Subsequently, full-load testing of the complete compression system (driver, coupling and <b>gear,</b> <b>lube</b> and seal oil systems, control system, coolers, etc.) was performed. Finally, testing was carried out on the entire module...|$|E

50|$|Lucas Oil Products, Inc. is an American {{manufacturer}} and distributor of automotive oil, additives, and lubricants. It {{was founded by}} trucker Forrest Lucas and his wife Charlotte in 1989. The company is a world leader of high performance lubricants, including engine oils, greases, <b>gear</b> <b>lubes,</b> as well as problem-solving additives and car-care products. It produces and markets approximately 270 formulations in 40 countries. In the U.S., Lucas Oil is sold in more than 30,000 auto parts stores, displaying the most variety of shelf products of any oil company and at truck stops nationwide. Lucas Oil has two major plants in the United States. The original plant is located in Corona, California, which also houses Lucas Oil Corporate Headquarters, Lucas Oil Production Studios, Team Lucas, LucasOilRacingTV and the Lucas owned motorsports network, MAVTV. In 2003 it opened a new production plant in Corydon, Indiana and expanded with an additional, multimillion dollar, 350,000-square-foot facility in 2014.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{couplings}} {{for high}} speed turbocompressors or pumps {{is essential to}} transmit power from the driver. Typical couplings are either of the lubricated gear or dry diaphragm type design. Gear couplings have been the standard design {{for many years and}} recent advances in power and speed requirements have pushed the standard design criteria to the limit. Recent test stand and field data on continuous <b>lube</b> <b>gear</b> type couplings have forced a closer examination of design tolerances and concepts to avoid operational instabilities. Two types of mechanical instabilities are reviewed in this paper: (1) entrapped fluid, and (2) gear mesh instability resulting in spacer throw-out onset. Test stand results of these types of instabilities and other directly related problems are presented together with criteria for proper coupling design to avoid these conditions. An additional test case discussed shows the importance of proper material selection and processing and what can happen to an otherwise good design...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn this study, the Trilateral Flash Cycle (TFC) and the Partially Evaporating Cycle (PEC) {{have been}} {{analyzed}} and {{compared to the}} Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for power production from low temperature heat sources. This study {{is a continuation of}} the work done in my project thesis fall 2013. The ORC is a well-known technology that is in use in several plants today. The TFC and PEC on the other hand are still in a state of technical development. The biggest challenge for the TFC and PEC is the required two-phase expansion. Lately, two-phase expanders with high efficiencies have been developed, which makes the TFC and PEC economically interesting. Currently, only a few studies on the TFC and PEC can be found, {{and most of them are}} theoretical considerations. All of these studies finds the TFC promising for low temperature heat sources, which was also the findings of my project thesis. The PEC is found to be promising for smaller systems where the working fluid pump efficiency is low. The TFCs main difference from the ORC is that the heating process ends at the boiling point of the working fluid, i. e. there is no evaporation and superheating. This leads to a better temperature match between the working fluid and the heat source, such that more heat can be transferred to the working fluid. Power is produced in a two-phase expander after the heating process. The cost pr. kWh for TFC systems have been estimated to be lower than for ORC systems due to the elimination of the evaporator, separator drum, <b>gear</b> box, <b>lube</b> oil system and the fact that simpler heat exchangers can be used. In the PEC, the working fluid is allowed to be partially evaporated during the heating process. This is done in an attempt to combine the advantages of the TFC and the ORC. The ORC, TFC and PEC have been simulated in a Microsoft Excel calculation tool, using Visual Basic for Applications. The simulations include detailed heat exchanger models to calculate heat transfer coefficients and pressure losses, and two-phase expander efficiency models for the TFC and PEC. The three cycles have been simulated and optimized for maximum net power production for three cases using different heat source temperatures. Air with a mass flow of 10 kg/s and temperatures of 100, 150 and 200 &# 176;C are used for Case I, Case II and Case III respectively. Water at 20 &# 176;C is used as the heat sink. The three cases are simulated with eight different working fluids, R 123, R 134 a, R 245 fa, R 1234 ze(E), butane, pentane, isopentane and propane with maximum heat exchanger areas of 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500 and 4000 m 2. Different performance parameters are calculated and used to compare the performance of the ORC, TFC and PEC, and the different working fluids. The results show that the TFC has the lowest power production for all cases, and the largest estimated system size. Both the total heat exchanger area and expander outlet volume flow are generally higher for the TFC systems, especially for the lower heat source temperature cases. For the 100 &# 176;C and 150 &# 176;C cases the power production for the TFC and ORC is in the same range. Since TFC systems are estimated to have a lower cost than ORC systems, they can be suitable for systems with heat sources in this range when system size is not a critical factor. The PEC does not show any advantage over the ORC for the cases analyzed here. This study shows less promising results for the TFC than my project thesis and other published studies. This is mainly due to the variable two-phase expander efficiency used here, and that none of the other studies considers pressure losses in the system or calculation of heat transfer coefficients for each working fluid. A scientific paper on the main results from the study before the simulation of the PEC and inclusion of the heat exchanger models is given in Appendix C. This paper has been submitted to the journal Energy. A scientific paper on the final results of the study is given in Appendix D. This paper has been submitted to the Gustav Lorentzen Conference. </p...|$|R
