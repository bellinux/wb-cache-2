40|$|In {{line with}} the focus on {{specialty}} coffee, we will concentrate on the breeding of Coffea arabica. Contrary to what many may believe, breeding for coffee quality {{is a relatively new}} initiative. The challenges and opportunities that breeders face when selecting varieties for high quality are discussed. In the coffee production sector, when talking about varieties, most people will mention Robusta and Arabica. This confusion between species, Coffea canephora and C. Arabica respectively, and varieties is typical of a pure commodity sector where only the largest and most obvious differences are recognized. According to the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, a variety is "a plant grouping within a single botanical taxon of the lowest known rank, which grouping" can be: "i) defined by the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> resulting from a given genotype or combination of genotypes, ii) distinguished from any other plant grouping by the expression of {{at least one of the}} said characteristics and iii) considered as a unit with regard to its suitability for being propagated unchanged". One would argue that Bourbon or Tipica are Arabica coffee varieties and it is true that most coffee people would be able to roughly describe the phenotype of each. However, referring to the definition of a variety: exactly what are the characteristics expressed by Bourbon or Tipica? Are they distinguishable from other Arabica plants? Further adding to the complexity is the recognition by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) of three Arabica coffee categories: Colombian milds, other milds and Brazilian natural. Historically, the mainstream coffee market has been based largely on this classification and the reputation of quality coffee tends to be associated with geographic origin irrespective of the variety or botanical type. In this chapter, the concept of coffee variety and its relation to market demand are discussed. The current knowledge of coffee genetics and quality are also discussed, along with the gaps in knowledge that still remain. Breeding strategies are then proposed, stressing the need for new high throughput phenotyping of selection criteria linked to quality. Finally, some thoughts are offered about how producers might take advantage of new advances in genetics and selection methodologies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{problem of the}} study was to examine the characteristics of musically talented pupils at the elementary level of primary school. The study of a musical talent is not a new problem in the field of giftedness and musical talent. This field has not been sufficiently researched and explained yet not even up to today. This is because there is a discrepancy at the theoretical level. This discrepancy is reflected in a number of partial conceptual and methodological solutions. The theoretical part deals with the current findings in the area of giftedness and musical talent. A large part of the 20 th century can be characterized as an era where conceptions and tests of musical abilities were developed. In recent times a number of researches have been carried out in specific areas of this field, including the individual characteristics of the musical talent. In terms of a holistic, several areas approach to the study of musical talent, we have identified and dealt with six major areas of the characteristics of musical talent: musical abilities, musical creativity, musical performance, musical knowledge, musical activities and nonmusical characteristics. In connection with musical talent identification, this part presents a set of several musical tests and rating scales as well as a study of teacher’s nominations. The empirical part deals with some previously unexplored or insufficiently explained questions about the characteristics of musical talent. These questions cover the following topics: the latent structure of the characteristics, the level of <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characteristics,</b> the consistency of teacher assessments, mutual correlations of individual areas of assessment and the existence of possible statistically significant difference in the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> according to attending of music school, gender and age. This is the first research that has been based on the identified six major areas of musically talented characteristics. These areas were used to survey the expression of the set of characteristics within the population of musically talented pupils between 6 and 10 years of age. For the purposes of this doctoral dissertation a questionnaire was designed which included teacher nominations and an evaluation of the characteristics of musically talented pupils using a 7 -point grading scale. This system represents an innovation in the evaluation of characteristics because it allows the assessment of any deviations within the characteristics of a nominated pupil from a hypothetical average population. Based on the research findings presented in the theoretical section, we designed and included in the questionnaire a set of 32 characteristics, which is expected to be the most comprehensive evaluation of the characteristics of musical talent in the age group studied. The study involved 432 first-fifth grade primary school teachers from 90 Slovenian elementary schools. Each of the teachers nominated and evaluated one pupil whom they believed to be the most musically talented of all the pupils in their class. In this way, 432 of the most musically talented pupils were nominated and evaluated. The doctoral dissertation includes a scientific evaluation of numerous important findings on this research topic. The identified factorial structure of the characteristics is in accordance with the six areas of assessment of musical talent which we identified in the literature on this topic. All the characteristics of the musically talented pupils from our survey were expressed statistically significant as above average. The pupils who attend music schools, expressed statistically significant higher level of characteristics in all areas of the assessment of musical talent. Girls, compared to the boys, expressed statistically significant higher level of characteristics in four areas (musical abilities, musical performance, musical activities and nonmusical characteristics). The assessment areas of the characteristics of musically talented pupils (musical abilities, musical creativity, musical performance, musical knowledge, musical activities, and nonmusical characteristics) were correlated. The teacher’s overall assessment of the degree of musical talent of the pupils is in accordance with the assessment of specific areas of the assessment of musical talent and with the overall results of the assessment. Statistically significant increase in the expressed characteristics according to age was not confirmed. As a résumé of our theoretical and empirical research in the field of musical talent, we developed the Theoretic Model of Characteristics of Musical Talent and the Factor Model of Characteristics of Musical Talent and came up with a definition of musical talent. On the basis of the results of our findings, we propose numerous applicative possibilities and guidelines for practice. ...|$|E

The plant height kept symmetry of its distribution curve and the frequency accumulation in central classes (positive excess). For {{the first time a}} symbolic designation to new short-stem related Hl- 2 Hl- 2 allele and the donor name (Gnome 2) were proposed. 28 years of stabilizing selection showed that 57 % of overall genetic variability of plant height resulted from adaptive genes available for directed selection by phenotype, and 43 % from dominant and epistatic factors that predetermines the expression heterosis effect. Gnome 2 donor proved to have genetic additive correlation between the pants height and number of flows per ear, ear length, weight of seeds per plant, 100 seeds weight per plant; to have reverse correlation with ear density seeds weight per ear. The height of original parent components have displayed direct additive correlation with number of flowers per ear and reverse with the ear density. The additive correlation component directly exposes «genuine» impact of parental plants on the <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> indicated among the offspring Productive bushing of parental plants, seed weight per plant directly, and seed size (100 seeds weight) indirectly, respectively, influence the height of offspring pants. The reverse additive correlation between the parents height and 100 seeds weight in the offspring is caused by pleiotropic effect of the genes impact thus enabling to combine the desirable characteristics in one genotype. Productive bushing is by 54 % due to the impact of general genetic factors among the above, in particular, 30 % due to that additive, 24 due to non-additive factors. The concept of genetic improvements for productive bushing of the Gnome 2 rye implies utilization of additive effect through the directed selection, as well as application of breeding techniques for controlling the effect of heterosis caused by the genes of dominant and epistatic impact. The selection paradigm requires simultaneous genotypes selection with immediate examination of the selection results by offspring while in parallel to develop inbred lines, combining these afterwards evaluating general and specific combining ability by productive bushing. It is also to be noted that the productive bushing essentially depends on the environmental conditions, which significantly corrects the implementation of productivity potent, thereby the issue of agronomical conditions aimed at extending the expression of characteristic in question remains...|$|E
