Ike Clanton's account of the game (the only one that exists) gives the participants as John Behan, Virgil Earp, Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, and a fifth man Ike did not recognize, while Barra wrote that Holliday had attended the game.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>reviewing</b> {{the sweep}} of botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the {{scientific}} method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{subsequently}} {{passed the}} Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989.

Section8B(1) of the amended ISA provides {{that the law}} pertaining to the judicial review of decisions made by the President or the Minister was restored to the legal position applicable in Singapore on 13 July 1971, the date when Lee Mau Seng was decided. In Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990), the Court of Appeal held that these amendments reinstated the legal position set out in Lee Mau Seng as the applicable law governing judicial review in Singapore, thus prompting {{a return to the}} subjective test <b>in</b> <b>reviewing</b> the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA.|$|E
5|$|The {{incentive}} to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, transport, or even {{total primary energy}} supply globally, has been motivated by global warming and other ecological {{as well as economic}} concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. <b>In</b> <b>reviewing</b> 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply.|$|E

25|$|The court {{argued that}} a claim for {{wrongful}} termination in violation of public policy necessarily requires a violation of public policy; however, as concluded in section I., Nissan's actions <b>in</b> <b>reviewing</b> plaintiffs' E-mail messages did not violate their constitutional right to privacy.

In many cases the revisions were sufficiently major for the original and the revised to be treated as two separate works. A study of these differences is still awaited.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{impact of}} Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his {{exposure to the}} opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand <b>in</b> <b>reviewing</b> his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in The Old Curiosity Shop), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in Oliver Twist. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June 2010, the Palermo Court of Appeals {{reduced the}} 2004 nine-year {{sentence}} for collusion with the Mafia to seven years. <b>In</b> <b>reviewing</b> the previous sentence, {{the appeals court}} said the conviction stood only for acts committed by Dell'Utri prior to 1992, while he was acquitted for charges after that year. The prosecution had asked that the sentence be increased to 11 years. The judges took six days to consider their decision, an extraordinary long time for deliberations. The verdict effectively cleared Dell'Utri and Italian prime minister Berlusconi over allegations his entry into politics was backed by Cosa Nostra and a terrorist bombing campaign. However, Prosecuting Offices in other Italian cities are looking into these allegations.|$|E
25|$|Israel has {{a common}} law legal system.

One of the primary reasons that the Israeli constitution remains unwritten is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the Knesset (which, following the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, holds near-unlimited power).|$|E
