Today, there are 30 European Consumer Centres: 28 in the EU Member States, one in Norway, one in Iceland.The ECC-Net originated from two former existing consumer information and protection networks: The Network for the extra-judicial settlement of consumer disputes (EEJ-Net) and the <b>Euroguichet</b> Network.|$|E
50|$|The EEJ-Net was {{established}} in 2001 to help consumers to solve cross-border disputes with traders providing defective goods and services, by guiding them to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (ADR).The <b>Euroguichets</b> were founded in 1992 at the European Commission's initiative with the objective to inform consumers about the opportunities of the European Single Market and about their rights as consumers in Europe. Moreover, the <b>Euroguichets</b> helped consumers encountering problems with cross-border transactions. The <b>Euroguichets</b> also acted as interfaces between consumers and the European Commission. The European Consumer Centres Network took over the duties of both organisations: It helps consumers to solve cross-border disputes and informs them about their rights in Europe.|$|R
