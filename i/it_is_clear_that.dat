5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Seth's mental states (desires, beliefs, etc.) have causal effects {{on his body}} and vice versa: A child touches a hot stove (physical event) which causes pain (mental event) and makes her yell (physical event), this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the {{caregiver}} (mental event), and so on.|$|E
5|$|Did Harrison {{deliberately}} use {{the music}} of He's So Fine? I do not believe he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> My Sweet Lord is the very same song as He's So Fine with different words, and Harrison had access to He's So Fine. This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the {{evidence}} showed that there were instances of confusion, albeit few, and that consumers seeing identical signs to Arsenal's registered marks, complained to Arsenal. If {{there was no such}} likelihood of confusion there would be no need for Mr Reed to inform his customers expressly that the goods <b>were</b> not official. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the trademarks did designate origin.|$|R
5|$|In Safavid times, {{the lion}} and sun stood for two {{pillars of the}} society, state and religion. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that,</b> {{although}} various alams and banners were employed by the Safavids during their rule, especially the earlier Safavid kings. By the time of Shah Abbas, the lion and sun symbol {{had become one of}} the most popular emblems of Persia.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the demoralised {{and tired}} Greeks were {{no match for}} the Persians, and were {{completely}} routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus. Many were killed, including the Eretrian general, Eualcides. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships and sailed back to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} do {{not believe}} that the compliance pyramid applies when legitimate differences of views exist as to compliant behaviour. Regulators all need to establish their positions in this situation, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> some regulators do still apply the compliance pyramid when the law is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|The {{evidence}} of toponymy and language is unequivocal. Placenames in Orkney with a Celtic derivation are {{few in number}} and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Norn, a local version of Old Norse, was widely spoken by the inhabitants into historic times. Norn was also spoken in Shetland and evidence for Pictish elements in placenames is virtually non-existent, the three island names of Fetlar, Unst and Yell excepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{report cards}} for these {{operations}} are highly controversial. Some sources claim the commandos suffered immense casualties and were ineffectual. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> these operations inflicted damage and caused confusion and anxiety among the Israelis, who diverted resources to counter these threats, while reservists were slowed down. One Israeli divisional commander also commended the Egyptian Sa'iqa.|$|E
5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E

5|$|Adonis {{originally}} was a Phoenician god of fertility representing {{the spirit of}} vegetation. It is further speculated {{that he was an}} avatar of the version of Ba'al, worshipped in Ugarit. It is likely that lack of clarity concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna, and who her father was, originated in Cyprus before the Greeks first encountered the myth. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Greeks added much to the Adonis-Myrrha story, before it was first recorded by classical scholars.|$|E
5|$|As a child William {{was educated}} in Jerusalem, at the cathedral {{school in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The scholaster, or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first {{introduced}} him to Latin. From the Historia <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he also knew French and possibly Italian, {{but there is not}} enough evidence to determine whether he learned Greek, Persian, and Arabic, as is sometimes claimed.|$|E
5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E

5|$|Commander T'Pol and Commander Tucker remain captives of Paxton, who {{continues}} to broadcast his demand on all channels and frequencies. Paxton's action has an unsettling effect on the interspecies conference since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> not all humans support it. On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner {{to learn that the}} child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian gene therapy to treat himself). Seeking to fine-tune their attack, Paxton then threatens T'Pol to force Tucker to optimize the targeting system of the array.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> an economy {{operating}} at {{a position where}} the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish {{is different from the}} rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E
5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at Salamis. The Allied navy was thus able to prepare {{properly}} for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, why or how this decision was made, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> John has an ulterior motive; first, he paralyses Gwen {{and locks}} {{her in a}} crate telling {{her that if she}} is not found in two hours, her main organs will stop working and she would die. He then finds Owen and Tosh, {{shooting}} the former in the hip. After letting Ianto go, he finally confronts Jack, who realises that the bombs are an elementary 51st century confidence trick. Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rubeus Hagrid {{has not yet}} {{returned}} from the secret mission {{given to him by}} Dumbledore {{at the end of the}} previous book, and is absent for the first part of the school year. Upon his return, Harry, Ron, and Hermione learn that his mission, which was mostly unsuccessful, was to seek out the last giants to stop them from joining Lord Voldemort. Professor Umbridge has been steadily amassing more and more power and influence at the school, and as she begins regularly inspecting Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures lessons, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> she intends to get rid of him.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} tend {{to reject}} the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic and as resultant from miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors. Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000–300,000. These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.|$|E
50|$|Torstein Dahle, an {{economist}} at Bergen University College, was elected leader in 2003 and re-elected in March 2005. Following the 2005 election <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> their work to regain {{their place in the}} parliament had failed. They received 1.2% of the national total of votes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> in order to be represented in parliament, they had to win a large share of votes in Hordaland or Oslo. However their best result was 3.4% in Hordaland.|$|R
