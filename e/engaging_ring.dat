5000|$|On {{making a}} {{telephone}} call to a number that is <b>engaged,</b> automatic <b>ring</b> back is a service provided by the telephone company whereby, when the called number becomes available, the caller is rung back, usually with a distinctive [...] "ring back" [...] ring. When the phone is picked up, it calls the previously engaged number. The service is typically invoked by keying a number on hearing the engaged tone.|$|R
50|$|Some {{gas turbine}} engines and diesel engines, {{particularly}} on trucks, use a pneumatic self-starter. In ground vehicles the system {{consists of a}} geared turbine, an air compressor and a pressure tank. Compressed air released from the tank is used to spin the turbine, and {{through a set of}} reduction gears, <b>engages</b> the <b>ring</b> gear on the flywheel, much like an electric starter. The engine, once running, drives the compressor to recharge the tank.|$|R
5000|$|The Champion Bridge Company was a {{well-known}} builder of truss bridges. [...] The bridge is a truss bridge with an approximately 100-foot span [...] To open the bridge for marine vessels, {{an electric motor}} drives a pinion gear which <b>engages</b> a <b>ring</b> gear {{in the base of}} the bridge. If the electric motor is not working, the bridge can also be opened manually using a large wrench (approx. 8' DEEP socket with an 8' long handle).|$|R

[8] The First Part {{was written}} in Bedford jail; this is 'about a mile off the place,' at the village of Elstow, where Mr. Bunyan resided, and where his house is still standing--a very humble cottage, and an object of curiosity, as is also the very ancient church and tower. The tower answers to the {{description}} of the 'steeple-house' in which Mr. Bunyan was <b>engaged</b> in <b>ringing</b> the bells. 'The main beam that lay overthwart the steeple from side to side,' and under which he stood lest 'one of the bells should fall and kill him,' presents exactly that appearance---(Ivimey).|$|R

5000|$|Augustus's {{televised}} bouts have garnered him a cult {{following in}} part due to his unique style and flair in the ring and his willingness to take on all comers, sometimes taking fights on short notice as a last minute replacement, even in his opponents' hometowns.

5000|$|Each {{level of}} system or [...] "ring" [...] was {{considered}} one of the enemy's centers of gravity. The idea behind Warden's five rings was to attack each of the rings to paralyze their forces, an objective also known as physical paralysis. To optimize a strike attack the attacker would <b>engage</b> as many <b>rings</b> as possible with special emphasis on taking out the center ring, which is the enemy's leadership. This would result in total physical paralysis.|$|R

50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{are composed}} of a breech, into which the cartridge is inserted, which {{is connected to the}} motor by a short steel pipe, which acts like a gun barrel. The blank cartridge fits into the breech, and is triggered either electrically or mechanically. When the aircraft's ignition is turned on and the cartridge is fired, high-velocity, high-pressure gas (~ at ~600 ft/s) shoots down the pipe, forcing the motor to spin and <b>engage</b> the starter <b>ring</b> gear on the engine, which is attached to the crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} starter drive pinion on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia {{of the drive}} pinion {{assembly}} causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of the}} spring to change and <b>engage</b> with the <b>ring</b> gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} and frames {{were cast}} {{in one piece}} while the steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. The tender frame was also a one-piece steel casting. The Alligator type crossheads were split on the vertical centre line and clamped on {{to the end of}} the piston rods, which had three coned <b>rings</b> <b>engaging</b> in grooves in the crossheads. The original coupling rods differed from the usual in the provision of three independent rods, thereby doing away with four knuckle joints and pins.|$|R

However, such model should be verified against other models as well as validated against experiments to ensure reasonable accuracy. In this contribution, results from the previous developed mathematical model of a generic synchronizer (gearshifting mechanism) against the model developed at Scania is presented. The mathematical model is based on constrained Lagrangian formalism (CLF) and the generic synchronizer is consist of <b>engaging</b> sleeve, synchronizer <b>ring</b> and the gearwheel with dimensions relevant to that of a heavy truck...|$|R
40|$|Wrench {{converts}} gripping {{action of}} hand to rotary motion without imparting reactive moments or forces on part being turned or on operator. Wrench should {{be useful in}} undersea operations and other delicate work where reactive forces and torques have to be controlled. In design for valve tightening, tool resembles cross between conventional spanner wrench and pilers. One handle engages valve body; second handle has ratchet pawl that <b>engages</b> toothed coupling <b>ring</b> on perimeter of valve handle. When operator squeezes wrench handles, valve handle rotates with respect to valve body...|$|R
5000|$|Some designs use [...] "stepped-planet" [...] {{which have}} two differently-sized gears on {{either end of}} a common casting. The large end engages the sun, while the small end <b>engages</b> the <b>ring</b> gear. This may be {{necessary}} to achieve smaller step changes in gear ratio when the overall package size is limited. Compound planets have [...] "timing marks" [...] (or [...] "relative gear mesh phase" [...] in technical term). The assembly conditions of compound planetary gears are more restrictive than simple planetary gears, and they must be assembled in the correct initial orientation relative to each other, or their teeth will not simultaneously engage the sun and ring gear at opposite ends of the planet, leading to very rough running and short life. Compound planetary gears can easily achieve larger transmission ratio with equal or smaller volume. For example, compound planets with teeth in a 2:1 ratio with a 50T ring gear would give the same effect as a 100T ring gear, but with half the actual diameter.|$|R
50|$|Directly {{above the}} volume {{controls}} is a ring/silent switch that when <b>engaged</b> mutes telephone <b>ringing,</b> alert sounds from new & sent emails, text messages, and other push notifications, camera shutter sounds, Voice Memo sound effects, phone lock/unlock sounds, keyboard clicks, and spoken auto-corrections. This switch does not mute alarm {{sounds from the}} Clock application, and in some countries or regions it will not mute the camera shutter or Voice Memo sound effects. All buttons except Home were made of plastic on the original first generation iPhone and metal on all later models. The touchscreen furnishes {{the remainder of the}} user interface.|$|R
50|$|All SA gear hubs use {{epicyclic}} (planetary) geartrains {{of varying}} complexity. The AW is the simplest, using {{one set of}} planetary gears with four planets. The AM uses three compound planets with differently sized cogs on a common shaft to <b>engage</b> the gear <b>ring</b> and sun gear separately, while the close-ratio three-speeds, and hubs with four or more speeds, use multiple planetary geartrains. Depending on the specific hub these may be in series with each other, or with {{one or the other}} set being selectable at any given time by locking a particular sun gear to the axle.|$|R

The brothers have not seen each other in years, but now von Detner wants to use Becker's shop to transmit and receive secret messages. Becker refuses, until von Detner threatens to have him deported back to Germany as an illegal immigrant and reveals that Becker's assistant, Miss Harper (Dorothy Tree), is actually a German agent.|$|R
5000|$|She {{soon became}} pen pals with poets in Turkey. With Ümit Yaşar Oğuzcan, {{one of these}} pen pals, she {{developed}} a romantic affair that each expressed through their poems. They then got <b>engaged</b> through a <b>ring</b> that Oğuzcan sent hidden in a book that he sent her. Marmara's father was outraged at the prospect but had to yield when his daughter stopped eating, sending her brother to Istanbul to see Oğuzcan. However, her brother came with a stark refusal of the prospects, saying that Oğuzcan was [...] "stout and a stutterer". This psychologically devastated Marmara and influenced her poetry.|$|R
2500|$|The {{central drive}} shaft, called the [...] "eccentric shaft" [...] or [...] "E-shaft", {{passes through the}} center of the rotor and is {{supported}} by fixed bearings. The rotors ride on eccentrics (analogous to crankpins) integral to the eccentric shaft (analogous to a crankshaft). The rotors both rotate around the eccentrics and make orbital revolutions around the eccentric shaft. Seals at the corners of the rotor seal against the periphery of the housing, dividing it into three moving combustion chambers. The rotation of each rotor on its own axis is caused and controlled by a pair of synchronizing gears A fixed gear mounted on one side of the rotor housing <b>engages</b> a <b>ring</b> gear attached to the rotor and ensures the rotor moves exactly 1/3 turn for each turn of the eccentric shaft. The power output of the engine is not transmitted through the synchronizing gears. The force of gas pressure on the rotor (to a first approximation) goes directly to the center of the eccentric part of the output shaft...|$|R
50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{had several}} advantages over other starting systems in {{use at the}} time. Electric starters required large, heavy, and often troublesome batteries to be carried on board, or external charging equipment had to be located at every place where the vehicle was anticipated to operate. Inertia starters used a heavy wheel, usually made of brass, which was spun by a hand crank or electric motor, causing the spinning wheel to <b>engage</b> the starter <b>ring</b> gear. The Coffman system was more lightweight and compact than inertial starters or internal batteries, {{and it did not}} require any special auxiliary equipment, an important feature when operating in remote areas.|$|R
50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus <b>engage</b> with the <b>ring</b> gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with the ring gear.|$|R
5000|$|A keyring or [...] "split ring" [...] is a {{ring that}} holds keys {{and other small}} items, which are {{sometimes}} connected to keychains. Other types of keyrings are made of leather, wood and rubber. Keyring was invented in the 19th century by Alexander Parkes.The {{most common form of}} the keyring is a single piece of metal in a 'double loop'. Either end of the loop can be pried open to allow a key to be inserted and slid along the spiral until it becomes wholly <b>engaged</b> onto the <b>ring.</b> Novelty carabiners are also commonly used as keyrings for ease of access and exchange. Often the keyring is adorned with a key fob for self-identification.|$|R
50|$|Among notable {{members of}} the Tolomei family {{included}} Pia Tolomei. In 1295, however, she was defenestrated by her Guelf husband from Maremma, who wished to remarry. Her story was popular in the 19th century and the Risorgimento {{as a symbol of}} faithfulness to principles in the face of treachery and self-interest. Gaetano Donizetti made her the subject of his tragic opera, Pia de Tolomei. She was initially immortalized by Dante, who encounters her in Purgatory::Ricorditi di me, che son la Pia: :Siena mi fe, disfecemi Maremma: :Salsi colui che innanellata pria, :Disposato mavea con la sua gemma.:Remember me, who is the Pia; :Siena was my faith, but defaced by Maremma::He who had <b>engaged</b> with his <b>ring</b> me first,:Disposed of me from his jewel.|$|R
50|$|Bell housing or {{bellhousing}} is a colloquial/slang {{term for}} {{the portion of the}} transmission that covers the flywheel and the clutch or torque converter of the transmission on vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. This housing is bolted to the engine block and derives its name from the bell-like shape that its internal components necessitate. The starter motor is usually mounted here, and <b>engages</b> with a <b>ring</b> gear on the flywheel. On the opposite end to the engine is usually bolted to the gearbox. The use of different bellhousings on a transmission allows the same transmission to be used on multiple engines in multiple applications. However, on some transmissions, the bellhousing is a nonremovable part of the transmission case. This is particularly true with front wheel drive transmissions, which are much shorter than conventional rear wheel drive transmissions.|$|R
50|$|The {{team will}} start by running 10 m {{from one end}} of the raceway to the other with a cap on the first member's head. The first member will then solve a Tangram puzzle {{presented}} at the station. After completing the puzzle, he/she will raise a flag signaling completion, if successful, the first member will pass the cap to the second member and the team will run down the 10 m path back to reach the second station. The second member will then <b>engage</b> in a <b>ring</b> toss. After one successful toss, the cap will be passed to the third member and they will run back to the first station to complete a second Tangram puzzle. After completion, the cap will be passed to the fourth and final member, in which they will run back to the second station. After the final member makes a successful throw, the team completes the relay. The fastest team to successfully complete the relay will win the round.|$|R
40|$|Protonated 3 -nitrotyrosine ([nitroTyr + H](+)) {{has been}} {{investigated}} by collision induced dissociation at variable energy and by IR multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations. Ultimately, this investigation is aimed at providing a diagnostic signature of protein tyrosine nitration, a post translational modification implied in pathological states. IRMPD spectroscopy of [nitroTyr + H](+) ions has been examined in two different spectral regions, namely in the 1000 - 2000 cm(- 1) range, using the free electron laser beamline at the CLIO facility, and in the 3200 - 3700 cm(- 1) range, using a tabletop laser source. [nitroTyr + H](+) ions have been assayed in parallel with intact [Tyr + H](+) ions revealing characteristic bands at 1329 and 1540 cm(- 1). Mode assignments allowed by density functional theory calculations of the IR spectra of the most stable conformers indicate that these features are associated to vibrations of the nitro group and are endowed with enhanced activity. In the NH/OH stretching region, the remarkable difference between the IRMPD spectra is the strong absorption at 3641 cm(- 1) of the ring OH stretching of [Tyr + H](+) which is absent in the nitrated ion due to a strong hydrogen bond <b>engaging</b> the <b>ring</b> OH and the ortho nitro group. These results suggest that IRMPD spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry may afford a selective method for the analysis and characterization of 3 -nitrotyrosine, to be possibly extended to 3 -nitrotyrosine-containing peptides.

500|$|Each {{end of each}} caisson is {{supported}} on small wheels, which run on rails on the inside face of the [...] diameter holes {{at the ends of}} the arms. The rotation is controlled by a train of gears: an alternating pattern of three [...] diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth, as shown in the picture. The large central gear is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed in place prevent it from rotating. The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end. When the motors rotate the central axle, the arms swing and the small gears engage the central gear, which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction. The smaller gears <b>engage</b> the large <b>ring</b> gears {{at the end of the}} caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction. This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.|$|R
