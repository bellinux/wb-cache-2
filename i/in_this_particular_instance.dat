500|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{became the}} first {{full-length}} feature film colourised for a theatrical re-release; although some Hollywood films had been colourised earlier, they were only available for home media. It was subsequently selected for seven international film festivals. Upon release, the film drew crowds to the cinemas, with an overall occupancy of 90 per cent. Subsequently, it completed a 25-week run. While some critics complained that the colours were [...] "psychedelic" [...] or [...] "unnatural", others hailed the effort as a technological achievement. Film critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times remarked that while colourising {{was not a good}} idea for most black-and-white classics, it was perfect <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>instance.</b> He compared it to films by Cecil B. DeMille and to Gone With the Wind (1939) for its larger-than-life storytelling. The Guardian said that although the new version was an improvement, [...] "the fake colours tend to look flat and brash, detracting from cinematographer RD Mathur's elegantly composed shots." [...] The BBC's Jaspreet Pandohar, observing that the film was [...] "restored in appealing candy-colours and high quality sound", considered it a [...] "cross between Gone With the Wind and Ben-Hur". Other critics have said that they prefer the black and white version.|$|E
500|$|The deaths at Truckee Lake, Alder Creek, {{and in the}} snowshoe {{party were}} {{probably}} caused {{by a combination of}} extended malnutrition, overwork, and exposure to cold. Several members became more susceptible to infection due to starvation, such as George Donner, but the three most significant factors in survival were age, sex, and the size of family group that each member traveled with. The survivors were on average 7.5years younger than those who died; children aged between 6 and 14 had a much higher survival rate than infants and {{children under the age of}} 6, of whom 62.5 percent died, including the son born to the Kesebergs on the trail, or adults over the age of 35. No adults over the age of 49 survived. Deaths were [...] "extremely high" [...] among males aged between 20 and 39, at more than 66 percent. Men have been found to metabolize protein faster, and women do not require as high a caloric intake. Women also store more body fat, which delays the effects of physical degradation caused by starvation and overwork. Men also tend to take on more dangerous tasks and, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>instance,</b> the men were required to clear brush and engage in heavy labor before reaching Truckee Lake, adding to their physical debilitation. Those traveling with family members had a higher survival rate than bachelor males, possibly because family members more readily shared food with each other.|$|E

The first problem is searching for α-helices <b>in</b> protein sequences. <b>This</b> <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> of the search is based on matching of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. We find an algorithm which is linear in the sequence length for fixed helix length and is O(nlogn) for any helix length. The second problem is on matching probabilistic sequences against sequences or against other probabilistic sequences. In both cases we derive efficient formulas to compute scores according to a Markovian model of evolution...|$|R
2500|$|Wallace {{also argued}} that Darwin too much favoured the bright colours of the male peacock as {{adaptive}} without realising that the [...] "drab" [...] peahen's coloration is itself adaptive, as camouflage. Wallace more speculatively argued that the bright colours and long tails of the peacock were not adaptive in any way, and that bright coloration could result from non-adaptive physiological development (for example, the internal organs of animals, not being subject to a visual form of natural selection, come {{in a wide variety}} of bright colours). This has been questioned by later scholars as quite a stretch for Wallace, who <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>instance</b> abandoned his normally strict [...] "adaptationist" [...] agenda in asserting that the highly intricate and developed forms such as a peacock's tail resulted by sheer [...] "physiological processes" [...] that were somehow not at all subjected to adaptation.|$|E
2500|$|The heraldic scholar A. C. Fox-Davies {{proposed}} that, in some circumstances, white {{should be}} considered a heraldic colour, distinct from argent. [...] In a number of instances, a label or collar blazoned as [...] "white" [...] rather than [...] "argent" [...] appears on a supporter blazoned argent or or. [...] The use of [...] "white" [...] in place of [...] "argent" [...] would be consistent with the practice of heraldic blazon that discourages repeating the name of a tincture in describing a coat of arms, but if it were merely intended as a synonym of [...] "argent", this placement would clearly violate the rule against placing metal on metal or colour on colour (see below). [...] This difficulty is avoided if [...] "white" [...] is considered a colour <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>instance,</b> rather than a synonym of [...] "argent". [...] This interpretation has neither been accepted nor refuted by any heraldic authority, but a counter-argument is that the labels are not intended to represent a heraldic tincture, but are in fact white labels proper.|$|E
2500|$|On May 14, 2016, {{the band}} {{were forced to}} cancel their {{headlining}} slot at the annual KROQ Weenie Roast, as Kiedis {{was rushed to the}} hospital prior to the band appearing on stage. It was confirmed that Kiedis was suffering from intestinal flu and was expected to make a full recovery soon however the band was forced to postpone their iHeartRadio album preview show on May 17, 2016 (rescheduling it for May 26). Kiedis and the Chili Peppers returned to the stage on May 22, 2016 in Columbus, OH. According to the band's drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis was suffering from a stomach flu a few weeks earlier and it had returned on the night they were set to perform. In a May 20, 2016 interview with Entertainment Tonight Canada, his first since being released from the hospital, Kiedis said that his illness was brought on by an [...] "inflammation in my guts" [...] which he said was complicated by a recent stomach virus and existing scar tissue from previous hernia operations which required his stomach being pumped at the hospital due to his food not being able to properly digest. [...] "That becomes an incredibly painful situation where you get a fever and pass out... Lo an behold, I'm on the mend" [...] He went on to say [...] "so it turned out to be a good thing, albeit painful and very sad to have to cancel a show. We don't really do that.

Many fearsome critters were simply {{the products of}} pure exaggeration; while a number, however, were used either seriously or jokingly as explanations for unexplained phenomena. For example, the hidebehind served to account for loggers who failed to return to camp, while the treesqueak offered justification for strange noises heard in the woods.

40|$|Aragon and Seidel [1] {{presented}} {{a solution of}} the dictionary problem which became very popular in the last years. Their algorithm is easy to implement and fast in practice.

The second one is that changing the weight of a key is only possible when deleting the key or increasing its weight by an amount of 1 (through insertion or access). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> paper we will show that these drawbacks can be avoided by a simple modification of the algorithm.

30|$|Other {{solutions}} {{such as the}} {{one from}} [87] use reliability-related methods such as checkpointing to decrease application failures, but <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> case, for <b>instance,</b> the performance implications of having these mechanisms is not fully appreciated. The I/O cost in terms of storage and time to implement checkpointing are far from negligible. Still on reliability, [124] state that the main two strategies to calculate reliability factors is to either establish a reputation threshold or to treat nodes independently and multiply their probability of success. Still, the reliability approach proposed by the authors does not address measurable metrics to calculate these factors. Moreover, on one side there are the solutions only address failures after their occurrence, not before. For instance, [86] uses checkpointing to recover from failures but there is no mechanism in place to calculate the probability of failures and attempt to avoid nodes with higher probability of failure, or at least designate a smaller portion of tasks to this node. On the other side, solutions calculate reliability factors based on theoretical metrics that might not reflect the specificities of each node and there are no clear mechanism to combine prevention and recovery. In that sense, [49] provides a deeper analysis of fault-tolerance techniques for grid computing that could be applied to cloud computing. The authors clearly state that the requirements for implementing failure recovery mechanisms on grids comprise support for diverse failure handling strategies, separation of failure handling policies from application codes, and user-defined exception handling. In terms of task-level failure handling techniques the authors consider retrying (straightforward and potentially least efficient of the enlisted techniques), replication (replicas running on different resources), and checkpointing. Checkpointing is actively used in real scientific scenarios while replication usually leads to prohibitive costs, as in several cases running one replica is expensive enough in terms of resource demand. In addition, in terms of workflow-level failure handling, the authors propose mechanisms such as alternative task (try a different implementation when available), workflow-level redundancy, and user-defined exceptions that are able to fallback to reliable failure handling. In terms of evaluation the authors propose parameters such as failure-free execution time, failure rates, downtime, recovery time, checkpointing overhead, among others. These are measurable metrics {{that can be used to}} model and represent the failure behavior of systems and workflows.|$|R
