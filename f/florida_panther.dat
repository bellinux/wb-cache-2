5|$|The <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} mammals on earth. About 50 live in the wild, primarily in the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp. The biggest threats to the panther include habitat destruction from human development, vehicle collisions, inbreeding due to their limited gene pool, parasites, diseases, and mercury poisoning.|$|E
5|$|These smaller animals support {{communities}} of larger animals, including 70species of land birds that breed within the Everglades, and 120water birds, of which 43 breed in the area. Many of these birds {{go on to}} migrate through the West Indies and North America. Several dozen species of mammals also thrive in the region, from tiny bats and shrews to midsize raccoons (Procyon lotor), otters (Lontra canadensis), opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and foxes. The largest include white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), the Florida black bear, and the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther.</b>|$|E
5|$|Recent extinctions can be {{directly}} attributable to human influences. The IUCN characterizes 'recent' extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500, and around 80 mammal species have gone extinct since that time and 2015. Some species, such as the Père David's deer are extinct in the wild, and survive solely in captive populations. Other species, such as the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther,</b> are ecologically extinct, surviving in such low numbers that they essentially have {{no impact on the}} ecosystem. Other populations are only locally extinct (extirpated), still existing elsewhere, but reduced in distribution, as with the extinction of gray whales in the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|The {{plant growth}} around the hammock base is nearly impenetrable; beneath the canopy hammocks {{is an ideal}} habitat for animals. Reptiles (such as various species of snake and anole) and {{amphibians}} (such as the American green tree frog, Hyla cinerea), live in the hardwood hammocks. Birds such as barred owls (Strix varia), woodpeckers, northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and southern bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nest in hammock trees. Mammal species living in hardwood hammocks include opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), Everglades minks (Neovison vison), marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the rare, critically endangered <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> (Puma concolor coryi).|$|E
5|$|Wildlife in pine rockland {{communities}} is diverse. In some forests, 15species of birds can be found. Common {{among them are}} the pine warbler (Dendroica pinus), the red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), and the eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna). More than 20species of reptiles and amphibians have been noted, such as the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), and southern black racer (Coluber constrictor priapus). Mammals such as the critically endangered <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> (Puma concolor coryi), American black bearFlorida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus), and several types of bats also live in the pine rocklands.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time mercury was found in local fish at such high levels that {{consumption}} warnings were posted for fishermen. A <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> was found dead with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Scientists found that power plants and incinerators using fossil fuels were expelling mercury into the atmosphere, and it fell as rain or dust during droughts. The naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in the Everglades ecosystem were transforming the mercury into methylmercury, and it was bioaccumulating through the food chain. Stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming from power plants and incinerators, which in turn lowered mercury levels found in animals, though {{they continue to be}} a concern.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> {{is close}} to extinction. A record 23 were killed in 2009 predominately by {{automobile}} collisions, leaving about 100 individuals in the wild. The Center for Biological Diversity and others have therefore called for a special protected area for the panther to be established. Manatees are also dying at a rate higher than their reproduction.|$|E
25|$|About {{two-thirds of}} Florida {{occupies}} a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Florida has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, approximately , {{not including the}} contribution of the many barrier islands. It is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at or near sea level and is characterized by sedimentary soil. Florida has the lowest high point of any U.S. state. The climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. The American alligator, American crocodile, <b>Florida</b> <b>panther,</b> and manatee can be found in Everglades National Park {{in the southern part of}} the state. Florida is one of only two states that has a tropical climate, the other one is Hawaii and is the only continental U.S. State with a tropical climate.|$|E

500|$|Most {{national}} parks preserve unique geographic features; Everglades National Park {{was the first}} created to protect a fragile ecosystem. The Everglades are a network of wetlands and forests fed by a river flowing [...] per day out of Lake Okeechobee, southwest into Florida Bay. The Park {{is the most significant}} breeding ground for tropical wading birds in North America and contains the largest mangrove ecosystem in the western hemisphere. It is home to 36threatened or protected species including the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther,</b> the American crocodile, and the West Indian manatee, and supports 350species of birds, 300species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40species of mammals, and 50species of reptiles. The majority of South Florida's fresh water, which is stored in the Biscayne Aquifer, is recharged in the park.|$|E
500|$|The {{west coast}} of Florida relies on {{desalinization}} for its fresh water; the quantity demanded is too great for the land to provide. Nitrates in the underground water system {{and high levels of}} mercury also impact the quality of fresh water the park receives. In 1998 a <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> was found dead in Shark Water Slough, with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Increased occurrences of algal blooms and red tide in Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay have been traced to the amounts of controlled water released from Lake Okeechobee. The brochure given to all visitors at Everglades National Park includes a statement that reads, [...] "Freshwater flowing into the park is engineered. With the help of pumps, floodgates, and retention ponds along the park's boundary, the Everglades is presently on life support, alive but diminished." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{critically}} endangered of {{any animal}} in the Everglades region is the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> (Puma concolor coryi), a species that once lived throughout the southeastern United States: there were only 25–30 in the wild in 1995. The panther is most threatened by urban encroachment, because males require approximately [...] for breeding territory. A male and two to five females may live within that range. When habitat is lost, panthers will fight over territory. After vehicle collisions, the second most frequent {{cause of death for}} panthers is intra-species aggression. In the 1990s urban expansion crowded panthers from southwestern Florida as Naples and Ft. Myers began to expand into the western Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp. Agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service were responsible for maintaining the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, yet still approved 99% of all permits to build in wetlands and panther territory. A limited genetic pool is also a danger. Biologists introduced eight female Texas cougars (Puma concolor) in 1995 to diversify genes, and there are between 80 and 120panthers in the wild [...]|$|E

500|$|A {{different}} {{concern about}} water quality arose when mercury {{was discovered in}} fish during the 1980s. Because mercury is damaging to humans, warnings were posted for fishermen that cautioned against eating fish caught in South Florida, and scientists became alarmed when a <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> was found dead near Shark River Slough with mercury levels high enough to be fatal to humans. When mercury is ingested it adversely affects the central nervous system, and can cause brain damage and birth defects. [...] Studies of mercury levels found that it is bioaccumulated through the food chain: animals that are lower on the chain have decreased amounts, but as larger animals eat them, the amount of mercury is multiplied. The dead panther's diet consisted of small animals, including raccoons and young alligators. The source of the mercury {{was found to be}} waste incinerators and fossil fuel power plants that expelled the element in the atmosphere, which precipitated with rain, or in the dry season, dust. Naturally occurring bacteria in the Everglades that function to reduce sulfur also transform mercury deposits into methylmercury. This process was more dramatic in areas where flooding was not as prevalent. Because of requirements that reduced power plant and incinerator emissions, the levels of mercury found in larger animals decreased as well: approximately a 60% decrease in fish and a 70% decrease in birds, though some levels still remain a health concern for people.|$|E

[...] Proceeds benefit the Astronauts Memorial Foundation, and funded the construction and maintenance of the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida. [...] The current version of the plate, and the second revision since its inception, introduced in 2004, commemorates both Challenger and Columbia. It remained the most popular of all of Florida's specialty plates until it was overtaken by a plate to support the critically endangered <b>Florida</b> <b>panther.</b> In 2006, it was outsold by a plate for the University of Florida. Florida currently offers 122 specialty plates, more than any other state, while other states offer only a few.|$|E
2500|$|What is now Everglades National Park {{was created}} in 1947, and is {{recently}} as 1998, {{has been referred to}} as [...] "the most endangered national park in America." [...] Some of the environmental issues facing the Everglades are, disrupted water flow, a drastic decline in the wading bird population, invasion of exotic species and the survival challenges facing the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther,</b> of which there are only 160 left in the wild, an increase from 20 wild Florida panthers in the 1970s. Additionally, species such as the wood stork, the Cape Sable seaside sparrow and the manatee have an uncertain future in the Everglades as a result of environmental issues. [...] Former Secretary of Friends of the Everglades, Sharyn Richardson said that she got started with the organization, attracted by its philosophical ideals, stating, [...] "when you see an injustice and you become aware of that injustice, you have to take responsibility for it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Of all the puma subspecies, the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> has {{the lowest}} genetic {{diversity}} due {{to a variety of}} environmental and genetic factors.  Factors that include {{but are not limited to}} habitat destruction contributed to the formation of a distinct and isolated subspecies of puma in the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther.</b> Isolation was followed by a gradual decline in the population size that increased the likelihood of inbreeding depression. [...] The lower genetic diversity and higher rates of inbreeding, led to the increased expression of deleterious traits in the populations, resulting in lower overall fitness of the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> population. This will also lower the adaptive capacity of the population and increased the likelihood of genetic defects like Cryptorchidism and other complications to the heart and immune system. Specifically concerning the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther,</b> one of the morphological consequences of inbreeding was a high frequency of cowlicks and kinked tails. The frequency of exhibiting a cowlick in a <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> population was 94% compared to other pumas at 9% while the frequency of a kinked tail was 88% as opposed to 27% for other puma subspecies. A solution that was implemented to increase genetic diversity of the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> was the introduction of eight Texas pumas to the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> population in efforts to restore genetic diversity and promote the survival of the native population. The results indicated that the survival rates of hybrid kittens were three times higher than those of purebred pumas.  Due to the successes of this restoration effort, the genetic depletion of the <b>Florida</b> <b>panther</b> population is now not as big of a problem as it used to be but is something that ought to be monitored moving forward since the population is still in a fragile state.|$|E
