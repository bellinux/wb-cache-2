25|$|Lawrence {{was also}} a {{headquarters}} for a band of Redlegs that had initiated a particularly vicious jayhawking campaign in late March 1863. The purported objective of this group was to eliminate civilian support for the Confederate guerillas, but their tactics (executions, arson, and plundering) were employed rather indiscriminately. As one observer noted (apparently {{a member of the}} Fifth Kansas Cavalry), “I believe the Red Legs will kill any man <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> a good horse; and they have glorified themselves considerably over finishing some unarmed sympathizers.” In describing the activities of the Redlegs, Union General Blunt stated, “A reign of terror was inaugurated, and no man’s property was safe, nor was his life worth much if he opposed them in their schemes of plunder and robbery.” It is difficult to quantify the number of civilians killed by the Redlegs, but a letter written from the Lexington area early in the Redlegs campaign (April 1863) stated that the Redlegs had “killed at least fifty men, who were unarmed and heretofore lived in peace and quiet".|$|E

The success of that work was followed in 1920 by an enthusiastic reception for The Hymn of Jesus, described in The Observer as [...] "one of the most brilliant and one of the most sincere pieces of choral and orchestral expression heard for some years." [...] The Times called it [...] "undoubtedly the most strikingly original choral work which has been produced <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> many years." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Marshall visited Knoxville, Tennessee and {{met with}} Benton MacKaye, a {{regional}} planner who gained support to designate and lay out the Appalachian Trail. Together with Harvey Broome, a Knoxville lawyer, they discussed Marshall's 1930 proposal for an organization dedicated to wilderness preservation. Bernard Frank, a fellow forester, joined them later in the year; the men mailed an [...] "Invitation to Help Organize a Group to Preserve the American Wilderness" [...] to like-minded individuals. The invitation expressed their desire [...] "to integrate the growing sentiment which we believe exists <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> holding wild areas sound-proof as well as sight-proof from our increasingly mechanized life," [...] and their conviction that such wildernesses were [...] "a serious human need rather than a luxury and plaything".|$|E

500|$|As a protege of Slessor, Hardman proclaimed: [...] "An {{air force}} without bombers isn't an air force". He {{maintained}} {{that the only way}} to attain [...] "true and enduring air superiority" [...] was by attacking the enemy's vital centres, which included its means of producing fighters. He recommended that the RAAF purchase one of Britain's nuclear-capable [...] "V bombers"—the Vickers Valiant, Handley Page Victor, or Avro Vulcan—though this never eventuated, and Australia's jet bomber remained the English Electric Canberra until the long-delayed introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C in 1973. Towards the end of his tenure as CAS, Hardman gave an interview in which he criticised Army and Navy operations against a backdrop of continuing interservice rivalry for the defence budget. He was quoted as saying: [...] "The Air Force <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>for</b> either defence or offence, is the only force worth while. It can be sent anywhere in the world to the point where it can do most good and be rapidly switched to any other point." [...] In contrast to the initial disquiet at his appointment, upon his departure from Australia Hardman was described by The Age as [...] "the outstanding CAS in the RAAF's history", a [...] "brilliant organiser", and a [...] "master of the theory of air power". He was succeeded by McCauley on 18January 1954.|$|E

2500|$|In the president's request, he had {{not asked}} for the {{combined}} numbers of U.S. Army and U.S. Navy aircraft; he asked for the [...] "number of combat aircraft by types which should be produced <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> the Army and our Allies in 1943..." [...] This meant that the Navy's aircraft needs, which were significant, were not requested, but that the aircraft needs for America's allies would be included, allies that were to receive {{a certain amount of}} Navy-type aircraft. Hansell decided to make his plan wholly inclusive of all American aircraft requirements—Army, Navy, and Allied—so {{that there would be no}} misunderstanding about how aircraft-producing resources would be allocated. Hansell accepted the aircraft production plans that the Navy submitted, but with one vital change: the four-engined bombers the Navy wanted would be built as Air Corps bombers, flown by USAAF units.|$|E

He believed that even a moderate disruption to the flow of oil could translate into high oil prices which could lead to [...] "chaos" [...] in the global economy and bring the industrial world [...] "to its knees". He feared that Saddam could seize control of the Straits of Hormuz and restrict the transport of oil through them.

He also took four wickets in New Zealand's victory in the Fifth Test; along with John Reid and Noel McGregor he played in all of New Zealand's first three Test victories.

He went further to defend the position Williams had taken earlier in the year, explaining that [...] "It was not very radical to advocate embracing sharia law in the context of family disputes, for example, and our system already goes a long way towards accommodating the archbishop's suggestion."; and that [...] "It is possible <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>for</b> those who are entering into a contractual agreement to agree that the agreement shall be governed by a law other than English law."
