Maintaining a level of happiness at work has become more significant and relevant due to the <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> caused by economic uncertainty and increase in competition. Nowadays, it is viewed by a growing number of scholars and senior executives as one of the major sources of positive outcomes in the workplace.|$|E

The <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on plans to complete the existing EMU in order to correct its economic errors and social upheavals soon introduced the keyword [...] "genuine" [...] EMU. At the beginning of 2012, a proposed correction of the defective Maastricht currency architecture comprising: introduction of a fiscal capacity of the EU, common debt management and a completely integrated banking union, appeared unlikely to happen. Additionally, there were widespread fears that a process of strengthening the Union's power to intervene in eurozone member states and to impose flexible labour markets and flexible wages, might constitute a serious threat to Social Europe.|$|E

Further, since British time the Railways termed the work of the loco staff as [...] "continuous", implying that workers would have to remain at work as long as the train ran on its trip, often for several days at a stretch especially on the goods trains. Independence did not change this. The spread of diesel engines and the consequent <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in the Indian Railways since the 1960s created much resentment among the workers. The Railways, although government-owned, remained an organization in which the accepted worldwide standard of an eight-hour working day was violated with impunity.

Following the debate that has arisen from Braverman's work, concentrating largely on either deskilling and/or strategies of management control, there have been wide-ranging qualifications to Braverman's core theory.

40|$|This study, {{based on}} a sustained, {{qualitative}} investigation into the instructional decision-making of three Grade Nine Natural Science teachers, addresses the dichotomy between policy and practice in the post-apartheid South African context. The main research questions that guided this study were: 1. How do secondary school teachers understand the critical differences between the traditional curriculum, the new outcomes-based curriculum and the revised version of this new curriculum? 2. Why and how do these teachers make strategic curriculum decisions at the interface of the three curricula in their classrooms? A comparative case study approach was taken, during which evidence of what the science teachers were doing in their classes was collected through prolonged, non-participant classroom observation of close to 30 lessons each. Insight into the rationale behind their practices, i. e. their pre-active and interactive decision-making, was gleaned from intensive pre-lesson and post-lesson interviews. The video-recording lessons were played back to them for stimulated recall of their interactive thinking and decision-making. Together with biographical interviews, teacher diaries, and the researcher’s field-notes, these instruments helped {{get a sense of}} the mechanics and dynamics of how these two science teachers make planning, teaching and assessment decisions in the fluidity of the present curriculum habitat in South Africa. The main finding from this study is that teachers do not make extensive use of their considerable decision-making space; I characterize this phenomenon as passivity in decision-making. It was found, further, that a number of decision-making frame factors have a bearing on teachers’ tendency to abdicate their decision-making authority; However, an unexpected finding was the extent to which the commercially prepared ‘outcomes-based’ learning support material shapes what happens in science classrooms. In theorizing teachers’ passivity-in-decision-making during complex curriculum change, I draw on and extend the scholarship on the <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> teachers’ <b>work,</b> by arguing that South African teacher essentially cede their decision-making authority to ‘outcomes-based’ texts, in order to cope with the overwhelming and multiple threats <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> their <b>work.</b> The evidence in this study demonstrate that the veritable threats <b>of</b> <b>intensification</b> <b>of</b> teachers’ <b>work,</b> which typically accompany radical curriculum change in developing countries, stifles teachers’ opportunities to bridge the gap between policy and practice.
