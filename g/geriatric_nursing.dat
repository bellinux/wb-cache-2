There was some reduction in hospital admissions and total days in geriatric NP homes. Overall measures of medical attention showed a mixed pattern with some evidence of geriatric NP care substituted for physician care.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Daily {{observation}} by nurses of {{the cognitive}} function of patients is of high ecological validity because cognitive functioning is observed in a natural setting around the clock. AIM: To evaluate why and how <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurses</b> observe the cognitive functioning of their patients. DESIGN: Survey. METHODS: A self-developed questionnaire was administered to a purposeful sample of <b>nurses</b> working on <b>geriatric</b> wards of seven acute care hospitals. The questions were open-ended. Data were analysed through content analysis. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 97 nurses (response rate 77 %). Categorisation of the many objectives reported by the nurses revealed four themes: to tailor nursing interventions (51 %), to determine discharge arrangements (46 %), to support medical diagnosis and therapy (43 %) and to map specific elements of functional capacity (34 %). Nurses reported also many different domains to observe (mode 2; range 0 - 7), only 73 % of which were actual cognitive domains. The most commonly mentioned cognitive domain was psychomotor behaviour (63 %), followed by executive functions (48 %), language (37 %), attention (33 %), thinking (25 %) and consciousness (20 %). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Geriatric</b> <b>nurses</b> not only made daily observations of their patients' cognitive functioning to support medical diagnoses, but also to guide nursing interventions and determine discharge arrangements. The assessment domains varied fairly widely, because the participants' understanding of the concept cognitive functioning was vague, incomplete and often incorrect. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This is the first study that investigated why <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurses</b> make daily observations of their patients' cognitive functioning. In addition, we explored {{their understanding of the}} concept of cognitive functioning. Based {{on the fact that the}} content of an assessment is determined by its aim, the objectives to perform daily observations have to be clear and stated explicitly.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to develop an instrument to test the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein 2 ̆ 6 Ajzen, 1975) in a new behavioral domain the health promotive behaviors of <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioners (GNPs). The two behavioral categories included in the study were health assessment and health teaching, each with its individual index of actions. A questionnaire was developed to examine the beliefs of a sample of 200 certified <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioners and to test the relationships of the theoretical model. Names of the subjects were randomly selected from the American Nurses 2 ̆ 7 Association 1989 list of certified GNPs. Ninety-four returned questionnaires were included in the data analyses. Data analysis included frequency of demographic attributes, correlation, stepwise multiple regression, and factor analysis. Estimation of validity and reliability of the instrument were sufficient to warrant reuse of the instrument. As a homogeneous group, the <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioners shared strong personal and social beliefs about carrying out health promotive behaviors with older clients. They perceived that important others in the organization think the GNP should carry out health assessment and health teaching with clients. The theory was partially supported in the investigation. Intention was a determinant of behavior in both categories. Attitude was a more significant predictor of intent to carry out behavior than were the perceived social pressures. Motivation to comply with important others was not a determinant of the subjective norm. Results from this study hold implications for both nurse educators, clinicians and health care administrators. In a period when reimbursement for nurse practitioners and cost containment have become realities in the health care system, a GNP who carries out health promotive behaviors with the ever increasing number of elderly clients will be a desirable asset in any health care system...|$|R

5000|$|The nursing {{shortage}} {{continues to}} affect {{all aspects of}} nursing, and gerontological nursing is no exception. It is estimated that 50-150% more nurses will be needed in this speciality in the next decade. Often times nursing students do not express a desire to work in gerontological nursing as their specialty.

40|$|Background. Falls are a {{major health}} problem in older people with {{dementia}} or cognitive impairment. Prevalence rates of falls in these patients are described for the home care setting {{as well as for}} nursing homes but not for the hospital setting. Cognitively impaired older people have a doubled to threefold risk for falls, but the reasons for this have not been fully explained. Several integrative reviews discuss possible specific fall risk factors. However, there is lack of a systematic review. Experts in the field recommend adapting fall preventive strategies with respect to the specific needs of dementia patients. For this experience of <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurses</b> working in the field might be useful. Therefore, the aims of this dissertation were as follows: 1. To describe fall rates in older hospital inpatients with and without cognitive impairment. 2. To evaluate systematically studies investigating fall risk factors in cognitively impaired older people. 3. To explore fall preventive strategies of <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in dementia patients. Methods. Study 1 : A secondary analysis of nationwide prevalence studies in German hospitals from the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 was conducted. In total data of 9246 patients from 37 hospitals were analysed. Study 2 : We performed a systematic review using the data bases PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsychInfo. Study 3 : Focus group interviews with <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurses</b> were conducted. In total 39 nurses in nine groups participated. Results. Study 1 : The fall rate in cognitively impaired patients was 12. 9 % (n= 159), while only 4. 2 % (n= 330) of older persons without cognitive impairment experienced a fall. In our sample these patients had a threefold risk for falls (OR 3. 3, CI 2. 7 - 4. 1). Study 2 : Six prospective studies were included. Eight categories of risk factors emerged: disease-specific motor impairments, impaired vision, type and severity of dementia, behavioural disturbances, functional impairments, fall history, neuroleptics and low bone mineral density. Study 3 : Two categories were derived from the interviews: general and specific interventions. General interventions were common fall preventive strategies adapted with respect to cognitive impairments, e. g. easy to follow physical training instructions. Specific interventions were as follows: to ameliorate agitation and wandering, to give aids to orientation, to consider environmental influences and targeted surveillance. Conclusions. Cognitively impaired older persons constitute a high-risk-group for falls in hospitals. Assessing fall risk in these patients special attention should be given to behavioural disturbances and a fall history. Interventions which improve cognitive function might also decrease fall risk...|$|R
