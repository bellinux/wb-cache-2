5000|$|The data {{structure}} representing the mesh provides support for two basic operations, inserting triangles and removing triangles. It also supports an <b>edge</b> <b>collapse</b> operation that {{is useful in}} triangle decimation schemes. The structure provides no support for the vertex positions, but it does assume that each vertex is assigned a unique integer identifier, typically the index of that vertex {{in an array of}} contiguous vertex positions. A mesh vertex is defined by a single integer and is denoted by hvi. A mesh edge is defined by a pair of integers hv0,v1i, each integer corresponding to an end point of the edge. To support edge maps, the edges are stored so that v0 = min(v0,v1). A triangle component is defined by a triple of integers hv0,v1,v2i, each integer corresponding to a vertex of the triangle. To support triangle maps, the triangles are stored so that v0 = min(v0,v1,v2). Observe that hv0,v1,v2i and hv0,v2,v1i are treated as different triangles. An application requiring double-sided triangles must insert both triples into the {{data structure}}. For the sake of avoiding constant reminders about order of indices, in the remainder of the document the pair/triple information does not imply the vertices are ordering in any way (although the implementation does handle the ordering).Connectivity between the components is completely determined by the set of triples representing the triangles. A triangle t = hv0,v1,v2i has vertices v0, v1, and v2. It has edges e0 = hv0,v1i, e1 = hv1,v2i, and e2 = hv2,v0i. The inverse connections are also known. Vertex v0 is adjacent to edges e0 and e2 and to triangle t. Vertex v1 is adjacent to edges e0 and e1 and to triangle t. Vertex v2 is adjacent to edges e1 and e2 and to triangle t. All three edges e0, e1, and e2 are adjacent to t.How much of this information a data structure stores is dependent on the needs of an application. Moreover, the application might want to have additional information stored at the components. The information stored at a vertex, edge, or triangle {{is referred to as the}} vertex attribute, edge attribute, or triangle attribute. The abstract representations of these for the simple data structure described here are ...|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{simplification}} of nonconvex tetrahedral meshes {{with the}} help of <b>edge</b> <b>collapses</b> (<b>edge</b> contractions) is considerably more complex than the corresponding simplification of convex meshes. In particular, <b>edge</b> <b>collapses</b> in nonconvex meshes may cause intersections of cells that are hard to detect, and therefore hard to avoid. More precisely spoken, the problem is quadratic in the number of cells. However, we show how to reduce the complexity of this problem by employing a preprocessing step, which was originally proposed in order to sort nonconvex meshes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel selective refinement scheme of progressive meshes. In previous schemes, topology {{information in the}} neighborhood of a collapsed edge is stored in the analysis phase. A vertex split or <b>edge</b> <b>collapse</b> transformation is possible in the synthesis phase only if the configuration of neighborhood vertices in the current mesh corresponds to the stored topology information. In contrast, the proposed scheme makes it possible to apply a vertex split or an <b>edge</b> <b>collapse</b> to any selected vertex or edge in the current mesh without a precondition. Our main observation is that the concept of a dual piece can be used to clearly enumerate and visualize the set of all possible selectively refined meshes for a given mesh.

40|$|Simplification of {{tetrahedral}} meshes is {{an important}} tool to decrease the complexity of these datasets. Many visualization systems need the simplified version of a mesh to be fully interactive. This paper presents a rapid tetrahedral simplifier that works in three steps. First, {{the border of the}} tetrahedral mesh is simplified. Second, the interior of the mesh is point sampled such that the resulting point cloud contains the most important points. Third, the point cloud is tetrahedralized and constrained to the simplified border. Such a sequence of global operations exceeds the limitations of a sequence of local operations like <b>edge</b> <b>collapses.</b> The point sampling is steered by both a field and a space error such that direct volume renderings as well as isosurfaces are well approximated. For the border simplification, we present a triangle mesh simplifier that ensures an intersectionfree border after is has finished.
