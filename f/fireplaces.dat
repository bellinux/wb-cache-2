5|$|The central {{chimney stack}} exists, but the {{back-to-back}} <b>fireplaces</b> have been blocked. The staircase may have originally been located {{to one side}} of the back-to-back <b>fireplaces,</b> but no evidence of this remains. There are two rooms on the upstairs floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two rooms in the attic complete with modern fittings. The first floor and attic was used as a flat, with a kitchen, living room and office on the first floor, and two bedrooms in the attic. The roof is thought to be from around 1800 but has subsequently been strengthened.|$|E
5|$|All {{houses were}} built with marble-mantelpieced <b>fireplaces</b> and flues. All houses were {{supplied}} with running water supplied from the New River, which flowed through nearby Wood Green. However, not all houses were supplied with gas or mains electricity from the outset, the remainder being lit by candles or oil or paraffin lamps.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey {{house has}} a {{symmetrical}} facade with projecting wings {{either side of the}} central doorway with a Tuscan portico.

5|$|In addition, {{the house}} has nine {{bathrooms}} and one elevator, which {{were taken from the}} Mellon Mansion. Also taken from the Mellon Mansion were two <b>fireplaces.</b> The one was carved in Italy from lava of Mt. Vesuvius and is located in the community room.

5|$|La Pausa {{contains}} three wings {{that face}} onto a shaded courtyard, with the rooms containing large <b>fireplaces.</b> The rooms were filled by Chanel with 16th-century English oak furniture, {{given to her}} by the Duke of Westminster; English oak was also used for floors and panelling. The large reception rooms were lit by wrought-iron chandeliers from Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{has been changed}} and expanded over the centuries. It now consists of a main 3 storey block with two wings. The interior includes fine wooden panelling and plaster ceilings.

There is a 17th century barn adjacent to the house.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fireplace</b> inserts {{are popular}} {{with people who}} have an {{existing}} open <b>fireplace</b> and chimney, since they significantly improve both fuel efficiency and heat output while also providing an attractive focal point to a room. The disadvantages when compared to a free standing wood burning stove are that they are more expensive to install and obviously also depend upon there being a usable <b>fireplace</b> and chimney in the first place.Electric <b>fireplace</b> inserts are made to fit any size of brick or steel covered hearth. Electric <b>fireplace</b> inserts come in three form factors: electric log inserts (which imitate a natural wood flame), plug-in inserts and built-in units. Plug-in electric <b>fireplace</b> inserts typically connect to a common 120-volt wall plug and are placed within an existing <b>fireplace.</b>|$|R

5|$|The house {{also has}} {{significant}} interior features, including marble <b>fireplaces,</b> wood paneling, coffered ceilings, window and door architraves, parquet floors, and extensive carved wood and plaster detail, {{primarily in the}} Adamesque mold. The original furnishings together were reported in 1895 to have cost {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars, and to have included rare tapestries, carved woods, paintings, and Italian marble.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the building is also similar to how it appeared when the house was constructed. However, a few changes have been made. In 1910 the two marble <b>fireplaces</b> were replaced by brick. The flooring has been replaced as needed. The home's basement, once the main living area, has since been converted several times for other uses.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} were streamlined {{as much as}} possible, without traditional touches such as baseboard moldings. Indirect lighting {{was used}} throughout. Curves were abundant, with rounded <b>fireplaces</b> topped with indirect lighting and a round dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows. Rounded balcony edges were set off by rounded bay windows. The bedrooms included circular dressing rooms with ample closet space. In some of the units, glass brick was used as partition material.|$|E

5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel {{to the north}} tower, and the west face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and {{the upper part of}} the north tower was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and <b>fireplaces</b> in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Decorative tiles {{designed}} by Henry Chapman Mercer—one {{of the leading}} figures of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the U.S.—are placed throughout the building. These tiles (known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's Moravian Pottery and Tile Works) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that complement the simple brick buildings. The tiles on the <b>fireplaces</b> and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, tripartite tile mural on the north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.|$|E

5|$|Maybeck {{designed}} a dining hall {{much like the}} living room, with Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and two opposing <b>fireplaces,</b> but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. The kitchen wing, , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided rooms in the kitchen wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached {{to the top of}} the ground floor; the second story's wall was of rubble stone. The roof was topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to the kitchen wing's exterior appearance led Hearst to surround it with shrubbery.|$|E

The castle kitchens and pantries are on the north side, containing two large <b>fireplaces</b> and storage facilities for food and supplies in their cellars. In the 1460s, the first floors to these buildings included chambers for the senior servants. The buttery in the north-west corner would have been used to store and serve beer and wine.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} to {{the inner}} bailey has the coats of arms of Sir Henry Sidney and Queen Elizabeth I displayed over it, dating to 1581, and was originally a three-storeyed building with transomed windows and <b>fireplaces,</b> probably used as the lodgings for the judges.
