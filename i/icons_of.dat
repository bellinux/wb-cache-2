A fast is observed on Tuesdays to placate the consort goddesses. Festival <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> Murugan used during temple festival processions generally depict him with his consorts.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} fight for Warsaw {{became one of the}} <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> Polish culture, {{described}} by, among others, Polish romantic poets Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki. It was also the main inspiration behind Chopin's Revolutionary Étude, initially called the Étude on the Bombardment of Warsaw. The fall of Warsaw also garnered sympathy for the Poles and their quest for independence.|$|E

Also from the Rhondda Fawr was sculptor Robert Thomas; born in Cwmparc, his heavy cast statues have become <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> contemporary Wales, with many of his works publicly displayed in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E

There are four historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places within the city: Downtown Columbia, the East Campus Neighborhood, Francis Quadrangle, and the North Ninth Street Historic District. The downtown skyline is relatively low and is dominated by the 10-story Tiger Hotel and the 15-story Paquin Tower.|$|E

5|$|The {{church is}} built {{along the banks}} of the Loboc River. The coral stone church follows a {{cruciform}} plan, with a sunken pyramidal roof on its crossing. As a church built by the Jesuits, exterior walls of the church have the Jesuit insignia and <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> an angel's wing and head. Major renovations were undertaken by Augustinian priest Father Aquilino Bon, including the addition of a portico to the façade (1863–1866) and re-roofing with tiles (1873). Father José Sánchez, OAR, added stone buttresses to the walls (1891–1893) and side porticoes (1895–1896). Because of frequent flooding, its wooden flooring was changed to cement tiles in 1895 and was elevated in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} population was originally animist, {{but while the}} fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% {{of the population of}} Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim.|$|E
5|$|The inner baroque façade, {{which is}} part of the 1734 church built by the Jesuits, is {{decorated}} with pilasters, capitals, blind niches and volutes. It is patterned after the San Ignacio Church in Intramuros, with two levels, a triangular pediment, and two narrow octagonal bell towers on each side. The neoclassical portico houses niches for Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Along the pediment is a wooden bas-relief on galvanized iron of the papal tiara over crossed keys (the symbol of Saint Peter) on the center and medallions carrying the <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> the Augustinians and Saint Peter on both ends.|$|E

50|$|The {{museum has}} many {{noteworthy}} ecclesiastical exhibits, most notably an altar {{door from the}} Church of Agia Paraskevi (1760), an <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> St Demetrios with twelve smaller representations, an <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> the Virgin Mary and Christ from the Church of Agios Demetrios (1763), an <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> St Constantine and St Helen from the same church (1600), and an <b>icon</b> <b>of</b> Elijah (16th century). There are also ecclesiastical accessories, such as silver banners, gospels (1776, 1860), an antimension (1840), two chalices (1862, 1890), menaia printed in Venice in 1680 and 1860, part of a chancel screen (17th century), and several chancel-screen icons.|$|R

5|$|Although sawgrass and sloughs are the {{enduring}} geographical <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> the Everglades, other ecosystems {{are just as}} vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are cypresses, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater {{for months at a}} time. The Big Cypress Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{then settled}} an {{incident}} involving {{the abuse of}} the protection afforded by <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> the princeps, in which the emperor's images were being used to shield the guilty. Gaius Cestius Gallus brought a complaint into the Senate, and claimed he was being abused under this safeguard by Annia Rufilla. Drusus was soon brought in to weigh on the matter, for the Senate felt only {{a member of the}} imperial family could speak on such a delicate matter. At the request of many senators, Drusus had Rufilla arrested and imprisoned. Later, he was given credit for the condemnation of two Roman equites, Considius Aequus and Coelius Cursor, who had attacked the praetor, Magius Caecilianus, with false charges of maiestas. It is unlikely that he himself was responsible, for every verdict was given by the Senate with Tiberius' authority, but this did not prevent his popularity.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Heraclius, the Sassanid advance pushed {{deep into}} the Levant, occupying Damascus and Jerusalem and removing the True Cross to Ctesiphon. The counter-attack launched by Heraclius took {{on the character of}} a holy war, and an acheiropoietos image of Christ was carried as a military standard (similarly, when Constantinople was saved from a combined Avar–Sassanid–Slavic siege in 626, the victory was attributed to the <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> the Virgin that were led in procession by Patriarch Sergius about the walls of the city). In this very siege of Constantinople of the year 626, amidst the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the combined Avar, Sassanid, and Slavic forces unsuccessfully besieged the Byzantine capital between June and July. After this, the Sassanid army was forced to withdraw to Anatolia. The loss came just after news had reached them of yet another Byzantine victory, where Heraclius's brother Theodore scored well against the Persian general Shahin. Following this, Heraclius led an invasion into Sassanid Mesopotamia once again.|$|E

5|$|Her parents, Franciszek Ksawery Plater and Anna von der Mohl (Anna z Mohlów), {{divorced}} {{when she was}} nine years old, in 1815. She was brought up by distant relatives, Michał Plater-Zyberk and Izabela Helena Syberg zu Wischling, in their family's manor Līksna near Daugavpils (Dźwina), then Inflanty (now Latvia). Well-educated, Plater was brought up to appreciate the efforts of Tadeusz Kościuszko and the Prince Józef Poniatowski. She was fascinated by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, who she could read in the original German language. She was raised {{in an environment that}} valued the history of Poland, and her literary heroes included Princess Wanda and Adam Mickiewicz's Grażyna. She also admired Bouboulina, a woman who became one of the <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> the Greek uprising against the Ottomans, a Polish fighter Anna Dorota Chrzanowska, as well as Joan of Arc. These pursuits were accompanied by an early interest in equestrianism and marksmanship, quite uncommon for early 19th-century girls from aristocratic families. She was also deeply interested in Ruthenian and Belarusian folk culture. She had contacts and friends in the Filaret Association.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{was finally}} able to bring Symeon before the Synod on charges of honoring as a saint someone who Stephen {{believed}} was far from saintly. At first, Patriarch Sergius II of Constantinople supported Symeon, {{going so far as to}} send candles and perfume in support of the veneration of Symeon the Studite at St. Mammas. Stephen attacked the Studite as unholy and sinful, and was eventually able to convince others that Symeon's homage was improper by convincing them that the Studite held some unorthodox beliefs. As a compromise, Stephen suggested that the annual festival honoring the elder Symeon be held as a private observance within the monastery. Symeon the New Theologian refused to compromise, declaring that it was his duty to honor the church fathers and the saints, and in January 1009 was condemned to go into exile. Stephen also convinced the Patriarch to order all <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> Symeon the Studite removed from St. Mammas, with many of them destroyed or covered over with soot.|$|E
5|$|The Doddagaddavalli Lakshmi Devi ("Goddess of Wealth") Temple is an {{exception}} as it is dedicated to neither Vishnu nor Shiva. The defeat of the Jain Western Ganga Dynasty (of present-day south Karnataka) by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of Vaishnava Hinduism and Virashaivism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism. However, two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The Hoysalas built Jain temples to satisfy the needs of its Jain population, a few of which have survived in Halebidu containing <b>icons</b> <b>of</b> Jain tirthankaras. They constructed stepped wells called Pushkarni or Kalyani, the ornate tank at Hulikere being an example. The tank has twelve minor shrines containing Hindu deities.|$|E
