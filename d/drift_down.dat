5|$|It {{was late}} on 1 August when the British fleet {{appeared}} in the bay, and the French were at anchor in a strong defensive position. The French commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers, did not expect a night attack, but Nelson ordered his ships to form up and attack {{the head of the}} French van, taking advantage of a favourable wind which allowed his ships to <b>drift</b> <b>down</b> the line, while preventing the French rear from reinforcing the van and centre. Bellerophon was the eighth ship in the British line, and as the battle began, Darby turned her towards the French centre, eventually coming to anchor at 7 pm. Possibly due to some error {{on the part of the}} crew or because the anchor had dragged, Bellerophon came to rest alongside the French flagship, the 120-gun Orient.|$|E
5|$|Still {{farther north}} along the {{mountain}} ridge, in the Battle Mountain area, the battle was going poorly for the 24th Infantry. After C Company lost Battle Mountain, heavy UN airstrikes and artillery fire struck its crest in preparation for an infantry counterattack planned to regain the mountain from the North Koreans. The hot and sultry weather made climbing the steep slope difficult, but L Company was on top by 12:00 on August 21. North Korean troops had left the summit under fire from the UN aircraft, artillery, and mortars. The North Koreans placed their own mortar fire on the crest and prevented L Company from consolidating its position. This situation continued until mid afternoon when a North Korean platoon {{came out of the}} trenches on the eastern slope of the mountain and surprised a platoon of L Company with an attack from behind. The other two platoons of L Company, upon hearing firing, started to leave their positions and <b>drift</b> <b>down</b> the hill. The North Koreans swiftly reoccupied the peak while officers tried to assemble L and I Companies on the eastern slope. Elements of E Company also left their position during the day.|$|E
25|$|Several {{witnesses}} reported {{hearing a}} sharp crack followed by cessation of {{noise from the}} engines. When they looked up they saw the Stinson spiralling downwards. Part of one wing had separated from {{the remainder of the}} aircraft and it was drifting slowly towards the ground. As they watched, they saw the whole tail assembly break free from the fuselage. Moments later the wreckage struck the ground and a pall of black smoke rose into the air. Part of the left wing, outboard of the engine nacelle, continued to <b>drift</b> <b>down</b> slowly and reached the ground about ¾mile (1.2km) from the main wreckage.|$|E

25|$|The river rose in mid-April, and by April 19, 1870, judging {{that the}} river was high {{enough to make the}} run, Captain Miller ordered lines cast off. His plan was to <b>drift</b> <b>down</b> with the current, then run the engines in reverse to gain {{steering}} control in the rapids. Going over Copper Ledge Falls, just a few hundred yards downstream, the boat first spun around three times in a powerful eddy just above the drop. Then the bow went over and the whole boat tilted sharply downwards until the sternwheel was spinning around free in the air. Once the boat hit the bottom of the drop, the sternwheel started to break up, throwing the boat out of control and into some rocks which crushed part of her bow. The boat was twisting and wracking and then a boiler valve broke, filling the engine room with steam. Captain Miller put ashore after this, and the crew repaired the vessel. Fortunately the smashed portion of the bow turned out to be above the waterline, and by 9:00a.m. the next day they were ready to proceed.|$|E
25|$|As smoke {{began to}} escape the Zebra Room and <b>drift</b> <b>down</b> the hall toward other banquet rooms, patrons and {{employees}} in the rooms nearest to the Zebra Room smelled it. The employees began to verbally urge room occupants to leave the building; however, as the sprawling complex lacked an audible fire alarm, those in further-flung rooms {{had no way to}} know that there was a fire in the building until an employee walked the length of the building alerting them. Fire investigators later estimated that, once through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, the fire took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. By the time busboy Walter Bailey arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around a thousand people to make their way through the room's small number of exits. As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those {{on the second floor of}} the building.|$|E

Perhaps the river was quietest of a morning or late at night. One moonlight night some people <b>drifted</b> <b>down</b> singing, and with a zither playing--it sounded very pleasantly across the water.|$|R
