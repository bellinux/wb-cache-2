40|$|Virtual {{instrumentation}} {{system has been}} developed for the control system of SRRC. Almost of the measurement instruments are to provide IEEE- 488 interface, they are distributed around the accelerator facilities, the virtual {{instrumentation system}} connects these instruments by local area network, Ethernet, to <b>GPIB</b> <b>adapter.</b> The man-machine interface developed by using LabVIEW, which is running at Sun's workstation. The workstation to be played as an instrument server, the operator can access remote instruments simply by point and click operation. The information provided by instruments can be analyzed and extracted the desire machine parameters at workstation. The main control system can access these parameters by standard network protocol. The major goals of the virtual instrumentation interface are to provide the automatic measurement of the machine parameters and to minimize the interlude of the machine physicists and operators. Machine parameters, such as tune, beam spectrum, filling [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A LabVIEW program {{running on}} a Sun SPARCstation 5 {{controls}} a Tektronix TDS 820 6 GHz sampling oscilloscope via an Ethernet to <b>GPIB</b> <b>adapter.</b> A PC based X Window terminal continuously displays the trace, refreshed at 7 Hz. Functions such as gain, time base and application specific controls are selected by menus, buttons and dialog boxes. We have used the system to observe signals from fast (> 1 GHz) Faraday cups (FFC) in the radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) section of our Radioactive Beam Facility (ISAC). The setup utilizes the accelerator control display terminals while allowing the oscilloscope {{to be closer to}} the FFC's. ISAC uses the RFQ to accelerate singly charged ions to 0. 15 MeV/u where they are stripped prior to acceleration in a drift tube linac (DTL). The time structure of the beam at the RFQ entrance was measured on a FFC placed 4 m downstream of the RFQ pre-buncher. Additional 50 Ω coaxial cone FFC’s were installed downstream of the RFQ near the RFQ exit, just ahead of the stripping foil and at a double focus following the charge selection slit. The last FFC shows the increase in the mean drift time and broadening associated with the increase in energy loss and straggling caused by foil thickening under ion bombardment. Although the phase broadening cannot be corrected, the increase in the mean drift time can be corrected by changing the bias voltage on the stripper foil and thus keeping the ions in phase with the rebuncher rf...|$|E
