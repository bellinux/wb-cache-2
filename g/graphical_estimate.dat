There is an interesting technical analogy between this problem and the theory of random matrices. In d = 2 the random matrices which appear are approximately of the free type well known to physicists and mathematicians, and their asymptotic eigenvalue distribution is therefore simply Wigner’s law. However in d = 3 the natural random matrices that appear have non-trivial constraints of a geometrical origin. It {{would be interesting to}} develop a general theory of these constrained random matrices, which presumably play an interesting role for many non-integrable problems related to diffusion.

40|$|Covariance {{estimation}} {{for high}} dimensional vectors is a classically difficult problem in statistical analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to covariance estimation, which employs a novel sparsity constraint. More specifically, the covariance is constrained {{to have an}} eigen decomposition which can be represented as a sparse matrix transform (SMT). The SMT is formed by a product of pairwise coordinate rotations known as Givens rotations. Using this framework, the covariance can be efficiently estimated using greedy minimization of the log likelihood function, {{and the number of}} Givens rotations can be efficiently computed using a cross-validation procedure. The resulting estimator is positive definite and well-conditioned even when the sample size is limited. Experiments on standard hyperspectral data sets show that the SMT covariance estimate is consistently more accurate than both traditional shrinkage estimates and recently proposed <b>graphical</b> lasso <b>estimates</b> for a variety of different classes and sample sizes. ...|$|R
40|$|We develop several {{methods to}} {{evaluate}} mortality experience of medical facilities with applications to transplant facilities' post-transplant mortality and pre-transplant waitlist mortality. We aim {{to compare the}} center-specific outcomes with the standard practice while providing timely feedback to the centers. In Chapter II, we introduce a risk-adjusted O-E (Observed-Expected) Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) chart along with monitoring bands as decision criterion, to monitor the post-transplant mortality in transplant programs. This {{can be used in}} place of a traditional but complicated V-mask and yields a more simply interpreted chart. The resulting plot provides bounds that allow for simultaneous monitoring of failure time outcomes with signals for `worse than expected' or `better than expected'. The plots are easily interpreted in that their slopes provide <b>graphical</b> <b>estimates</b> of relative risks and direct information on additional failures needed to trigger a signal. In Chapter II, we discuss the construction of a weighted CUSUM to evaluate pre-transplant waitlist mortality of facilities where transplantation can be considered as dependent censoring. Patients are evaluated based on their current medical condition as reflected in a time dependent variable the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, which is used to prioritize to receive liver transplants. We assume a ‘standard’ transplant practice through a transplant model, utilizing Inverse Probability Censoring Weights (IPCW) to construct a weighted CUSUM. We evaluate the properties of a weighted zero-mean process as the basis of the proposed weighted CUSUM. A rule of setting control limits is discussed. Case study on regional transplant waitlist mortality is carried out to demonstrate the usage of the proposed weighted CUSUM. In Chapter III, we provide an explicit road map for using a Cox dependent censoring model in the IPCW approach, complete with details of implementation. In addition, we evaluate an alternative parametric IPCW approach to gain efficiency. Simulation studies and case study on the national liver transplant waitlist mortality are conducted to demonstrate the similarity in estimates between Cox IPCW and PWE IPCW, and the computational savings by the PWE IPCW as compared to the Cox IPCW.

40|$|Estimating dynamic {{networks}} {{from data}} {{is an active}} research area {{and it is one}} important direction in system biology. Estimating the structure of a network is about deciding {{the presence or absence of}} relationships between random variables. Graphical models describe conditional independence relationships. Gaussian graphical models are graphical models where it is assumed that the random variables follow a multivariate normal distribution. When Gaussian graphical models are applied in order to study large networks, they typically fail because the number of variables is much greater than the number of observations. Recently, penalized Gaussian graphical models have been proposed to estimate static networks in high-dimensional studies because of their statistical properties and computational tractability. We propose to use penalized Gaussian <b>graphical</b> models to <b>estimate</b> structured dynamic networks, for modeling slowly changing of dynamic networks, and to estimate particular structures such as scale-free dynamic networks in a small world setting. These models can be applied when estimating dynamic networks in high-dimensional environments. When multivariate dynamic data are binary or ordinal random variables, transformations based on probability distribution with fixed marginal can be used to do inference. We propose the Gaussian copula for non-Gaussian graphical models to overcome the assumption of Gaussianity. The problem of estimating dynamic networks becomes even more challenging when latent or hidden variables are involved in larger systems. State-space models have been proposed in order to study dynamic networks with latent variables. We propose a penalized Gaussian <b>graphical</b> models to <b>estimate</b> dynamic networks with latent structures...|$|R

The two most important aspects of laboratory consolidation tests are: (1) estimation of the compression index (C-c), used to predict total settlement of normally consolidated soils provided the void ratio versus log (effective stress) is linear; and (2) the coefficient of consolidation (C-v), used to predict the rate of settlement in the range of primary consolidation. Several researchers have proposed various graphical methods for obtaining estimates of C-v from laboratory oedometer tests. Olson (1985) concluded that since different <b>graphical</b> methods <b>estimate</b> different values for C-v for the same data, the only rational way to estimate the C-v value is to base it on the coefficient of volume compressibility (m(v)) and the coefficient of permeability (k).

In particular {{we focus on}} extracting features {{in the form of}} graphical models of conditional dependence between the process components. The motivation is to use the techniques on brain EEG data measured from multiple patients and investigate whether it can be used in areas such as medical diagnosis. We look at both the case where the <b>graphical</b> model is <b>estimated</b> based on time series recorded on the scalp and also where the <b>graphical</b> model is <b>estimated</b> based on source signals within the brain. In the first case we use a multiple hypothesis testing approach to build the graphical models and a learning algorithm based on random forests to find patterns within multiple graphical models. In the second case we use independent component analysis (ICA) to extract the source time series and estimate the conditional dependence graphs using partial mutual information. It is of particular note that in this case due to the indeterminacy issues associated with ICA we only know the conditional dependence graphs up to some unknown permutation of the nodes. To solve this issue we use novel methods based on an extension of graph matching to multiple inputs in order to develop a new clustering algorithm. Finally, we show how this algorithm can be combined with further information obtained during the ICA phase contained in columns of the unmixing matrix, to create a more powerful method.

40|$|Investigations into brain {{connectivity}} aim {{to recover}} networks of brain regions connected by anatomical tracts or by functional associations. The inference of brain networks has recently attracted much interest {{due to the}} increasing availability of high-resolution brain imaging data. Sparse inverse covariance estimation with lasso and group lasso penalty has been demonstrated {{to be a powerful}} approach to discover brain networks. Motivated by the hierarchical structure of the brain networks, we consider the problem of <b>estimating</b> a <b>graphical</b> model with tree-structural regularization in this paper. The regularization encourages the graphical model to exhibit a brain-like structure. Specifically, in this hierarchical structure, hundreds of thousands of voxels serve as the leaf nodes of the tree. A node in the intermediate layer represents a region formed by voxels in the subtree rooted at that node. The whole brain is considered as the root of the tree. We propose to apply the tree-structural regularized <b>graphical</b> model to <b>estimate</b> the mouse brain network. However, the dimensionality of whole-brain data, usually on the order of hundreds of thousands, poses significant computational challenges. Efficient algorithms that are capable of estimating networks from high-dimensional data are highly desired. To address the computational challenge, we develop a screening rule which can quickly identify many zero blocks in the <b>estimated</b> <b>graphical</b> model, thereby dramatically reducing the computational cost of solving the proposed model. It is based on a novel insight on the relationship between screening and the so-called proximal operator that we first establish in this paper.
