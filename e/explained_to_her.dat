Following the procedure, Ezri — now known as Ezri Dax — spent time at the Symbiosis Institute on Trill to learn to adapt to her new state. Because of her new state, Ezri's romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended, as she later <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> family that he reminded her of a past host's son.|$|E
25|$|Corby was {{released}} from Kerobokan Prison on 10 February 2014. Avoiding the packed media surrounding her, she was loaded into a prison van and taken to the prosecutor's office in Denpasar, where she was fingerprinted and had the rules of her parole <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Corby then left the prosecutor's office in the prison van, which drove towards the Bali Correction Centre. After {{she arrived at the}} Correction Centre, she signed her parole and underwent final explanation of her parole. She was then released. It was believed she would stay with her sister in Kuta to serve her parole period.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of {{the woman and the}} rival who supposedly caused Hill's injury, though frequently speculated upon, remained mostly conjecture for nearly a century. William M. Adler's 2011 biography of Hill reveals new information about his alibi, which was never introduced at his trial. According to Adler, Hill and his friend and countryman, Otto Appelquist, were rivals for the attention of 20-year-old Hilda Erickson, {{a member of the family}} with whom the two men were lodging. In a recently discovered letter, Erickson confirmed her relationship with the two men and the rivalry between them. The letter indicates that when she first discovered Hill was injured, he <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that Appelquist had shot him, apparently out of jealousy.|$|E

500|$|Notorious {{scenes in}} the play include [...] "the china scene", a {{sustained}} double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection {{with two of his}} lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband that Horner [...] "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it lest I should beg some. But I will find it out, and have what I came for yet" [...] (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made [...] "china" [...] a dirty word in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{asked her}} {{to play the role}} because he had seen her {{previous}} work and liked it. Saldana had never seen the original series, though she had played a Trekkie in The Terminal (2004), but agreed to play the role after Abrams complimented her. [...] "For an actor, that's all you need, that's all you want. To get the acknowledgment and respect from your peers," [...] she said. She met with Nichelle Nichols, who <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> how she had created Uhura's background and had named the character. Saldana's mother was a Star Trek fan and sent her voice mails during filming, giving advice on the part. Sydney Tamiia Poitier also auditioned for the part. The film officially establishes the character's first name, which had never been previously uttered on TV or in film. It also establishes (in an officially discreet manner) that Uhura and Spock are, in fact, lovers and had been romantically linked for some time during the film.|$|E
500|$|Nicole {{had a brief}} {{relationship}} with Penn Graham (Christian Clark) and after he was murdered, she discovered {{that she was pregnant}} with his child. James told Sunrise that viewers could expect a [...] "realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy" [...] and she explained {{that it was important to}} respect the issue. She added [...] "We took it very seriously with the writers, and you do a lot of research and things like that. You can only do your best, I guess!" [...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant. Of the moment she was told that Nicole was going to have a baby, James said [...] "I went in to see our producer later and he said, 'Okay, I'm going to apologise in advance - we're making Nicole pregnant!'" [...] She initially did not want to portray a [...] "typical soap teenage pregnancy" [...] as she thought Nicole should be different. However the situation was <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and she became excited at the challenging storyline ahead.|$|E

500|$|Confronted by a Puritan {{friend with}} rumours about his [...] "ungodly life", Dudley defended himself in 1576: I {{stand on the}} top of the hill, where ... the {{smallest}} slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who I have no doubt but will cancel them as I have been and shall be most heartily sorry for them. With Douglas Sheffield, a young widow of the Howard family, he had a serious relationship from about 1569. He <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that he could not marry, not even in order to beget a Dudley heir, without his [...] "utter overthrow": You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [...] favour". Although in this letter Leicester said he still loved her as he did at the beginning, he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if she so wished. The affair continued and in 1574 [...] Douglas gave birth to a son, also called Robert Dudley.|$|E
500|$|A general {{election}} {{was called in}} Southern Rhodesia in July 1948 after the United Party government, headed by the Prime Minister Sir Godfrey Huggins, unexpectedly lost {{a vote in the}} Legislative Assembly. In August, about a month before election day, Smith was approached by members of the opposition Liberal Party and asked to stand for them in Selukwe. Jacob Smit's Liberals, despite their name, were decidedly illiberal, chiefly representing commercial farming, mining and industrial interests. Smith was initially reluctant, saying he was too busy organising his life to stand, but agreed after one of the Liberal officials suggested that a political career might allow him to defend the values he had fought for in the Second World War. With their wedding barely a fortnight away, Janet was astonished to learn of Smith's decision to run for parliament, having never before heard him discuss politics. [...] "I can't say that I am really interested in party politics," [...] Smith <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "but I've always been most interested in sound government." [...] Smith duly became a Liberal Party politician, finalised his purchase of Gwenoro, and married Janet, adopting her two children as his own, all in a few weeks in August 1948. They enjoyed a few days' honeymoon at Victoria Falls, then went straight into the election campaign.|$|E
500|$|The 1983 season {{started the}} Group B {{era of the}} WRC and Mouton was now {{at the wheel of}} the Audi Quattro A1. She also had a new teammate; Audi had signed Stig Blomqvist as their third regular driver. For the third year in a row, Mouton had a bad start to her season in Monte Carlo. She went off the road on a stage not far from her home town, and again hit a stone wall at over 100km/h (60mph). The car was destroyed, but Mouton and Pons were unharmed. Mouton <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> team boss Roland Gumpert, later of Gumpert {{supercar}} fame, that she had had to dodge a photographer. Mouton went on to record successive points finishes. She finished fourth in Sweden in a quadruple win for Audi, after an early driving error that had sent her Quattro into a snow bank. In Portugal, Mouton finished second to Mikkola, ahead of Lancia's Röhrl and Markku Alén. After the first section of the Safari Rally, totaling over 1,600km (1,000mi), Mouton arrived to the finish on three wheels and said she was [...] "totally exhausted" [...] from the effort. She eventually placed third behind Opel's Ari Vatanen and her teammate Mikkola. After four events, Mikkola and Mouton were first and second in the drivers' championship.|$|E

500|$|In 1839, History of a Six Weeks' Tour was {{revised and}} republished as [...] "Journal of a Six Weeks’ Tour" [...] and [...] "Letters from Geneva" [...] in Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments, by Percy Bysshe Shelley, Edited by Mrs. Shelley (1840). Although these works were not by her husband, {{she decided to}} include them because they were [...] "part of his life", as she <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> friend Leigh Hunt. She {{appended}} her initials to the works to indicate her authorship. As Moskal explains, [...] "the unity of the 1817 volume as a volume was dissolved" [...] {{to make way for}} a biography of Percy Shelley. After Percy Shelley drowned in 1822, his father forbade Mary Shelley from writing a memoir or biography of the poet. She therefore added significant biographical notices to the edited collections of his works. The 1840 version of History of a Six Weeks' Tour has four major types of changes according to Moskal: [...] "(i) modernization and correction of spelling, punctuation and French (ii) self-distancing from the familial relationship with Claire Clairmont (iii) a heightened sensitivity to national identity (iv) presentation of the travelers as a writing, as well as reading, circle". As a result of these changes, more of Percy Shelley’s writing was included in the 1840 version than in the 1817 version. In 1845, Mary Shelley published a one-volume edition with additional minor changes, based on the 1840 version.|$|E
500|$|Art {{director}} Randy McIlvain led the set re-creation for the Enterprise and K7, {{describing the}} excitement over {{working on the}} episode as [...] "contagious". McIlvain spent {{a fair amount of}} time getting the window angles correct on the sets. Mike Okuda re-created the graphics seen on the Enterprise sets using a computer, whilst others were re-drawn by artist Doug Drexler. Some sets were not re-created in full, such as the bridge, which required parts of it to be later added digitally. The captain's chair from the bridge re-creation was later one of the Star Trek items to be auctioned by Christie's. Set designer Laura Richarz watched [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] carefully looking for small details to replicate on the new sets, such as the legs of benches in the bar on K7. However, she said her biggest challenge was tracking down the chairs seen on the space station. She contacted John M. Dwyer, who had worked on the original episode. He <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that the company which created the original chairs had gone out of business. After searching shops selling retro furniture, the production team found a single chair that matched those seen in the original episode. It was purchased and a mold was made to create more chairs. The actors were impressed when they saw the resulting sets, with Terry Farrell exclaiming [...] "Wow, we're on the Enterprise!" ...|$|E
500|$|Rhimes also {{described}} the difficulty she faced in finding an appropriate love {{interest for the}} character of Alex Karev: [...] "We kept meeting with people and it wasn't until we met Elizabeth Reaser and sat down with her, and in two seconds in {{realized that she was}} absolutely the one we'd been looking for." [...] Reaser explained that when she was cast, there were no definite plans for the development of her character, and that only the intrigue of the ferry accident had been <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She also deemed her character [...] "frustrated and scared". As for the make up process, Reaser stated: [...] "The prosthetic changes your outlook on yourself. It can be very disorienting. It's intense." [...] Beers, however, noted that the focus on Ava was mainly due to her inability to express her feelings through facial expressions, only communicating with her eyes and voice. Executive producer Rob Corn stated that his plan for the original arc was about Jane Doe's inner life, struggling {{to get out of the}} situation she is trapped in. He stated that the main characteristics they had been looking for in the actress for the part were strength and vulnerability. He also called Reaser's performance [...] "heart-wrenching and wonderful". Betsy Beers, the show's supervising executive producer, found Izzie to have been marked for life by Denny's death, which matured her [...] "in a very sobering way", but played a major role in making her feel more confident. She also noted the undeniable connection between Izzie and Alex Karev, whose desire to do honorable things has been compared with his [...] "cutting and sarcastic" [...] personality. After Izzie's continuous efforts to change Alex during their relationship in the previous season, Beers announced the possibility of a relationship between the two of them. She also contrasted the female leads on the show with women in film, explaining how the characters on television are shaped in unique ways.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the moment}} she arrived in Sweden, Louisa Ulrika engaged in {{political}} activity. Her political ideal was absolute monarchy, and she disliked the Swedish constitutional monarchy from the moment it was <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She also disliked the system of legal justice. When she, at one point, thought herself exposed to a plot, she wrote: [...] "The laws are so strange, and one does not dare to arrest someone on mere suspicion without proof, which benefit the individual more than the Kingdom." [...] She respected the political ability of Carl Gustaf Tessin, and identified him as an ally in her wish to increase royal power. At Christmas 1744, she visited Tessin {{and gave him a}} lantern in the guise of the goddess Diana with the inscription: [...] "Made only to shed light on the political system of the day".|$|E
2500|$|These {{claims are}} {{directly}} contradicted by comments from actresses like Cybill Shepherd, who acknowledged her {{affair with the}} singer and said to have introduced Elvis to certain amorous techniques. However, the [...] "much-quoted claims that she taught him the joys of oral sex is viewed with skepticism by other lovers of the King." [...] In an interview, Shepherd reveals that Presley kissed her all over her naked body – but refused to have oral sex with her. His slow tender kisses ended at her bellybutton. Elvis <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "Me and the guys talk and, well, we don't eat pussy." [...] She always knew their relationship was doomed and they wouldn't last as a couple. She says, [...] "The fact is, Elvis got hooked on speed in the army. ... Then it got out of control. Did I {{want to be with}} someone who would have dragged me down? The only way to have stayed with Elvis was by doing drugs.".|$|E
2500|$|Loveless' second single, [...] "I Did", was {{released}} in April 1986. The song had gone out with releases from four other MCA singers, {{all of whom had}} album contracts. Shortly after its release, Roger Bowen asked Loveless to come into his office where he <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that he wanted to pull the song from radio because it was succeeding too well. [...] "I have to be fair to the other artists". In return, he would give Loveless an album deal and she could release [...] "I Did" [...] as a single from her first album. This produced the self-titled Patty Loveless album, being initially released on October 1, 1986 in a promotional form, with a full release on February 21, 1987. The singles, [...] "Wicked Ways" [...] and [...] "After All", were released from that album, which again, did not do well on the charts but garnered sufficient airplay that Tony Brown decided to sign Loveless to a long-term recording contract.|$|E

2500|$|Two Russian men she met {{commented on}} her general {{disdain for the}} male sex; irritated by their {{assumption}} that since she was always falling in love, she would return their affections if they flirted with her, Clairmont joked {{in a letter to}} Mary Shelley that perhaps she should fall in love with both of them at once and prove them wrong. She returned to England in 1828, but remained there only a short while before departing for Dresden, where she was employed as a companion and housekeeper. Scholar Bradford A. Booth suggested in 1938 that Clairmont, driven by a need for money, might have been the true author of most of The Pole, an 1830 short story that appeared in the magazine The Court Assembly and Belle Assemblée as by [...] "The Author of Frankenstein". Unlike Mary Shelley, Clairmont was familiar with the Polish used in the story. At one point, she thought of writing a book about the dangers that might result from [...] "erroneous opinions" [...] about the relations between men and women, using examples from the lives of Shelley and Byron. She did not make many literary attempts, as she <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> friend Jane Williams: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was originally created purely for {{the plot of}} [...] "Silence in the Library". Moffat knew that the team of archaeologists would have to trust the Doctor, but the Doctor's psychic paper could not explain and convince the team why he had appeared in a sealed-off library. Therefore, Moffat intended for the Doctor to {{know one of the}} archaeologists, but decided that idea was [...] "dull" [...] and instead decided to have one of them know him. When Kingston returned to the show, Moffat <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> some details about her character's back-story, knowledge which Smith, Gillan and Darvill did not receive until later. Kingston relates that she knows her character cannot be killed off because we saw her death in her introductory episode; each subsequent appearance is set at a different point in her character's personal history. Moffat had planned out that River was Amy and Rory's daughter for [...] "a long time" [...] and used [...] "Pond" [...] as Amy's last name to create a link between the two. For the filming of the sixth series, Kingston was aware of River Song's relationship to Amy and Rory, while the other cast only found out upon reading of the mid-season cliffhanger script for [...] "A Good Man Goes to War".|$|E
