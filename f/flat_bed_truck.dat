The first festival took place over four successive weekends with bands playing from a stage improvised from a <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> <b>truck.</b> Bristol City Council donated £50. The following year the festival took place over one weekend and was located near to Ashton Court mansion. After this, new organisers came on board and fund-raising gigs were held enabling the event to grow steadily through the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|EATS {{technology}} is predominately used when applying vehicle tracking to vehicle security solutions. [...] An {{example of this}} distinction is given in the following scenario; [...] A construction company owns some pieces of plant machinery that are regularly left unattended, at weekends, on building sites. Thieves break onto one site and a piece equipment, such as a digger, is loaded {{on the back of}} a <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> <b>truck</b> and then driven away. [...] Typically the ignition wouldn’t need to be turned on and as such most of the AVL products available wouldn’t typically be activated. Only products that included a unit that was activated by a motion sensor or GeoFence alarm event, would be activated.|$|E

5000|$|A Skid Unit (called a [...] "Slip-on" [...] in Australia) is {{the common}} name {{used to refer to}} a {{complete}} self-contained fire fighting apparatus designed for use on/in commercially available vehicle platforms. Vehicles such as pickup <b>trucks,</b> <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> <b>trucks,</b> vans, off-road vehicles, trailers and others can easily be fitted with a proper size skid unit for a variety of fire fighting operations. There is virtually no limit to size or performance capabilities. Fire operations can include rural field operations, forest fires, brush fires and other situations in which a small, highly mobile vehicle is necessary to reach the location of the fire ground operations in rough or otherwise inaccessible terrain.|$|R
5000|$|El Teatro Campesino ("farmworkers' theater"), is a {{theatrical}} troupe founded in 1965 as the cultural {{arm of the}} United Farm Workers with the [...] "full support of Cesar Chavez."

Early performances were on <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> <b>trucks</b> {{in the middle of the}} fields in Delano, California, and the theater is now located in San Juan Bautista, California. Currently, El Teatro Campesino’s mission is “…to create a popular art with 21st century tools that presents a more just and accurate account of human history, while encouraging the young women and men of a new generation to take control of their own destiny through creative discipline, vibrant education, economic independence, and artistic excellence.” ...|$|R
50|$|To the {{surprise}} of many observers, in December 1994 DB signed a letter of intent with ABB Henschel {{which resulted in the}} order of 145 locomotives on 28 July 1995. The first class 101 locomotive was ceremonially presented on 1 July 1996. This unit, as was the case for the first three locomotives of this class, carried the orient red color scheme. ABB Henschel had by this time merged with AEG Schienenfahrzeugtechnik to become ADtranz, and some of the bodies were now being built at the Hennigsdorf factory, while others were built in Kassel. The bodies that were manufactured in Hennigsdorf were transported by <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> <b>trucks</b> via the Autobahn to Kassel, where they were attached to the bogies built in Wrocław in Poland, and assembly was finalized. On 19 February 1997, the first class 101 locomotive was officially put into service.|$|R

5000|$|Pau de Arara is a Portuguese {{term that}} {{literally}} translates to [...] "macaw's perch". The term originates from {{the habit of}} tying birds to a pole for sale, where they also hang for transportation. By analogy, the term has gained two distinct meanings: it can refer to an irregular <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> <b>truck</b> used to transport migrant workers and to a torture device developed during the Brazilian military dictatorship.|$|E
5000|$|Lane {{had been}} {{interested}} in airplanes since his early career as an aircraft mechanic. He eventually got his pilot's license, and also became a skydiver. He used this experience in a song [...] "The Day I Jumped from Uncle Harvey's Plane" [...] recorded by Roger Miller. He found a 1958 DC-8 passenger jetliner at the Smyrna, Tennessee airport, {{one of the few}} places where this particular type of plane could be repaired. He purchased the plane and had it cut into five pieces, which were shipped on <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> <b>trucks</b> to his home in Ashland City, Tennessee (near Nashville). Its 177 seats were removed, and it was converted into Lane’s permanent home. It was well insulated and comfortable, and had a bar and a music room in the cockpit. It served as a place where songwriters and musicians would frequently gather to share songs and ideas. Lane's directions on how to find him went something like: [...] "...go down the country road past the bicycle and the windsock, and it's the first large airliner on the right." [...] Lane was active in charitable efforts with the local police department with a camp for disadvantaged youth. He once took the boys out for a boat ride on Nashville's Old Hickory Lake and surprised them by pulling the boat up to Johnny Cash's house. Cash came out personally and gave the boys record albums. Lane was a veteran guest of the [...] "red light pickin' parties" [...] hosted by Texas football coach Darrell Royal, who was an aficionado of country music and especially songwriters.|$|R
5000|$|On April 29, 2007, Hancock {{was killed}} in a motor vehicle {{accident}} when the 2007 Ford Explorer he was driving while intoxicated struck the rear of a <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> tow <b>truck</b> at 12:35 a.m. Central Time. The truck was reportedly in the left lane assisting another vehicle that was involved in a prior accident. A police report revealed that Hancock was intoxicated {{at the time of his}} fatal accident with a blood-alcohol level of 0.157, nearly double the legal limit in Missouri. Police found 10.95 grams of marijuana and a pipe in his vehicle, although toxicology reports came back revealing that there was no marijuana in his system. Hancock was texting on his cell phone when the accident occurred and was not wearing a seatbelt. An accident reconstruction team determined that Hancock was driving 68 mi/h km/h in a 55 mi/h km/h zone.|$|R
5000|$|Bob Woodward, in {{his book}} Plan of Attack, wrote that Tenet privately lent his {{personal}} authority to the intelligence reports {{about weapons of mass}} destruction (WMDs) in Iraq. At a meeting on December 12, 2002, he assured Bush that the evidence against Saddam Hussein amounted to a [...] "slam dunk case". After several months of refusing to confirm this statement, Tenet later stated that this remark was taken out of context. (Tenet indicated that the comment was made pursuant to a discussion about how to convince the American people to support invading Iraq, and that, in his opinion, the best way to convince the people would be by explaining the dangers posed by Iraq's WMD i.e., the public relations sale of the war via the WMD, according to Tenet, would be a [...] "slam dunk".) The search following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by American, British, and other international forces yielded no stockpiles of nuclear WMDs in Iraq, except for tens of thousands of chemical shells found stacked from floors to ceilings in every room of what was putatively a school building in the Anbar province. And of course the 83 <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> <b>trucks</b> which sped from Iraq into Syria 3 days before the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which were later used by Syrian dictator and former passenger jet pilot Bashar al-Assad against the population whose desire for self-government and liberty were revived after Iraq and Lebanon, whose elected government had not met since shortly after the terrorist group PLO invaded in 1975 and destroyed Beirut, until then called [...] "the Paris of the Middle East", gained representative governments. Tenet and his Director of Operations resigned at about this same time, and it has been suggested these resignations were in penance over the WMD issue in Iraq.|$|R

50|$|One notable {{example was}} a Ford F-500 <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> <b>truck</b> {{made in the}} mid-1960s. Proportions were {{realistic}} and colors were authentic looking. The grille was also authentically detailed with jeweled headlights. Wheels were done in a utilitarian black, detailed, but with no chrome. Rear wheels were 'duallies'. One model offered a dark green body, brown interior, and a red metal chassis. It was a heavy model of a heavy duty real truck (Ragan 2000, p. 36).|$|E
50|$|Small {{cars were}} at first {{packaged}} in both picture boxes and blister packs. Boxes were dropped entirely by the mid-1980s. Large models were mostly packed in window boxes, {{with a few}} exceptions. One unfortunate design element in this time period was the unrealistic and rather gaudy white-walled tires labeled with 'Siku' {{on opposite sides of}} each tire and with and white 'spoked' wheels that appeared on most vehicles in this series. Fortunately, by the late 1990s, realistic wheel designs were adopted, like accurate mini mags for the Mini Cooper seen on this page. This series is still produced today, and since the incorporation of the Club Series (see below) in the early 1990s, large trucks as well as military tanks and a few aircraft {{have been made in the}} small car size and put in blister packages. Of course, their scale varied greatly too. Hence, a unified scale of 1:55 (or 1:60 for cars from the V series) is not uniformly applied.Siku keeps up with odd German sports cars selections like the Gumpert Apollo or the Wiesmann GT. Occasionally Siku outdoes itself with a very odd model. Sixteen inch tall cranes have been produced, helicopters on <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> semi <b>trucks,</b> forestry log loaders, piston bully snow tracked vehicles, an ultra-detailed stake bed Mercedes Unimog, potato digger truck, triple engined competition pulling tractor and modern tram and subway cars. Perhaps the most outrageous is the AIDA Aluna 10 story plus cruise ship in 1:1,400 scale (18 cm long).|$|R
5000|$|The Honda Ridgeline is a {{sport utility}} truck (SUT) by Honda and is {{categorized}} {{by some as}} a lifestyle pickup.

[...] The first Honda Ridgeline went on sale in March 2005 as a 2006 model. This SUT was initially built by Honda of Canada Manufacturing until 2009 when assembly was relocated to Honda Manufacturing of Alabama. [...] Production of the first generation Honda Ridgeline ended in mid-2014. [...] After a two-year hiatus, a newly redesigned second generation Honda Ridgeline went on sale in late June 2016 as a 2017 model.|$|R
50|$|Some vehicle {{recovery}} tow <b>trucks</b> have <b>flat</b> <b>beds</b> {{and are able}} to winch a recovered vehicle entirely on board. They can then drive the vehicle away for repair without needing to tow it. This allows a faster journey, does not require a driver in the vehicle being towed, and allows a damaged vehicle to be recovered when it cannot be towed. As these <b>flat</b> <b>beds</b> usually slope gradually to the rear, unlike the level bed of a cargo flatbed, they are known as 'beavertails'. Some tow <b>truck</b> <b>beds</b> are demountable and may be lowered behind the truck for easy loading, then both bed and load winched back aboard as one.|$|R
