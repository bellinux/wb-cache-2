40|$|The thermoelastic {{properties}} of several common woven glass/epoxy substrate materials were characterized {{in both the}} warp and <b>fill</b> <b>directions.</b> Five common commercially pressed cores (1080, 2116, 2313, 3313, 7628) were obtained from Polyclad, Inc. The cores consisted of either one or two plies of C-staged woven glass epoxy substrate sandwiched between 1 ounce copper cladding. After the copper {{was removed from the}} cores, samples were cut for either mechanical property characterization or microstructural analysis with the test axis lying along either the warp or fill direction. The crimp angle and relative fiber volume fraction of each fabric was first determined from photomicrographs of polished cross-sections. Next, Young's modulus was measured via standard tension tests at room temperature. The storage and loss moduli were then measured as function of temperature using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Finally, the coefficients of thermal expansion were determined using constant force thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) measurements. All of the substrates showed significant differences in microstructure and material properties between the warp and <b>fill</b> <b>directions.</b> Most of the laminates had a much lower crimp angle in the warp direction, which resulted in a higher modulus and lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the fill direction.

In the characterization effort, the stress-strain relation and damage evolution are studied {{with a series}} of loading and unloading tensile test experiments. The stress-strain relation is linear in response to the initial loading and becomes nonlinear when loading exceeds the proportional limit. Transverse cracking has been observed to be a dominant damage mode governing the nonlinear deformation. The damage is initiated at the inter-tow pores where fiber yarns cross over each other. In the modeling work, the analysis is based upon a fiber bundle model, in which fiber undulation in the warp and <b>fill</b> <b>directions</b> and gaps among fiber yarns have been taken into account. Two limiting cases of fabric stacking arrangements are studied. Closed form solutions are obtained for the composite stiffness and Poisson's ratio.

30|$|In case of {{citric acid}} (Table  14) tensile {{strength}} retention was at most 75 and 70 % for warp and <b>fill</b> <b>directions</b> respectively. Higher concentration of citric acid and SHP caused noticeable loss in tensile and tear strength due to more acid degradation of fabric {{as compared to}} resin treatment (pH of citric acid bath was 2.7 – 3). High curing temperature (180  °C) too resulted fall in tensile strength. Softener and polyethylene emulsion at lower concentrations, viz. 5 and 10  gpl respectively, produced remarkably lower bending length (stiffness). TCRA was not comparable with that of resin finished cottons, although there was improvement in it.

One of the woven fabrics was non-hybrid glass using E-glass fibre yams in both warp and weft (<b>fill)</b> <b>directions,</b> the second fabric was a hybrid woven fabric using E-glass fibre yams in the warp direction and R-glass fibre yams in the weft direction. Destructive tests such as interlaminar shear, flexural and uniaxial tension tests were carried out on two different categories. In the first category four different fibre volume fractions of nonhybrid E-glass woven fabric reinforced epoxy resin laminates have been investigated. In the second category hybrid and non-hybrid woven fabric reinforced epoxy resin laminates for similar fibre volume fractions have been investigated. Acoustic Emission (AE) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were employed as nondestructive tools to predict and characterise the damage events in the composites. All laminates were fabricated using the wet hand lay-up process to laminate the fabric layers prior to curing. Epoxy resin (L 20 -SL set) was the sole matrix used for all composites. Test results showed higher mechanical performance for the hybrid composites and improvements in mechanical properties for higher fibre volume fraction in the non-hybrid composites. DMTA tests were carried out on the laminates of the categories mentioned above, the test results indicated the effect of fibre surface treatment concentration {{on the performance of}} mechanical properties of woven composites.

The fabrics represented three weaves: plain, twill and leno; and three colors: white, eggshell and turquoise. The fiber contents, {{according to the}} manufacturers, varied from 20 percent "Rovana", 56 percent "Verel" and 24 percent rayon to 49. 3 "Rovana", 30. 5 percent "Verel" and 20. 2 percent rayon. Chemical analysis revealed {{that all of the}} fabrics varied from the manufacturers' stated fiber contents. A Fade-Ometer was used to test for colorfastness to light. Although no fading was visible to the eye, the plain weave fabrics of high "Rovana" content showed the greatest color change according to a Gardner Color Difference Meter. White fabrics and broken twill weave fabrics were modified also. Washing had little effect on the colors. Shrinkage was most pronounced in the <b>filling</b> <b>direction</b> and was due chiefly to laundering. Fabrics fabricated in a broken twill weave of approximately 30 percent "Rovana" exhibited slightly more shrinkage than the four percent allowance recommended by the American Hotel Association. The remaining fabrics shrank only approximately one percent. Fabrics appeared to be most affected by 63. 5 °C temperatures in an oven during the first 50 hours according to a heat study which measured shrinkage and tensile strength, but generally the effect was slight. There was considerable variation in tensile strength of the filling yarns but the percentage retained after Fade-Ometer exposure and launderings was good. The "Rovana" warp yarns were slightly less strong but retained more strength. Fabrics of high "Verel" content showed the greatest elongation in the <b>filling</b> <b>direction</b> and fabrics of high "Rovana" in the warp direction. Loss of body was noticed as a result of abrasion, with loose weaves and fabrics of high "Rovana" content being affected the most. All of the fabrics proved to be flame-resistant as they would not support combustion. As a result of this study, these fabrics, particularly the plain weave fabrics containing 30 percent "Rovana", 50 percent "Verel" and 20 percent rayon, are recommended for home and institutional use...|$|R

Results from the basin modelling support, in general terms, the previous geochemical classification and petroleum families in the region. However, a separate well-defined main kitchen area for the Snorre Field was deduced opposed to the multiple kitchen areas having contributed to the filling as proposed in the literature. Our conclusions are based on the quantitative evaluation of the different proposed kitchen areas and the timing and extent of petroleum generation. Modelling of petroleum generation was performed using asphaltene kinetics determined on petroleum asphaltenes from Snorre oils.

The flexural properties and impact resistance showed lower values as the apparent density decreased, but constant specific properties. The fracture characterization {{was carried out by}} determining the Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) at low strain rate, as well as the fracture toughness (KIc) at impact loading. Foamed specimens presented higher values of CTOD than the solid ones and higher as the foaming ratio increases, due to cells acting as crack arrestors by blunting the crack tip.
