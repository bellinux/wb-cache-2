Taunton, in spite of Massey's efforts to keep the field, was again besieged. In Wilts and Dorset, numerous bands of Clubmen were on foot, which the King's officers were <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> to turn into troops for their master. But the process of collecting a fresh royal army was slow, and Goring and his subordinate, Sir Richard Grenville, were alienating the King's most devoted adherents by their rapacity, cruelty and debauchery.|$|E

The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer's Wistful Vista Development Company, with lottery ticket #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes (like digging an oil well in the back yard), antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends {{in and out of the}} quiet home, Fibber McGee and Molly built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of that audience in 1940, they rarely let go of it.|$|E

25|$|Slavery is {{more common}} when the labour done is {{relatively}} simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop. It {{is much more difficult}} and costly to check that slaves are <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.|$|E

Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [...] upstate New York, but later returned to {{the city in the}} mid-1990s to advocate for homeless members of the gay community. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: [...] "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now." [...] "It was horrible.

2500|$|In 1961 {{this view}} of {{appeasement}} as avoidable error and cowardice was set on its head by A.J.P. Taylor in his book The Origins of the Second World War.

Appeasement was an active policy, and not a passive one; allowing Hitler to consolidate was a policy implemented by [...] "men confronted with real problems, <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> in the circumstances of their time".

2500|$|Though {{informed}} by issues of recent national importance, the two-sided political culture of Norwich in the 1790s cannot be totally disconnected from local tradition. Two features {{stand out from}} a political continuum of three centuries. The first is the dichotomous power balance. From at least {{the time of the}} Reformation, there is a record of Norwich as a [...] "two-party city". In the mid-16th century the weaving parishes actually fell under the control of opposition forces, as Kett's rebels held the north of the river, in support of poor cloth workers. Secondly, {{there seems to be a}} case for saying that with this tradition of two-sided disputation, the city had over a long period of time developed an infrastructure, evident in her many cultural and institutional networks of politics, religion, society, news media and the arts, whereby argument could be managed short of outright confrontation. Indeed at a time of hunger and tension on the Norwich streets, with the alehouse crowds ready to have [...] "a Minister's head brought to the block", the Anglican and Dissenting clergy were <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> to conduct a collegiate dialogue, seeking common ground, and reinforcing the same well-mannered civic tradition of consensus as that illustrated by historians of earlier periods.|$|E
