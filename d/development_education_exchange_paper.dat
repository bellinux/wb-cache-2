It develops a critique of the conception of economic inclusion, by means of an exploration of linguistic inclusion and the notion of ‘disability’. ‘Inclusion in a Polarised World’.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the <b>development</b> <b>education</b> and <b>exchange</b> {{activities of the}} Dutch development organization Edukans with its longstanding experience in the “Going Global” program among secondary schools in The Netherlands. Based on a survey with 186 direct participants in the foreign exchange program and 608 schoolmates at 126 secondary schools, a detailed analysis is made of differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with respect to international cooperation, and tolerance regarding ethnic minorities. To guarantee unbiased impact assessment, the same data is collected among 276 students of a comparison group. Propensity score-matching techniques are used for data analysis, controlling for intrinsic differences among the three groups. Results show that international exchange programs have a significant positive impact on all four dimensions of societal support of the direct participants compared to their schoolmates. Only knowledge and attitudes changes are registered in the scores of the schoolmates compared to the comparison group. These outcomes remain robust when corrected for individual and school characteristics, parental background, and political preferences, and when unobserved heterogeneity is included...|$|R

The Higher <b>Education</b> <b>Exchange</b> is founded on a thought articulated by Thomas Jefferson in 1820 : "I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is {{not to take it}} from them, but to inform their discretion by education. " In the tradition of Jefferson, the Higher <b>Education</b> <b>Exchange</b> agrees that a central goal of higher education is to help make democracy possible by preparing citizens for public life. The Higher <b>Education</b> <b>Exchange</b> is part of a movement to strengthen higher education's democratic mission and foster a more democratic culture throughout American society.

We map the current <b>development</b> <b>education</b> activities and networks evident in the participating Irish post-primary schools and identify the key obstacles, opportunities and supports for <b>development</b> <b>education,</b> before discussing the broader implications for the sector. We highlight how institutional and cultural levels of support are key to ensuring that <b>development</b> <b>education</b> becomes an ‘organic…part of the culture of the school’. Other approaches to <b>development</b> <b>education</b> include an individualised model that tends to dilute power and focus on the commitment of individual teachers and students. The cross-curricular nature of <b>development</b> <b>education</b> poses particular challenges and opportunities in the current structure of the post-primary curriculum, examinations system, ownership structures, broader educational system and society. This research provides strategic insights about where extensive and intensive <b>development</b> <b>education</b> integration in schools is happening and where it is less visible or struggling for visibility.

40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} in two Parts. Part One {{consists}} of Chapters One to Four. Chapter One establishes {{a definition of}} the term 'Development Education' as it will be used in this thesis. Chapter Two is a comparative analysis of the socio-political contexts within which <b>Development</b> <b>Education</b> is normally created, and introduced into schools. Chapter Three analyzes the social context of Japan and notes the emergence of <b>Development</b> <b>Education</b> in the 1980 s. Chapter Four contrasts governmental intervention in the introduction of <b>Development</b> <b>Education</b> in some countries with the absence of such intervention in Japan. Part Two consists of Chapters Five to Nine. Chapter Five moves the focus to <b>Development</b> <b>Education</b> in the Japanese school system and examines the lack of progress in inserting <b>Development</b> <b>Education</b> into the Japanese national curriculum. Chapter Six contrasts this situation with the example of Life Environment Studies, which were introduced into the postwar Japanese curriculum. In Chapter Seven, the thesis reviews four small scale experiments with <b>Development</b> <b>Education</b> in schools in Japan and Chapter Eight asks why, with the same National Curriculum, <b>Development</b> <b>Education</b> was introduced in these schools and not in others. Finally, Chapter Nine summarizes and concludes the thesis. Thus within the two Parts of the thesis, there are three main themes. The first theme is a comparative investigation of the socio-economic and political contexts which increase the possibilities for the introduction of <b>Development</b> <b>Education</b> in schools. The comparative investigation includes Japan. The second theme is concerned with the difficulties of changing school curriculum in Japan itself. The third theme is the investigation of the micro-politics at school level which may make possible the introduction of <b>Development</b> <b>Education</b> in Japanese schools...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{introduce}} the concept of <b>development</b> <b>education</b> and find out whether non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can help nursery schools in implementing it. The aim of the empirical part {{is to find out}} which problems face teachers from nursery schools during the implementation of <b>development</b> <b>education</b> and which concrete steps would help them to improve their cooperation with NGOs. Since the <b>development</b> <b>education</b> is a new term in Czech Republic, my aim was to find out how it is being perceived by teachers. <b>Development</b> <b>education</b> touches topics that are being paid much more attention these days such as world trade, globalization, climatic changes, development countries, poverty and humanitarian aid. <b>Development</b> <b>education</b> can get into nursery schools thanks to school law from 2004, which brings more freedom to schools in preparation of their own educational programs. During this preparation, professionals from other than educational background can be involved. This way NGOs can provide their experiences from development countries. According to the teachers, the biggest problem in implementing the <b>development</b> <b>education</b> is a poor knowledge of the <b>development</b> <b>education</b> itself, absence of utilities and methodical materials. On this level, NGOs are able to help the teachers in terms of [...] ...|$|R

Â Boyer s re-imagination of scholarships re-connects research to an ecology of practice comprising engagement, inter-disciplinary collaboration and teaching. Â However, engagement is not necessarily synonymous with compliance. Â  The situation of public higher education is discussed and the chapter concludes with some reflections about global visions of research and the particular relevance of critical, defiant, humanistic and rights-based versions of <b>development</b> <b>education</b> for a sector facing into globalisation, crisis and the pressures of relentless reform.
