2500|$|The {{formation}} of a purely military postal department has been a tried {{for the first time}} in this war. It has been very successful ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> pleasure in bringing to the notice of the Secretary of State the admirable manner in which the Post Office Corps discharged its duties in Egypt ... Their services have been so valuable that I hope a similar corps may be employed on any future occasion.|$|E
2500|$|Burke {{supported}} {{the war against}} revolutionary France, seeing Britain as fighting {{on the side of}} the royalists and émigres in a civil war, rather than fighting against the whole nation of France. Burke also {{supported the}} royalist uprising in La Vendée, describing it on 4 November 1793 in a letter to William Windham, as [...] "the sole affair <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> heart in". Burke wrote to Henry Dundas on 7 October urging him to send reinforcements there, as he viewed it as the only theatre in the war that might lead to a march on Paris. Dundas did not follow Burke's advice, however.|$|E
2500|$|Moore soon {{moved to}} the {{district}} attorney's office, working as the first full-time prosecutor in Etowah County. During his tenure there, Moore was investigated by the state bar for [...] "suspect conduct" [...] after convening a grand jury to examine what he perceived to have been funding shortages in the sheriff's office. Several weeks after the state bar investigation was dismissed as unfounded, Moore quit his prosecuting position to run as a Democrat for the county's circuit-court judge seat in 1982. The election was bitter, with Moore alleging that cases were being delayed in exchange for payoffs. The allegations were never substantiated, and Moore overwhelmingly lost the Democratic runoff primary to fellow attorney Donald Stewart, whom Moore described as [...] "an honorable man for whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> respect, and he eventually became a close friend." [...] A second bar complaint against Moore followed, and though this too was dismissed as unfounded, Moore left Gadsden shortly thereafter.|$|E

2500|$|The Three Bees, {{commanded}} by Captn. John Wallis, {{arrived on the}} 6th inst. with two hundred and ten male Convicts, out of 219 originally embarked, the other nine having died on the passage; and out of those landed, it has been necessary to Send fifty five to the Hospital many of them being much affected with Scurvy and others labouring under various complaints. On enquiring into {{the cause of this}} mortality and sickness, it appeared that many of them had been embarked in a bad state of health, and not a few infirm from lameness and old age. I am happy in being enabled to state that the Convicts by the Catherine and the Three Bees have, without a Single Exception, borne grateful Testimony to their having been treated with the most unremitting care, Attention, and kindness, by the Masters and Surgeons of those Vessels, from the day of their Embarkation until they were finally landed here. The circumstance of several of those unfortunate men being embarked in a diseased or feeble State will, I trust, shew the necessity for greater attention being paid to the state of the Health of the Convicts, who are to be embarked in future, which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> reason to believe has not been so fully attended to by the Examining Surgeons as Humanity demands.|$|E
