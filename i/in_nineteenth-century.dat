5|$|Stolen Childhood: Slave Youth <b>in</b> <b>Nineteenth-Century</b> America is a 1995 {{history book}} about nineteenth century slave {{children}} in America by Wilma King. As the first full-length {{book on the}} subject, it began the scholarship of slave childhood. The book uses historical documents to argue that enslaved children were deprived of experiences now understood to constitute childhood, due to early work responsibilities, frequent bodily and emotional trauma, and separations from family. The book covers themes of the children's education, leisure, religion, transitions to freedmen, and work expectations. It {{was published in the}} Indiana University Press's Blacks in the Diaspora series, and a revised edition was released in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Tipu's Tiger was {{originally}} made for Tipu Sultan (also {{referred to as}} Tippoo Saib, Tippoo Sultan and other epithets <b>in</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> literature) in the Kingdom of Mysore (today in the Indian state of Karnataka) around 1795. Tipu Sultan used the tiger systematically as his emblem, employing tiger motifs on his weapons, on the uniforms of his soldiers, and on the decoration of his palaces. His throne rested upon a probably similar life-size wooden tiger, covered in gold; like other valuable treasures it was broken up for the highly organised prize fund shared out between the British army.|$|E
5|$|Pickingill {{was brought}} to wider public {{attention}} in the early 1960s by the folklorist Eric Maple. As part of his research into beliefs regarding folk magic and witchcraft <b>in</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> Essex, Maple had interviewed a number of Canewdon residents and collected their stories about Pickingill and {{his reputation as a}} cunning man. According to their accounts, Pickingill attracted visitors from around Essex seeking his magical help, for which he did not charge. They attributed to him the power to control animals, to command imps to do his bidding, and to wield power over either six or nine malevolent witches who lived in Canewdon. It was also claimed {{that he was able to}} coerce assistance and beer from local residents by threatening to place a curse upon them or their belongings. Although it has been suggested that local people were inventing claims to please Maple, many of which were based on older tales regarding the Essex cunning man James Murrell, subsequent research by historian Ronald Hutton has confirmed aspects of the folklorist's original accounts.|$|E
