40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} {{synthesis}} of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) by Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization using the bio-derived ‘green’ solvent 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran (2 -MeTHF). Using a standard flask-based reaction, the molecular weight distribution, regioregularity and product yield {{were found to be}} similar to those obtained under equivalent conditions using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a reaction solvent. The synthesis was subsequently adapted to a novel “tube-in-shell” droplet-based flow reactor, using a newly developed high-solubility catalyst derived from nickel(II) <b>bromide</b> <b>ethylene</b> glycol dimethyl ether complex (Ni(dme) Br 2) and 1, 3 -bis(diphenylphosphino) propane (dppp). Use of the new catalyst together with an increased reaction temperature of 65 °C (enabled by the higher boiling point of 2 -MeTHF) resulted in an approximate four-fold increase in reaction rate compared to a standard THF-based synthesis at 55 °C, with full conversion reached within one minute. The purified flow-synthesized polymer had an Mw of 46 kgmol− 1, a low PDI of 1. 4, and a regioregularity of 93 %, indicating the suitability of flow-based GRIM polymerization in 2 -MeTHF for the high-throughput synthesis of high quality P 3 HT...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPolyoxidonium (PO) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an effective, safe immunomodulator with a marked immuno-stimulating activity suitable for the complex treatment of both acute and chronic infections in humans. The PO contains high-polymeric units of 100 kDa based on both N-oxide 1, 4 - ethylene piperazine and (N-carboxyethyl-) 1, 4 <b>ethylene</b> piperazine <b>bromide.</b> Recently, PO has been licensed for human use in the new Russian trivalent polymeric subunit flu vaccine “Grippol. ” This will open a possibility of using the PO {{for the development of}} vaccines against other infectious diseases. Here we studied the potency of the PO in eliciting the humoral immune response to specific antigens of Chlamydia spp. (C 1 and C 2) and Yersinia pestis (Pla, LcrV, and YopM) in comparison with the Freund's complete (FCA) and Titermax (TMC) adjuvants. The Balb/c mice were primed with a single intraperitoneal injection of the 10 - 20 μg of antigen mixed 1 : 1 with either adjuvant and boosted 3 times with the same antigen alone. We found at least 8 - to 16 -fold and 4 - to 8 -fold increases in IgG titers to Chlamydia and Yersinia antigens, respectively, after injections of the antigens with the PO in relation {{to the use of the}} either FCA or TMC. The PO was found to be absolutely safe for animal health, since there were no visible adverse reactions at the inoculation site characteristic of those seen with the other adjuvants, in particular FCA. Thus, the PO could be the adjuvant of choice to elicit a strong immune response to the major antigens of Chlamydia and Yersinia, suggesting the possibility of its use in developing bi- and tri-valent subunit vaccines with enhanced immunity. The exact mechanism of priming the immune response by the PO is under investigation...|$|R
40|$|The cross {{coupling}} of 1 -bromopropene {{with a variety}} of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkylmagnesium bro-mides can be effected with an iron(1) catalyst derived from tris(dibenzoylrnethido) iron(III). A detailed study with ethylmagnesium bromide reveals the presence of ethane, <b>ethylene,</b> propylene, propenylmagnesium <b>bromide,</b> and 2, 4 -hexadiene as side products formed in addition to 2 -pentene. The quantities of these products are shown to be in agreement with those expected for a complete material balance and electron balance in the catalytic process. 2 -Pentene is formed stereospecifically from either (Z) - or (E) - 1 -bromopropene, as is the 2, 4 -hexadiene side prod-uct. Isotopic labeling of the ethyl group shows that ethane, ethylene, and propylene are formed by disproportiona-tion of ethylmagnesium bromide and l-bromopropene. A mechanism which accommodates all the products as well as the stereochemical and labeling results is proposed, in which the oxidative addition of 1 -bromopropene to iron(1) is rate limiting and stereospecific. The propenyliron(II 1) intermediate subsequently undergoes metatheti-cal exchange with the Grignard reagent and finally reductive elimination of the cross coupled product to regener-ate the iron(I) species. Side reactions are considered to proceed from organoiron(II 1) intermediates by multiple exchanges and reductive disproportionations. Grignard reagents are cross coupled stereospecifically with alkenyl halides such as I-bromopropene in the pres...|$|R
40|$|Background: International {{phytosanitary}} standards ISPM 15 require (since 2007) fumigation or {{heat treatment}} for shipping and storage. Those dealing with fumigated freight might be accidentally exposed. In this paper we report {{a series of}} three accidents of six storage room workers in a medium sized company regularly importing electronic production parts from abroad. Methods: Patients (n[*]=[*] 6, aged from 32 – 54 yrs.) and control group (n[*]=[*] 30, mean 40 yrs.) donated blood and urine samples. The fumigants: <b>ethylene</b> oxide, methyl <b>bromide,</b> chloropicrin, <b>ethylene</b> dichloride, other halo-alkanes and solvents were analyzed by headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS). For the quantitation of long term exposure/s, macromolecular reaction products (hemoglobin adducts) were used (with GCMS) as molecular dosimeter; additionally 8 -OHdG and circulating mtDNA (cmtDNA) were analyzed as nonspecific biological effect markers. Results: The hemoglobin adducts N-methyl valine (MEV) and N-(2 -hydroxy ethyl) valine (HEV) were elevated after exposure to the alkylating chemicals methyl <b>bromide</b> and <b>ethylene</b> oxide. Under the consideration of known elimination kinetics and the individual smoking status (biomonitored with nicotine metabolite cotinine and tobacco specific hemoglobin adduct: N-(2 cyan ethyl) valines, CEV), the data allow theoretical extrapolation to the initial protein adduct concentrations {{at the time of the}} accident (the MEV/CEV levels were from 1, 616 pmol/g globin to 1, 880 pmol/g globin and HEV/CEV levels from 1, 407 pmol/g globin to 5, 049 pmol/g globin, and correlated with inhaled 0. 4 - 1. 5 ppm ethylene oxide. These integrated, extrapolated internal doses, calculated on the basis of biological exposure equivalents, confirmed the clinical diagnosis for three patients, showing severe intoxication symptoms. Both, cmtDNA and 8 -OHdG, as non-specific biomarkers of toxic effects, were elevated in four patients. Conclusion: The cases reported here, stress the importance of a suitable risk assessment and control measures. We put emphasis on the necessity of human biomonitoring guidelines and the urgency for the relevant limit values...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ethylene</b> <b>bromide,</b> {{obtained}} by addition of bromine to ethylene, was once of commercial significance {{as a component}} of leaded gasoline. It was also a popular fumigant in agriculture, displacing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane ("DBCB"). Both applications are declining owing to environmental and health considerations. Methyl bromide is also an effective fumigant, but its production and use are controlled by the Montreal Protocol. Growing in use are organobromine biocides used in water treatment. Representative agents include bromoform and dibromodimethylhydantoin (“DBDMH”). [...] Some herbicides, such as bromoxynil, contain also bromine moieties. Like other halogenated pesticides, bromoxynil is subject to reductive dehalogenation under anaerobic conditions, and can be debrominated by organisms originally isolated for their ability to reductively dechlorinate phenolic compounds.|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} behavior of 1, 2 -bis-(2, 4, 6 -tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE) widely used as flame retardant plastics additive was studied by HRTG and differential scanning calorimetries.

It was found that BTBPE mostly evaporates at 240 °C. The decomposition products at 340 °C depend on rate of their removal from the hot reaction zone. Main primary decomposition products found in case of rapid removal are tribromophenol and vinyl tribromophenyl ether. Whereas, prolonged contact with heating zone also produces hydrogen bromide, <b>ethylene</b> <b>bromide,</b> polybrominated vinyl phenyl ethers and diphenyl ethers, and dibenzodioxins.
