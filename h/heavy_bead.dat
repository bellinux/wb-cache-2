50|$|Tiger {{tail wire}} (also simply called tiger tail or tiger-tail) {{is a kind}} of thin wire encased in nylon often used in beaded jewellery, and that is {{particularly}} suited to stringing <b>heavy</b> <b>beads</b> and sharp beads, which tend to fray other kinds of thread. For this reason, tiger tail is the thread of choice for gemstones. Some tiger tail has multiple intertwined wire threads under the nylon coating. The wire threads are made of stainless steel. Tiger tail cannot be fashioned into a knot in order to end a sequence of beads as other kinds of thread can, therefore crimp beads are often used for this purpose instead. Crimp beads are also used as spacers between other beads strung on tiger tail. Among the types of wire used for bead stringing, tiger tail is the most common. Tiger tail is easier to use than many other kinds of thread, and it does not require the use of a sewing needle. Tiger tail has high ultimate tensile strength and is therefore extremely difficult to tear, but if it is creased or twisted, tiger tail has a tendency to kink and then become brittle in the kinked area.|$|R
40|$|Granular convection/separation {{of single}} and binary {{component}} particles are studied {{in a narrow}} vibration bed, respectively.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the {{observation}} of the periodic pattern occuring in a two-dimensional (2 D) assembly of <b>heavy</b> <b>beads</b> (of diameter D = 280 - 630  μm) immersed in water when the vessel containing the fluid and the beads is submitted to horizontal vibrations (of frequency f and oscillation amplitude A). Under vibrations, regularly spaced, one bead thick lines perpendicular to the direction of vibrations are formed at small surface fraction. In the ranges f = 10 - 20  Hz and A = 0. 7 - 3. 5  mm, the amplitude of the oscillatory motion of the beads relative to the fluid B is found to vary linearly with A. A simple phenomenological model based on dynamic solid friction and viscous drag gives qualitatively account for this linear dependence. The period of the pattern λ is found to vary with viscosity v, ω = 2 πf, D, and B {{according to the law}} λ/D ∼ (B/D) 0. 5 (BωD/v) − 0. 21.

40|$|Parameter {{inference}} is {{a fundamental}} problem in data-driven modeling. Given observed data that {{is believed to be}} a realization of some parameterized model, the aim is to find parameter values that are able to explain the observed data. In many situations, the dominant sources of uncertainty must be included into the model for making reliable predictions. This naturally leads to stochastic models. Stochastic models render parameter inference much harder, as the aim then is to find a distribution of likely parameter values. In Bayesian statistics, which is a consistent framework for data-driven learning, this so-called posterior distribution {{can be used to make}} probabilistic predictions. We propose a novel, exact, and very efficient approach for generating posterior parameter distributions for stochastic differential equation models calibrated to measured time series. The algorithm is inspired by reinterpreting the posterior distribution as a statistical mechanics partition function of an object akin to a polymer, where the measurements are mapped on <b>heavier</b> <b>beads</b> compared to those of the simulated data. To arrive at distribution samples, we employ a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approach combined with a multiple time-scale integration. A separation of time scales naturally arises if either the number of measurement points or the number of simulation points becomes large. Furthermore, at least for one-dimensional problems, we can decouple the harmonic modes between measurement points and solve the fastest part of their dynamics analytically. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of inference problems and is highly parallelizable...|$|R

40|$|If a long {{chain is}} held in a pot {{elevated}} a distance h_ 1 above the floor, {{and the end of}} the chain is then dragged over the rim of the pot and released, the chain flows under gravity down into a pile on the floor. Not only does the chain flow out of the pot, it also leaps above the pot in a "chain-fountain". I predict and observe that if the pot is held at an angle to the vertical the steady state shape of the fountain is an inverted catenary, and discuss how to apply boundary conditions to this solution. In the case of a level pot, the fountain shape is completely vertical. In this case I predict and observe both how fast the fountain grows to its steady state hight, and how it grows quadratically in time if there is no floor. The fountain is driven by an anomalous push force from the pot that acts on the link of chain about to come into motion. I confirm this by designing two new chains, one consisting of hollow cylinders threaded on a string and one consisting of <b>heavy</b> <b>beads</b> separated by long flexible threads. The former is predicted to produce a pot-push and hence a fountain, while the latter will not. I confirm these predictions experimentally.

40|$|In a half-filled {{rotating}} drum, {{the size}} {{segregation of particles}} of equal density builds a ring pattern of the large particles, whose location continuously varies from the periphery to the center {{depending on the size}} ratio between particles [Thomas, Phys. Rev. E 62, 1 (2000) 961 - 974]. For small size ratios (typically 15) : large beads are close to the bottom in a reversing position. The existence of circles with an intermediate radius shows that the segregation at an intermediate level within a flow is possible. In this paper, we experimentally study the segregation of particles of different densities and sizes in a half-filled rotating drum and other devices (chute flow, pile). In the drum, the location of the segregated ring continuously varies from the periphery to the center and is very sensitive to both the size (from 1 to 33) and density (from 0. 36 to 4. 8) ratios. The densest large beads segregate on a circle close to the center, the lightest large beads on a circle close to the periphery. Consequently, we found that for any tracer, its excess of mass, due to only a size excess, a density excess, or both, leads to a deep inside segregation of the tracer. There is a push-away process that makes <b>heavy</b> <b>beads</b> of any type go downwards, while the excess of size is already known to push large beads towards the surface, by a dynamical sieving process. Each segregation at an intermediate ring corresponds to a balance between these mass and geometrical effects. The segregation level in the flow is determined by the ratio of the intensities of both effects. Comment: submitted to Physical Review E (february 2004...|$|R

The deposition rates, as simulated by the model, match the observation within E 30 % of accuracy, with E being the root-mean-square error normalized by the peak value on the deposition swath.

Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) with <b>heavier</b> polystyrene-ferrite <b>beads</b> is performed to simulate particle transport. Contrary to recent literature, in which the presence of mucus was deemed necessary to maintain periciliary liquid (PCL) transport, effective particle and fluid transport was measured in our experiments in the absence of mucus. In response to muscarine or ATP stimulation, maximum fluid transport rates of 250 μm/s at 15 μm distance to the tracheal epithelia were measured while bead transport rates over the epithelia surfaces reached 200 μm/s. We estimated that the mean bead transport is dominated by viscous drag compared to inertial fluid forces. Furthermore, mean bead transport velocities appear to be two orders of magnitude larger compared to bead sedimentation velocities.

50|$|To reduce both air {{resistance}} and rolling resistance on the road, tires are lightweight, narrow, {{and have a}} thin, smooth tread. They are inflated to a high pressure, typically around 8 bar (820kPa/120psi); track racing tires can be inflated up to circa 14 bar. Until recently, most racing bikes used tubular tires which have no beads: they are sewn around the tube and glued to the rim. These tires provide an advantage in weight (lacking the relatively <b>heavy</b> wire <b>bead),</b> rolling resistance, grip and pinch flat protection, but their greatest advantage lies {{in the ability to}} use a very lightweight simple box-section rim, rather than the U-shaped clincher rim. A U-shaped clincher rim must be made of relatively heavier gauge material to prevent the tire pressure from spreading the inherently weak U shape and allowing the tire to come off the rim. Advances in tire technology, however, have seen the far more practical (due to greater ease of changeability) clincher (beaded) tire close the gap.Some manufacturers create tubular-clincher tires, where the tires are sewn around the tubes and have a bead, but there is some debate as to the effectiveness of a tubular-clincher tire. Proponents believe that it has all the advantages of a tubular tire made to fit a clincher rim, but critics argue that the design includes disadvantages inherent to both systems---the rim weight is still high, the tire is more expensive than a standard clincher tire, and repairing a puncture on a tubular clincher is as inconvenient as it is with a standard tubular tire. However, a particular benefit of the tubular-clincher design is that the risk of pinch flats is very low (like the tubular tire), yet it allows the use of the more popular clincher wheel.|$|R
