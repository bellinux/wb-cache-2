According to Operabase, a total of 316 performances of 58 productions in 44 cities have been given since January 2013 or are planned to be given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two.

500|$|The show's {{executive}} producer Oliver Kent and series producer Erika Hossington began planning the thirtieth anniversary episode in 2014. Hossington {{said in an}} interview with Digital Spy that they wanted to do [...] "something only Casualty could do", and that there will be [...] "an absolutely massive stunt" [...] which will see the hospital itself in jeopardy too. The episode itself was to originally last for 110-minutes, however this was later shortened to 99-minutes. In addition to this, it was also reported that the events which took take place in the thirtieth anniversary episode would set up to two years of new storylines. Kent stated that [...] "a lot of storylines kicked off in this episode will deliver <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two, and probably beyond." [...] A special soundtrack was recorded by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales for the episode at BBC Hoddinott Hall in Cardiff Bay.|$|E
500|$|Usage of [...] "truthiness" [...] {{continued}} to proliferate in media, politics, and public consciousness. On January 5, 2006, etymology professor Anatoly Liberman began an hour-long program on public radio by discussing truthiness and predicting {{that it would}} be included in dictionaries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two. His prediction seemed to be on track when, the next day, the American Dialect Society announced that [...] "truthiness" [...] was its 2005 Word of the Year, and the website of the Macmillan English Dictionary featured truthiness as its Word of the Week a few weeks later. Truthiness was also selected by The New York Times as one of nine words that captured the spirit of 2005. Global Language Monitor, which tracks trends in languages, named truthiness the top television buzzword of 2006, and another term Colbert coined with reference to truthiness, wikiality, as another of the top ten television buzzwords of 2006, the first time two words from the same show have made the list.|$|E

6000|$|Then, again, {{the order}} of the Cephalopods, to which belong the cuttle-fish and the octopus (sacred to Victor Hugo), may be, for all we can say to the contrary, an order with a future. Their kindred, the Gastropods, have, {{in the case of the}} snail and slug, learnt the trick of air-breathing. And not improbably there are even now genera of this order that have escaped the naturalist, or even {{well-known}} genera whose possibilities in growth and dietary are still unknown. Suppose some day a specimen of a new species is caught off the coast of Kent. It excites remark at a Royal Society soirée, engenders a Science Note or so, [...] "A Huge Octopus!" [...] and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> so three or four other specimens come to hand, and the thing becomes familiar. [...] "Probably a new and larger variety of Octopus so-and-so, hitherto supposed to be tropical," [...] says Professor Gargoyle, and thinks he has disposed of it. Then conceive some mysterious boating accidents and deaths while bathing. A large animal of this kind coming into a region of frequent wrecks might so easily acquire a preferential taste for human nutriment, just as the Colorado beetle acquired a new taste for the common potato and gave up its old food-plants some years ago. Then perhaps a school or pack or flock of Octopus gigas would be found busy picking the sailors off a stranded ship, and then in the course of a few score years it might begin to stroll up the beaches and batten on excursionists. Soon it would be a common feature of the watering-places--possibly at last commoner than excursionists. Suppose such a creature were to appear--and it is, we repeat, a possibility, if perhaps a remote one--how could it be fought against? Something might be done by torpedoes; but, so far as our past knowledge goes, man has no means of seriously diminishing the numbers of any animal of the most rudimentary intelligence that made its fastness in the sea.|$|E
