5|$|Although Beato was {{previously}} {{believed to have}} died in Rangoon or Mandalay in 1905 or 1906, his death certificate, discovered in 2009, <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died on 29 January 1909 in Florence, Italy.|$|E
5|$|A death {{certificate}} discovered in 2009 shows that Beato {{was born in}} Venice in 1832 and died on 29 January 1909 in Florence. The {{death certificate}} also <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a British subject and a bachelor. It is likely that early in his life Beato and {{his family moved to}} Corfu, at the time part of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands, and so Beato was a British subject.|$|E
5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902 and passed through the hands {{of at least two}} owners before coming to Sunnybank.

5|$|MacMillan {{stayed out}} of the matter; he did not attend {{meetings}} of the TSO board and maintained a public silence through {{the spring and summer of}} 1952. According to TSO archivist Warren, MacMillan's correspondence <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> supported the board's decision not to rehire the six musicians.|$|E
5|$|Before {{going to}} London Grainger had {{composed}} numerous Kipling settings, {{and his first}} mature orchestral pieces. In London, when he found time he continued to compose; a letter to Balfour Gardiner dated 21 July 1901 <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was working on his Marching Song of Democracy (a Walt Whitman setting), and had made good progress with the experimental works Train Music and Charging Irishrey. In his early London years he also composed Hill Song Number 1 (1902), an instrumental piece much admired by Busoni.|$|E

A {{biography}} of No <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had four years' training when he arrived. Rozinsky and Walsh would have held 1st dan ranking in the 1960s. Both Rhee (KTA) and Yun (ITF) {{would have been}} in the middle dan ranks and held the title of 'Master' when they arrived, as they were sent to Australia by their respective Korean governing bodies.|$|E

5|$|In 1885 Farsari had a daughter, Kiku, by a Japanese {{woman whom}} {{he may not}} have married. He {{described}} himself as living like a misanthrope, associating with very few people outside of business, and his correspondence <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> increasingly hoped to return to Italy. He tried to regain the Italian citizenship lost when he emigrated to the United States, and he even hoped to be made a cavaliere and thereby join the Italian aristocracy. His success in these endeavours is not clear. Nevertheless, in April 1890 he and his daughter left Japan for Italy. On 7 February 1898 Farsari died in his family home in Vicenza.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala City, Guatemalan trafficker Efrain Ortiz {{is shown}} being arrested, {{and the film}} <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was later given a prison {{sentence}} of 95 years. Ortiz had two sons he had been using for waste collection and five daughters he had been committing incest with. Bilheimer accompanies IJM representatives Pablo Villeda, Amy Roth, and Gary Haugen as they and the local police arrest Ortiz; he is charged with exploitation of children and violence against women. Ortiz looks surprised as he is handcuffed. Haugen, President of IJM, went on to be named a Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Hero in the 2012 US DoS TIP Report.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{was born}} in a village in Auranitis, part of the {{district}} of Trachonitis, east of the Sea of Galilee in Palestine. Philip renamed the village Philippopolis (the modern al-Shahbā', Syria) during his reign as emperor. He was one of only three Easterners to be made emperor before the decisive separation of East and West in 395. (The other two were Elagabalus and Alexander Severus). Even among Easterners Philip was atypical, as he was an Arab, not a Greek. His father was Julius Marinus; nothing besides his name is known, but the name <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> held Roman citizenship and that he must have been prominent in his community.|$|E

5|$|Ragnall disappears from record {{after he}} and his sons were {{defeated}} by his brother Áengus. Ragnall's death-date is unknown, although certain dates between 1191 and 1227 are all possibilities. Surviving contemporary sources reveal that Ragnall was a significant patron of the Church. Although his father appears to have aligned himself with traditional forms of Christianity, Ragnall himself is associated with newer reformed religious orders from the continent. Ragnall's now non-existent seal, which pictured a knight on horseback, also <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> attempted to present himself as an up-to-date ruler, not unlike his Anglo-French contemporaries of the bordering Kingdom of Scots.|$|E
5|$|William faced several {{challenges}} on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: the evidence <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was either {{seven or eight}} years old at the time. He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as the king of France, Henry I, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and conditions in Normandy quickly descended into chaos.|$|E
5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, which <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was at least aware of the plot. Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva, but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian, {{it would have been}} less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder. On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.|$|E

5|$|Being ambitious, Grill {{aimed for}} the higher {{positions}} in the SOIC, and to achieve {{that he had to}} learn more and gain more experience. So when he returned to Sweden from China, he decided to go abroad again as soon as possible. He started out at the trading office of Kristian Holm, Swedish consul to France, in Montpellier where he worked for about six months. He stayed in France for five years, and in 1758, he was employed by the Mallet & Blancheney firm in Marseille. Grill's letters to his family during those years <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> enjoyed his time in France and was interested in style and his own appearance. His initial plans had been to set up a business in Marseille, but his family, especially his uncle Claes Grill, advised against it. Claes had started out as a merchant in the European market, but he soon moved on to the more lucrative Canton trade and encouraged his nephew to do the same.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 303, {{following}} a series of rebellions in Melitene (Malatya, Turkey) and Syria, a second edict was published, ordering the arrest and imprisonment of all bishops and priests. In the judgment of historian Roger Rees, there was no logical necessity for this second edict; that Diocletian issued one <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was either unaware the first edict was being carried out, or that {{he felt it was}} not working as quickly as he needed it to. Following the publication of the second edict, prisons began to fillthe underdeveloped prison system of the time could not handle the deacons, lectors, priests, bishops, and exorcists forced upon it. Eusebius writes that the edict netted so many priests that ordinary criminals were crowded out, and had to be released.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1907, Kafka {{was hired}} at the , an {{insurance}} company, {{where he worked}} for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00—making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing {{when he joined the}} Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor work safety policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with machine lathes, drills, planing machines and rotary saws which were rarely fitted with safety guards.|$|E

5|$|Pleydell's father, William, {{had been}} given a 95-year lease of the Midgehall estate in Lydiard Tregoze by the Abbott of Stanley Abbey in 1534. A 1545 record, {{ordering}} Gabriel to pay 26 shillings and 8 pence in benevolence to the crown under King Henry VIII, <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was soon managing Midgehall's financial affairs. His father entrusted him in 1549 with tenancy of the manor house at West Ilsley, Berkshire and in September 1553 a sublease of the Midgehall estate. William died in 1555, leaving Midgehall's full lease to his wife, Agnes. When she died in 1567, Gabriel unsuccessfully challenged his mother's will (an action which estranged his younger brother, John) despite inheriting tenancy of the estate. Pleydell's father originally intended two of his elder sons—Virgil and Tobias—to succeed ownership before Gabriel. Virgil died around 1559 and by 1567 Tobias had been resident in Chipping Faringdon for 11 years, prompting him to relinquish his inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus was {{receptive}} to Cleonymus' appeals to install {{him on the}} Spartan throne and agreed to assist him. To achieve this, the Epiriote King assembled an army numbering of 27,000 men. It consisted 25,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and was supplemented by 24 war elephants. The size of Pyrrhus' expedition <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> viewed aiding Cleonymus {{as an opportunity to}} extend his hegemony into the Peloponnese and securing Sparta as an ally. An alternate theory is that Pyrrhus undertook his invasion of the Peloponnese as a means of cutting off any support that Antigonus was still receiving from the southern Greek poleis. After mustering his force, Pyrrhus marched south through central Greece and through to the Peloponnese. N. G. L. Hammond speculates that Pyrrhus' army marched down to Pleuron on the Aetolian side of the Gulf of Corinth and crossed from there into the Peloponnese. This suggests that the invasion was facilitated by the Aetolian League, a power confederate in Central Greece, which was hostile to Antigonus.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's {{dwarfism}} {{is depicted}} realistically in the sculpture. It portrays {{him with a}} large head but small arms and legs. This possibly <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short arms and legs. Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E
