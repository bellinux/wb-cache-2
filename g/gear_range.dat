25|$|The {{overlapping}} ranges with {{derailleur gears}} mean that 24 or 27 speed derailleur gears may {{only have the}} same total <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> as a (much more expensive) Rohloff 14-speed hub gear. Internal hub geared bikes typically have a more restricted <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> than comparable derailleur-equipped bikes, and have fewer ratios within that range.|$|E
25|$|The SRAM DualDrive {{system uses}} a {{standard}} 8 or 9-speed cogset {{mounted on a}} three-speed internally geared hub, offering a similar <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> to a bicycle with a cogset and triple chainrings.|$|E
25|$|Less {{common is}} the use of a double or triple {{chainring}} in conjunction with an internally geared hub, extending the <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> without having to fit multiple sprockets to the hub. However, this does require a chain tensioner of some sort, negating some of the advantages of hub gears.|$|E

25|$|The {{approximate}} <b>gear</b> <b>ranges</b> which follow {{are merely}} indicative of typical gearing setups, and will vary somewhat from bicycle to bicycle.|$|R
25|$|Racing cyclists {{often have}} gears {{with a small}} {{relative}} difference of around 7% to 10%; this allows fine adjustment of gear ratios to suit the conditions and maintain a consistent pedalling speed. Mountain bikes and hybrid bikes often have gears with a moderate relative difference of around 15%; this allows for a much larger <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> while having an acceptable step between gears. 3-speed hub gears may have a relative difference of some 33% to 37%; such big steps require a very substantial change in pedalling speed and often feel excessive. A step of 7% corresponds to a 1-tooth change from a 14-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket, while a step of 15% corresponds to a 2-tooth change from a 13-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket.|$|E
2500|$|Powertrain {{design was}} reassessed for {{front-wheel-drive}} and this generated {{a foundation for}} which other models were developed. The transaxle is connected inline with the engine, {{and to create a}} simple and compact structure, a single rail system that replaces the three shafts normally used for each <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> with a single shaft, was adopted. In addition, automatic transmission fluid was used for the lubricating oil in order to reduce friction. Existing gasoline S- and diesel C-series engines were converted for use in transverse applications. Initially, the V10 featured the 1.8-liter 1S-LU engine good for [...] and a five-speed manual transmission. From July 1982, four-speed automatic with overdrive became available after starting manufacture the previous month. The 2.0-liter 2S-ELU engine with [...] and four-speed automatic followed in August. August 1983 saw the 1.8-liter 1C-TL turbocharged diesel offered (...) exclusive to Japanese dealerships called Toyota Diesel Store. June 1984 introduced the twin-cam 2.0-liter 3S-GELU engine offered on higher trims with [...] depending on the version. For lower trims, the [...] "Ci" [...] 1.8-liter 1S-iLU arrived. The diesel was upgraded to the 2.0-liter 2C-TL specification in August 1985 (...) [...]|$|E

25|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>ranges</b> {{of almost}} 700% can be {{achieved}} on derailleur setups, though this may result in some rather large steps between gears or some awkward gear changes. However, through the careful choice of chainrings and rear cogsets, e.g. 3 chainrings 48-34-20 and a 10-speed cassette 11-32, one can achieve an extremely wide <b>range</b> of <b>gears</b> that are still well spaced. This sort of setup has proven useful on a multitude of bicycles such as cargo bikes, touring bikes and tandems. Even higher <b>gear</b> <b>ranges</b> {{can be achieved}} by using a 2-speed bottom bracket hub gear in conjunction with suitable derailleurs.|$|R
5000|$|CamelBak {{also makes}} bottles, general purpose backpacks, and some {{specialized}} military and law-enforcement <b>gear,</b> <b>ranging</b> from simple back-worn water reservoirs {{with little to}} no cargo capacity, to large rucksacks with various accessories, even PALS webbing to accommodate MOLLE gear.|$|R

5000|$|Touring {{bicycles}} traditionally use wide-ratio derailleur gears, {{often with}} a very low gear, in some countries called a [...] "granny gear", for steep hills under load. Typically the gearing has a triple chainring similar to mountain bicycles, whereas most road bicycles have only two chainrings. Raleigh's 1985 catalogue lists touring bicycles that usually fitted with a 14-32 tooth 6-speed freewheel and 28/45/50-tooth chainrings, typically giving a <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> of 23 to 96 gear inches. A modern popular combination is to use an 11-34 tooth cassette with 22/32/44-tooth chainrings, typically giving a <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> from 18 to 104 gear inches.|$|E
50|$|The 11-speed Shimano Alfine 700 hub gear, {{introduced}} in 2010, has a <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> exceeding 4 to 1, comparable to 20-speed derailleur drive-trains, and internals running in an oil bath, for greater mechanical efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The VTi {{can handle}} a maximum of 200 N·m (147 ft·lbf) of torque for {{vehicles}} weighing up to 2100 kg (4630 lb), with <b>gear</b> <b>ranges</b> from 2.61 to 0.44. A 2.15 reverse gear is also specified. The effective final drive ratio is 4.35.|$|R
50|$|A bicycle with a 26-inch wheel, a 48-tooth chainring, and a {{cassette}} with <b>gears</b> <b>ranging</b> from 11 to 34 teeth has a lowest gear of 26 &times; 48 / 34 = 37 gear inches and a highest gear of 26 &times; 48 / 11 = 113 gear inches.|$|R

25|$|Four-wheel drive, {{also called}} 4×4 ("four by four") or 4WD refers to {{type of a}} vehicle, {{specifically}} one with its drivetrain capable of providing torque to all wheel ends of a two-axled vehicle simultaneously. It may be full-time, or on-demand, and is typically linked via a transfer case which provides an additional output drive-shaft, along with additional <b>gear</b> <b>ranges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Transfer cases used on [...] "part-time" [...] {{four-wheel-drive}} {{off-road vehicles}} such as trucks, truggies, rock-crawling vehicles, and some military vehicles generally allow {{the driver to}} select 2WD or 4WD, as well as high or low <b>gear</b> <b>ranges.</b> Those used in sports cars and performance sedans are usually [...] "transparent" [...] to the driver; there is no shifter or select lever.|$|R
50|$|A shaft-driven bicycle is {{a bicycle}} {{that uses a}} drive shaft instead of a chain to {{transmit}} power from the pedals to the wheel. Shaft drives were introduced over a century ago, but were mostly supplanted by chain-driven bicycles due to the <b>gear</b> <b>ranges</b> possible with sprockets and derailleurs. Recently, due to advancements in internal gear technology, {{a small number of}} modern shaft-driven bicycles have been introduced.|$|R
50|$|Advanced hub gears offer {{a higher}} number of gears by using {{multiple}} epicyclic gears driven by each other. Their ratios are chosen to give more evenly spaced gears and a larger total <b>gear</b> <b>range.</b> The operating principle of such units {{is the same as}} with less advanced systems, with a trigger or twist shifter with sequential shifting.|$|E
50|$|Several {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} to alter gear ratios. They can be used individually, as an external derailleur or an internal hub gear, or in combinations such as the SRAM Dual Drive, which uses a standard 8 or 9-speed cassette mounted on a three-speed internally geared hub, offering a similar <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> as a bicycle with a cassette and triple chainrings.|$|E
50|$|Inter 3 - This hub {{has three}} speeds with 36% {{intervals}} and an overall <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> of 186%. It weighs 1220 grams stripped in its basic version (without built-in brake). Other versions include coaster, roller or disk brake. Starting from around 2011 Shimano offers a {{model with a}} rotary shifting mechanism {{similar to the one}} originally developed for the Inter 7 instead of the push rod/bell crank mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Since then, {{the company}} has {{significantly}} expanded its <b>range</b> of travel <b>gear</b> <b>ranging</b> from uncomplicated, single-volume holdalls to two and even four-wheeled trolleys with single or dual compartments, {{in a range of}} sizes from strict carry-on to standard carry-on and larger. Most styles integrate other design features such as adjustable shoulder straps, organizer pouches, laptop and multimedia sleeves, expansion zips and straps, “add-a-bag” loops and security lock rings.|$|R
50|$|As the single-speed bicycle lacks {{alternative}} gearing ratios, {{it is less}} versatile, as it {{cannot be}} pedaled efficiently outside of its single <b>gearing</b> <b>range.</b> Without lower <b>gearing</b> options, the single speed bicycle is generally more difficult to pedal uphill. Conversely, its dedicated gear ratio also limits top speed, and is slower than a multi-geared bicycle on flat or descending terrain once bicycle speed exceeds the rider's ability to maintain continuing increases in cadence (pedaling revolutions per minute), typically 85-110 rpm.|$|R
25|$|There are two chainrings whose {{relative}} difference (say 10%) {{is about}} half the relative step on the cogset (say 20%). This {{was used in the}} mid-20th century when front derailleurs could only handle a small step between chainrings and when rear cogsets only had a small number of sprockets, e.g. chainrings 44-48 and cogset 14-17-20-24-28. The effect is to provide two interlaced <b>gear</b> <b>ranges</b> without any duplication. However to step sequentially through the gear ratios requires a simultaneous front and rear shift on every other gear change. This style is not available off the shelf.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{generation}} T Series that {{was introduced in}} 2014 featured {{for the first time}} Valtra’s patented hydraulics assistant that increases the engine speed automatically under heavy hydraulic loads. The T Series also features an automatic powershift that switches to a lower <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> when needed at a preset speed. The Valtra T Series was named Machine of the Year at SIMA, the Paris International Agri Business Show, in 2014.|$|E
50|$|Replacement of {{the forward}} and central bomb bays with full-fuselage-depth fuel tanks (as on the A-5/Rüstsätz 6 modification) and the {{addition}} of external bomb rack under the new fuel tank bays, capable of carrying a single 2,500 kg (5,511 lb) bomb or Fritz X/Hs 293 in addition to the rear bomb-bay loadout, if equipped with Kehl control <b>gear.</b> <b>Range</b> of 5,800 km (3,604 mi), only six test conversions built, from A-5 versions.|$|E
50|$|A high-clearance, {{four-wheel drive}} vehicle with a low <b>gear</b> <b>range</b> is {{required}} by park regulation since July 2014 on many backcountry roads including the White Rim Road. Front or rear-wheel drive only vehicles, as well as automatic all-wheel drive and low-clearance vehicles are not permitted. All drivers should be cautious at all times and be aware that towing fees usually exceed $1000 from the most remote areas. The road is rated moderately difficult for high-clearance, {{four-wheel drive vehicle}}s in good weather conditions.|$|E
2500|$|On some bicycles, {{there is}} only one gear and the gear ratio is fixed. Many {{contemporary}} bicycles have multiple gears and thus multiple gear ratios. A shifting mechanism allows selection of the appropriate gear ratio for efficiency or comfort under the prevailing circumstances: for example, it may be comfortable to use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. [...] Different gear ratios and <b>gear</b> <b>ranges</b> are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling.|$|R
50|$|There are two chainrings whose {{relative}} difference (say 10%) {{is about}} half the relative step on the cogset (say 20%).

50|$|The T-14 has a 12-speed {{automatic}} gearbox, with a {{top speed}} of 80-90 km/h and a range of 500 km. At least one expert speculated that the transmission might be an electronically controlled mechanical gearbox with external reverse and demultiplier gears, giving the tank equal forward and reverse <b>gear</b> <b>ranges.</b> Other sources suggest a partly or fully hydrostatic transmission. Uniquely for a Soviet/Russian design, the transmission is joined with the engine into a single unit that can be swapped out in the field in just under 30 minutes(source?).|$|R
