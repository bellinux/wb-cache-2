5|$|Nonetheless, the Labrador Battery guns <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> effect {{during the}} battle and the rounds {{allocated}} to it were more armour-piercing cartridges rather than high explosive rounds which were more effective against the infantry. As a result, these guns were ineffective and saw little action during the Battle of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The film premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and was {{screened}} at the Florida Film Festival in April 2006. It <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> {{release in}} two theaters in the US.

5|$|Aristocratic Heian women lived {{restricted}} and secluded lives, {{allowed to}} speak to men only when they were close relatives or household members. Murasaki's autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead she stayed in her father's household until her mid-twenties or perhaps even to her early thirties.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{declared}} victory. On {{a tactical}} level, the battle went in Israel's favor, and {{the aim of}} destroying the Karameh camp was achieved. On the other hand, the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israelis. Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers, who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by the Jordanians. The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters. Although the Palestinians <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> success in inflicting Israeli casualties, King Hussein allowed them to take credit.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{disagree}} on Tristano's importance in jazz history. Max Harrison {{indicated that the}} pianist <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> influence outside his own group of affiliated musicians; Robert Palmer, who pointed out that only one of Tristano's albums was in print {{at the time of}} his death, suggested that he was pivotal in the change from 1940s modern jazz to the freer styles of subsequent decades; and Thomas Albright similarly believed that his improvising prepared and developed new ground in the history of the music.|$|E

5|$|His {{successor}} at Ipswich was {{his assistant}} manager Bobby Ferguson. Under Ferguson, Town finished mid-table twice, but worsening performances {{meant that they}} began to struggle in the top division. The recent construction of an expensive new stand at Portman Road <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> the club's budget, despite the money gaining from sales of key players including Frans Thijssen and John Wark.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 {{the use of}} hashtags in {{television}} was new in Argentina, and programs <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> interaction with social networks. Although in August 2012 Showmatch had a higher number of tweets than Graduados (despite trailing it in the ratings), by October Graduados was the 2012 Argentine TV program with {{the highest number of}} tweets (averaging 244,540 per episode). Showmatch was second, with an average of 203,922 tweets per episode. As of October 14, September 3 was the day with the greatest number of tweets for a single episode (47,357).|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, Thai workers rioted {{over the}} {{draconian}} treatment they received as foreign workers. These workers lived in poor conditions and <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> freedom. The Chen administration vowed {{to take action}} on August 25. Chen apologized {{to the public for}} the social turmoil caused by the incident and offered to resign three times. Then-premier Frank Hsieh authorized Chen's resignation on September 12, and replaced him with former vice premier Yeh Chu-lan.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, {{three months}} after her husband {{declared}} his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign. Early in the campaign, she <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> involvement in which she traveled to political events only {{two days a week}} and rarely traveled overnight; by early February 2008 her participation had increased significantly, attending thirty-three events in eight days. She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey. She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006-2007 school year, 964 {{students}} attended North. North's minority enrollment {{has grown}} in {{the last twenty years}} despite attempts to keep it low. In 1987 North's minority enrollment was 46%. Minority enrollment continued to grow, becoming over 60% in 1991. Today, only three percent of students are white, with the majority of students, 69%, being black. Currently, 82% of students qualify for free or reduced priced lunch, an indicator of poverty. 16% of the students <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> English proficiency and 22% of students qualified for special education.|$|E
5|$|Jennings's salary as governor, {{which was}} the highest for an elected {{official}} in the state, was $1,000. Under the constitution, the governor served a three-year term and was prohibited from serving more that six years in a nine-year period. Jennings's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements. His efforts <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> success, due, in part, to the state's limited financial resources and Jennings's limited powers as governor.|$|E

5|$|Life in Nelson {{was hard}} for the colonists. The company <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> {{finances}} and tightened its expenditure which affected the salaries of its employees. In 1844, it had to halt its operations for a time. Although Nelson had 300 landowners, nearly two thirds were absentee owners and only 80 actually lived in the town. Brunner lived at Riwaka, a nearby village, and, in addition to carrying out survey work along the Motueka River, helped {{in the design and}} building of houses in the area. He ended his service with the company in August 1844.|$|E
5|$|London possessed {{advanced}} fire-fighting {{technology in}} the form of fire engines, which had been used in earlier large-scale fires. However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference. Only some of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds. They had to be brought a long way, tended to arrive too late, and <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> reach, with spouts but no delivery hoses.|$|E
5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large host range and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It causes damage to the flower buds, flowers and pods of the plant with infestations resulting in a 20–88% loss of yield. While the insect can cause damage through all growth stages, most of the damage occurs during flowering. Biological control has <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> success, so most preventative methods rely {{on the use of}} agrichemicals. Genetically modified cowpeas are being developed to express the cry protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to lepidopteran species including the Maruca.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell, who <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> {{communications}} with his division headquarters, {{was concerned that}} his force would be cut off by fierce and chaotic fighting at Sarimbun and Jurong to the south west, involving the Australian 22nd Brigade. Maxwell's force consequently withdrew from the seafront. This allowed the Japanese to land in increasing strength and take control of Kranji village. They also captured Woodlands, and began repairing the causeway, without encountering any Allied attacks.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} the Argentine–Chilean agreement <b>had</b> <b>limited</b> their naval expansion, they still retained the numerous vessels {{built in the}} interim, so {{by the turn of}} the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage. Brazil's huge advantage in population—it had almost three times the population of Argentina, close to five times that of Chile, and nearly double of the two combined—led the Brazilian government to believe that it should assume a leading role in naval affairs on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Medical residencies {{traditionally}} require lengthy {{hours of}} their trainees. Residents {{in the past}} had literally resided in hospitals {{for the duration of}} their training.
