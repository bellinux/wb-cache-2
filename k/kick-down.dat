During <b>kick-down,</b> the DSG will skip gears, shifting directly to the most appropriate gear depending on speed and throttle opening.

50|$|Despite {{very closely}} {{resembling}} the American transmissions, GAZ's copies did have distinctive differences. First of all - their components were adopted to the metric units. Their gear ratios - to the car's engines. Both cars' handbrake actuated a central drum between the housing and the drive shaft, {{instead of the}} rear wheels. Thus a parking pawl was deemed redundant. Volga's transmission, based on the Fordomatic, required additional adaptation to the air-cooled torque converter, as it was driven by a 65 hp 4 cylinder engine. Controlled by a steering column mounted lever, it had four regimes: Зх-Н-Д-П (R-N-D-L). In Drive the car would start in second and automatically shift to third depending on throttle position (the valve was regulated by a lever linked to the accelerator pedal). A <b>kick-down</b> feature was also present. First gear could only be engaged manually in Low (though it could be engaged if the car was in motion, but would only donwshift) and was used for engine braking or rapid starts. Gear ratios were: 2.4 - 1.0 for the torque converter, 2.84 for first gear, 1.68 for second, third was direct and reverse was 1.72.|$|E
5000|$|The Humber was also, at launch, {{fitted with}} a high tune version of the 1,592 cc and, from September 1965, 1,725 cc {{oversquare}} engine producing [...] and [...] respectively. Early models with the 1,592 cc engine had twin single Zenith downdraught carburettors - later 1,592/1,725 cc engines used a Solex twin choke downdraught carburettor for simplicity. The twin Zenith carburettors had been hard to keep balanced. Other modifications included a water-jacketed inlet manifold, timing adjustments and stronger valve springs to eliminate valve bounce at high engine speeds. The later H120's [...] engine is a straight swap for both of these units and looks almost identical - it provides a useful boost in power to an already swift automobile. The unique Sceptre interior featured full instrumentation, including a tachometer marked up to 6,000 rpm, and a four-speed floor-mounted transmission with self-cancelling overdrive (with column-mounted control and indicator) on third and fourth gear {{for a total of}} six separate ratios in standard form. The lockout could be removed on first and second gears, and this was often done by Rootes in cars used for competitions such as rallying. In addition, the Sceptre was from the beginning provided with servo-assisted braking control and, unusually in 1963, 10-inch front disc-brakes. The Marks 1 and 1A were not available with an automatic option - although this was rectified with the Mark II cars, using a three-speed unit with automatic <b>kick-down.</b> This was a cheaper option than was usual at the time due to the deletion of the Laycock De Normanville overdrive fitted to the Manual cars.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Vehicular powertrains with an {{internal}} combustion engine, an electronic throttle valve, and a {{continuously variable transmission}} (CVT) offer much freedom in controlling the engine speed and torque. This {{can be used to}} improve fuel economy by operating the engine in fuel-optimal operating points. The main drawbacks of this approach are the low driveability and, possibly, an inverse response of the vehicle acceleration after a <b>kick-down</b> of the drive pedal. This paper analyzes a concept for a novel pow-ertrain with an additional flywheel. The flywheel plays a part only in transient situations by (partly) compensating the engine inertia, making it possible to optimize fuel economy in stationary situations without loosing driveability in transients. Two control strategies are discussed. The first one focuses on the engine and combines feedback linearization with proportional control of the CVT ratio. The CVT controller has to be combined with an engine torque con...|$|E
40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the three-dimensional (3 D) vortex ring {{in the wake of a}} tail fin and to clarify the propulsion mechanism of dolphins and fish. In this study, we replaced a tail fin in pitching motion with an oscillating wing having a drive unit. The flow fields around the wing were measured by stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. To visualize the 3 D structure of the vortex in the wake, we determined the flow fields in equally spaced cross-sectional planes. We reconstructed the 3 D velocity fields from the velocity data with three components in two dimensions. We visualized the 3 D vortex structure from these velocity data and plotted an iso-vorticity surface. As a result, we found that the vortex ring was generated by the <b>kick-down</b> and kick-up motions of the wing and that the wake structure was comparable with that obtained numerically. Moreover, we calculated the propulsive forces from the temporal variations in circulation and in the area surrounded by the vortex ring...|$|E

40|$|The {{transmission}} {{is probably the}} drivetrain component with {{the greatest impact on}} driveability of an automatic transmission equipped vehicle. Since the driver only has an indirect influence on the gear shift timing, except for situations like <b>kick-down</b> accelerations, it is desirable to improve shift quality as perceived by the driver. However, improving shift quality is a problem normally diametrically opposed to minimizing transmission clutch energy dissipation. The latter has a great impact on transmission lifetime, and has to be defined and taken into consideration along with the notion of shift quality. The main focus of this thesis is the modeling of a drivetrain of an automatic transmission vehicle, and the implementation in MatLab/Simulink, including the first to second gear upshift. The resulting plant based on the derived equations is validated using data from a test vehicle equipped with a torque sensor located at the transmission output shaft. The shaft torque is more or less proportional to the driveline jerk, and hence of great interest for control purposes. Control strategies are discussed and a PID controller structure is developed to control the first to second gear upshift, as opposed to the traditional open-loop upshift control. Furthermore, the proposed controller structure uses the transmission output torque and the differential speed of the engaging clutch as inputs, to control the clutch pressure and the engine output torque, respectively. The structure is unsophisticated and transparent compared to other approaches, but shows great theoretical results in terms of improved shift quality and decreased clutch wear...|$|E
