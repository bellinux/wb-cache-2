Lady Gaga <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> artist and we hope to work together in the future.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing this trap <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> act in itself. The workers {{construct}} the traps on the stems of the plant, basically {{by making a}} raised and hollow platform on {{one section of the}} stem. The structure itself simply looks like a part of the plant, as if it grew in width slightly. The ants will also make small holes in this platform which are slightly wider than their own bodies. The individual workers will hide in these holes underneath the surface, invisible to their prey from the outside. They will position their heads outwards from the plant with mandibles open, waiting for prey.|$|E

I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m really serious and focused about it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes.

2500|$|By {{looking at}} the genome of the Choanoflagellate, [...] "Monosiga brevicollis", {{scientists}} have inferred that choanoflagellates {{play a key role}} in the development of multicellularity. Nicole King has done work {{looking at the}} genome of Monisiga brevicollis, and has found key protein domains that are shared between metazoans and choanoflagellates. These domains play a role in cell signalling and adhesion processes in metazoans. The finding that choanoflagellates also have these genes <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>incredible</b> discovery because it was previously thought that only metazoans had genes responsible for cell-cell communication and aggregation. This suggests that these domains {{play a key role in}} the origins of multicellularity since it ties a unicellular organism (choanoflagellates) to multicellular organisms (metazoans). It shows that the components required for multicellularity were present in the common ancestor between metazoans and choanoflagellates.|$|E
