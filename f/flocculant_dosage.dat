40|$|The {{influence}} of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) characteristics on the flocculation process and flocs structure {{was investigated in}} the presence of a linear, high molecular weight, cationic polyacrylamide of high charge density. For that, a commercial PCC sample was used, either as supplied (original PCC) or after a washing process (treated PCC). The PCC samples were characterised, and the flocculation process, for different flocculant concentrations, was monitored using the light diffraction scattering technique (LDS). Flocs structure was evaluated by determining the mass fractal dimension of the flocs. It was found that the particle size of the original PCC was larger than that of the PCC submitted to the cleaning process. As a consequence, the optimum <b>flocculant</b> <b>dosage</b> was lower for the original PCC than for the treated PCC.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates harvesting {{of marine}} microalgae for bioenergy {{and production of}} two recombinant proteins for therapeutic applications in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The first study describes harvesting of marine microalgae by flocculation using aluminum chloride (AlCl_ 3), natural polymer chitosan, and synthetic cationic polymers. Harvesting and concentration process of low concentration microalgae cultures ranging from 1 to 2 g dry weight per liter was affected by algogenic organic matter (AOM), ionic strength, cell concentration, polymer charge density, and media pH. Marine microalgae flocculation was greatly affected {{by the presence of}} AOM independently of the flocculant chemistry. Presence of AOM demanded extra <b>flocculant</b> <b>dosage</b> i. e., 3 -fold of AlCl 3, 7 -fold of highly charged synthetic cationic polymer, and 10 -fold of chitosan. <b>Flocculant</b> <b>dosage</b> required for > 90 % flocculation efficiency in the presence of AOM was 160 mg/L, 50 mg/L, and 20 mg/L when using AlCl_ 3, chitosan, and best (more efficient) synthetic polymer respectively. The high-ionic strength of saline water did not {{have a significant effect on}} flocculation efficiency when using AlCl_ 3. However, to achieve efficient algal biomass removal, application of highly-charged synthetic polymers was required to overcome the presence of electrolytes. The best synthetic cationic polymer tested herein, which achieved greater than 90 % flocculation efficiency at 20 mg/L dosage, was a polymer with 99 % cationic charge density. Cell concentration also affected <b>flocculant</b> <b>dosage</b> requirement; low density cultures (10 ^ 6 cells/mL) required 6 -fold greater dosages than cultures grown until early stationary phase (10 ^ 7 cells/mL).

This paper focuses {{on the effect of}} preconditioning tailings with varying <b>flocculants</b> and <b>dosages</b> on filtration kinetics and the resultant moisture content of the filter cake. The results show that the cationic flocculant, MAGNAFLOC LT 425, requires a high dosage to produce a low moisture content filter cake and clear filtrate. Optimal sized flocs were produced with the anionic flocculant, MAGNAFLOC 5250, even though the particles are negatively charged. The kinetics of the filtration was dependent on the composition of process water as indicated by supporting sedimentation tests. The concentration of divalent alkali earth metals such as Ca(2 +) and Mg(2 +) allow for large floc growth by a bridging mechanism, which involves binding of the polymer and the negativity charged particle. Filtration and settling curves at this dosage were also supported by filter cake analysis using Darcy plots. It was found that the large floc size significantly increases the permeability of the filter cake. Floc size measurements and fractal dimension showed that while the large flocs were produced with anionic flocculant, the flocs produced with the cationic flocculant were small and weak. The results indicate that the optimum <b>dosage</b> and <b>flocculant</b> type for effective and efficient filtration of coal plant tailings is approximately 350 g/t of anionic flocculant at a 35 % solids content and 40 kPa filtration pressure.

At flocculant concentrations greater than 0. 05 g/L, removal efficiencies were equally good but resulting concentration factors decreased with increasing AlCl 3 dosage.

Instead, the aggregate size decreases gradually due to polymer chain scission or rearrangement on repeated aggregation/breakage. This phenomenon is accounted for in the model by a flocculant strength degradation term...|$|E
40|$|This study explores froth {{flotation}} and selective flocculation methods to recycle waste phosphors containing several rare earth elements, namely, yttrium (Y), europium (Eu), cerium (Ce) and terbium (Tb). The {{effects of the}} presence or absence of collector and of <b>flocculant</b> and their <b>dosages,</b> as well as the pH, were investigated. Reverse flotation resulted in concentrates with grade of 27. 03 percent and recovery rate of 71. 36 percent, while flocculation resulted in concentrates with grade of 31. 43 percent and recovery rate of 91. 28 percent. The flotation and flocculation behaviors were further analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis, zeta potential measurements, particle size distribution and other methods. The successful separation of rare earth minerals by flotation was attributed to the selective adsorption of the collector onto quartz, making it particularly recoverable by reverse flotation so as to be separated from the valuable materials. The analysis of the particle aggregation process indicated that its better flocculation performance was due to the selective adsorption of flocculants onto the unwanted materials, enlarging the flocculant sizes by forming aggregations and facilitating the separation of rare earth minerals from waste materials based on different settling rates...|$|R
40|$|Floc {{characteristics}} such as settling velocity, concentration factor and floc size were studied for five different flocculation modes for Chlorella: aluminum sulphate, electro-coagulation-flocculation, chitosan, cationic starch and pH induced flocculation. These floc characteristics were influenced by the flocculation mode, which depends on the coagulation mechanism: adsorption – charge neutralization, sweeping or bridging. Secondly, {{the influence of the}} presence of AOM was evaluated. The presence of AOM led to an increase between 1. 5 and 5 -fold in needed <b>flocculant</b> <b>dosage</b> for all flocculation modes. This resulted particularly in a comparable decrease of the concentration factor. The floc characteristics upon flocculation using cationic starch were least affected by the presence of AOM, while flocculation using chitosan was most affected. The impact on floc characteristics is an important parameter next to flocculation efficiency to consider in the assessment of flocculation-based harvesting of microalgae. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Lignocelluloses {{materials}} {{were selected for}} ethanol production, but certain problems occurred, such as the hydrolysis and detoxification process. A biological flocculation technology was {{to apply for the}} detoxification of acid hydrolyzate of lignocelluloses materials. Meanwhile chitosan was confirmed as the best biological flocculant which showed good detoxification effect. In order to reach the optimal detoxification effect, the Box-Behnken experimental design was carried out. The most important parameters affecting the efficiency of detoxification are dosage, temperature, reaction time, and pH of the solution. The optimal parameters were: <b>flocculant</b> <b>dosage</b> of 0. 25 g L– 1, pH of 4, reaction time of 10 minutes, and reaction temperature of 41 °C. The calculated detoxification rate was 78. 2 %. Through three confirmation experiments, the practical detoxification rate was 78 %, which was close to the theoretical prediction. This model had good reliability and reproducibility...|$|E
