6000|$|Alice Montagu's indignation knew no bounds. What! {{was this}} noble votaress to be forced, {{not only to}} resign the glory of being the foundress of a new order of beneficence, but to be married, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> and to that wretched little coward? Boemond of Burgundy was better than that, for he at least was a man! ...|$|E
6000|$|The Duc de Chambertin-Pommard was a {{small but}} lively relic of a really aristocratic family, the members of which were nearly all Atheists up {{to the time of}} the French Revolution, but since that event (beneficial in such various ways) had been very devout. He was a Royalist, a Nationalist, and a {{perfectly}} sincere patriot in that particular style which consists of ceaselessly asserting that one's country is not so much in danger as already destroyed. He wrote cheery little articles for the Royalist Press entitled [...] "The End of France" [...] or [...] "The Last Cry," [...] or what not, and he gave the final touches to a picture of the Kaiser riding across a pavement of prostrate Parisians with a glow of patriotic exultation. He was quite poor, and even his relations had no money. He walked briskly to all his meals at a little open cafe, and he looked <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{fortunes}} of the trade unions are interwoven with the industries they serve. The more highly organised trade unions are, the more clearly they recognise their responsibilities; the larger their membership, the greater their knowledge, the wider their outlook. Of course, trade unions will make mistakes, like everybody else, will do foolish things, and wrong things, and want more than {{they are likely to}} get, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> But the fact remains that for thirty years trade unions have had a charter from Parliament which up to within a few years ago protected their funds, and gave them effective power to conduct a strike; and no one can say that these thirty years were bad years of British industry, that during these thirty years it was impossible to develop great businesses and carry on large manufacturing operations, because, as everybody knows perfectly well, those were good and expanding years of British trade and national enrichment.|$|E
5000|$|In {{light of}} Bereman's {{decision}} not to field a team, TeamTennis decided before the season {{that no matter what}} record the Loves posted, they would be placed last among the eight teams in the standings. The players were paid a salary instead of being eligible for prize money based on their performance. However, their matches counted in the records of the other seven teams. The Loves' first match was a loss to the eventual 1983 champion Chicago Fyre on July 20. Player-coach Syd Ball said, [...] "It's unfortunate we can't play any home matches. But we knew before we hit a ball in Chicago what the situation was. We accepted the fact we won't share in the prize money. We're looking at it as a good workout session that will stand us in good stead in any tournaments coming up. We have a compact little program. We haven't had any wins yet, but we had a super tiebreaker against Dallas. We <b>just</b> <b>like</b> spoiling <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> record." ...|$|R

He's not stopping and <b>just</b> settling in <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> And it's <b>like,</b> no muthafucka I'm not stopping and allowing myself to be content with riding in the fuckin promo van. Like, nah B, this is rap star shit. Cause if it ain't, and if you ain't no fuckin rap star, you just some other little dusty rap nigga with a chain trying to be noticed. And that ain't never been my style. It's all love though, on my end, he said. I don't have nothing but good wishes for them. I wish them all the best. In terms of being people, in terms of character, I don't think they had any malice towards me. But it's a business.|$|R
25|$|Maggie is a {{character}} that appears in Arthur Miller's partially autobiographical play, After the Fall. She is both {{one of his most}} criticised and controversial characters, and one of his most famous ones. She is a thinly veiled version of Marilyn Monroe, Miller's former wife, and thus her suicide attempts after her and Quentin's divorce, and her depression is from reality. This {{is one of the reasons}} that reviews upon its first release were generally negative, owing to the similarities between fact and fiction. However, academic scholars find her to be one of the best, if not the best, of Miller's creations, as the play presents readers with a superb portrait of a woman facing a mental crisis. It also shows Monroe in comparison to the reasons for her marriage to Miller- for example, the fact that Miller took her seriously, and was ready to treat her as more than <b>just</b> an object, <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> Miller also highlights his own feelings after Monroe's death by showing Quentin's, and his regret that he had been unable to save her from herself.|$|R

You've got your living to make, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> I guess. Well, see here. This is how it stands. To a certain extant, I don't mind admitting, seeing that we're being frank with one another, you two gentlemen have got us--that's to say, my employer--in a cleft stick. Frankly, those articles are beginning to attract attention, and if they go on there's {{going to be}} a lot of inconvenience for my employer. That's clear, I reckon. Well, now, here's a square proposition. How much do you want to stop those articles? That's straight. I've been frank with you, and I want you to be frank with me. What's your figure? Name it, and, if it's not too high, I guess we needn't quarrel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ruby Gillis {{thinks of}} nothing but beaus," [...] said Anne disdainfully. [...] "She's {{actually}} delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. But I'm afraid that is an uncharitable speech. Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don't they? I simply can't talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech, so I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I'm trying {{to be as much}} like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she's perfect. Mr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she treads on and she doesn't really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even ministers are human and have their besetting sins <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it's proper to talk about on Sundays {{and that is one of}} them. My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties. I'm striving very hard to overcome it and now that I'm really thirteen perhaps I'll get on better." ...|$|E
6000|$|Picture us, my dear, afloat in {{the very}} oddest ship you can imagine. It's not the ship, {{so much as the}} people. One does come across queer sorts as one travels. I must say I find it hugely amusing. There's the manager of the line--called Vinrace--a nice big Englishman, doesn't say much--you know the sort. As for the rest--they might have come {{trailing}} out of an old number of Punch. They're like people playing croquet in the 'sixties. How long they've all been shut up in this ship I don't know--years and years I should say--but one feels as though one had boarded a little separate world, and they'd never been on shore, or done ordinary things in their lives. It's what I've always said about literary people--they're far the hardest of any to get on with. The worst of it is, these people--a man and his wife and a niece--might have been, one feels, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> if they hadn't got swallowed up by Oxford or Cambridge or some such place, and been made cranks of. The man's really delightful (if he'd cut his nails), and the woman has quite a fine face, only she dresses, of course, in a potato sack, and wears her hair like a Liberty shopgirl's. They talk about art, and think us such poops for dressing in the evening. However, I can't help that; I'd rather die than come in to dinner without changing--wouldn't you? It matters ever so much more than the soup. (It's odd how things like that do matter so much more than what's generally supposed to matter. I'd rather have my head cut off than wear flannel next the skin.) Then there's a nice shy girl--poor thing--I wish one could rake her out before it's too late. She has quite nice eyes and hair, only, of course, she'll get funny too. We ought to start a society for broadening the minds of the young--much more useful than missionaries, Hester! Oh, I'd forgotten there's a dreadful little thing called Pepper. He's just like his name. He's indescribably insignificant, and rather queer in his temper, poor dear. It's like sitting down to dinner with an ill-conditioned fox-terrier, only one can't comb him out, and sprinkle him with powder, as one would one's dog. It's a pity, sometimes, one can't treat people like dogs! The great comfort is that we're away from newspapers, so that Richard will have a real holiday this time. Spain wasn't a holiday. [...] .|$|E
5000|$|Uzbekistan dominates {{southern}} Kyrgyzstan both {{economically and}} politically, {{based on the}} large Uzbek population in that region of Kyrgyzstan and on economic and geographic conditions. Much of Kyrgyzstan depends entirely on Uzbekistan for natural gas; on several occasions, Uzbekistan president Islam Karimov has achieved political ends by shutting pipelines or by adjusting terms of delivery. [...] In a number of television appearances broadcast in the Osh and Jalal-Abad provinces of Kyrgyzstan, Karimov has addressed Akayev with considerable condescension; Akayev, in turn, has been highly deferential to his much stronger neighbor. Although Uzbekistan has not shown overt expansionist tendencies, the Kyrgyz government is {{acutely aware of the}} implications of Karimov's assertions that he is responsible for the well-being of all Uzbeks, regardless of their nation of residence. The Kyrgyz deposed President said in an interview [...] "It is like we are heroin addicts but instead of heroin its energy we are addicted to-but not addicted as such, we <b>just</b> need it <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> does, so in fact heroin makes a bad comparison but I will stick with it- anyway its like Uzbekistan is our dealer, this is where the comparison is good, because heroin dealers are nasty and so is Uzbekistan, they play games, they get us to sell our bodies for the heroin, our bodies being bread, land and labor (and to remind you the heroin is energy). Like a pimp they do not give us a fair deal though and thus we are exploited. The situation is clear when one considers it in these terms." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{analogy to}} {{conscientious}} objection is flawed, these critics say: A conscientious objector to military service {{does not take}} up arms and kill. Perhaps somebody else is drafted to do so instead, but the conscientious objector does not. A “peace tax fund” payer, on the other hand, pays just {{as much money as}} the ordinary taxpayer, but just cherishes the illusion that her dollars were peaceful ones. It would be as if the government told conscientious objectors that they had to take up arms and shoot at the enemy <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> but that they didn’t have to take credit for their kills if they didn’t want to.|$|E
