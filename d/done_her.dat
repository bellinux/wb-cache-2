500|$|Cartoonist Milt Gross's He <b>Done</b> <b>Her</b> Wrong (1930) was {{a parody}} of the genre; the book uses varying panel designs akin to those of comics: the action {{sometimes}} takes place outside the panel borders and [...] "dialogue balloons" [...] show in images what the characters are saying. [...] Cartoonist and illustrator William Gropper's Alay-oop (1930) tells of three entertainers' disappointed dreams. [...] In Abraham Lincoln: Biography in Woodcuts (1933) Charles Turzak documented the American president. [...] Animator Myron Waldman (1908–2006) wrote a wordless tale of a plump young woman looking for a glamorous husband. [...] The book, Eve (1943), also uses [...] "picture balloons" [...] as He <b>Done</b> <b>Her</b> Wrong does.|$|E

500|$|While graphic novels {{generally}} use captions and dialogue, cartoonists such as Eric Drooker, Peter Kuper, , Brian Ralph, Masashi Tanaka, Lewis Trondheim, and Billy Simms {{have made}} wordless graphic novels. [...] As Gross did in He <b>Done</b> <b>Her</b> Wrong, 's wordless oeuvre uses textless word balloons containing symbols, icons, and other images. [...] The {{influence of the}} wordless novel is prominent in Drooker's Flood (1992) and Kuper's The System (1997), both metaphorical stories that focus on social themes. [...] Since 2011, the Pennsylvania State University Libraries and the Pennsylvania Center for the Book have awarded the annual Lynd Ward Prize for Graphic Novel, a cash prize established by Ward's daughters to highlight their father's influence {{on the development of}} the graphic novel.|$|E
500|$|A Contract with God has frequently, though erroneously, {{been cited}} as the first graphic novel; [...] comic book {{reviewer}} Richard Kyle had used the term in 1964 in a fan newsletter, and it had appeared {{on the cover of}} The First Kingdom (1974) by Jack Katz, with whom Eisner had corresponded. [...] A number of book-length comics preceded Contract, at least as far back as Milt Gross's He <b>Done</b> <b>Her</b> Wrong (1930). [...] A Contract with God attracted greater attention than these previous efforts partly due to Eisner's greater status in the comics community. [...] It is considered a milestone in American comics history not only for its format, but also for its literary aspirations and for having dispensed with typical comic-book genre tropes.|$|E
500|$|Ward first {{encountered}} the wordless novel with Frans Masereel's The Sun (1919) while studying art in Germany in 1926. [...] He {{returned to the}} United States in 1927 and established a career for himself as an illustrator. [...] He found Otto Nückel's wordless novel Destiny (1926) in New York City in 1929, and it inspired him to create such a work of his own. [...] appeared {{a week before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929; it nevertheless enjoyed strong sales and remains the best-selling American wordless novel. [...] Its success inspired other Americans to experiment with the medium, including cartoonist Milt Gross, who parodied [...] in He <b>Done</b> <b>Her</b> Wrong (1930). [...] In the 1970s Ward's example inspired cartoonists Art Spiegelman and Will Eisner to create their first graphic novels.|$|E

Reporting to a government select committee into the operation of the reserves later the same year, Homeswest director Greg Joyce defended Quartermaine: [...] "She has <b>done</b> <b>her</b> best over a long time to run the place.

500|$|The wordless novel has {{its origin}} in the German Expressionist {{movement}} of the early 20th century. [...] The typically socialist work drew inspiration from mediaeval woodcuts and used the awkward look of that medium to express angst and frustration at social injustice. [...] The first such book was the Belgian Frans Masereel's 25 Images of a Man's Passion, published in 1918. [...] The German Otto Nückel and other artists followed Masereel's example. [...] Lynd Ward brought the genre to the United States in 1929 when he produced , which inspired other American wordless novels and a parody in 1930 by cartoonist Milt Gross with He <b>Done</b> <b>Her</b> Wrong. [...] Following an early-1930s peak in production and popularity, the genre waned {{in the face of}} competition from sound films and anti-socialist censorship in Nazi Germany and the US.|$|E
