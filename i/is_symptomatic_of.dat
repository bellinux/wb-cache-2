500|$|Barry Schwartz, a {{sociologist}} who has examined America's cultural memory, argues {{that in the}} 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with [...] "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life". During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served [...] "as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful". Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used {{the words of the}} Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, [...] "What would Lincoln do?" [...] However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this [...] "fading hero <b>is</b> <b>symptomatic</b> <b>of</b> fading confidence in national greatness". He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.|$|E
500|$|Early {{development}} of the women's game at the time colonial powers brought football to the African continent was limited, as colonial powers in the region tended to make concepts of patriarchy and women's participation in sports was limited as a result. The lack of later {{development of}} the national teams on a wider international level <b>is</b> <b>symptomatic</b> <b>of</b> most of African teams and a result of several factors, including [...] limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. [...] When quality female football players are developed, they tend to leave for greater opportunities abroad. Continent wide, funding is also an issue, with most development money coming from FIFA, not the national football association. Future success for women's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities. [...] Attempting to commercialise the game and make it commercially viable is not the solution, {{as demonstrated by the}} current existence of many youth and women's football camps held throughout the continent.|$|E

500|$|In recent years, WMATA {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} for a neglect of safety in both its rail and bus systems. Problems include failures {{within the system}} designed to prevent train collisions and escalators failing or breaking apart while in service. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recommended that WMATA invest $1 billion in needed safety improvements. A December 2008 report by the WMATA Inspector General documented that Metro's System Safety and Risk Management Office was bypassed when changes were made to Metrorail's operating procedures, even though that office's review and approval was required {{as a matter of}} policy. On June 22, 2009, two Metrorail trains collided between the Takoma and Fort Totten Metro stations, killing nine.

500|$|All of the {{characters}} drink heavily during the fiesta and generally throughout the novel. In his essay [...] "Alcoholism in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises," [...] Matts Djos says the main characters exhibit alcoholic tendencies such as depression, anxiety and sexual inadequacy. He writes that Jake's self-pity <b>is</b> <b>symptomatic</b> <b>of</b> an alcoholic, as is Brett's out-of-control behavior. William Balassi thinks that Jake gets drunk to avoid his feelings for Brett, notably in the Madrid scenes at the end where he has three martinis before lunch and drinks three bottles of wine with lunch. Reynolds, however, believes the drinking is relevant as set against the historical context of Prohibition in the United States. [...] The atmosphere of the fiesta lends itself to drunkenness, but the degree of revelry among the Americans also reflects a reaction against Prohibition. [...] Bill, visiting from the US, drinks in Paris and in Spain. Jake is rarely drunk in Paris where he works but on vacation in Pamplona, he drinks constantly. Reynolds says that Prohibition split attitudes about morality, and in the novel Hemingway made clear his dislike of Prohibition.|$|E

[...] Barr opined that [...] "neither of these candidates is talking about the deep cuts in government spending and returning power to the people." [...] He identified the Republican Party's position on FISA legislation as his biggest aversion to the party. When confronted with opinion polls that showed the candidate with 3% in the presidential race, Barr explained that the numbers would increase in the following weeks, announcing that his campaign would be launched [...] "full-time" [...] on July 4.|$|E

500|$|Symptom onset {{is usually}} rapid, often {{occurring}} {{within minutes of}} elevated serotonin levels. Serotonin syndrome encompasses {{a wide range of}} clinical findings. Mild symptoms may consist of increased heart rate, shivering, sweating, dilated pupils, myoclonus (intermittent jerking or twitching), as well as overresponsive reflexes. However, many of these symptoms may be side effects of the drug or drug interaction causing excessive levels of serotonin; not an effect of elevated serotonin itself. Tremor is a common side effect of MDMA's action on dopamine, whereas hyperreflexia <b>is</b> <b>symptomatic</b> <b>of</b> exposure to serotonin agonists. Moderate intoxication includes additional abnormalities such as hyperactive bowel sounds, high blood pressure and hyperthermia; a temperature as high as [...] The overactive reflexes and clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs.

Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arising as a consequence of hyperthermia.|$|E
500|$|In his {{influential}} book From Caligari to Hitler, Kracauer argues the Dr. Caligari character <b>is</b> <b>symptomatic</b> <b>of</b> a subconscious need in German {{society for}} a tyrant, {{which he calls}} the German [...] "collective soul". Kracauer argues Dr. Caligari and Cesare are premonitions of Adolf Hitler and his rule over Germany, and that his control over the weak-willed, puppet-like somnambulist prefigures aspects of the mentality that allowed the Nazi Party to rise. He calls Dr. Caligari's use of hypnotism to impose his will foreshadowing of Hitler's [...] "manipulation of the soul". Kracauer described the film {{as an example of}} Germany's obedience to authority and failure or unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority, and reflects a [...] "general retreat" [...] into a shell that occurred in post-war Germany. Cesare symbolizes those who have no mind of their own and must follow the paths of others; Kracauer wrote he foreshadows a German future in which [...] "self-appointed Caligaris hypnotized innumerable Cesares into murder". Barlow rejects Kracauer's claims that the film glorifies authority [...] "just because it has not made a preachy statement against it", and said the connection between Dr. Caligari and Hitler lies in the mood the film conveys, not an endorsement of such tyrant on the film's part.|$|E

2500|$|One {{interpretation}} of Melinda's behavior {{is that it}} <b>is</b> <b>symptomatic</b> <b>of</b> post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) {{as a result of}} her rape. Like other trauma survivors, Melinda's desire to both deny and proclaim what happened produces symptoms that both attract and deflect attention. [...] Don Latham and Lisa DeTora both define Melinda's PTSD within the context of Judith Herman's three categories of classic PTSD symptoms: [...] "hyperarousal", [...] "intrusion", and [...] "constriction". Melinda displays hyperarousal in her wariness of potential danger. Melinda will not go over to David's house after the basketball game, because she is afraid of what might happen. Intrusion is depicted in the rape's disruption of Melinda's consciousness. She tries to forget the event, but the memories keep resurfacing in her mind. Constriction is illustrated in Melinda's silence and withdrawal from society. Latham views Melinda's slow recovery as queer in its diversion from the normal treatment of trauma. Melinda's recovery comes {{as a result of her}} own efforts, without professional help. Further, DeTora notes the connection between trauma and [...] "the unspeakable".|$|E
2500|$|From the 13th {{century to}} the late 16th century, the Zoroastrian priests of Gujarat sent (in all) twenty-two {{requests}} for religious guidance to their co-religionists in Iran, presumably because they considered the Iranian Zoroastrians [...] "better informed on religious matters than themselves, and must have preserved the old-time tradition more faithfully than they themselves did" [...] These transmissions and their replies – assiduously preserved by the community as the rivayats (epistles) – span the years 1478–1766 and deal with both religious and social subjects. From a superficial 21st century point of view, some of these ithoter ("questions") are remarkably trivial – for instance, Rivayat 376: whether ink prepared by a non-Zoroastrian is suitable for copying Avestan language texts – but they provide a discerning insight into the fears and anxieties of the early modern Zoroastrians. Thus, {{the question of the}} ink <b>is</b> <b>symptomatic</b> <b>of</b> the fear of assimilation and the loss of identity, a theme that dominates the questions posed and continues to be an issue into the 21st century. So also the question of conversion of Juddins (non-Zoroastrians) to Zoroastrianism, to which the reply (R237, R238) was: acceptable, even meritorious.|$|E
2500|$|France goes on {{to comment}} on the other {{translations}} in the market. On David Magarshack's Dostoyevsky translations he says: [...] "it is not certain that Magarshack has worn as well as Garnett. He certainly corrects some of her errors; he also aims for a more up-to-date style which flows more easily in English....Being even more thoroughly englished than Garnett's, Magarshack's translations lack some of the excitement of the foreign." [...] On MacAndrew's American version, he writes: [...] "He translates fairly freely, altering details, rearranging, shortening and explaining the Russian to produce texts which lack a distinctive voice." [...] On David McDuff's Penguin translation he continues: [...] "McDuff carries this literalism the furthest of any of the translators. In his Brothers Karamazov the odd, fussy tone of the narrator is well rendered in the preface....At times, indeed, the convoluted style might make the reader unfamiliar with Dostoevsky's Russian question the translator's command of English. More seriously, this literalism means that the dialogue is sometimes impossibly odd—and as a result rather dead....Such 'foreignizing' fidelity makes for difficult reading." [...] On the Pevear and Volokhonsky's translation, France writes: [...] "Pevear and Volokhonsky, while they too stress the need to exhume the real, rough-edged Dostoevsky from the normalization practised by earlier translators, generally offers a rather more satisfactory compromise between the literal and the readable. In particular, their rendering of dialogue is often livelier and more colloquial than McDuff's.... Elsewhere, it has to be said, the desire to replicate the vocabulary or syntax of the Russian results in unnecessary awkwardness and obscurity." [...] In commenting on Ignat Avsey's translation, he writes: [...] "His not entirely unprecedented choice of a more natural-sounding English formulation <b>is</b> <b>symptomatic</b> <b>of</b> his general desire to make his text English....His is an enjoyable version in the domesticating tradition." ...|$|E
