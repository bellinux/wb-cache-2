Ang has no belief that he will become the <b>Golden</b> <b>Dragon,</b> as Ling is the best fighter at the Dragon dojo. Ling is positive that she will become the <b>Golden</b> <b>Dragon.</b> However, when Master Chin calls upon the power of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Dragon</b> to choose who will be the next <b>golden</b> <b>dragon,</b> it chooses Ang. Humiliated and furious, Ling storms out of the temple and is tempted by the ultimate dark and evil power of the shadow dragon. From then on, Ang is forced to fight his own twin sister.|$|R
