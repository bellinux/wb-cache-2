25|$|The {{chemical}} isomer {{shift and}} quadrupole splitting are generally <b>evaluated</b> <b>with</b> {{respect to a}} reference material. For example, in iron compounds, the Mössbauer parameters were evaluated using iron foil (thickness less than 40 micrometers). The centroid of the six lines spectrum from metallic iron foil is −0.1mm/s (for Co/Rh source). All shifts in other iron compounds are computed relative to this −0.10mm/s (at room temperature), i.e., in this case isomer shifts are relative to Co/Rh source. In other words, the centre point of the Mössbauer spectrum is zero. The shift values may also be reported relative to 0.0mm/s, here shifts are relative to the iron foil.|$|E

25|$|For any fixed number w {{of machine}} registers, it is {{possible}} to determine in linear time whether a piece of straight-line code can be reordered {{in such a way that}} it can be <b>evaluated</b> <b>with</b> at most w registers. For, if the vertex separation number of a topological ordering is at most w, the minimum vertex separation among all orderings can be no larger, so the undirected graph formed by ignoring the orientations of the DAG described above must have pathwith at most w. It is possible to test whether this is the case, using the known fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms for pathwidth, and if so to find a path-decomposition for the undirected graph, in linear time given the assumption that w is a constant. Once a path decomposition has been found, a topological ordering of width w (if one exists) can be found using dynamic programming, again in linear time.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{community}} restitution was not {{authorized by the}} former U.S. federal law. Also under that law, restitution was struck down where aggrieved parties were not identified and actual damages or loss caused were not <b>evaluated</b> <b>with</b> exactitude. The District Court is without power to order restitution of an amount greater than the actual loss caused by the offense for which conviction was had, regardless of a presentence report indicating a greater amount of total losses. The order to make restitution cannot extend to sums pertaining to crimes for which the defendant was neither indicted, tried, nor convicted. There {{seems to be a}} circuit split as to whether a defendant can be ordered to repay money given by the government as part of a sting operation. Under , sentencing courts are permitted to impose restitution as a condition of release to the extent agreed to by the government and defendant in a plea agreement.|$|E
