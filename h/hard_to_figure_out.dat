Mike Diver of the BBC wrote that Carey shows restraint {{for the most}} part of the album, but [...] "Auld Lang Syne (The New Year's Anthem)" [...] as the final track is [...] "slathered in cheesy beats". Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz disapproved of the dance beat, saying [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what's 'extra festive' (as the full song title promises) about her 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' update, and far easier to determine what's wrong with 'Auld Lang Syne' (an awkward dance beat)."

She found singing in three different styles, {{as required by the}} role, to be [...] "fun and challenging", and though she had never before sung [...] "Maybe This Time", after singing it on Glee, she went on to use it in shows as her opening number. Chenoweth stated that she would love to return to Glee in the future, a sentiment shared by Murphy. She commented: [...] "they are all working <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> stories all the time. It'd be great for it to make sense for her to come back.

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{incarnation of}} [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{developed during the}} recording sessions for Achtung Baby. While working in Hansa Ton Studios in Berlin, guitarist The Edge and lead singer Bono created the verse. The track was given the working title [...] "Sinatra" [...] {{in reference to the}} artist whose music inspired it. The group reworked it in preparation of Zooropa. The Edge noted [...] "it came to us in installments". Bassist Adam Clayton said [...] "it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how we would do it. I mean, {{no one is going to}} mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what we ended up with and that really worked." [...] The Edge added [...] "I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to summon up the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition." [...] He worked out a chord progression based on old Tin Pan Alley songs.|$|E

However, she was {{confused by the}} re-recording of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", saying that [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what's 'extra festive, and quipped that it is [...] "far easier to determine what's wrong with 'Auld Lang Syne' (an awkward dance beat)". Ganz concluded with [...] "the LP's warm heart is in the right place." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the album {{two and a half}} stars our of five, writing [...] "Everything about Carey’s sequel to 1994’s buoyant, if, in retrospect, safe, Merry Christmas is as desperate and habitual as it is reassuringly predictable." [...] While he continued to label it as an [...] "incredibly adventureless album," [...] he also wrote that it is a [...] "remarkably comforting listen". He felt that Merry Christmas II You was not a sequel, or a remake, but rather an attempt at rewinding time on Carey's part. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was critical of Merry Christmas II You. He described [...] "One Child" [...] as a [...] "needless retelling", [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] as trying too hard and too difficult to sing along to and [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)" [...] as a desperate attempt at Carey canonising herself for re-recording her own song. [...] "The near-crazed desperation to please listeners for her own sake is all over Merry Christmas II You: A [...] "gift" [...] to her fans (or so she claims) that they, of course, must pay for, it's her fascinating, career-long saga of self-obsession in a nutshell." ...|$|E

As a result, KFC worked <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how <b>to</b> appeal to the kids even further. One of the first things KFC found was that children were not at all interested in its logo. In 1995, the bearded, elderly white man that Chinese children found so off-putting was exchanged for a playful cartoon character dubbed 'Chicky.' Other efforts to entice children included play areas, child-height sinks, smaller furniture, and settings for birthday parties, which are a very recent phenomenon in China.|$|R

Game theory, the most {{influential}} model of choice in economics and the social sciences, offers an answer, one based on games of strategy like chess and checkers: the chooser considers the choices that others will make and makes a choice {{that will lead to}} a better outcome for the chooser, given all those choices by other people. It is universally established in the social sciences that classical game theory (even when heavily modified) is bad at predicting behavior. But instead of abandoning classical game theory, those in the social sciences have mounted a rescue operation under the name of “behavioral game theory. ” Its main tool is to propose systematic deviations from the predictions of game theory, deviations that arise from character type, for example.

The fundamental idea of behavioral game theory is that, if we know the deviations, then we can correct our predictions accordingly, and so get it right.
