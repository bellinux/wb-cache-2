Malagkit Pirurutong and Binicol were identified as the two rice accessions with <b>deepest</b> <b>roots</b> through four field experiments conducted at two different locations in West Africa. For these two accessions, root depths reached 35. 6 and 41. 4  cm, respectively, in the first experiment at Bamako; on the other hand, their depths only reached 22. 6 and 18. 6  cm, respectively, {{in the second and third}} experiments at Ibadan, leading to inconsistent genotypic ranking based on root depth between the two locations. However, Malagkit Pirurutong was identified as <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>in</b> both locations; in addition, it showed <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>in</b> the fourth experiment in a 20 -mm irrigation treatment, even when compared with the <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> reference Azucena.
