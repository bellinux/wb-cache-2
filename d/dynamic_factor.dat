40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of unit root testing in the {{presence}} of multiple structural changes and common <b>dynamic</b> <b>factors.</b> Structural breaks represent infrequent regime shifts, while <b>dynamic</b> <b>factors</b> capture common shocks underlying the comovement of economic time series. We examine the modified Sargan-Bhargava (MSB) test in the panel data setting and propose ways to handle multiple structural changes and <b>dynamic</b> <b>factors.</b> Properties of the MSB test under these non-standard conditions are derived. For example, the test statistics are shown to be invariant, in the limit, to mean breaks. This invariance does not carry over to breaks in linear trends, where the test statistics will converge to functionals of weighted Brownian bridges. A simplified test statistic is then proposed, which is invariant to both mean and trend breaks. We further study pooled test statistic based on standardization and combination of "p"-values. Response surfaces for "p"-values of all test statistics are computed to facilitate the empirical implementation of the proposed methodology. The pooled tests are shown to have good finite sample performance. Copyright © 2009 The Review of Economic Studies Limited. ...|$|R

In this paper, we associate q with the number of <b>dynamic</b> <b>factors</b> in a large panel of data.

Our algebraic tests are based on a spectral decomposition of the covariance matrix of the residuals of a VAR. The tests are exact if the residuals were observable. Because of sampling variability from having to estimate the VAR, the tests are accurate up to an error that vanishes asymptotically. We show how this error depends on the rate of convergence of the sample covariance to the population covariance of the true innovations.

5000|$|Prof. Munoz's Inaugural Lecture at the University of Ibadan {{entitled}} [...] "For the Sake of Tradition" [...] was {{a master}} exposition of what humans and the human societies are, or as Jean Guitton states profoundly 'Become what you are'. In holding brief for tradition, Munoz takes a stand concerning what he believes to be the fundamental problem of mankind, namely, the problem of development. Because development in its various connotations is of such importance {{to the problems of}} the Third World, Monoz demonstrates the close links between development and tradition. To him, once tradition is understood as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>factor</b> and not simply as a duration, bound in time, the past is brought into focus in the understanding of development; as men and societies of men not only change but last. He sees a paradigm according to which the progress of mankind is understood solely in terms of modernity, where the past, namely tradition, is replaced by the present. In particular, he inveighs against the secularizatiom of the vision of the world that leaves out its pivotal significance of the transcendental dimension of human existence. He agrees with St. Josemaria that [...] "if we keep the sense of eternity, we do not lose sight that today or now are temporal adverbs and chronological criteria not necessarily of validity". Munoz finds that the social sciences, including political science, have been particularly affected by the paradigm of modernity which has exerted such a destructive influence in the Western thought and has impaired the understanding of society and of political events. This decline, he believes, has been caused by the predominance of commitment to the Cartesian paradigm which refuses to accept the existential nature of human cognition. He therefore warns that unless we regain an appreciation of ourselves as persons, unless we appreciate in its fullness the historical and personal form of the being of man, we will pay the price namely, the elimination of an entire realm of questions and the denial of the truth of existence. For Munoz tradition implies a value judgement about the element being handed on. In this sense, what is really tradition is not the institution in itself but the belief in its value, the outcome of which Munoz has referred to as traditionality. To demonstrate that his stand on tradition has immediate practical relevance in the Nigerian society he asks: 'What would be the outcome if, for instance, our national rural development programmes, our economic and educational planning, our population policies, our handling the issues of our religious and ethnic pluralism, our creation of states, our constitution making, all took tradition into consideration'. He thus stresses that bringing tradition in will free humans from the grip of the paradigm of modernity and help them to see themselves as they really are'.|$|E
