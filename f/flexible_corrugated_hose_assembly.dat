50|$|A {{metal hose}} is a {{flexible}} metal line element. There {{are two basic}} types of metal hose that differ in their design and application: stripwound <b>hoses</b> and <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses.</b> Stripwound hoses have a high mechanical strength (e.g. tensile strength and tear strength). <b>Corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> can withstand high pressure and provide maximum leak tightness on account of their material. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> also exhibit corrosion resistance and pressure tightness under the most extreme conditions, such as in aggressive seawater or at extreme temperatures such as found in space or when transporting cooled liquid gas. They are particularly well suited for conveying hot and cold substances.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanical}} corrugation method, on {{the other}} hand, is used to produce both annular and helical <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses.</b> Usually, multiple profiled pressure rollers are positioned around the tube with an offset {{that enables them to}} roll the desired corrugation profile into the tube from the outside to the inside. Both corrugation methods cause material hardening and thus increase the pressure and fatigue resistance of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{hydraulic}} corrugation method {{expands the}} tube {{from the inside}} to the outside. This method is used to create annular <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{increases}} process reliability during conduit {{assembly and}} use. For this reason, annular <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> {{are far more}} common, {{with only a few}} exceptions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> are {{pressure}} and vacuum tight. The permissible operating pressures for hoses with small dimensions reach 380 bar (with a 3-fold burst pressure safety factor). The pressure resistance of large dimensions is lower for technical reasons. Stainless steel models have a temperature resistance {{of up to}} approx. 600 °C, depending on the pressure load, and even higher values are possible with special materials. In the low temperature range, stainless steel <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> can be used down to -270 °C.|$|R
50|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> {{are used}} as economical, {{flexible}} connecting elements that permit movement, thermal expansion and vibrations, {{and that can be}} used as filling hoses. The starting material is a seamless or longitudinally welded, thin-walled tube into which corrugations are introduced by mechanical or hydraulic means using special tools. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> are absolutely leak-tight and are used to convey liquids or gases under pressure or as vacuum lines. They are also referred to as pressure hoses. Their special design achieves both flexibility and pressure resistance.|$|R

Wings are usually oval (annular, doughnut or toroidal) or U-shaped (horseshoe), and are designed to wrap slightly around the diving cylinder(s) when inflated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: New {{measurements}} of the frictional pressure drop of air–water two-phase flow in a <b>flexible</b> <b>corrugated</b> U-tube have been carried out. Experiments were performed under the following conditions of two-phase parameters: mass flux of 300 – 800 kg/m 2 s, gas quality of 1 – 60 per cent, and system pressure of 3 – 7 bar. The inner diameter of the U-tubes tested was 40 mm, with a ratio of curvature radius to inner diameter varying from 3 to 7. 5. The results demonstrate that the two-phase flow resistance, energy dissipation, friction losses, and interaction of the two phases in <b>flexible</b> <b>corrugated</b> U-tubes are perceptible about two to five times greater than those in smooth U-tubes. Hence, the two-phase friction factor of such tubes increases from 0. 65 to 1. 4, depending on the influencing flow and geometrical parameters. The available correlations in the open literature present a similar trend and behaviour. However, they predict the data presented poorly because of the complex geometry of the <b>flexible</b> <b>corrugated</b> U-tube. Based on the energy balance and the presented experimental results, a new model has been developed to calculate the frictional two-phase pressure drop and hence the friction factor of the flexible U-tube. The model includes the relevant primary parameter, fits the experimental data well, and is sufficiently accurate for engineering purposes. The standard deviation of the data is less than 7 per cent. The reported results enable a practical design with standard products and optimization of the geometry of the <b>flexible</b> <b>corrugated</b> U-tube for specific conditions...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two basic}} {{variants}} of <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> that differ in their type of corrugation: annular corrugation and helical corrugation. In hoses with helical corrugation, usually a right-handed coil with a constant pitch that runs along the whole length of the hose.The annular corrugation, on the other hand, consists {{of a large number}} of equally-spaced parallel corrugations whose main plane is perpendicular to the hose axis. Hoses with annular corrugation have decided advantages over those with helical corrugation: ...|$|R

50|$|In addition, <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> can be {{manufactured}} {{by a special}} method that {{is closely related to}} the manufacture of stripwound hoses. In this procedure, the starting strip is given a corrugated profile in a longitudinal direction. This profile strip is then wound helically and the overlapping coils are tightly welded along the helical seam. After corrugation, the hose may be equipped with a braided sheath (see below). In this case, the hose then passes through a braiding machine that has circumferential wire coil holders, or so-called bobbins.|$|R
50|$|The <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose</b> of the {{inflator}} assembly {{should be}} {{long enough to}} easily dump air from the bladder and no longer, as this {{makes it difficult to}} streamline. The inflator mechanism must not be a high flow type. These use a non-standard connector, and can fill the wing dangerously quickly if the valve sticks open. It is easier to deal with a runaway inflation on a low flow rate inflator. A pull dump valve on the inflation manifold is an unnecessary additional point of failure.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{variant of}} the metal hose {{can be attributed to}} the inventor Siegfried Frank of Frankfurt, Germany. In 1894, he patented the method of rolling a helical corrugation into a smooth rigid pipe. Heinrich Witzenmann had already made experiments in this direction several years earlier, but did not continue his efforts to create a patentable result. It wasn't until the twenties and thirties of the 20th century that the hotel administrator Albert Dreyer of Lucerne, Switzerland, succeeded in creating a satisfactory annular corrugation for the manufacture of metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{flexibility}} of the hose is achieved {{by means of the}} elastic behaviour of the corrugation profile. When the hose is bent, the outer corrugations separate while the inner corrugations are squeezed together. The flexibility, bending behaviour and pressure stability of <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> depend on the selected profile shape. While flexibility increases with an increase in profile height and a decrease in corrugation spacing, pressure resistance decreases. The frequently required semi-flexible bending behaviour is achieved by flat profiles. Depending {{on the use of the}} hose, special application-specific profile shapes can be implemented ...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} {{contributes to}} the LNG supply chain {{by the development of}} a validated calculation model for <b>corrugated</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> or pipes developed for LNG Transfer. The model builds upon experience gained by TNO Technical Sciences (Fluid Dynamics) in a large number of flow tests carried out on hoses in a large range of diameters from 4 to 18 -inch. LNG transfer rates are in general relatively high as the time involved should be limited from economical point of view. In large scale offshore LNG transfer, flow rates up to 5000 m 3 /h are applied and in future flow rates up to 10. 000 m 3 /h are foreseen. Typical values mentioned for offshore operations in tandem transfer range from 50 to 150 meters hose length and hose diameter up to 20 -inch. The pressure losses in LNG offshore transfer, but also in smaller scale applications, can be considerable. The pressure loss depends on flow rate, length of the hose, internal diameter and internal hose corrugation geometry. High pressure losses will impose additional requirements on LNG pumps and might result in cavitation at the downstream end of the hose as the average pressure drops below vapor pressure. Furthermore the impact of local boiling phenomena due to heat-ingress and cavitation, possibly effected by vortex shedding along the internal corrugations, is not known. Once the gaps in the data base are filled a validated prediction model is available, which can be used in guidelines and standards. So far the EN 1474 (part 2 : Design and testing of transfer hoses) does not specify a maximum allowable pressure loss and the prescription of the requirement for the test is limited: "Flow rate testing (ambient or cryogenic) : demonstrate that the hose is capable of operating at its maximum flow rate and confirm the predicted head loss " The final goal of the project is to obtain a validated prediction model for the calculation of pressure losses in LNG transfer with flexible multi-composite and metal hoses based on input of parameters as operating conditions and hose geometry. Also input for guidelines and standards in LNG transfer with flexibles such as EN 1474 will be generated, which can be used in for qualification of LNG equipment...|$|R

50|$|To {{increase}} pressure resistance, metal hoses can {{be equipped}} with one- or two-layer braiding. The braiding is firmly connected to the hose fittings on both sides to absorb the longitudinal forces caused by internal pressure.

Hose braiding consists of right- and left-handed wrapped wire bundles that are alternately layered one over the other. This not only prevents hose lengthening due to internal pressure, but also absorbs external tensile forces and protects the outside of the hose. The basic material of the wire braid is usually {{the same as that of}} the <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose.</b> It is also possible to select different materials in the interest of greater corrosion resistance or for economic considerations.|$|R
