Before 1903, the latest attempted use of Jus exclusivae was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the 1846 conclave, but the cardinal the Austrian Emperor had entrusted to issue the veto arrived too late, finding the conclave over and that Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti, the man he was meant to veto, publicly announced as Pope Pius IX.|$|E

2500|$|Rather than {{accepting}} {{responsibility for}} a transgression through {{the form of an}} apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications. [...] While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to minimize blame by focusing on a transgressor’s inability to control their actions (e.g., “How would I have known my exgirlfriend was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the party.”) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., “I went to lunch with my exgirlfriend because I did not want to hurt her feelings.”). [...] Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe. [...] For example, a transgressor may justify having lunch with a past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the lunch meeting was of no major consequence (e.g., “We are just friends.”).|$|E
