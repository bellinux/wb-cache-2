This road {{contains}} many shops, including a large Co-op store, and, uphill to the east, {{it leads to}} the A610 to Nottingham, the M1 motorway, and Giltbrook Retail Park, which {{is home to a}} large IKEA store, and various projected developments (see Future plans). At the western end of Eastwood is a gyratory system, consisting of an ancient crossroads converted into a traffic island, around the Sun Inn public house.

500|$|As Ross {{became the}} focal point of the Supremes, Ballard felt pushed aside in the group. Depression ensued, and Ballard began to drink excessively, gaining weight until she could no longer comfortably wear many of her stage outfits. The friendship, and later the working relationship, between Ross and Ballard became strained. During this {{turbulent}} period, Ballard relied heavily upon the advice of group mate Mary Wilson, with whom she had maintained a close friendship. Wilson, while outwardly demure and neutral in hopes of keeping the group stable, privately advised Ballard that Ross and Gordy were eager to oust Ballard.

[...] The four reviewers of EGM hailed the SNES version as a [...] "near-perfect" [...] translation of the arcade game. While commenting that its graphics and sounds are {{not as good as}} those of the SNES version, they held the Genesis version to be an outstanding port as well. A reviewer for The Baltimore Sun called the SNES version [...] "the best game I've ever played - a true translation," [...] while Patterson noted it was the bloodiest game Nintendo has yet allowed to be released.|$|E

500|$|My Truth was {{released}} in Sweden on 17 May 1999 through BMG Sweden. Around this time, RCA Records, Robyn's international label, were formulating the marketing plans for the album in the United States; the initial reports anticipated the release of an airplay single in September 1999, followed by the album in January 2000. Due to the inclusion of two songs that reflected on the abortion incident, RCA asked Robyn to re-record portions of the album for the American market and pop radio. On top of this, American music magazine Billboard published an article in June 1999 that falsely claimed she had a miscarriage rather than an abortion. Ultimately, Robyn refused to alter the record and a compromise was not reached. The negotiations {{came to an end}} after six months and the plans to release My Truth abroad were cancelled. Robyn's manager Alex Strehl said, [...] "I guess Robyn had moved in a direction that [...] didn't expect." [...] According to Robyn, the label wanted an album like Robyn <b>Is</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> thus were not interested in investing in My Truth. In 2001, she parted ways with RCA and entered a new record deal with Jive Records and Zomba.|$|E

After the final helix, the train passes over the Rivertown midway a second time and drops into the splashdown finale, slowing the train down and leading it into the final brake run. After braking, the train takes a left U-turn and heads back into the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 3 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Bonifacio works. Probably one of {{the best}} works done inside the Katipunan was written by Andrés Bonifacio, the Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa (Love of Fatherland), a poem of sincere {{patriotic}} sentiment. Pag-ibig was published in the Kalayaan only issue of January 1896 under his nom-de-plume Agapito Bagumbayan. According to Manuel Artigas y Cuerva, the name Agapito Bagumbayan was a corruption of combination agap-ito, bagum-bayan, which, if translated from Tagalog to English word by word, means [...] "the new nation <b>is</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> ready. There is no known original source of Pag-ibig, especially that there is no surviving Kalayaan issue. The two available texts accessible reprinted through books is the one published by Jose P. Santos in 1935. The other one, with familiar discrepancies to Santos' print, was archived in military annals of Madrid.|$|E
2500|$|In 1918, Karen Blixen met the English {{big game}} hunter Denys Finch Hatton (1887–1931), an English army officer from an upper-class background. He often {{travelled}} {{back and forth}} between Africa and England, and visited her occasionally. After her separation from her husband she and Finch Hatton developed a close friendship, which eventually became a long-term love affair. In a letter to her brother Thomas in 1924, she wrote: [...] "I believe that for all time and eternity I am bound to Denys, to love the ground he walks upon, to be happy beyond words when he <b>is</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> to suffer worse than death many times when he leaves..." [...] But other letters in her collections show that the relationship was unstable, and that Blixen's increasing dependence upon Finch Hatton, who was intensely independent, was an issue.|$|E
2500|$|On April 30, 2008, Iolani Palace was {{overtaken}} {{by a group}} of native Hawaiians who called themselves the Hawaiian Kingdom Government to protest what they view as illegitimate rule by the United States.

[...] "The Hawaiian Kingdom Government <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> it doesn't plan to leave. This is a continuity of the Hawaiian Kingdom of 1892 to today," [...] Kahau said. Friends of Iolani Palace released a statement stating: [...] "We respect the freedom of Hawaiian groups to hold an opinion on the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, we believe that blocking public access to Iolani Palace is wrong and certainly detrimental to our mission to share the Palace and its history with our residents, our keiki (children), and our visitors." ...|$|E

Also on Memri-TV, McKinney stated [...] "On a previous visit to Libya, I was able to learn about the Green Book, and the form of direct democracy that is advocated in The Green Book. When I went back to the United States, I spoke with Senator Mike Gravel, who was a presidential candidate, just like me, in 2008, because he too is pushing a form of direct democracy for the United States.

2500|$|The Michigan Alumnus {{published}} {{a letter from}} another Michigan athlete, Cecil F. Cross, recalling memories of football in Ann Arbor:"The autumn is approaching here. The days are getting shorter {{and there is a}} chill in the air ... It seems to bring back the old feeling which is experienced where the smell of football is in the air, the first cold days of autumn and it makes me homesick, though only slightly. Ralph Henning, of Bay City, <b>is</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> though we come from different parts of Michigan and attended different schools, he being the captain of the Michigan Aggies' football team in 1916, we quite frequently talk over the old scenes with which we are both familiar. He, too, has mentioned the feeling of football in the air. If they were to train an army of football players and throw them into the lines, the last weeks of October, with Coach Yost to address them just before the battle, we would score a touchdown the first half, and before Thanksgiving we would have pushed the Germans under their own goal posts and eat dinner in Berlin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Presently, {{the trail}} officially ends, and is blocked off at, the lower {{of the two}} falls. However, the former {{treadway}} is still usable, and many visitors continue past the brush pile {{to get closer to}} the falls. Some venture into the natural amphitheater behind the falls, and it <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> from the ledge above the falls that more than one hiker has fallen to death. The height of the upper interior rim of the upper falls amphitheater is deceptively high and the footing is tenuous. [...] During 2004 a Putnam County woman sued the state over injuries sustained by her fall into the pool {{from the top of the}} falls, arguing the state had a responsibility to put a barrier there. Four years later a state Court of Claims judge ruled against her, saying the danger [...] "was open and obvious to anyone employing the reasonable use of her senses". The trail's junction with the current Escarpment Trail route just past the Laurel House site is also readily apparent due to the rock pile used to block it and the wood pole that once held mileage signs. It, too, is still used unofficially to reach the waterfalls.|$|E
