The program is facilitated by the Nigeria Strategy Support Program of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (FMAWR) and funded by the Canadian International Development Agency. APSF was launched in August 2007, and on September 20, 2007 a workshop was organized that brought together stakeholders to discuss the emerging issues in agriculture policy and the implementation of the APSF. The objectives of this stakeholders workshop were: to discuss the emerging issues for agricultural policy in Nigeria and how APSF can support these issues; to share information on the APSF Program and its initial activities; to receive feedback on these initial activities; and to initiate discussions on year- 2 activities. This workshop was held at the Chelsea Hotel in Abuja, Nigeria on September 20 2007. There were more than 70 participants from FMAWR, other ministries and agencies, farmer organizations, development partners, academia, and the private sector (see appendices A and B for the agenda and participants list). The workshop opened with remarks from Ms. Pepple, Permanent Secretary, FMAWR; Ms. Julia Bracken, Head of Cooperation, Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA); and Dr. Shenggen <b>Fan,</b> <b>Division</b> Director, IFPRI.

For the rest of the 1980s Villa were lacklustre. In 1993 Villa finished 2nd in the inaugural season of the Premier League. In the nineties Villa won two League Cups but League finishes were inconsistent. 2006 was a year of change at Villa as Martin O'Neill was brought in and after 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder, Doug Ellis sold his stake in Aston Villa to Randy Lerner.|$|R

40|$|College and {{professional}} sports depend on fans. Female fans constitute a lucrative but often neglected demographic {{in the sport}} industry. While marketers and advertisers recognize {{the power of the}} female customer, many sport organizations marginalize female fans by virtue of omission. Given the multi-dimensional nature of the female sport fan and the growth potential of the fan base, the sport industry must pay attention. This makes good sense not only ethically and socially, but economically as well since this demographic is steadily growing while the male fan base remains stable. The current study examined consumer practices and attitudes of female fans at professional and Division I college revenue sporting events during the 2013 - 14 season. Over 900 female <b>fans</b> of NCAA <b>Division</b> I revenue sports (football, men’s basketball, women’s basketball), professional basketball {{and professional}} hockey were interviewed regarding both consumer choices and their perceived value as fans. Results indicate specific expressed needs and preferences of female fans. Of great interest is the preponderance of female college-sport fans who declared themselves as valued “long-time fans” compared to the relatively short-time nature of the professional sport fans.

The teams annually opened their seasons against one another at Memorial Stadium from then through the 2004 season. In 2005, the series took another brief hiatus when Mississippi College began preparing for a potential move to Division II, where they could grant athletic scholarships. This move never came to fruition, however, and the series resumed in 2006, again as an opening week contest but with the games alternating between the schools' campuses. The renewed rivalry has been hotly contested. In 11 games since 2000, the average margin of victory is 9.8 points; 10 of those games have been decided by 13 points or less, with an average victory margin of 5.7 points. Five of the Six meetings since 2006 have been decided by 6 points or fewer, including two games that required overtime to determine a winner (2009 and 2011).
