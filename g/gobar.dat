5000|$|<b>Gobar</b> {{embarked}} on a professional career in wrestling in 1910 {{at the age of}} eighteen. He debuted against Navrang Singh, the court wrestler of the Maharaja of Tripura, but he didn't take any money. In 1910, the John Bull Society of London organised a world wrestling championship bout to which wrestlers {{from all over the world}} including <b>Gobar</b> Goho and junior Gama of India were invited. In his first tour of Europe, <b>Gobar</b> fought bouts in Italy, Switzerland and England. <b>Gobar</b> went on a second tour of Europe in 1912 and returned home in 1915. During the trip he met Jack Johnson, the first black world heavyweight boxing champion at the wrestling tournament in Paris. [...] Next he defeated Campbell, the highest-ranked wrestler of Scotland. His next bout was against Scottish strongman and wrestler Jimmy Esson of Aberdeen, who has been described by the great strongman and wrestler Georg Hackenschmidt as 'the Scotch Giant'. Esson was at the receiving end throughout the fight and in the end resorted to illegal boxing punches. <b>Gobar</b> remained undeterred and duly wrestled the 'giant' on to the ground. After the War, <b>Gobar</b> went on a third tour of Europe and the United States from 1920 to 1926. During this tour, he fought the bout of his lifetime, when he disposed off the then World Light Heavyweight Champion and catch wrestler Ad Santel on 30 August 1921 at the Coliseum in San Francisco. He became the first Asian to win a World Professional Wrestling Championship in the United States. In his next bout he was pitted against the famous Ed 'Strangler' Lewis, considered by many to be the greatest ever professional wrestler. Lewis first tried his famous headlock on <b>Gobar</b> but to little effect. After a few rounds, Lewis managed to floor <b>Gobar</b> once, but the latter soon returned the compliment. Both fighters had registered two falls each, when Lewis resorted to foul play by hitting <b>Gobar</b> with a boxer’s punch. When the referee overlooked this offence, <b>Gobar</b> turned to the judges to remonstrate, but at this moment, Lewis floored <b>Gobar</b> with a resounding thump, causing him to hit his head on the boards and lose consciousness. In 1929, <b>Gobar</b> fought another memorable fight against the younger Gama at Park Circus, Kolkata in a bout that has since passed into the folklore of Indian wrestling. After a stirring fight which showcased all the moves of Indian wrestling, the older <b>Gobar</b> finally lost on a technicality.The akhada that was established by his ancestors at Masjidbari Street was reincarnated by <b>Gobar</b> Goho at Goabagan in 1936. <b>Gobar</b> Goho retired from professional wrestling in 1944.|$|E

40|$|Chapter 232 of Photius' Bibliotheca is {{dedicated}} to the book by "a certain Stephen, tritheist, a. k. a. Gobar": we can gather no more information about him from other sources. Recent research proposed an effective interpretation of some of <b>Gobar's</b> thoughts on the background of sixth-century theological controversies in Egypt: now we may better perceive what his work may have been like, although it stays somehow mysterious; and we may also grasp the reasons why Photius had such a lively interest in debates arising from Origen's eschatological doctrines. Some issues raised by the iconoclastic controversy - one may assume - sparked Photius' interest in the nature and consistency of the glorious body...|$|R

50|$|<b>Gobar</b> (reign 1675-1675) was {{the king}} of the Ahom kingdom for a {{duration}} of about three weeks. He was the first king from Tungkhungia line of Ahom dynasty, and the father of Gadadhar Singha, a later Ahom king. He was installed by Debera Borbarua, a powerful officer in the capital Garhgaon. <b>Gobar</b> was the last king installed by Debera before both were removed and executed by the Saraighatia Ahom officers under the leadership of Atan Burhagohain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gobar</b> Goho {{developed}} his own style of wrestling which took Indian wrestling into newer heights. His style included his own wrestling holds like dhonka, tibbi, gadhanet, dhak, tang, pat, dhobiya pat and kulla which {{later became a}} {{part and parcel of}} Indian wrestling. He was famous for his vicious chops known as radda. His achievements and success inspired Bengali Hindus to take up wrestling as a career which was seen as the traditional bastion of Punjabi Muslims. Not only wrestlers but the famous body builders like Manohar Aich and Monotosh Roy were inspired by his successes. His own disciples included his son Manik and his students Banamali Ghosh, Jyotish Charan Ghosh and Biswanath Dutta. His followers observed his birth centenary in 1992. Goabagan Street in North Kolkata has been named <b>Gobar</b> Goho Sarani in his honour. His statue was installed and unveiled at the Azad Hind Bagh in 1996 by the then Governor of West Bengal, Late Raghunath Reddy. On the current day his akhada <b>Gobar</b> Goho's Gymnasium runs firmly at 19/D/H/7, <b>Gobar</b> Goho Sarani, Kolkata-700006. The nearest prominent landmark is the Scottish Church College.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gobar</b> ruled for a {{very short}} {{duration}} {{during the period of}} ministerial supremacy in Ahom kingdom. Since Debera Borbarua held the real authority, <b>Gobar</b> was nothing more than mere figurehead in the affairs of the royal court. The circumstances which allowed <b>Gobar</b> to sit on the throne were also responsible for his deposition and death. His short reign witnessed the fall of the ministerial dictatorship of Debera Borbarua and the rise of Atan Burhagohain at Garhgaon. Even though Gobar’s reign was very short, he will be remembered as the first king from the famous Tungkhungia branch of Royal Ahom dynasty, as his son Gadadhar Singha firmly established the power of monarch in 1681 putting an end to the period of ministerial supremacy. The Tungkhungia branch of Ahom dynasty would reign for the remaining period of Ahom rule till 1826.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile <b>Gobar</b> Raja {{had been}} deposed {{and kept in}} {{confinement}} at Haithaguri. After finishing their affairs with Debera Borbarua, Atan Burhagohain held consultations with other nobles. The nobles offered the crown to Atan Burhagohain and declared their intention to make him the king, but Burhagohain gently declined the offer stating that only members of Royal Ahom Dynasty, the direct descendants of Sukaphaa were alone eligible to become kings. Therefore he nominated a prince from Namrupia branch of Royal Ahom Dynasty, named Arjun Konwar as {{the king of the}} Ahom kingdom. Atan Burhagohain held consultations with the new king and other nobles and decided to get rid of <b>Gobar.</b> <b>Gobar</b> was transferred to a place called Bhogbari, where he along with his younger brother Nisaranga Gohain was put to death. This happened on 23rd of May 1675.|$|E

5000|$|... "Gobar" [...] is the Hindi and Nepali {{word for}} cow dung." [...] It {{was chosen to}} capture the eco-philosophy and {{tradition}} of generating wealth from waste. Waste <b>gobar</b> serves as an insecticide and is used to plaster mud houses and is a waterproof coating for walls. It {{is also used to}} plaster floors to keep them cool. <b>Gobar</b> is the energy source for rural India. It is used as cooking fuel where people have no access to fuels like LPG. The greatest use of cow dung in India is in farming where it is used as natural manure for farmers' crops. In short, it's a mainstay of rural India, and an appropriate symbol for eco-friendly technology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gobar</b> {{came from}} a family of wrestlers.

He also took lessons from his uncle Khetra Charan Goho and father Ram Charan Goho. He began rigorous training under the famous Indian wrestlers like Kholsa Chaubey and Rahmani Pehlwan, who were employed by the Goho family. When <b>Gobar</b> reached adulthood he stood at six feet and one inch and weighed around 290 pounds. His expanded chest measured 48 inches.
