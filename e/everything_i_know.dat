I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, {{he was the only}} virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about the piano.|$|E

It was said that Duff Gordon had trained her {{to act like a}} Duchess. Diana Vreeland commented, [...] "I remember his [...] girls so vividly. Dolores was the greatest of them – a totally Gothic English beauty. She was very highly paid just to walk across the stage – and the whole place would go to pieces. It was a good walk I can tell you – it had such fluidity and grace. <b>Everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about walking comes from watching Ziegfeld's girls." ...|$|E

According to Geelong player Sam Newman, “without speaking one word he [...] taught me <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> I watched how a man overcomes not the physical, not the mental, but the spiritual – that’s the most important – he was an absolute star, about one decade, one century ahead of his time”.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Morton stated that he asked Cruise for {{an interview}}, but was turned down: [...] "I asked Tom for an interview and he declined. The Church of Scientology has got a very controversial reputation and that is what he is linked with. An unauthorized biography would essentially be a compromise … I want to investigate it without any kind of fetters." [...] Morton consulted with private investigator and former adult film actor Paul Baressi, who investigated Cruise's private life. [...] He also consulted with Los Angeles, California attorney Graham Berry. [...] Baressi stated he had begun investigating Cruise after his marriage to Nicole Kidman ended, but after six years of research on the actor {{had not been able to}} find any evidence that Cruise was gay. [...] Baressi gave all of his research to Morton, and later told InTouch magazine: [...] "Everything I have found, and <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> points to Tom being heterosexual." [...] Morton also traveled to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to interview people who knew Cruise when he was filming Cocktail. [...] Several Paramount Pictures employees were interviewed about Cruise's termination by Sumner Redstone. [...] The book had initially been planned for a February 2006 publication date.|$|E

2500|$|Yzerman's first {{off-season}} with Tampa Bay {{began with}} a splash. With the sixth pick of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, the Lightning selected forward Brett Connolly despite a history of injuries while playing for the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Prince George Cougars. When asked about Connolly's injuries being {{a factor in the}} decision to draft him, Yzerman boldly declared, [...] "I think it was a factor that he was available with the 6th pick. Because if he had been healthy all year, based on <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> he would not have been available with the 6th pick." [...] On July 1, 2010, veteran blueliner Andrej Meszaros was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for their second round pick in 2011. Later that day, the Lightning signed their star winger Martin St. Louis to a four-year, $22.5million contract extension to come into effect on July 1, 2011. On July 19, in another move with the Flyers organization, the Lightning traded defenseman Matt Walker and Tampa Bay's fourth round pick in 2011 for high-scoring winger Simon Gagne. Other off-season acquisitions included the signing of forwards Sean Bergenheim, Dominic Moore and Marc-Antoine Pouliot, along with defensemen Brett Clark, Randy Jones and Pavel Kubina and goaltender Dan Ellis, as well as the re-signing of restricted free agent forward Steve Downie to a two-year, $3.7million deal.|$|E
