5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is {{faster and more}} power efficient than its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 video card. The benchmarks were performed on the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 workstation card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three {{times faster than the}} Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes more power than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as <b>energy</b> <b>efficient</b> as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as <b>energy</b> <b>efficient</b> as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees Celsius when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at full load.|$|E

5|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>efficient</b> and {{sustainability}} features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more <b>energy</b> <b>efficient</b> and helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E

Other environmental friendly amenities include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, infrared bathroom fixtures, and the use of recycled building materials among other items.|$|E

The measure enabled the addition of renovated science classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and media center, and a sound-proofed music building.

5|$|On July 28, 2007, UN {{officials}} announced the complex would undergo a $1 billion renovation {{starting in the}} fall. Swedish firm Skanska AB won a bid to overhaul the buildings which including the Conference, General Assembly and Secretariat buildings. The renovations, {{which will be the}} first since the complex opened in 1950, are expected to take about 7 years to complete. When completed the complex is also expected to be more <b>energy</b> <b>efficient</b> and have improved security. Work began on May 5, 2008 but the project was delayed for a while. By 2009 the cost of the work had risen from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion with some estimates saying it would take up to $3 billion. Officials hope the renovated buildings will achieve a LEED Silver rating. Despite some delays and rises in construction costs, renovation on the entire UN headquarters is progressing rapidly. As of 2012, the installation of the new glass facade of the Secretariat Building is completed. The new glass wall will retain the look of the original facade but it will be more <b>energy</b> <b>efficient.</b> The renovation of the Secretariat building has been complete and the UN staff moved into the new building in July 2012.|$|E
5|$|The forelimb {{bones of}} azhdarchids and ornithocheirids were unusually long {{compared}} to other pterosaurs, and, in azhdarchids, {{the bones of the}} arm and hand (metacarpals) were particularly elongated. Furthermore, as a whole, azhdarchid front limbs were proportioned similarly to fast-running ungulate mammals. Their hind limbs, on the other hand, were not built for speed, but they were long compared with most pterosaurs, and allowed for a long stride length. While azhdarchid pterosaurs probably could not run, they would have been relatively fast and <b>energy</b> <b>efficient.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more <b>energy</b> <b>efficient</b> than {{other means of}} {{locomotion}} when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more <b>energy</b> <b>efficient</b> equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E
