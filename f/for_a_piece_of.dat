25|$|While his {{teaching}} abilities were widely acknowledged, Hanson struggled to gain recognition for his talents as a composer {{for much of}} his career, as his music was often unpopular with the audience at that time and also unfashionable. He was fifty-four years old before receiving his first commission <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> music, and many of his works lay unperformed for many decades. Part of the problem lay with his independence of mind. Hanson ignored prevailing trends in the pursuit of his own muse. In the 1940s and 1950s, his work was regarded by his Australian contemporaries as too avant-garde, but by the 1960s it was being dismissed as not avant-garde enough. Hanson's rejection of serialism, responsible for the latter dismissal, was ultimately vindicated by history, but this vindication came late in his career.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} generates about 29,000 jobs {{directly and}} indirectly. Certified production amounts {{to more than}} 2 million liters; 434,000 liters are exported, generating 21 million dollars in income. To truly be called mezcal, the liquor must come from certain areas. States that have certified mezcal agave growing areas with production facilities are Durango, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Oaxaca, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas. About 30 species of agave are certified {{for use in the}} production of mezcal. Oaxaca has 570 of the 625 mezcal production facilities in Mexico, but some in-demand mezcals come from Guerrero, as well. In Tamaulipas, 11 municipalities have received authorization to produce authentic mezcal with the hopes of competing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> both the Mexican national and international markets. The agave used here is agave Americano, agave verde or maguey de la Sierra, which are native to the state.|$|E
25|$|Mizraab {{was formed}} in Karachi, Sindh, in 1997 by vocalist, lead guitarist and {{songwriter}} Faraz Anwar, who then recruited Akhtar Qayyum on percussions and Khalid Khan on bass guitar. The name of the band was given by Faraz's father, the word being Persian <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> metal worn on the finger while playing sitar. The trio then after a struggle of two years went on recording and releasing the band's debut album, Panchi, in April 1999. The album included fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship that placed them {{as one of the}} pioneers of progressive metal music in Pakistan. The release of the album also earned the band a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim and thus the album was regarded as the first progressive rock album in the country.|$|E

25|$|European art {{music is}} largely {{distinguished}} from many other non-European classical and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 11th century. Western staff notation {{is used by}} composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (which form the melodies, basslines and chords), tempo, metre and rhythms <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the fugue, concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera.|$|E
25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; {{they were his}} own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point {{in a conversation with}} a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E

5000|$|A {{numbering}} system {{is used to}} describe the various weights of duck cloth, based on the weight of a 36 × 22 in piece. Weights below 19 ounces are called numbered duck.

Furthermore, straight lines rarely occur in global communications situations, and delays are created when the signal passes through an electronic switch or signal regenerator.|$|E

The piece was later included in Hemingway's collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories published in October 1938, and in two collections of short stories published after his death, The Nick Adams Stories (1972) and [...] (1987). The fragment Hemingway cut was published posthumously as a separate short story titled [...] "On Writing" [...] in 1972 in The Nick Adams Stories.|$|E
