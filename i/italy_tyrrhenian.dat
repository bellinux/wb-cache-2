40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{different}} Mediterranean habitats on spine and gonad colouring and gonadal index in the purple sea urchin ea and the gonad index of the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Echinodermata: Echinoidea). Specimens were collected in winter 2012 in Posidonia oceanica meadows and rocky bottom areas at two sites in Southern Sardinia (<b>Italy,</b> <b>Tyrrhenian</b> Sea). Colorimetric analyses of spines and gonads were conducted with a digital colorimeter using CIELAB colour spaces, which defines the colour in terms of three coordinate values: lightness (L*), redness (a*) and yellowness (b*). Lightness and redness of the spines differed significantly between habitats, whereas colour spaces of the gonads did not. A careful analysis of the gonad index showed it to be significantly affected by habitat, registering higher values in rocky bottom locations. In conclusion, it seems that habitat does affect spine colour but not gonad colour. Spine colour seems to be site-dependent, whereas the gonad index depends solely on the habitat. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{analysed}} {{the life}} cycle and {{some aspects of the}} reproductive biology of the talitrid amphipod Macarorchestia remyi (Schellenberg, 1950) on a sandy beach in central <b>Italy</b> (<b>Tyrrhenian</b> Sea). The species is strongly associated with rotting wood carried by the sea. The animals were sampled once a month by hand over 1 year (May 2006 -April 2007) and a total of 3, 484 individuals were collected. Results showed the occurrence of intersexes in addition to males and females (n = 268) and a sex ratio always in favour of females. Breeding peaked twice during the year and the number of eggs in the ventral brood chamber ranged from 3 to 19. Linear regression analysis showed a positive correlation between total length of ovigerous females and the number of eggs they carried. The mean length of both mature males and mature females was 6 mm, while the maximum length was 13 mm. The presence of two cohorts during the year was also identified. Our results suggest that, despite the ephemeral habitats where the species lives, the population is stable over time and its life cycle does not differ in relation to other talitrid species that live on beaches...|$|E

A magnetic anomaly map of the Gulf of Naples has been constructed aimed at highlighting new knowledge on geophysics and volcanology of this area of the Eastern Tyrrhenian margin, characterized by a complex geophysical setting, strongly depending on sea bottom topography. The theoretical aspects of marine magnetometry and multibeam bathymetry have been discussed. Magnetic data processing included the correction of the data for the diurnal variation, the correction of the data for the offset and the leveling of the data {{as a function of the}} correction at the cross-points of the navigation lines. Multibeam and single-beam bathymetric data processing has been considered. Magnetic anomaly fields in the Naples Bay have been discussed through a detailed geological interpretation and correlated with main morpho-structural features recognized through morphobathymetric interpretation.

Differences between the various communities of these grasslands in the European continent have not been fully investigated; in Italy, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge of the mesophilous pastures in the central and southern Apennines. In order to shed light on the Cynosurion hay meadows and grasslands in the central Apennines, we considered phytosociological data from the Lepini and Prenestini mountains (central <b>Italy,</b> <b>Tyrrhenian</b> sector) : 58 original releves and a synoptic table containing similar associations throughout the Italian peninsula were analysed using multivariate methods (hierarchical classifications and principal coordinates analysis). Two new associations were distinguished: Hordeum bulbosum meadows, grazed after being mown (Trifolio molinerii-Hordeetum bulbosi), and heavily grazed, unmown pastures with several thorny species (Centaureo calcitrapae-Lolietum perennis). Both these associations have been assigned to Cynosurion cristati, though they differ from the European coenoses owing to the presence of Festuco-Brometea and Helianthemetea guttati species. Further investigations are warranted to clarify the overall syntaxonomical position of the Italian coenoses in relation to the ecological and phytogeographic variations of Cynosurion, which are considered to be related to traditional land use in mountain agricultural systems.

Biological assessments revealed clearly distinct phases, elucidating the definitive shift of this human-induced coastal lake from a freshwater to a marine-influenced lagoon ecosystem. Records of marine subfossil taxa suggest that previous accommodations to these environmental features have already occurred in the past, in agreement with historical evidence. Faunal and ecological insights are offered for its current malacofauna, and special emphasis is given to alien species.

50|$|Nonetheless, in Italy, the war {{was devastating}} to the {{urbanized}} society that {{was supported by a}} settled hinterland. The great cities of Rome and her allies were abandoned as Italy fell into a long period of decline. The impoverishment of Italy and the drain on the Empire made it impossible for the Byzantines to hold Italy. Imperial gains were fleeting: only three years after the death of Justinian, the mainland Italian territories fell into the hands of a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, leaving the Exarchate of Ravenna, a band of territory that stretched across central <b>Italy</b> to the <b>Tyrrhenian</b> Sea and south to Naples, along with parts of southern Italy, as the only remaining Imperial holdings. Justinian also managed to carve out an Imperial domain in Southern Hispania, but that too would be conquered by Germanic tribes a few decades later.

Rome itself would remain under imperial control until the Exarchate of Ravenna was finally conquered by the Lombards in 751.

40|$|We present new {{wellbore}} breakout {{data from}} oil exploration wells drilled in southern Peninsular <b>Italy,</b> from the <b>Tyrrhenian</b> shelf through the Apenninic mountain belt and foredeep, eastward to the undeformed Adria foreland. From {{the analysis of}} 64 wells, we observe Shmin oriented around NE-SW, perpendicular to the trend of the Apennines, both within the belt and in the eastern foredeep. Some variations are observed in the few wells analyzed on the Tyrrhenian shelf, possibly due to local tectonic structures, such as transverse NE-SW oriented extensional basins. The Apulian platform overthrust by the Apenninic mountains at 3 - 4 km depth, shows a very consistent direction of Shmin oriented N 40 °- 50 °E, {{in agreement with the}} stress regime inferred from focal mechanisms of strong earthquakes at depths of 10 - 15 km, which show NE extension, mostly accomplished by normal faulting. The overlying sedimentary and allochthonous units of the Apenninic belt exhibit the same NE Shmin direction, but show a larger scatter. Breakout data demonstrate that Quaternary compressional tectonism has ended, as Shmin is oriented NE also in the undeformed foreland as far as 50 km NE from the seismic belt.

Local and regional growth responses to climate were examined using a dendroclimatic analysis. To remove the age-dependent trend we decomposed the tree ring width data into age-bands, thereafter standardised and recombined into a single mean site chronology. & Results The main grouping of tree ring series reflected climate-driven growth patterns, with a clear separation be-tween stands from wetter and drier sites. The most interesting results were found at a seasonal scale and showed i) a shift of the main precipitation inputs from previous autumn-winter to current early-spring period, and ii) a bimodal pattern of sen-sitivity to water availability, when increasing drought conditions. & Conclusion Our findings suggest that water deficit limits P. pinea growth also during late summer months in drier sites. In view of the projected increases in the frequency and dura-tion of summer droughts in the Mediterranean basin, detecting differences in growth responses to site-specific climate patterns may allow selection of more appropriate miti-gation and conservation strategies across most of its present range...|$|R
5000|$|Cassius Dio gave a {{different}} account of Pyrrhus’ march towards Rome. In his version, {{it was a}} march in <b>Tyrrhenian</b> <b>Italy.</b> Publius Valerius Laevinus found out that Pyrrhus wanted to seize Capua (in Campania) and garrisoned it. Pyrrhus {{set out for the}} nearby Neapolis (Naples), but he did not accomplish anything and passed on through Etruria [...] "with the object of winning the people there also to his cause." [...] According to Zonaras, Pyrrhus saw that the Etruscans had made a treaty with the Romans, Tiberius Coruncanius, the other consul for 280 BC, was moving towards him and Laevinius was dogging his footsteps. He [...] "became afraid of being cut off on all sides." [...] He withdrew and got close to Campania. Laevinus confronted him with an army which was now larger and [...] "he declared that the Roman legions when cut to pieces grew whole again, hydra-fashion." [...] Pyrrhus declined to join a battle and went back to Tarentum. Because of the fragmentary nature of the surviving texts of Cassius Dio and Zonaras, the dating of these events is uncertain. It could be after Cineas’ trip to Rome. Cassius Dio wrote that the Romans sent another army to Laevinus, who, after seeing to the wounded, followed Pyrrhus and harassed him. They also recalled Tiberius Coruncanius from Etruria and assigned him to guard Rome.|$|R

The coupling of a data-assimilative nested ocean modeling system with an acoustic propagation modeling syste was carried out at sea for the first time, {{within the scope of}} Battlespace Preparation 2007 (BP 07) that was part of Marine Rapid Environmental Assessment (MREA 07) exercises. The littoral region for our studies was southeast of the island of Elba (<b>Italy)</b> in the <b>Tyrrhenian</b> basin east of Corsica and Sardinia. During BP 07, several vessels collected in situ ocean data, based in part on recommendations from oceanographic forecasts. The data were assimilated into a four-dimensional high-resolution ocean modeling system. Sound-speed forecasts were then used as inputs for bearing- and range-dependent acoustic propagation forecasts. Data analyses are carried out and the set-up of the coupled oceanographic-acoustic system as well as the results of its real-time use are described. A significant finding is that oceanographic variability can considerably influence acoustic propagation properties, including the probability of detection, even in this apparently quiet region around Elba. This strengthens the importance of coupling at-sea acoustic modeling to real-time ocean forecasting. Other findings include the challenges involved in downscaling basin-scale modeling systems to high-resolution littoral models, especially in the Mediterranean Sea.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to analyse {{the local and}} {{regional}} variability in the density and typology of marine debris on fishing grounds on the northern Mediterranean continental shelf, and to test relationships between marine litter and trawl fishing activity. Moreover, the colonization of plastics was examined in order to study the importance of plastics {{as a source of}} impact on marine communities and their further environmental implications. This study surveyed 11 sites, associated with trawling grounds and subjected to different levels of fishing intensity, located in four areas of the Mediterranean: one in <b>Italy,</b> the Central <b>Tyrrhenian</b> coast, one in Greece, the eastern Ionian coast, and two in Spain, the Murcian and Catalan coasts. Samples were collected during an oceanographic cruise undertaken from the 21 May to the 24 June 2009. Results showed geographical variation in the density of marine debris which ranged from 0 to 405 pieces per hectare in the surveyed areas, plastics being the dominant components. Variability within sites was higher than between areas, indicating small-scale patchiness in the distribution of the debris over the seafloor. Though the study areas were within trawling grounds, the density of debris was not significantly correlated with fishing effort. More than 30 % of plastics were between 10 and 20 cm width/length, and more than 40 % of the plastics were colonized by a biofilm of microorganisms, suggesting indirect effects on benthic communities...|$|R
40|$|The project, {{financed by}} the Directorate General XIV of the EC, has {{undertaken}} a comparative study on the biology and fisheries techniques of the Norway lobster in Mediterranean member states and adjoining Atlantic areas. The ultimate goal of the project has been to assess the conditions for a global regulation {{in the area and}} determine possible differences among exploited stocks. The areas selected are characterised by their importance in Norway lobster catch. The overall duration of the project has been three years. Sampling was concentrated in the first two years. Data analysis was conducted during the second and third years (1993 - 1995). The countries (areas) involved in the study, together with their target areas, were: Portugal (south coast of Algarve), Spain (Alboran and Catalan Seas), <b>Italy</b> (Ligurian, <b>Tyrrhenian</b> and Adriatic Seas) and Greece (Gulf of Euboikos). In order to make results perfectly comparable, each scientific subject has been developed by a specialised team using a unified and standardised methodology. From the biological standpoint, Norway lobster growth, reproduction, moult and feeding have been compared. Special studies on distribution and genetics have been also conducted. In the fisheries context, a comparison of fishing techniques has been undertaken. The fisheries studies have been complemented with reconstruction of virgin populations, comparison of yield per recruit, sensitivity analysis and transition analysis. Selectivity issues have been object of specific analyses. As a result of these studies, it is evident that Norway lobster populations in the Mediterranean follow a common life-cycle model. The differences among areas reported in this project respond to environmental variation and differential fishing pressure in each area. All populations are exploited near its carrying limit, although overexploitation is unlikely at this stage. However we identified varying levels of exploitation according to study areas: The Catalan, Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas populations are exploited at a high level; the Ligurian Sea and Euboikos Gulf populations at an intermediate level; and the Alboran Sea and Algarve populations are at a low level of exploitation. The regulation concepts could be applied globally to the Mediterranean, allowing for the differences observed. It is highly recommended that effort is not increased. It should rather be decreased as new technologies being implemented continuously are by themselves an effort increase. A effort reduction of 20 % is desirable to ensure that stocks are maintained at their current levels. This measure should be foremost applied to those areas being subjected to the highest exploitation levels...|$|R
