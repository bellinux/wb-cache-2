5|$|Rhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre {{of action}} game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player {{is required to}} press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure rhythm and pitch, {{in order to test}} a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>they</b> press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, remember, and repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} {{of support for}} rugby grew over the following years, and large paying crowds were attracted to major matches, particular in Yorkshire, where matches in the Yorkshire Cup (T'owd Tin Pot) soon became major events. England teams of the era were dominated by Lancashire and Yorkshire players. However these players were forbidden to earn any of the spoils of this newly-rich game. Predominantly working class teams {{found it difficult to}} play to their full potential because in many cases their time to play and to train was limited by the need to earn a wage. A further limit on the playing ability of working class teams was that working class players had to be careful <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>they</b> played. If injured, they had to pay their own medical bills and possibly take time off work, which for a man earning a weekly wage could easily lead to financial hardship.|$|E

Sylvester states that Angelou uses this technique often in her poetry, and that it elicits {{a change in the}} reader's emotions; in this poem, from humor to anger. Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in [...] "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", also in Diiie, in which the understatement contained in the repeated phrase [...] "nothing happens" [...] is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society. Hagen calls Angelou's coding [...] "signifying" [...] and states, [...] "A knowledge of black linguistic regionalisms and folklore enhances the appreciation of Angelou's poems". Hagen believes that despite the signifying that occurs in many of Angelou's poems, the themes and topics are universal enough that all readers would understand and appreciate them. DeGout states that Angelou conveys meaning through literary imagery, denser vocabulary, and poetic techniques such as catachresis, ambiguity, and anthropomorphism. Angelou's use of language frees her readers from their traditional perceptions and beliefs about human experience. She uses everyday language, the Black vernacular, Black music and forms, and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language, the occasional use of profanity, and traditionally unacceptable subjects. DeGout says that although this use of language is not the main technique she uses in her poetry, it appears in her more popular poems.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>they</b> try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just {{to get used to the}} crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E

Well-identified {{estimates}} of exactly <b>how</b> much <b>harder</b> <b>they</b> will work have been elusive, however, because agents select into jobs. We conduct a real effort experiment with participants who work directly for organizations with clear missions. Weeks before the experiment, we survey potential participants for their organizational preferences. At the experiment, we randomly assign workers to organizations, creating either mission matches or mismatches. We overlay performance incentives to test whether they can make up for the motivational deficit caused by a mismatch. Our estimates suggest that matched workers produce 72 % more than mismatched workers and that performance pay can increase output by 35 % compared to workers who only receive a base wage. Considering matches and mismatches separately, we find that performance pay has only a modest effect on matched workers (a 13 % increase) while it has a large effect (a 86 % increase) on mismatches, an effect that erodes much of the performance gap caused by the poor match. Our results have broad implications both for those organizations already with well-defined missions (i. e., compensation and screening policies) as well as for those organizations strategizing about strengthening or clarifying their missions...|$|R

50|$|An earmold (ear mold British {{ear mould}} or earmould) is a device worn {{inserted}} into the ear for sound conduction or ear protection. Earmolds are anatomically shaped and can be produced in different sizes for general use or specially cast from particular ear forms. Some users specify <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> or soft <b>they</b> want their mould to be, an audiologist can also suggest this. As a conductor, it improves sound transmission to eardrums. This is an essential feature to diminish feedback paths in hearing aids and assure better intelligibility in noisy-environment communication. The main goal in wearing earmolds is to attain better user comfort and efficiency. Earmolds (and their tubes) often turn yellow and stiff with age, and thus need replacement on a regular basis. The job of making earmoulds is very time-consuming and skilful; each one is made individually.|$|R

[...] This is one of the basic laws of a comedian, referred to as [...] "exactness". It {{is important to note that}} sometimes the inconsistency may be resolved and there may still be no laugh. Because laughter is a social mechanism, an audience may not feel as if they are in danger, and the laugh may not occur. In addition, the extent of the inconsistency (and aspects of it timing and rhythm) has to do with the amount of danger the audience feels, and <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> or long <b>they</b> laugh.|$|R

The technique is illustrated by a specific adversary for the standard C qsort function. The general method works against any implementation of quicksort–even a randomizing one–that satisfies certain very mild and realistic assumptions. When using quicksort one often feels a nagging tension: suppose it goes quadratic? Tactics to avoid embarrassing results in some low-entropy cases, such as already ordered input, are cited in most algorithms books 12 and are widely used. Nevertheless, production implementations have been caught going quadratic in real-life applications. 3 No matter <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> implementers try, <b>they</b> cannot (without great sacrifice of speed) defend against all inputs. This note describes an adversarial method that finds chinks in the defenses of any implementation. A polymorphic implementation of quicksort, such as the standard C functionqsort, never looks at the data. It relies instead on an externally supplied comparison function. And that allows us to monitor and influence the program’s progress noninvasively. To do so we make a comparison function that observes the pattern of comparisons and constructs adverse data on the fly. Recall that quicksort sorts a sequence of n data items in three phases...|$|R
