5000|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industry, a <b>farmout</b> {{agreement}} is an agreement entered into by the owner of one or more mineral leases, called the [...] "farmor", and another company who wishes to obtain a percentage of ownership of that lease or leases in exchange for providing services, called the [...] "farmee." [...] The typical services described in <b>farmout</b> agreements is the drilling of one or more oil and/or gas wells. A <b>farmout</b> agreement differs from a conventional transaction between two oil and gas lessees, because the primary consideration is the rendering of services, rather than the simple exchange of money.|$|E
50|$|A <b>farmout</b> {{agreement}} {{differs from}} its sister agreement, the Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA), {{in that the}} PSA addresses an exchange of money or debt for immediate transfer of assets, whereas the <b>farmout</b> agreement addresses an exchange of services for a transfer of assets, and that transfer is often delayed until a later date (such as when the 'earning barier' has been met).|$|E
5000|$|The {{two most}} common {{contractual}} agreements entered into by {{oil and gas}} companies are the <b>Farmout</b> Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement. A <b>Farmout</b> Agreement, generally, is between one company that owns a lease, and another company that wishes to drill the property. The company wishing to drill, called the farmee, provides drilling services {{in exchange for a}} majority interest in the lease owned by the farmor.|$|E
5000|$|Petrotrin {{operates}} in land and marine acreage across southern Trinidad. In some instances, {{the company has}} engaged in joint ventures, lease operatorships, <b>farmouts</b> and incremental production services contracts to support its exploration and production activities. In 2004, Petrotrin was granted an automatic stake in all exploration and production arrangements with foreign companies in Trinidad and Tobago.|$|R
40|$|The {{basic design}} of the Mexican oil industryâs new {{architecture}} is now in place. Regulatory directives and resolutions, {{as well as a}} number of key policy decisions and new business strategies, will further define how the new structures come together. Within this context, it will be the behaviour of the incumbent monopoly, and of new players, that will determine industry dynamics. Public interest in Mexican energy reform has focused on the opening of the upstream to international industry. This is understandable given the expectation of important investment flows and the continuing decline of oil production. However, it is still too early to forecast the magnitude of capital flows associated with Round 1 upstream auctions and <b>farmouts,</b> or the time profile of incremental production and eventual government oil revenues. Recent government medium-term oil revenue projections to 2020 are based on questionable assumptions and unwarranted optimism, even if Round 1 is successful. On the other hand, mid and downstream investments in oil products, natural gas, and electricity could have greater short- and medium-term impacts on Mexicoâs energy markets and manufacturing industry, and are a central feature of energy reform...|$|R
50|$|<b>Farmout</b> {{agreements}} typically {{provide that}} the farmor will assign the defined quantum {{of interest in}} the lease(s) to the farmee upon the farmee finishing: (1) the drilling of an oil and/or gas well to the defined depth or formation, or (2) drilling of an oil and/or gas well and the obtaining of commercially viable production levels.Farmout Agreements are the second most commonly negotiated agreements in the oil and gas industry, behind the oil and gas lease.For the farmor, the reasons for entering into a <b>farmout</b> agreement include obtaining production, sharing risk, and obtaining geological information. Farmees often enter into <b>farmout</b> agreements, because they wish to obtain an acreage position, need to utilize underutilized personnel, need to share risks, or because they desire to obtain geological information.|$|E
50|$|In February 2014, ERHC {{completed}} its <b>farmout</b> agreement with CEPSA, a Spanish {{oil and gas}} company. Following the agreement, CEPSA acquired a 55 percent stake in Block 11A. ERHC retained 35 percent of interest in Block 11A.|$|E
50|$|In 1976 Amoco relinquished the {{concession}}, {{citing the}} field as non-commercial. The concession was reassigned to Offshore Hydrocarbons Ltd., which later entered into a development <b>farmout</b> with Agri-Petco of the United States. In 1977 - 1978 Agri-Petco drilled six appraisal wells from a centrally located jackup rig called Mr. Louie. After the drilling, the jack-up was converted into a production unit and the field was put onstream in October 1978.|$|E
5000|$|Overriding Royalty Interest: a {{share of}} income received, {{unconnected}} to either mineral ownership or working interest. A person or company may receive an overriding royalty by a contract with an owner of a net revenue interest. This is typically received for performing some service for working interest owners. The original owner of an oil and gas lease will sometimes retain an overriding royalty {{as part of a}} <b>farmout</b> agreement.|$|E
5000|$|The {{person or}} company acquiring, {{receiving}} and purchasing the property, stock or assets {{is referred to}} as the [...] "Buyer" [...] and the person or company disposing, conveying and selling the stock or assets {{is referred to as}} [...] "Seller". The PSA will set out the various rights and obligations of both the Buyer and Seller, and may also require other documents be executed and recorded in the public records, such as an Assignment, Deed of Trust, or <b>Farmout</b> Agreement.|$|E
50|$|In May 2010, Crescent Petroleum and the Russian government-owned oil company, Rosneft {{signed a}} Strategic Cooperation Agreement to jointly develop {{material}} {{oil and gas}} opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa region. The following month, the two companies signed a <b>Farmout</b> agreement under Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin. Under {{the terms of the}} agreement, both companies would jointly develop the Sharjah Onshore Concession, with Rosneft holding a 49% stake as participating interest. The two companies agreed to invest USD 60 million in initial exploration activities which includes the drilling of two oil wells to a depth of 4500 m. The project aimed to benefit from existing infrastructure in Sharjah to produce condensates and natural gas liquids that could be consumed domestically and exported internationally. The agreement also included a budget for the development of local infrastructure while preserving the region's natural ecosystems and terrain. Since 2014, two wells have been drilled.|$|E
