Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a test week, in which the performer plays with the orchestra <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.|$|E

These umpires service the league as a whole; {{there are not}} separate umpiring crews for each conference. Depending on the flexibility of all ten umpires, the leagues does its best to rotate the game and location assignments. There are also temporary umpires that float in and out in a reserve role.

25|$|Salmon was the {{preferred}} food of the Stó:lō and {{was seen as}} superior to other types of meat. Meat and salmon were classified differently and salmon was said to give individuals energy while meat makes you feel heavy and lazy. In order to have salmon through the off seasons it was preserved through two different methods. In the summer salmon was wind dried with salt in the Fraser Canyon. In the fall salmon was smoked, this was traditionally done <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> but with modern refrigeration technology smoking is only done for a few days. Dried salmon was then either boiled or steamed before eating.|$|E

San Francisco ran from 1975 to 1987/1988, when it was replaced by Good Morning, Bay Area, hosted by Susan Sikora. Hosts of A.M. San Francisco included the husband-and-wife team of Fred LaCosse and Terry Lowry (other ABC owned-and-operated stations produced their own A.M. programs in the 1980s; for example, A.M.

500|$|Aristotle however {{suggested}} that swallows and other birds hibernated. [...] This belief persisted {{as late as}} 1878, when Elliott Coues listed the titles of no less than 182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows. Even the [...] "highly observant" [...] Gilbert White, in his posthumously published 1789 The Natural History of Selborne, quoted a man's story about swallows being found in a chalk cliff collapse [...] "while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone", though the man denied being an eyewitness. However, he also writes that [...] "as to swallows being found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of this country, I never heard any such account worth attending to", and that if early swallows [...] "happen to find frost and snow they immediately withdraw for a time—a circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration", since he doubts they would [...] "return <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> to warmer latitudes".|$|E
500|$|U2's initial time at Danesmoate {{was spent}} {{recording}} and refining [...] "extensive demos" [...] that the Edge anticipated {{could turn into}} final backing tracks. They began with their usual songwriting methods of sorting through tapes from soundcheck jams, working through Bono's lyric book, and recording jam sessions. The sessions saw the group's songwriting beginning to evolve; not all material was being worked out as a band, rather Bono and the Edge often brought basic song ideas to Mullen and Clayton. The group were first joined at Danesmoate by Eno, with Flood and fellow engineer Dave Meegan recording their jams. Meegan said of Eno's involvement: [...] "Usually he was in first every morning and he'd start some dodgy sequence on his DX-7 —it would be just like a cello line with no intentions of ever staying forever, just something to inspire people when they walked into the room." [...] One of the first songs worked on was [...] "Heartland", which originated during The Unforgettable Fire sessions and was later released on the band's 1988 album, Rattle and Hum. The arrangements for [...] "With or Without You" [...] and [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] were completed early in the Danesmoate sessions, giving the band the confidence to experiment. Eno and Lanois intentionally worked with the band at alternate times—one producer <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> followed by the other. The producers encouraged an interest in older songs, especially American roots music. More contemporary references included the textural guitar work of the Smiths and My Bloody Valentine. The band's musical vocabulary had improved after their previous album, facilitating communication and collaboration with the production team.|$|E

2500|$|The Alhambra was {{scheduled}} to reopen early in March 1897 with the premiere of Sir Arthur Sullivan's new ballet [...] "Victoria and Merrie England". There were a few problems with this work (it was rather over-long in its original form) {{and so it was}} thought that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> Leopoldo Fregoli could perform (he needed {{little in the way of}} permanent sets, etc.) until Sir Arthur was satisfied his work was just right. Such was Fregoli's success that it was to be late in May of that year before the Sullivan piece was finally performed.|$|E
2500|$|After infection, the third-stage larval heartworms (L3) {{deposited}} by {{the mosquito}} grow <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> and molt {{to the fourth}} larval stage (L4) under the skin {{at the site of}} the mosquito bite. Then, they migrate to the muscles of the chest and abdomen, and 45 to 60 days after infection, molt to the fifth stage (L5, immature adult). Between 75 and 120 days after infection, these immature heartworms then enter the bloodstream and are carried through the heart to reside in the pulmonary artery. [...] Over the next three to four months, they increase greatly in size. [...] The female adult worm is about 30cm in length, and the male is about 23cm, with a coiled tail. [...] By seven months after infection, the adult worms have mated and the females begin giving birth to live young, called microfilariae.|$|E

2500|$|Reporting to Sherman on November 22, Hazen said, [...] "{T]o {{have made}} peace with them would have brought to my camp most of those now on the war path south of the Arkansas; and as General Sheridan is to punish those at war and might follow them in afterwards, a second Chivington affair might occur, which I could not prevent." [...] Hazen {{reported}} that while the chiefs seemed sincere, the Kiowa and Comanche at Fort Cobb said the young warriors who accompanied the chiefs were pleased that peace had not been made. They boasted that the Lakota and other northern bands would come down the following spring to [...] "clean out the entire country." [...] Hazen took the young warriors' boasts so seriously that he requested two more companies of the 10th Cavalry from Fort Arbuckle and two howitzers to remain <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> at Fort Cobb.|$|E
2500|$|The {{greatest}} {{and most}} frequent ceremonies of the Ashanti recalled {{the spirits of}} departed rulers with an offering of food and drink, asking their favor for the common good, called the [...] Adae. The day before the Adae, Akan drums broadcast the approaching ceremonies. The stool treasurer gathers sheep and liquor that will be offered. The chief priest officiates the Adae in the stool house where the ancestors came. The priest offers each food and a beverage. The public ceremony occurs outdoors, where all the people joined the dancing. Minstrels chant ritual phrases; the talking drums extol the chief and the ancestors in traditional phrases. The Odwera, the other large ceremony, occurs in September and typically lasted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> It {{is a time of}} cleansing of sin from society the defilement, and for the purification of shrines of ancestors and gods. After the sacrifice and feast of a black hen—of which both {{the living and the dead}} share—a new year begins in which all are clean, strong, and healthy.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, {{band members}} {{continued}} with the sentiment {{that it was}} possible, depending mostly on everyone's schedule. In a November 2011 interview, Patrick said {{of the future of}} the band: Those guys are amazing, it's basically this simple: Robert has a studio in his basement where he can totally do his old-fashioned kind of classic sound. They can write and record at any moment in time, they can get Ray Luzier in to play drums and I can take it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> and write vocals or sing it. So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, every time I see him he's like [...] "Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still {{come up to me and}} talk about that Army of Anyone record". And I think that I honestly could probably do a way better job just 'cause of what I've learned lately as a singer...I think the best Army of Anyone record is still to come, it's still totally doable and could be even better.|$|E
