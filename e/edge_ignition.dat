40|$|AbstractBy {{utilizing}} the self-designed test platform {{to carry out}} tests on the <b>edge</b> <b>ignition</b> time and center ignition time of wooden panels coated with finishing fire-retardant paints to different fire-retardant degrees and analyzing the factors affecting the <b>edge</b> <b>ignition</b> time and center ignition time, this paper proposes the indicators {{for the assessment of}} fire-retardant properties of wooden panels coated with finishing fire-retardant paints, i. e. the <b>edge</b> <b>ignition</b> time and the center ignition time. It is indicated by research results that the paint quality, coating process and fire-retardant properties of wooden panels coated with finishing fire-retardant paints can be comprehensively assessed in terms of these two indicators; the <b>edge</b> <b>ignition</b> time can be used for auxiliary assessment of the quality situation of finishing fire-retardant paints, and the center ignition time can be used for assessment of the coating process of finishing fire-retardant paints...|$|E
40|$|The {{ignition}} and subsequent burning of polyurethane foam based mattresses poses a significant danger {{to life and}} safety in North American homes. The development of fire models which can predict the full scale fire behavior of these mattresses using bench scale data would assist manufacturers and regulators to manage this danger in a cost effective manner. This thesis builds on previous work by the University of Saskatchewan and University of Waterloo fire research groups and focuses on the evaluation of one such scaling model, which was originally developed during the Combustion Behavior of Upholstered Furniture (CBUF) project. The evaluation of the CBUF model conducted in this thesis isolates the heat release rate (HRR) density sub-model and explores the effects of 1) cone calorimeter incident heat flux setting, 2) specimen thickness and 3) ignition location on the predictive capability of the CBUF model. To provide input for the CBUF model cone and furniture calorimeter tests were conducted. Cone calorimeter tests were conducted on foam specimen thicknesses of 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10. 0 cm at incident heat flux settings of 25, 35, 50 and 75 kW/m 2. Furniture calorimeter tests were conducted on foam specimen thicknesses of 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10. 0 cm in both edge and center ignition configuration. Flame area spread rates were measured from infrared video of the furniture calorimeter tests using an automated algorithm. It was found that HRR curves predicted by the CBUF model showed good agreement with experimental results. Experimental results from tests of thinner foams were predicted with greater success than results from thicker foams, and results from <b>edge</b> <b>ignition</b> tests were predicted with greater success than results of center ignition tests. The {{results of this study}} indicated that specimen thickness and ignition location need to be considered when selecting an appropriate incident heat flux setting for producing input data for the CBUF model...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Modeling the UL- 94 {{vertical}} burning test is {{of practical}} importance in industries which, however, {{has not been}} addressed sufficiently. In this article, a 3 D convective heat transfer model was developed to simulate ignition times for the UL- 94 test. An experimental procedure was proposed to measure ignition times of two polymers under the UL- 94 test condition. Comparisons between experimental and simulated results of ignition times showed that edge effects were significant in the ignition process of the UL- 94 test and the convective heat transfer <b>ignition</b> model considering <b>edge</b> effects gave <b>ignition</b> times close to experimental results. Sensitivity analyses showed that the ignition time increased linearly with decreasing initial temperature and increasing density, heat capacity and emissivity, but nonlinearly with decreasing flame temperature and convective heat transfer coefficient and increasing thickness, thermal conductivity, and ignition temperature of the specimen...|$|R

Estafette with a certain Letter, which the Rittmeister had picked up in Erlangen, and has shot across by estafette to wait his Majesty here. Majesty has read with open eyes and throat: Letter from the Crown-Prince to Lieutenant Katte in Berlin: treasonous Flight-project now indisputable as the sun at noon!--His Majesty stept on board the Yacht in such humor as was never seen before: [...] "Detestable rebel and deserter, scandal of scandals--!"--it is {{confidently}} written everywhere (though Seckendorf diplomatically keeps silence), his Majesty hustled and tussled the unfortunate Crown-Prince, poked the handle of his cane into his face and made the nose bleed,--"Never did a Brandenburg face suffer the like of this!" [...] cried the poor Prince, driven to the <b>edge</b> of mad <b>ignition</b> and one knows not what: when the Buddenbrocks, at whatever peril interfered; got the Prince brought on board a different Yacht; and the conflagration moderated for the moment. The Yachts get under way towards Mainz and down the Rhine-stream. The Yachts glide swiftly on the favoring current, taking advantage of what wind there may be: were we once ashore at Wesel in our own country,--wait till then, thinks his Majesty! ...|$|R
40|$|Edge flames were {{investigated}} in a methane/O 2 /N 2 counterflow diffusion flame burner. In a typical experiment, a stable counterflow diffusion flame in an axysymmetric configuration was perturbed by low-ering the relevant Damköhler number slightly below the extinction value, Daext. As a result, the flame extinguished {{in the vicinity}} of the burner axis where conditions were uniform. An edge flame extinction front quickly propagated in the radial direction, turned into an <b>ignition</b> <b>edge</b> flame, and eventually stabilized as a standing triple flame at a radial position larger than the burner radius. This sequence of events resulted from an increase of Da as a function of the radial direction, consequent to a decrease in the strain rate in the radial direction. The edge flame propagation velocity in the ignition mode was measured for propa-gating edge flames at moderate Da and for standing triple flames at large Da, using a combination of laser Doppler velocimetry of seeded particles, formaldehyde planar laser-induced fluorescence, and natural chemiluminescence imaging. The propagation velocity, nondimensionalized with the premixed laminar flame speed of the unburned stoichiometric mixture, was correlated with Da. The latter was calculated using a thermal diffusive model and velocity measurements. The nondimensional velocity reached a value of 2. 6 at large Da, in good agreement with the estimated square root of the ratio of the unburned gas density to the burned gas density, as suggested by scaling considerations...|$|R
30|$|Flammability of {{the leaves}} was {{determined}} by methods modified from Taylor and Fonda (1990). Forty samples per species per month were burned in the laboratory {{for a total of}} 880 burns. Our fuel bed for each burn was composed of a sample of leaves weighed out to 10.00 g to 10.09 g and arranged so they would fit within a 25 cm × 25 cm area on a 35 cm × 35 cm flat metal tray, and all fuel beds were < 4 cm deep. Fuel beds did vary over the sample time; earlier in the sample period fuel beds were thicker and less compact due to leaf size (3 cm to 4 cm deep). As time from leaf fall increased, leaves were often broken and more decomposed, which made the fuel beds more compact and thinner (2 cm to 3 cm deep). Each prepared sample was placed under a 62 cm × 98 cm laboratory fume hood with the vent running. Four 25 cm long pieces of 1.4 kg cotton string were soaked in xylene and placed overlapping each other on top of the sample, and within 2 cm of the sample <b>edge,</b> to achieve <b>ignition.</b> The string was ignited at a single point and the fume hood door closed. Initially the twine was placed under the samples, as described by Taylor and Fonda (1990), but consistent and even ignition of the samples could not be obtained using this method. A type K thermocouple of 24 AWG insulated wire was positioned 10 cm above the center of the tray then attached to a ExTech™ EasyView 15 thermometer datalogger (FLIR Commercial Systems, Nashua, New Hampshire, USA) to record maximum and average burn temperatures (average of temperature from ignition to extinction of last glowing ember). In the darkened laboratory, flame time (time from ignition to extinction of last flame) and total burn time (time from ignition to extinction of last glowing ember) was recorded with a stopwatch. From these two readings we determined ember time (time from the extinction of last flame to the extinction of last glowing ember). After the sample had completed combustion, the percent consumption of the sample was determined by weighing the remaining residue. Individual leaf weights were determined just prior to burning by randomly selecting and weighing 50 individual leaves by species from each sample for each collection period (n = 1110).|$|R
