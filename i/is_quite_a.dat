5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

25|$|Given that {{creating}} an OpenGL context <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> complex process, {{and given that}} it varies between operating systems, automatic OpenGL context creation has become a common feature of several game-development and user-interface libraries, including SDL, Allegro, SFML, FLTK, and Qt.

25|$|The buff striped keelback (Amphiesma stolatum) is {{a species}} of nonvenomous {{colubrid}} snake found across Asia. It is the sole species of genus Amphiesma.

An experienced breeder {{can try to}} identify that personality which would be happier as an independent livestock dog, or that which wants more to please and {{would make a good}} obedience dog or family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability and general attitude.|$|E
25|$|The general {{movement}} of the EGC is southward along the eastern Greenland continental margin. The currents are quite strong with annual averages of 6–12cm/s in {{the upper part of}} the EGC (<500 m) with inter-annual maximums of 20–30nbsp&cm/s. It was estimated in 1991 by Hopkins et al. that the transport of water southward ranged from 2–32 sverdrups. That <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> large variation that they attributed to the widely varying strength of the Atlantic Water flow at intermediate depths. More recent estimations of water transport in the top layers (<800 m) of the EGC is between 3 and 4 sverdrups.|$|E
25|$|Grey Friar is a {{fell in the}} English Lake District, {{it is one of}} the Coniston Fells and is {{situated}} 13 kilometres west-south-west of Ambleside.

It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> large fell and forms the eastern wall of the Duddon Valley for several kilometres, in fact all drainage from Grey Friar goes to the Duddon Valley and not to Coniston Water.|$|E

25|$|Indigenous Filipinos have harbored {{their own}} {{religions}} {{long before the}} Spanish had arrived at their shores. Along with these religions, are corresponding burial practices to accompany such religions. Given that the Spanish occupancy in the Philippines had lasted almost four-hundred years, {{it would not be}} a rash assumption that Catholicism should have become widespread or have become the primary religion for the entire nation. This inference, however would be highly problematic as it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> ways from the actual truth. Persisting through the Spanish occupation, indigenous Filipino tribes continued with their respective religions and hence, with their customary burial practices. The Spanish influence however, highly affected the religious traditions and customs in the areas surrounding large trade cities and the capital. These influences include the location of the burials, position of the body and decoration of burial goods to name a few.|$|E
25|$|This {{formation}} {{is widely used}} by Spanish, French and German sides. While it seems defensive to the eye, it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> flexible formation, as both the wide players and the full-backs join the attack. In defense, this {{formation is}} similar to either the 4–5–1 or 4–4–1–1. It is used to maintain possession of the ball and stopping opponent attacks by controlling the midfield area of the field. The lone striker may be very tall and strong to hold the ball up as his midfielders and full-backs join him in attack. The striker could also be very fast. In these cases, the opponent's defense {{will be forced to}} fall back early, thereby leaving space for the offensive central midfielder. This formation is used especially when a playmaker is to be highlighted. The variations of personnel used on the flanks in this set-up include using traditional wingers, using inverted wingers or simply using wide midfielders. Different teams and managers have different interpretations of the 4–2–3–1, but one common factor among them all is the presence of the double pivot. The efficiency and the compactness that the double pivot provides makes it vital to have in the modern game. The double pivot is the usage of two holding midfielders in front of the defence.|$|E

25|$|After {{the current}} splits into the Svalbard Branch and the Yermak Branch, the general sinking process {{described}} above still {{continues in the}} Svalbard Branch. However, in the Yermak Branch the WSC {{is not able to}} penetrate deep inside the Arctic Ocean because the zone it enters has very strong tidal mixing. This allows the Atlantic Water to mix with the Polar Waters, creating more of a homogeneous mixture of relatively warm and moderately saline water. This extends down to about 300 meters which is recognized as the bottom depth of the Return Atlantic Current. For the Svalbard Branch, the Atlantic Water core of the WSC continues to sink as it meets more and more freshwater on its eastern route. It sinks fairly quickly to a depth greater than 100 meters by the time it reaches the Barents Sea because in Northern Svalbard there <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of freshwater run-off from fjords which adds to a deeper, less dense Arctic Surface Water and thus a deeper WSC. By the time this water recirculates to the Beaufort Gyre, the Atlantic core of the WSC is 400 to 500 meters deep. Unlike the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current, the Svalbard Branch is able to retain a strong Atlantic Water chemical signal whereas the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current carry a very weak Atlantic Water signal. The Atlantic Water core temperature is a direct reflection of the depth of the Svalbard Branch of the WSC.|$|E
