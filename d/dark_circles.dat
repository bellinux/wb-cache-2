25|$|In 1999, Duffy found a tape {{recording}} of 1978–1979 Duran Duran music {{that was in}} storage. Shortly afterwards, {{he had a chance}} meeting with Nick Rhodes. Reminiscences led to a desire to collaborate, and they ended up re-recording the music on the tape. They did not change any of the lyrics, and used only late-70s-era instrumentation with modern recording techniques. The result was the album <b>Dark</b> <b>Circles,</b> released under the name The Devils.|$|E
500|$|Dazed {{magazine}} calls Courtney Love One of [...] "ten {{women who}} defined the 1990s" [...] from a style perspective: the [...] "...image of Courtney Love’s too-short baby doll dress, tattered fur coat and shock of platinum hair", a look dubbed [...] "kinderwhore", [...] "...topped with a tiara, of course – is seared on {{the memory of}} anyone who lived through the decade." [...] The kinderwhore look consisted of torn, ripped tight or low-cut babydoll and peter pan collared dresses, slips, heavy makeup with dark eyeliner, barrettes, and leather boots or Mary–Jane shoes. Kat Bjelland of Babes in Toyland {{was the first to}} define it, while Courtney Love of Hole was the first to popularize it. Love has claimed that she took the style from Divinyls frontwoman Christina Amphlett. The look became very popular in 1994. During the mid-1990s, the rise of [...] "heroin chic", a trend that Maxim Furek links to the role that the drug played in the grunge scene, led to controversy. Heroin chic models had pale skin, <b>dark</b> <b>circles</b> underneath the eyes, emaciated features and [...] "a nihilistic vision of beauty" [...] that was reflective of drug addiction; the U.S.News and World Report called the movement a [...] "cynical trend".|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Dark</b> <b>Circle</b> was {{referenced}} {{during the}} Giffen-Bierbaum continuity. Members were depicted wearing hoods with a prominent <b>dark</b> <b>circle</b> (zero) over the face. In Legion of Super-Heroes Annual #2, {{they were said}} to have existed for millions of years, even before New Genesis and Apokolips. They had little influence over events and were outmaneuvered by other factions who were prominent during this period. The Legion member Tellus joined the <b>Dark</b> <b>Circle</b> during this time.|$|R

2500|$|The 737's main {{landing gear}} under the wings at mid-cabin rotates into wells in the aircraft's belly. The legs are covered by partial doors, and [...] "brush-like" [...] seals aerodynamically smooth (or [...] "fair") the wheels in the wells. The sides of the tires {{are exposed to the}} air in flight. [...] "Hub caps" [...] {{complete}} the aerodynamic profile of the wheels. It is forbidden to operate without the caps, because they are linked to the ground speed sensor that interfaces with the anti-skid brake system. The <b>dark</b> <b>circles</b> of the tires are clearly visible when a 737 takes off, or is at low altitude.|$|E
2500|$|Law of Similarity—The law of {{similarity}} states that elements within {{an assortment of}} objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other. [...] This similarity can occur {{in the form of}} shape, colour, shading or other qualities. [...] For example, the figure illustrating the law {{of similarity}} portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square. [...] In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark and 18 of the circles are shaded light. [...] We perceive the <b>dark</b> <b>circles</b> as grouped together, and the light circles as grouped together forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.|$|E

2500|$|Polk's {{time in the}} White House {{took its}} toll on his health. Full of enthusiasm and vigor when he entered office, Polk left office {{exhausted}} by his years of public service. He lost weight and had deep lines {{on his face and}} <b>dark</b> <b>circles</b> under his eyes. He is believed to have contracted cholera in New Orleans, Louisiana, on a goodwill tour of the South after leaving the White House. He died of cholera at his new home, Polk Place, in Nashville, Tennessee, at 3:15pm on June 15, 1849, three months after leaving office. He had never joined any church, but received a deathbed Methodist baptism. Initially buried in what is now Nashville City Cemetery, due to a legal requirement related to his infectious disease death, he was moved to a tomb on the grounds of Polk Place (as specified in his will) less than a year later. Polk's last words illustrate his devotion to his wife: [...] "I love you, Sarah. For all eternity, I love you." [...] She lived at Polk Place for 42 years after his death and died on August 14, 1891. His mother, Jane Knox Polk, died on January 11, 1852. In 1893, the bodies of President and Mrs. Polk were exhumed and relocated to their current resting place {{on the grounds of the}} Tennessee State Capitol in Nashville. Polk Place was demolished in 1900. In 2017, state legislative action was considered to relocate the Polk's remains to his father's home in Columbia, Tennessee.|$|E

60|$|Hazel Strong was prostrated.
