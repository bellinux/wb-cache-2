500|$|Despite Pinkertons initial failure, during Weezer's hiatus {{the album}} amassed a cult following. By {{the time of}} the release of the Green Album in 2001, a wave of {{mainstream}} emo bands including Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional and Motion City Soundtrack had cited it as a major influence. Cuomo was not comforted by this development, and told Rolling Stone in 2001: [...] "The most painful thing in my life these days is the cult around Pinkerton. It's just a sick album, sick in a diseased sort of way. It's such a source of anxiety because all the fans we have right now have stuck around because of that album.

"Secrets That <b>I</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Know" [...] is the eighth-season premiere {{episode of}} the American comedy-drama {{television}} series Desperate Housewives, and the 158th overall {{episode of the}} series.

500|$|... "Secrets That <b>I</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Know" [...] {{received}} mixed critical reviews. TV Guide Kate Stanhope gave a mixed {{review of}} the episode, opining that [...] "the episode moved a little slow for what was the last season premiere." [...] She praised the sequence in which Bree and Gabrielle attempt {{to get rid of}} Alejandro's car, writing, [...] "I always love the Bree-Gaby scenes because they contradict each other in such an interesting way." [...] She enjoyed that the Bree character was [...] "turning back into the controlling perfectionist we grew to love rather than the carefree woman she became" [...] in the seventh season. Stanhope was critical of the Lynette and Tom storyline, opining: [...] "it's annoying that their relationship has been reduced to this gimmick... I was never on board with the whole Tom and Lynette split simply because it felt less honest and more of a last-ditch effort to cause conflict. But if they're going to go through with separating the formerly stable couple, at least go through with it all the way and show Lynette really and truly on her own." [...] She also believed the Renee storyline to be a waste of Vanessa Williams's talents. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly called the episode's overall storyline [...] "too juicy a landmine to not have the repercussions play out deliciously on this, the show’s last season." ...|$|E
500|$|Preparing for {{the episode}} was {{physically}} difficult {{for some of}} the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that [...] "It took something like 19hours of singing and 17hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes" [...] and she was so anxious about singing that she [...] "hated every moment of it". When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, [...] "I basically started to cry and said, 'You mean someone else is going to do my big emotional turning point for the season?' In the end, it was an incredible experience and I'm glad I did it. And <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it again." [...] Davies was so impressed with Hinton Battle's performance on Broadway in The Wiz that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up {{for the first time to}} give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as [...] "slick", smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Battle's dance.|$|E

500|$|... "Secrets That <b>I</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Know" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Bob Daily and directed by David Grossman. Filming for the episode began on July 11, 2011. The episode {{is only one of}} two season premieres Cherry did not write himself, as he took on a reduced production role for the eighth season in order to develop several new series while Daily was given more creative authority. According to Daily, the series' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines. [...] "You get to do story lines that you wouldn't otherwise do because you don't {{have to worry about the}} ramifications," [...] he explained. [...] "So people can move, people can die, people can have babies and you don't have to worry about the babies growing up." [...] The episode introduced Bree's blackmail storyline, which recalls the first season's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice's suicide. Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional: [...] "We’re kind of just diving into the DNA of the series a little bit. Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there? Any characters we need to check in with one more time?" [...] Cherry noted that the [...] "mystery hearkens back to the first season, going back to the roots of Mary Alice [...] This feels right for that mystery to take us out this year." [...] Brenda Strong commented that [...] "It’s the smartest way to end the series, to finish where you began. I think it really cements it in the psyche of the audience and gives them a sense of completion." ...|$|E

The cast and crew left for Hollywood to begin preparations for the film, but much of the budget was taken up during preproduction.
