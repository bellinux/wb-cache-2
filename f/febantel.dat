40|$|Drug {{resistance}} in sheep gastrointestinal trichostrongyles is a cosmopolitan major constraint to small ruminant production. Despite reports that anthelmintic drug resistance has become common, there are limited {{information on the}} presence of drug {{resistance in}} Italy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of four anthelmintics to control infection in sheep in central Italy. Fifty sheep with fecal egg counts (FEC) > or = 150 eggs per gram were selected on each of three farms (n = 150 total sheep) which were randomly allocated to one of five groups. Groups were treated with <b>febantel,</b> levamisole, ivermectin, or moxidectin while the fifth group acted as the control group. A FEC reduction test (FECRT) was conducted on each animal and the mean FEC of each treatment group was compared to that of the control group within farm. Resistance was declared when percentage reduction (R) < 95 % and the lower 95 % confidence interval was < 90 %. Levamisole (mean R = 89 %) resistance was found on all farms and ivermectin (mean R = 93 %) resistance was found on two of the three farms. Posttreatment larval cultures showed the presence of Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) circumcincta and Trichostrongylus spp. larvae. <b>Febantel</b> (mean R = 96 %) and moxidectin (mean R = 100 %) remained effective. This study suggests that drug resistance in sheep gastrointestinal trichostrongyles is present in central Italy and a potential problem which would justify a broader nationwide geographical investigation.

In these the anthelmintic efficacy of <b>febantel</b> (a benzimidazole), ivermectin, levamisole and morantel are compared, using the first stage larval reduction test. The mean natural log (+ 1 for zero values) of the post treatment larval counts of the treated groups was compared with that of the untreated controls and the percentage reduction used to assess anthelmintic efficacy. <b>Febantel</b> was only 87, 4 % effective against Teladorsagia in suckling lambs but the other anthelmintics were more than 99 % effective against this genus. Efficacy against Haemonchus and Trichostrongylus ranged from 93, 2 %- 100 % for all 4 compounds. In the rams all compounds were 100 % effective against Trichostrongylus, with the exception of morantel which was only 87, 5 % effective. None of the compounds were effective against Teladorsagia, particularly morantel, animals treated with which having more larvae than the controls.

40|$|Japanese {{yellowtail}} Seriola quinqueradiata {{has been}} commercially farmed in Japan since the 1940 s. In comparison, sea-cage farming of yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi in Australia is still developing, with commercial production commencing in 1998. In Australia, S. lalandi is parasitised by Zeuxapta seriolae and Benedenia seriolae. In Japan, S. quinqueradiata is parasitised by Heteraxine heterocerca and B. seriolae. These monogeneans affect industries {{in both countries}} and management of these parasites is required to prevent impacts on fish health and commercial losses. I investigated efficacy (% reduction of mean parasite abundance) for orally administered praziquantel, fenbendzole and oxfendazole against Z. seriolae and B. seriolae on S. lalandi and the efficacy of orally administered praziquantel and <b>febantel</b> against H. heterocerca and B. seriolae on S. quinqueradiata. Medications were administered to fish by surface coating feed pellets or via direct intubation of the stomach. Seriola lalandi administered fenbendazole and oxfendazole by surface coating of feed had lower abundance of the gill parasite Z. seriolae. Seriola quinqueradiata intubated with <b>febantel</b> had lower abundance of the gill parasite H. heterocerca. Neither fenbendazole nor oxfendazole administered to S. lalandi in Australia, nor <b>febantel</b> administered to S. quinqueradiata in Japan resulted in a lower abundance of the skin parasite B. seriolae. Praziquantel was first administered to S. lalandi by surface coating of feed. Fish rejected medicated feed, suggesting praziquantel affected its palatability. Fish treated with feed medicated with praziquantel had fewer Z. seriolae and B. seriolae than untreated fish. Praziquantel administered to S. lalandi by intubation allowed a more accurate dose to be tested without differential feeding or reduced palatability obstructing results, and resulted in fewer Z. seriolae (99. 5 - 100 % reduction) and B. seriolae (91 – 97. 7 % reduction). Intubated praziquantel also led to fewer recruitment life stages of Z. seriolae and B. seriolae, even at low doses, but did not completely eliminate them from S. lalandi. Praziquantel administered to S. lalandi alone and combined with cimetidine had high efficacy (> 99 %) against Z. seriolae. In comparison, praziquantel administered alone resulted in fewer B. seriolae (68. 3 – 69. 7 % reduction) than the same doses of praziquantel combined with cimetidine (36. 9 – 40. 9 % reduction). A 90. 4 - 100 % reduction in H. heterocerca was achieved when praziquantel was administered by intubation to S. quinqueradiata in Japan {{but there was only}} a 22 - 77. 8 % reduction in B. seriolae. The dose of PZQ (150 mg kg⁻¹ body weight day⁻¹ for 3 days) on the label of a commercially available product used to treat B. seriolae in Japanese aquaculture resulted in a 50. 9 % reduction against B. seriolae, but completely eliminated H. heterocerca. In trials against Z. seriolae and B. seriolae on S. lalandi in South Australia, I also screened 27 other anthelmintics and antiparasitics from the chemical groups: amprolium derivatives, benzimidazoles, benzyl ureas, diphosphate salts, imidazothiazoles, macrocyclic lactones, nitromidazoles, organophosphates, piperazines, salicylanilides, substituted phenols and tetrahydropyrimidines. Of these, only the benzimidazole, albendazole, was effective against Z. seriolae and none appeared to have an effect against B. seriolae. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The aim of t he {{present study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of helminth control in kennels using different broad-spectrum anthelmi ntics that are routinely used in canine veterinary practice. Particular attention was given to the field efficacy and ease-of-use of each product. Methods: The study was conducted in 3 public kennels in the Campania region (southern Italy). Eighteen boxes from each of the three kennels were selected for treatment based on faecal egg counts (FECs) at Day − 30.

Potential risk factors for infection were identified by a questionnaire: dogs from rural areas significantly more often had hookworms and taeniid eggs in their feces when compared to urban family dogs. Access to small rodents, offal, and carrion was identified as risk factor for hookworm and Taeniidae, while feeding of fresh and uncooked meat {{did not result in}} higher prevalences for these helminths.

40|$|Flank sucking is a {{behavioural}} abnormality of compulsive nature that occurs {{almost exclusively in}} Doberman pinchers and is frequently accompanied by other abnormal behaviours, such as acral lick dermatitis, blanket sucking and pica. A 2. 5 -year old, intact male, Doberman pinscher was presented because of a two-month long history of persistent right flank sucking. The dog was up-to-date with vaccinations and lived exclusively outdoors with his mother. The onset of the problem coincided with a period of crate restraining, where a short chain was used to avoid copulation with his mother, {{when she was in}} oestrus. Since then, the abnormal behaviour occurred on a daily basis and was not associated with neurological signs. In addition, the dog presented blanket sucking and pica that had first appeared during puppyhood. No clinical abnormalities were detected and the dog did not show signs of anxiety, aggression or fear during physical examination and blood sampling. Later-on and while remaining calm in the waiting room of the Clinic, the dog started chasing, chewing and sucking his right flank for over three minutes, but stopped immediately after his owner's verbal intervention. Primary diagnosis was compulsive flank sucking; differential diagnosis included Trichuris vulpis infestation, allergic dermatitis and psychomotor seizures. Results of haematological and serum biochemical examinations were unremarkable, whereas serological examination for Leishmania and faecal parasitological examination did not reveal significant results. Suggested treatment included administration of an anthelminthic combination (praziquantel, pyrantel and <b>febantel),</b> orally, for 4 consecutive days and clomipramine, at the dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, every 12 hours, orally, {{for a long period of}} time, along with instructions to avoid the causative and triggering factors.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The work presented in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} chemotherapy of parasite infestations in the ruminant with the anthelmintic thiophanate [diethyl 4, 4 '-o-phenylene bis (3 -thioallophanate) ]. A new concept of administration was investigated, namely continuous low-level anthelmintic medication. Two aspects were studied which divide conveniently into two sections. In Section 1, following preliminary trials undertaken to assess the low-level anthelmintic activity of thiophanate, the effects are assessed when this drug is administered continually directly into the rumen of parasitised sheep. Thiophanate was infused at dosages between 3. 0 and 5. 0 mg per kg bodyweight over various periods of medication against various developmental stages of gastro-intestinal parasites. The daily drug release rate. required to inhibit egg hatch and eliminate the worm burden is established. A minimum daily release rate of 3. 0 mg per kg bodyweight was shown to be required to completely inhibit egg hatch and 4. 5 mg per kg for effective vermicidal activity. In similar experiments, the anthelmintic activities of levamisole (s-(-) - 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrahydro- 6 -phenylimidazo (2, 1 -b) thiazole), <b>febantel</b> (N-(2 -(2, 3 -bis-(methoxycarbonyl) -guanidino) - 5 -(phenyl-thio) -phenyl) - 2 -methoxy-acetamide) and briefly oxfendazole (5 -(phenylsulfinyl) -IH-benzimidazol- 2 yl) carbamate) were also examined. In Section 2, the development of an intra-ruminal bolus incorporating thiophanate and designed to release drug at a predetermined rate {{over an extended period of}} time is described. Experiments were carried out in sheep to assess the bolus density required for retention within the reticulo-rumen (monitored by direct bolus recovery), to compare various density factors (iron powder, iron bar core, iron shot and sand) and to assess the average drug release rate from different matrix formulations (based on fatty acids, palmitic acid and paraffin wax) when the boluses were dosed singly or in pairs. The development of a stable "carrier" on which to load a suitable matrix is also described, the majority of the experiments undertaken utilising this "carrier". The effect on the drug release rate of incorporating various "leaching aids" (digestible materials, wetting and soluble agents) into the matrix is examined and preliminary anthelmintic trials undertaken in experimentally infected lambs. The required drug release is achieved when the boluses are administered in pairs. The anthelmintic activity is confirmed. Possible matrices suitable for use as a single bolus administration were produced. The advantages of this form of anthelmintic medication over the single therapeutic dose are discussed along with some indications for further studies that emerged. May and Baker Limite...|$|E
