40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} idea of using different sources of data in order to effectively monitor and control the manufacturing process. For application in classical Condition Monitoring we developed a data analysis flow which is equipped with self-learning properties. In this flow we use all available sensor data to extract relevant features (in the sense of distinguishing marks) in a generic way. To this end, a broad variety of mathematical transformations followed by statistical value calculations are applied to all sensor data histories yielding a large amount of potential features. Using Principal Component Analysis or Linear Discriminant Analysis, we are able to extract the relevant features which reliably build clusters of measurement points in the feature space. These clusters are finally used to distinguish between different operational conditions and wear-out conditions. This way, starting with a finger print of the machine free from defects, we are able to detect variations of the monitored machine concerning e. g. slightly increasing wear-out phenomena. Our approach was already successfully applied to hydraulic pumps, <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>trains</b> e. g. for conveyor belts, and also packaging machines...|$|E

40|$|Reliability {{of power}} {{electronic}} systems {{is a major}} concern for application engineers in the automotive and power system sectors. Power electronic modules are one of the main sources of failure in wind energy conversion systems. Power electronic converters used in wind turbine <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>trains,</b> railway traction, more-electric-aircrafts, marine propulsion and grid connected systems like FACTS/HVDC require reliable power devices and modules. Wide bandgap semiconductors like SiC have demonstrated enlarged electrothermal Safe-Operating-Areas compared with silicon devices. However, the reliability of SiC power modules and packages has been identified as an area of potential weakness. Traditional packaging systems have been developed for Si hence the different thermomechanical properties of SiC cause different stresses in the packaging thereby potentially causing reduced reliability. This paper identifies some of the key areas for the development of reliable power electronic systems using SiC. The focus is on condition monitoring, packaging system innovation and thermomechanical stress analysis {{as a function of the}} mechanical properties of Si and SiC.

40|$|While {{technology}} {{issues are}} increasingly overcoming, the economic viability of electric vehicles is remaining constrained by higher prices than for conventional vehicles. However, first automakers present their Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) {{or at least}} pronounce them for the near future. Hence, there is an emerging need for vehicle manufacturers, practitioners and policy to estimate the particular demand for partly and fully electrified drive trains under the current and probable future economic and regulatory conditions. In our paper we analyze the possible German car market’s development towards electric mobility for the two key technologies, PHEV and BEV.

Additionally, the dSPACE ControlDesk interface used to control the drive system is presented. In the second part, the heat sink of the AC Drive is investigated by measurements and analytical calculations. Furthermore, the motor temperature at different loads is also presented and discussed.

40|$|With rising gas prices, global warming, {{and green}} thinking, all-electric {{vehicles}} are currently considered the automobile {{technology of the}} future. However, besides their advantages <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>trains</b> also exhibit several disadvantages. Moreover, history shows several failed attempts to establish electric vehicles. Thus, a reliable forecasting model is needed that predicts if the current trend is sustainable. We develop and empirically test a choice-based conjoint adoption model that uses individual-level preferences {{as a basis for}} prediction. Predictions are mapped to the time of the next planned purchase in order to establish the adoption process. The model extends existing research in several ways. First, no prior information, e. g., historical market data or a functional form of the adoption process, has to be integrated. Second, the model allows dynamic modifications of product specifications or competition at different points in time. Third, a no-choice option can be integrated so that a technology switch is not forced by the model itself and switching costs can be considered. The empirical results reveal different critical factors for the adoption of all-electric vehicles, such as purchase price, range, timing of the market entry, or environmental evolution, which could lead to a solid base of consumers preferring this option.

40|$|Research and {{development}} of electric weapons is currently in progress in several countries for their benefits of higher muzzle velocities and insensitive munitions compared with conventional chemical guns. The integration of these weapons aboard land based vehicles will likely require careful consideration of the energy balances and power flows {{to all of the}} major loads aboard.

Emission reductions must be quantified and documented on a case-by-case basis. Improve fuel efficiency from construction equipment: o Minimize idling time either by shutting equipment off {{when not in use}} or reducing the time of idling to no more than 3 minutes (5 minute limit is required by the state airborne toxics control measure [Title 13, sections 2449 (d) (3) and 2485 of the California Code of Regulations]). Provide clear signage that posts this requirement for workers at the entrances to the site. o Maintain all construction equipment in proper working condition according to manufacturer’s specifications.

40|$|Hydrogen {{will assume}} {{a key role}} in Europe’s effort to adopt its energy {{dependent}} society to satisfy its needs without releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases. The paradigm shift is so paramount that one speaks of the ‘‘Hydrogen Economy’’, as the energy in this new and ecological type of economy is to be distributed by hydrogen. However, H 2 is not a primary energy source but rather an energy carrier, a means of storing, transporting and distributing energy, which has to be generated by other means. Various H 2 storage methods are possible; however industries’ favourite is the storage of gaseous hydrogen in high pressure tanks. The biggest promoter of this storage methodology is the automotive industry, which is currently preparing for the generation change from the fossil fuel internal combustion engines to hydrogen based fuel cells. The current roadmaps foresee a market roll-out by 2015, when the hydrogen supply infrastructure is expected to have reached a critical mass. The hydrogen economy is about to take off as being demonstrated by various national mobility strategies, which foresee several millions of electric cars driving on the road in 2020. Fuel cell cars are only one type of ‘‘electric car’’, battery electric as well as hybrid cars – all featuring <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>trains</b> – are the others. Which type of technology is chosen for a specific application depends primarily on the involved energy storage and power requirements. These considerations are very similar to the ones in the aerospace sector, which had introduced the fuel cell already in the 1960 s. The automotive sector followed only recently, but has succeeded in moving forward the technology to a level, where the aerospace sector is starting considering to spin-in terrestrial hydrogen technologies into its technology portfolio. Target areas are again high power/high energy applications like aviation, manned spaceflight and exploration missions, as well as future generation high power telecommunication satellites. Similar trends can be expected in the future for RADAR Earth Observation satellites and space infrastructure concepts of great scale. This paper examines current activities along the hydrogen value chain, both in the terrestrial and the aerospace sector. A general assessment of the synergy potential is complemented by a thorough analysis of specific applications serving as role models like a lunar manned base or pressurised rover, an aircraft APU or a high power telecommunications satellite. Potential performance improvements and cost savings serve as key performance indicators in these comparisons and trade-offs. JRC. F. 2 -Cleaner energ...|$|E
