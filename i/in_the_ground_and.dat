5|$|A typical {{structure}} {{would have}} {{four or more}} central posts planted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.|$|E
5|$|At that time, the Federal {{government}} was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil {{in the place of}} water.|$|E
5|$|From arms caches {{hidden in}} 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades. However, {{due to their}} {{inadequate}} preservation, which had had to be improvised in {{the chaos of the}} September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.|$|E

[...] There is a {{licensed}} tea room <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hall is also licensed for civil weddings. Ceremonies are conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Long Hall, and receptions can be held in a marquee <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b> During <b>the</b> summer months plays, concerts and other entertainments take place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open-air theatre close to the hall.|$|R

5|$|In 1943 French agents {{reported}} that the Germans were planning to mount an offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> served by rail links. The first signs of abnormal activity at Mimoyecques were spotted by analysts at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit in September 1943, when aerial reconnaissance revealed that the Germans were building railway loops leading to the tunnels into the eastern and western sites. Further reconnaissance flights in October 1943 photographed large-scale activity around the tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Males {{mark their}} territories with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes {{made by the}} feet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> twisted saplings also seem {{to be used for}} communication. Members of other rhino species have a {{peculiar}} habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back feet in the dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.|$|E
5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are {{used for this purpose}} and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E

5|$|The corn crake's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} grassland, particularly hayfields, and it uses similar environments on the wintering grounds. This secretive species builds {{a nest of}} grass leaves in a hollow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> lays 6–14 cream-coloured eggs which are covered with rufous blotches. These hatch in 19–20 days, and the black precocial chicks fledge after about five weeks. This crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is completed. The corn crake is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates, the occasional small frog or mammal, and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain. Natural threats include introduced and feral mammals, large birds, various parasites and diseases.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{have their}} roots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> their trunk and {{branches}} extended towards the sky. This concept {{is found in}} many of the world's religions as a tree which links the underworld and the earth and holds up the heavens. In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose roots and branches extend to various worlds. Various creatures live on it. In India, Kalpavriksha is a wish-fulfilling tree, one of the nine jewels that emerged from the primitive ocean. Icons are placed beneath it to be worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants favours to the devout who tie threads round the trunk. Democracy started in North America when the Great Peacemaker formed the Iroquois Confederacy, inspiring the warriors of the original five American nations to bury their weapons under the Tree of Peace, an eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). In the creation story in the Bible, the tree of life and the knowledge of good and evil was planted by God in the Garden of Eden.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many of {{the sets}} {{featured}} on the show which were filmed on a Fox soundstage, the shot of the buried alien space craft was actually filmed in the hills near Simi Valley, California. Carter wanted a full-scale mock-up of the alien ship {{to be buried in}} the ground. This was unusual for the show; usually, {{a small portion of the}} ship would have been buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> the rest would have been filled in either via digital graphics, or with a scale model. In this episode, however, all of the shots of the alien ship, sans the take off, were done practically. To create the otherworldly glow of the ship, over 100 lamps were hidden within the craft. In addition, the ship itself was covered in glyphs that are supposed to be part of an unknown alien language. This was accomplished by designing fictional characters and programming them into a computer. These were then printed as letters which could be applied to the ship's hull.|$|E

5|$|When a {{vegetable}} is harvested, it {{is cut off}} from its source of water and nourishment. It continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so, a process most noticeable in the wilting of green leafy crops. Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life, but alternatively, these root crops can be left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> harvested over an extended period. The harvesting process should seek to minimise damage and bruising to the crop. Onions and garlic can be dried {{for a few days}} in the field and root crops such as potatoes benefit from a short maturation period in warm, moist surroundings, during which time wounds heal and the skin thickens up and hardens. Before marketing or storage, grading {{needs to be done to}} remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality, size, ripeness, and color.|$|E

25|$|When {{you take}} a tree that is rooted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> {{transfer}} it {{from one place to}} another, the tree will no longer bear fruit.

25|$|On 28 September 1977, a Japan Airlines Flight 472 {{en route}} from Mumbai to Tokyo was hijacked by 5 Japanese Red Army terrorists shortly after takeoff, and forced the plane to land at then Zia International Airport.

25|$|Traditional barbacoa {{involves}} {{digging a}} hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> placing some meat—usually a whole lamb—above a pot so the juices {{can be used}} to make a broth. It is then covered with maguey leaves and coal, and set alight. The cooking process takes a few hours. Olaudah Equiano, an African abolitionist, described this method of roasting alligators among the Mosquito People (Miskito people) on his journeys to Cabo Gracias a Dios in his narrative The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano.|$|E
25|$|In-situ {{leaching}} (ISL), {{also known}} as solution mining, or in-situ recovery (ISR) in North America, involves leaving the ore where it is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> recovering the minerals from it by dissolving them and pumping the pregnant solution to the surface where the minerals can be recovered. Consequently, there is little surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock generated. However, the orebody needs to be permeable to the liquids used, and located {{so that they do}} not contaminate ground water away from the orebody.|$|E
