5|$|The 1926 World Series {{was also}} known for Ruth's promise to Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy. Ruth promised the child that he would <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> on his behalf. Sylvester had been injured in a fall from a horse, {{and a friend of}} Sylvester's father gave the boy two autographed baseballs signed by Yankees and Cardinals. The friend relayed a promise from Ruth (who did not know the boy) that he would <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> for him. After the Series, Ruth visited the boy in the hospital. When the matter became public, the press greatly {{inflated}} it, and by some accounts, Ruth allegedly saved the boy's life by visiting him, emotionally promising to <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>run,</b> and doing so.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies' {{offensive}} woes {{seemed in}} the distant past as the lineup broke out in a big way during Game 4. Led by Ryan Howard's 3-for-4, 2 home run performance, and home runs by Jayson Werth and starting pitcher Joe Blanton, the Phillies pushed 10 runs across the plate. Blanton became the first World Series pitcher to <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> in 34 years, in addition to a strong performance on the mound, pitching six innings and allowing two earned runs on four hits.

Andy Pafko <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> to start the inning, and Hodges walked; he later scored on the fifth and final error made by the Giants to make the score 8–0. The bottom of the seventh and the eighth inning passed without a hit. In the ninth inning, Walker <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>run,</b> the fourth of the game, to make the score 10–0.

5|$|On July 9, 2011, Jeter {{recorded}} his 3,000th career <b>hit,</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> off of David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeter finished {{the day with}} five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have five hits {{on the day he}} achieved his 3,000th hit (the first was Craig Biggio). He also became the second player to <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> for his 3,000th hit, Wade Boggs having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter's five hits proved to be the game-winning hit. He is {{the only member of the}} 3,000 hit club to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees, and the only player to join the club as a Yankee. Jeter became the second player to reach 3,000 career hits while still a regular shortstop (the first was Honus Wagner). Only Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount were younger than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th hit. MLB and HBO produced Derek Jeter 3K, a documentary that profiled his path to 3,000 hits and originally aired on July 28, 2011.|$|E
5|$|On June 12 at AT Park, in a 6-3 {{win over}} the Houston Astros, Bumgarner hit his first career home run into left field off of Bud Norris.

Bumgarner also struck out twelve batters, {{becoming}} the most recent Giant to <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> and strikeout ten or more batters in the same game since Mike Krukow, who was announcing the game.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs, led by Tinker, Evers, and Chance, won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910.

In the Merkle game, Tinker <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>run</b> off Christy Mathewson, and Evers alerted umpire Hank O'Day to Merkle's baserunning gaffe. In the replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a triple off Mathewson that started the rally that gave the Cubs the victory, clinching the pennant.|$|E
