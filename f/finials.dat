5|$|The Servant's Hall, {{from which}} a {{staircase}} in the bay window descends to the basement, became the servant's dining room {{at the beginning of}} the 18th century. Outside, the six Doric columns on the East Terrace originally had decorative <b>finials,</b> now replaced by lamps.|$|E
5|$|The rusticated stone piers {{on either}} side of the main {{entrance}} gates are surmounted by entablatures and large ornamental vases, while those at the drive entrance have ornamental carved <b>finials.</b> The Porter's Lodge was built along with the main house to designs by John Wood the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Like many Elizabethan mansions, Barrington {{is built}} in an 'E' shape with large {{projecting}} wings with square projections that contain staircases. The {{house is not}} truly symmetrical as the hall has two lights and the buttery one. The south front has seven gables supported by octagonal buttresses and decorated with twisted <b>finials</b> with ogee scale-work caps and English Crockets.|$|E

50|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{feature of this}} pagoda is the base of pagoda <b>finial,</b> {{which looks like a}} roof stone. It is designed to support the <b>finial</b> {{at the top of the}} pagoda and gives the pagoda a distinct appearance.|$|R
5|$|The former stables, in {{red brick}} with a tiled roof, were {{completed}} around 1636 and are contemporary with the Jacobean mansion; they are listed at grade II*. They form a quadrangle {{immediately to the}} west of the hall, enclosing a rectangular courtyard. The main east face of the quadrangle stands at right angles to the front of the house; it has nine bays of two storeys and an attic. Its centrepiece, added by Edward Blore in around 1837, consists of an arched stone entrance flanked by pilasters, above which a clock tower rises from the first-floor level. The tower features twinned arrow-slit windows and clock faces with stone surrounds, and is topped by a bell chamber and ogee cupola with <b>finials.</b> In addition to the centrepiece, the east face has four bays which are set forward and have shaped gables topped with <b>finials.</b> The north and south ends of this east building also have shaped gables.|$|E
5|$|The {{frontage}} {{and principal}} {{entrance of the}} Town Hall face the River Roch, and comprises a portico of three arches intersected by buttresses. Decorating the main entrance are stone crockets, gargoyles, and <b>finials.</b> Four gilded lions above a parapet around three sides of the portico bear shields carrying the coats of arms of Rochdale Council and the hundred of Salford.|$|E
5|$|Externally, {{there are}} slate roofs and coped gables with cross <b>finials.</b> The roofs have {{patterned}} bands of fishscale Whitland Abbey slates, {{except on the}} nave. There are large scale, plain unbuttressed walls without batter for the nave, a nineteenth century south porch, two transepts and a chancel with a nineteenth century addition of a north choir vestry; the dating of the priests' vestry, {{on the north side}} of the chancel, is less certain. Externally, the nave downpipes on the south side are dated 1884.|$|E
50|$|During {{the various}} dynasties in China, a <b>finial</b> was worn {{on the top}} of the hats civil or {{military}} officials wore during formal court ceremonies. The <b>finial</b> was changed to a knob for other daily usage (including semi-formal ceremonies).|$|R
50|$|Historically, flags {{were flown}} at half-mast on the Commemoration Day of Fallen Soldiers {{which takes place}} on the third Sunday of May. Originally, flag was raised to the <b>finial</b> in the morning, {{displayed}} at half-mast from 10:00 to 14:00, and again raised to the <b>finial</b> {{for the rest of}} the day. In 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, the tradition of flying the flag at half-mast was discontinued and flag is displayed at the <b>finial</b> in a usual manner.|$|R

5|$|Most of {{the medieval}} stonework, is made from {{limestone}} taken from quarries around Dundry and Felton with Bath stone being used in other areas. The two-bay Elder Lady Chapel, which includes some Purbeck Marble, lies {{to the north of}} the five-bay aisled chancel or presbytery. The Eastern Lady Chapel has two bays, the sacristy one-bay and the Berkeley Chapel two bays. The exterior has deep buttresses with <b>finials</b> to weathered tops and crenellated parapets with crocketed pinnacles below the Perpendicular crossing tower.|$|E
5|$|On {{the rooftop}} and roof ridges are iconic statues of golden deer {{flanking}} a Dharma wheel, victory flags and monstrous fish. The temple interior {{is a dark}} labyrinth of chapels, illuminated by votive candles and filled with incense. Although portions of the temple has been rebuilt, original elements remain. The wooden beams and rafters have been shown by carbon dating to be original, and the Newari door frames, columns and <b>finials</b> dating to the seventh and eighth centuries were brought from the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal.|$|E
5|$|The Fuller Houses are {{originally}} {{believed to}} have been constructed as identical -story Queen Anne-styled homes with both having their gable-ends facing the street. The southern flank of the building is visually broken up by a two-story bay window with a gabled peak. A semi-octagonal bay on the northern corner of the houses indicates the position of the front staircase. A single-story porch with a shed-roof overhangs the front doorways. A striking feature of the Fuller Houses is the two-story circular porch on the southwest side. The porches are almost removed from the building and topped with a conical roof and ornamented with Queen Anne-style spindle. The exterior walls of the houses are clapboarded and the tops of the gables have simple metal <b>finials.</b>|$|E

This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements. The <b>finial</b> is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.|$|R
5|$|The double finial minaret {{was built}} in 1509 by Qansah al-Ghuri. Sitting on a square base, the first shaft is octagonal, and four sides have a {{decorative}} keel arch, separated from the adjacent sides with two columns. The second shaft, is a 12 - sided polygon separated from the first by a fretted balconies supported by muqarnas is decorated with blue faience. A balcony separates the third level from the second shaft. The third level {{is made up of}} two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts. Atop each of these two shafts rests a finial atop two identical onion shaped bulbs, with a balcony separating the <b>finials</b> from the shafts.|$|E
5|$|The inner ward is {{guarded by}} four large {{circular}} towers. Over time these acquired various names: in 1343, clockwise from the north-east, {{they were called}} Le Prisontour, Turris Ultra Gardinium, Le Wedercoktour and Le Chapeltour, but by 1564 they had been renamed the Debtors', Mortimer, Bronwen and Armourer's Towers respectively. Le Prisontour incorporated a dungeon and the Le Chapeltour may have contained an artillery workshop in the 16th century. Several ranges of buildings were built around the inner ward, including a chapel, kitchen, service buildings, a granary and a great hall. The battlements may originally have been built with triple <b>finials</b> {{in a similar fashion}} to Conwy, although little remains of these in the modern era.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, Plas Mawr {{is almost}} {{unchanged}} from the 16th century, {{making it a}} very rare survival from this period. The architectural style {{is a product of}} the broader Renaissance influences prevalent across Europe at the time. Robert Wynn spent time in Germany, and the style of Plas Mawr makes use of North German Gothic themes, particularly in its use of symmetry, the pedimented windows at the front of the house, faceted <b>finials</b> and crow-stepped gables. These features were already popular in England when the house was built, and indeed Plas Mawr is very similar in design to Eastbury Manor House, the two possibly being based off the same architectural plan. Some of these features had already begun to spread into Wales – crow-stepped gables, for example, were already being used in Flintshire by the 1580s – but others were ground breaking in Wales, such as the use of ovolo-moulded and dormer windows. Nonetheless, Robert Wynn was only an emerging member of the gentry, and his house was not as large or as sophisticated as contemporary grander Renaissance properties built in larger rural settings.|$|E
50|$|When {{hoisting}} a {{flag that}} is to be displayed at half-mast, it should be raised to the <b>finial</b> of the pole for an instant, then lowered to half-mast.

5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, Chelsea Bridge was in poor condition. It {{was unable to}} carry the {{increasing}} volume of traffic caused by the growth of London and the increasing popularity of the automobile; between 1914 and 1929 use of the bridge almost doubled from 6,500 to 12,600 vehicles per day. In addition, parts of its structure were beginning to work loose, and in 1922 the gilded <b>finials</b> on the towers {{had to be removed}} because of concerns that they would fall off. Architectural opinion had turned heavily against Victorian styles and Chelsea Bridge was now deeply unpopular with architects; former President of the Royal Institute of British Architects Reginald Blomfield spoke vehemently against its design in 1921, and there were few people supporting the preservation of the old bridge. In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross-river Traffic recommended that Chelsea Bridge be rebuilt or replaced.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Virginia Weddell hired {{architect}} William Lawrence Bottomley {{and purchased}} antique stone columns from the Spanish Duke of the Infantado to reconstruct an ancient Spanish loggia {{on the southwest}} elevation of the house. Bottomley was able to incorporate the existing parapets, <b>finials</b> and pierced railings and posts from the north library bay windows into the loggia design, with a ceiling reconstructed from a sixteenth-century house {{on the grounds of}} a manor in Knole, Kent, England. Wall tiles were used which indicated use of gunpowder on the original property. Bottomley, however, was quite critical of his own work and believed his loggia was too symmetrical and lacking in the quality of picturesqueness and romance {{that the rest of the}} house displayed and proposed an octagonal stairway be added on the outside corner. However, his idea was rejected by the Weddells, and the loggia was completed without the staircase in 1946. Bottomley was paid $10,764 and received a ten percent commission for his drawings and construction.|$|E
5|$|The churches {{had three}} aisles, divided by wooden columns, often solomonic columns, carved with twisted fluting {{resembling}} those at St. Peter's baldachin in St Peter's, Rome. Until modern times, {{there were no}} pews so the congregation had to kneel or sit on the floor. A variety of fine pieces of art adorn {{the inside of the}} churches, notably their altars, which are sometimes covered in gold, silver or mica. Especially remarkable are the pulpits made of brightly painted wood and supported by carved sirens. The pulpit in the church of San Miguel de Velasco features motifs derived from local vegetation. Elements specific to the Chiquitos missions exist also in other decorations. The altars of the churches of San Xavier and Concepción include depictions of notable Jesuits together with indigenous peoples. There remain a handful of original sculptures in retablos often depicting Madonnas, the crucifixion, and saints, carved in wood and then painted. These sculptures exhibit a style unique to the Chiquitos region, differing from that of the reductions in Paraguay or the Bolivian highlands. The tradition of figure carving has been preserved to the present day in workshops where carvers make columns, <b>finials</b> and windows for new or restored churches or chapels in the area. In addition, carvers produce decorative angels and other figures for the tourist market.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} ELP's {{turntable}} {{came from an}} American company named <b>Finial</b> Technologies, led by Michael Stoddard, who designed a prototype unit for playing vinyl using laser technology in the mid-1980s. Unfortunately, this coincided with the commercial rise of the CD, so <b>Finial</b> went into receivership and sold the rights to ELP in 1989.|$|R

5|$|In 1992, {{following}} an appeal for help by Norodom Sihanouk, Angkor Wat was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger (later removed in 2004) and World Heritage Site {{together with an}} appeal by UNESCO {{to the international community}} to save Angkor. Zoning of the area was set up to protect the Angkor site in 1994, APSARA was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area, and a law to protect Cambodian heritage was passed in 1996. A number of countries such as France, Japan and China are currently involved in various Angkor Wat conservation projects. The German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) is working to protect the devatas, and other bas-reliefs which decorate the temple, from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005. World Monuments Fund began conservation work on the Churning of the Sea of Milk Gallery in 2008 after several years of studies on its condition. The project restored the traditional Khmer roofing system and removed cement used in earlier restoration attempts that had resulted in salts entering the structure behind the bas-relief, discoloring and damaging the sculpted surfaces. The main phase of work ended in 2012, with the final component being the installation of <b>finials</b> {{on the roof of the}} gallery in 2013.|$|E
