The aims of these workshops are to teach the parties about conflict in general and their conflict in particular, to forge understanding between the parties and, if possible, to develop joint projects that will contribute to reconciliation. One evaluation study conducted showed that these workshops improved attitudes toward the other side, increase complexity of thinking about the conflict, and facilitate further communication with people on the other side (Fisher, 1997).

All these mines were close to one another and pumping water from the workings was still of highest priority: if any of the pumping engines stopped there were serious repercussions at the other mines. Such was the problem of underground water that their winding (whim) engines were adapted to haul water by using self-tipping water-skips—this was done at East Pool in 1897. East Pool mine still had a problem with water coming from Wheal Agar, which was losing money at the time and kept threatening to switch off its pumps, which it did in late 1895.

The task involved a grounding and a conflict resolution component. The results showed that video conferencing supported participant dyads in reaching a consensus that had better balanced performance between the dyads only when task difficulty was high and when there were more inherent conflicts in the task. Participants across the three CMC conditions also demonstrated different patterns of conversation dynamics during information exchange and negotiation. Mediation analysis showed that in video-based communication, strategies of exchanging less information at a time predicted <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>negotiation,</b> which in turn predicted smaller performance differences in high conflict conditions.

40|$|Background Globally, many {{technological}} innovations {{have been introduced}} for universal health coverage by increasing accessibility. mHealth (mobile phone based health) shows potentiality in improving maternal health service delivery {{with the help of}} communication between health care providers and beneficiaries. With the fastest growing mobile market {{over the last five years}} in low income setting (LIS) like Sub-Saharan Africa, Government and development partners are being encouraged to use mHealth. This study aims to see recurrent challenges from the program experiences of maternal health care (MHC) -focused mHealth initiatives from Ghana as country case study and how they address those challenges and secondly, supplemented by mHealth experiences in other LIS. Methods Qualitative data was collected mainly from 11 key informant interviews (KIIs) of senior officials of Ghana Health service, development organizations, government facility based health care providers- physician, community health nurse, ICT personnel, e-health specialist, Health MIS analyst and academic searchers. Interviews were face to face and via skype. Findings from Ghana were supplemented by literature review. Data was analysed via thematic analysis and stakeholder analysis was done to see their respective position for overcoming challenges using mHealth. Results Lack of national data ownership & non-sustainable plan for the skilled health force from the MOH, financial and double work burden of community health workers (CHWs), conflict of interest among collaborative partners & inter government departments, incomplete & inconsistent reporting due to distorted mobile network & data bundle and internet disruption, poor infrastructure of electricity and finally, business promotion strategy of telecommunication industries were the key challenges found in Ghana. Though they adapt some local strategies to minimize the acute problem, but like other low income settings, Ghana could not produce adequate scientific research evidences using primary data source. Conclusions: Ghana has many similar challenges to other low income settings; however, they adapt their own strategies to overcome. To increase utilization rate of maternal care, mHealth has been tested by different organizations in Ghana. To expand/scale up, <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>negotiation</b> & coordination among the profitable industries and government is necessary especially in staff development. Furthermore, more mHealth field research is expected before developing sustainable plan. Keywords: mHealth, Ghana, Maternal Care, Low income setting (LIS...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increased}} use of e-learning and with easier access to the Internet there is a growing concern with the quality of teaching that we as educators provide our students in higher education. E-learning provides a challenge to make learning an interactive and collaborative experience that is guided by a social constructivist approach to teaching and learning. This paper will discuss the processes of interactions among learners in higher education based on a specific online unit that was designed for science and mathematics teachers who were geographically and socially isolated. Underpinning the design of this unit was the creation of a networked community of learners which would enable the learners to engage with one another in peer learning and reflective thinking. In order to investigate the extent to which peer learning and reflective thinking occurred, qualitative data from students' transcripts, end of semester evaluations and students reflective stories were analysed. Analysis suggests that participants demonstrated a strong sense of belonging to this community, thus enabling them to share their experiential knowledge. Peer learning became a significant feature of the community, however, we believe that sometimes the opportunity for critical reflection was missed. As a result, students' interaction mainly occurred at the level of sharing and comparing information rather than negotiating meaning for the purpose of co-constructing knowledge. Based on this experience we faced with the following dilemmas: •How to create an online environment which promotes critical discourse among the online participants? •What {{is the role of the}} teacher in creating this environment? •How can the teacher challenge and transform students' interactions from the level of sharing information to <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>negotiation?</b> This should lead to further general discussion on: •How can we create an online learning environment where the teacher takes the role of a facilitator and the students engage in peer learning...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to systematically}} explore teaching and learning English as a foreign language in a 3 D game-like multi-user virtual learning environment (MUVE), Quest Atlantis (QA). This dissertation project is comprised of two studies, offering distinct theoretical perspectives and analytic data techniques for measuring and describing the phenomenon of English language learning in the virtual world. These studies, however, share the same meta-theoretical framework of learning by doing (Dewey, 1910), in that thinking {{and the use of}} language are in service to action, not just about action. Study 1 [...] -Attitude and Self-Efficacy Change [...] -used quasi-experimental design and quantitative analytic tools to measure the differences of Controls and a QA group 2 ̆ 7 s affective factors and English achievement test during a one academic year 2 ̆ 7 s intervention, during which QA participants explored English-only QA worlds, completed content driven quests, and chatted with native English speakers. The findings, that the experimental group reported a more positive attitude and higher self-efficacy than the control group toward various aspects of language learning and use, are significantly important for both educational research and classroom practice. Failure to find differences on standardized post performance tests of English writing raises issues concerning the trade-offs between test preparation and engaging activities that may sustain learning. ^ Study 2 [...] -A Cross-Cultural Interaction [...] -took a finer grain analysis approach to look at the chat logs and other QA-generated artifacts and examines how cross-cultural interaction in a virtual space, specifically collaboration between NES 2 ̆ 7 and NNES 2 ̆ 7 in QA, provided resources for English language acquisition. Qualitative tools including the CHILDES CLAN program, Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis and ethnography were used to examine the smallest unit of analysis, perception and action. Iterative multi-layered analyses revealed the affordances of QA at different levels. Co-questing was particularly interpretable based on the assumptions and underlying design intentions of ecological psychology and sociocultural cognition. Co-questing afforded a <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of meaning making enacted in collaboration through the chat channel. In other words, this <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of <b>Negotiation</b> for Meaning appeared {{to be the result of}} goal directed behavior within the social and cultural boundaries of the QA situation. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{comprehensive}} institutional understanding {{of the extent to}} which ecosystem services (ES) thinking is integrated in Chinese coastal and marine governance. It draws on a multi-level case study analysis (local, municipal, and national levels) and attempts to clarify the importance of attuning institutional arrangements with coastal and marine ecosystems, thereby providing lessons to improve the quality of governance. Results illustrate a certain level of consideration of ESs in policies, recognizing human dependence on coastal and marine ecosystems in different ways. However, some fundamental ESs and relevant indirect impacts are implicit, which requires characterizing more broadly all possible ESs and account for ES interrelationships. The analysis also reveals that Chinese practice lacks evidence on developing institutional solutions to ecological issues at an appropriate geographical scale. To increase the capacity of dealing with complex ES issues, coastal and marine governance demands institutional adjustments and cooperation to integrate ecological entity and different geographies. In China, the valuation and use of ESs wields a rising influence at the strategic level of governance but encounters limited acceptance among organizations. This suggests further efforts to clarify the ES concept, improve knowledge learning and communication, and increase the reliability of valuation. Finally, this research clearly shows that institutional arrangements can significantly influence the ES integration. Chinese policies highlight regulatory support for facilitating economic incentives as a way to allocate ESs. However, a <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of voluntary <b>negotiations</b> and exchanges between actors should be encouraged under the required regulations...|$|R
