Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 82 - 84. The term plasmon-polariton is used {{to describe}} coupled modes of electromagnetic waves with <b>electronic</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> in conductors. Surface plasmon resonances have found profound interest {{over the last few}} decades in multiple fields ranging from nanophotonics to biological sensing. In this thesis, we study enhancement of absorption and emission of radiation due to the presence of a modified local electromagnetic mode density within the vicinity of metallic surfaces supporting plasmon modes. Various coupling schemes of freespace electromagnetic modes to plasmon modes are investigated theoretically and experimentally. Local mode densities and field enhancements due to plasmon modes in planar structures, gratings and optical antennas have been studied in their relation to the absorption and emission enhancement of dipoles positioned in various orientations and locations with respect to structures displaying plasmonic effects. Particularly, grating coupled plasmon resonances were analysed using Rigorously Coupled Wave Analysis and Finite Difference Time domain methods. Experimental demonstrations of absorption and emission enhancement of dielectric layers containing Rhodamine 6 G on various plasmonic structures are given. Confocal Raman microscopy was used in characterization of fabricated structures. It is seen that the experimental measurements are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Direction dependent luminescence enhancement is observed with dye molecules on grating structures. Potential applications of plasmon enhanced absorption and emission include high sensitivity absorption spectroscopy, performance enhancement in thin film solar cells and luminescent concentrators.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{study of}} the IMP- 6 and IMP- 8 plasma and radio wave data was performed {{to try to find}} electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> associated with type III radio noise bursts and low-energy solar electrons. It is shown that electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> are seldom observed in association with solar electron events and type III radio bursts at 1. 0 AU. For the one case in which electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> are definitely produced by the electrons ejected by the solar flare the electric field strength is relatively small. Electromagnetic radiation, believed to be similar to the type III radio emission, is observed coming from the region of the more intense electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> upstream. Quantitative calculations of the rate of conversion of the <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillation</b> energy to electromagnetic radiation are presented for <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> excited by both solar electrons and electrons from the bow shock. These calculations show that neither the type III radio emissions nor the radiation from upstream of the bow shock can be adequately explained by a current theory for the coupling of electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> to electromagnetic radiation...|$|R
40|$|Electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> in the earth's {{electron}} foreshock {{region are}} observed to shift {{above and below}} the local electron plasma frequency. As <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> shift downward from the plasma frequency, their bandwidth increases and their wavelength decreases. Observations of <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> well below the plasma frequency are correlated with times when ISEE 1 is far downstream of the electron foreshock boundary. Although wavelengths of <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> below the <b>plasma</b> frequency satisfy k x lambda-De approximately 1 the Doppler shift due to the motion of the solar wind is not sufficient to produce the observed frequency shifts. A beam-plasma interaction with beam velocities on the order of the electron thermal velocity is suggested as an explanation for <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> {{above and below the}} plasma frequency. Frequency, bandwidth, and wavelength changes predicted from the beam-plasma interaction are in good agreement with the observed characteristics of <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> in the foreshock region...|$|R

In this paper the principal characteristics of these <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> are reviewed and the observed <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillation</b> intensities are compared with recent measurements of the emissivity of type III radio bursts.

40|$|Electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> {{have been}} {{detected}} upstream of the solar wind ter-mination shock by the plasma wave instrument on the Voyager 1 spacecraft. These waves were first observed on 11 February 2004, at a heliocentric radial distance of 91. 0 astronomical units, and continued sporadically with a gradually increasing occurrence rate for nearly a year. The last event occurred on 15 December 2004, at 94. 1 astronomical units, just before the spacecraft crossed the termination shock. Since then, no further electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> have been observed, consistent with the spacecraft having crossed the termination shock into the heliosheath. Electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations,</b> also known as Langmuir waves, {{are one of the}} oldest known and most widely studied of all plasma wave phenomena (1). For many years it has been known that electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> are generated ahead of planetary bow shocks by energetic electrons escaping into the solar wind upstream of the shock (2 â€“ 7). This close relationship led Kurth and Gurnett (8) to pre-dict that electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> would be present upstream of the solar wind termination shock. Here, we report the initial observations of these waves.

40|$|Results of an {{extensive}} search for electron <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> associated with type III radio noise bursts are presented which {{were obtained by}} analyzing 87 type III bursts detected in plasma-wave and charged-particle measurements carried out by IMP 6, 7, and 8.

The type III emissions are compared with similar radiation coming from upstream of earth's bow shock at the harmonic of the local electron plasma frequency, and quantitative calculations of the rate of conversion from plasma oscillatory energy to electromagnetic radiation are performed.

40|$|We {{study the}} dynamic {{effects in the}} double graphene-layer (GL) {{structures}} with the resonant-tunneling (RT) and the negative differential inter-GL conductivity. Using the developed model, which accounts for the excitation of self-consistent oscillations of the electron and hole densities and the ac electric field between GLs (<b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations),</b> we calculate the admittance of the double-GL RT structures {{as a function of}} the signal frequency and applied voltages, and the spectrum and increment/decrement of <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Our results show that the electron-hole plasma in the double-GL RT structures with realistic parameters is stable with respect to the self-excitation of <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> and aperiodic perturbations. The stability of the electron-hole plasma at the bias voltages corresponding to the inter-GL RT and strong nonlinearity of the RT current-voltage characteristics enable using the double-GL RT structures for detection of teraherz (THz) radiation. The excitation of <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations</b> by the incoming THz radiation can result in a sharp resonant dependence of detector responsivity on radiation frequency and the bias voltage. Due to a strong nonlinearity of the current-voltage characteristics of the double-GL structures at RT and the resonant excitation of <b>plasma</b> <b>oscillations,</b> the maximum responsivity, $R_V^{max}$, can markedly exceed the values $(10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 5) $~V/W at room temperature.
