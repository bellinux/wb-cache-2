25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

Obama said she and her husband believe [...] "that you work hard <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them." [...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements about feeling proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe. That keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%.|$|E

500|$|By 1762, however, Johnson {{had gained}} notoriety for his dilatoriness in writing; the {{contemporary}} poet Churchill teased Johnson {{for the delay}} in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: [...] "He for subscribers baits his hook / and takes your cash, but where's the book?" [...] The comments soon motivated Johnson to finish his Shakespeare, and, after receiving the first payment from a government pension on 20 July 1762, {{he was able to}} dedicate most of his time towards this goal. Earlier that July, the 24-year-old King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of £300 in appreciation for the Dictionary. While the pension did not make Johnson wealthy, it did allow him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining 22 years of his life. The award came largely through the efforts of Sheridan and the Earl of Bute. When Johnson questioned if the pension would force him to promote a political agenda or support various officials, he was told by Bute that the pension [...] "is not given you for anything you are to do, but <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done".|$|E

2500|$|Sales {{taxes are}} levied when a {{commodity}} is sold to its final consumer. Retail organizations contend that such taxes discourage retail sales. The {{question of whether}} they are generally progressive or regressive is a subject of much current debate. People with higher incomes spend a lower proportion of them, so a flat-rate sales tax will tend to be regressive. It is therefore common to exempt food, utilities and other necessities from sales taxes, since poor people spend {{a higher proportion of}} their incomes on these commodities, so such exemptions make the tax more progressive. This is the classic [...] "You pay <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> spend" [...] tax, as only those who spend money on non-exempt (i.e. luxury) items pay the tax.|$|E
