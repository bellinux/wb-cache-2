50|$|Ballas got {{the idea}} for the trimmer while driving through an {{automatic}} car wash, where the rotating brushes gave him an idea. Using a tin can laced with fishing line and an <b>edge</b> <b>trimmer,</b> he tried out his idea, which worked. After some refinements, he shopped it around to several tool makers, who all rejected his invention. He went on to develop the garden tool himself. The first year, sales were over a half million dollars. By 1977 they were $80 million, and Ballas sold his company the following year to Emerson Electric Company.|$|E
40|$|Discussing {{the results}} of archaeological {{investigation}} at two important medieval sites - remains of the monastery of St George at Mažići near Priboj and of the church at Drenova near Prijepolje - the author puts forward his critical observations that make significant revisions to the conclusions suggested by excavators. The remains of a monastery at Mažići have long ago been identified with the monastery of St George in the župa (district) of Dabar known from early 13 th-century records. In the 1310 s a monastery of St George is referred to {{in association with the}} toponym of Orahovica. After a long gap, the monastery is referred to again several times in the 1600 s until its final destruction in 1743, as St George’s at Orahovica or simply Mažić(i). The report following systematic archaeological excavations suggests the unacceptable and unfounded conclusion, with dating and interpretation that the monastery church was built in the 13 th century, received additions in the 14 th, and was renovated in the 16 th- 17 th centuries when there was a hospital attached to it. Careful analysis of the structural remains and the site’s stratigraphy clearly shows that the monastery was built on the site of a medieval cemetery of a 14 th- 15 th-century date, which means that the church and its buildings cannot be older than the 16 th century. The author also argues against the assumed presence of a monastic hospital, the assumption being based upon metal artifacts misinterpreted as "medical instruments" (parchment <b>edge</b> <b>trimmer,</b> compasses, fork!!!). The author’s inference is that the ruins at Mažići are not the remains of the monastery of St George, which should be searched for elsewhere, but possibly the legacy of a 14 th-century monastic establishment which was moved there from an as yet unknown location most likely about the middle of the 16 th century. The site at Drenova, with remains of a church destroyed by land slide, has been known since the late 19 th century when a stone block was found there bearing the opening part of an inscription: "+ Te Criste auctore pontifex [...] . ", long believed to date from the 9 th- 10 th century. Following the excavations, but based on this dating the church remains were interpreted as pre- Romanesque, and the interpretation entailed some major historical conclusions. From a more recent and careful analysis, the inscription has been correctly dated to the 6 th century. With this dating as his starting-point, the author examines the fieldwork results and suggests that the block is an early-Byzantine spolium probably from the late-antique site of Kolovrat near Prijepolje, reused in the medieval period as a tombstone in the churchyard, where such examples are not lonely. It follows that the inscribed block is not directly relatable to the church remains and that it cannot be used as dating evidence. On the other hand, the church remains show features of the Romanesque-Gothic style of architecture typical of the Pomorje, the Serbian Adriatic coast. According to close analogies found for some elements of its stone decoration, the date of the church could not precede the middle of the 13 th century. The question remains open as to who had the church built and what its original function was, that is whether a monastic community center round it. Its founder may be sought for among members of the ruling Nemanjić house, but a church dignitary cannot be ruled out. Anumber of complex issues raised by this site are yet to be resolved, but the study should be relieved of earlier misconceptions. Fresh information about this ruined medieval church should be provided by revision excavations in the future...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of CFRP needs <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> {{in order to}} remove burrs as well as undefined orientated fibres and to shape the final part contour. <b>Edge</b> <b>trimming</b> is usually done by contour milling. The quality of machined edges may be affected by fibre protrusions and delaminated fibres which cause manual repair or may even lead to scrap. Delamination of fibres is often initiated by stresses applied during engagement of the cutting edge. Based on measured cutting forces, the stress distribution and the inter fibre fracture modes in the boundary zone of the machined surface are calculated using Lekhnitskii's theory of elasticity for anisotropic elastic bodies and the fracture criteria of Puck. In course of the continuing <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> process, fibre ends in the damaged boundary zone might not be cut off but deflected by subsequent tool engagements, as {{can be observed in}} high speed videos. In the case of existing fibre protrusions, a relation between the minimum depth of the damaged zone, the fibre orientation at the machined edge and the fibre properties was derived using elementary bending models. The analysis underlines the existence of only one type of surface ply delamination i. e. fibre protrusions and fibre delamination always occur together...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLaser {{technology}} {{has been used in}} industrial processes for several decades. The most advanced development and implementation took place in laser welding and cutting of metals in automotive and ship building industries. However, there is high potential to apply laser processing to other materials in various industrial fields. One of these potential fields could be paper industry to fulfill the demand for high quality, fast and reliable cutting technology. Difficulties in industrial application of laser cutting for paper industry are associated to lack of basic information, awareness of technology and its application possibilities. Nowadays possibilities of using laser cutting for paper materials are widened and high automation level of equipment has made this technology more interesting for manufacturing processes. Promising area of laser cutting application at paper making machines is longitudinal cutting of paper web (<b>edge</b> <b>trimming).</b> There are few locations at a paper making machine where <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> is usually done: wet press section, calender or rewinder.

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRPs) {{have found}} wide-ranging applications in numerous industrial {{fields such as}} aerospace, automotive, and shipping industries due to their excellent mechanical properties that lead to enhanced functional performance. In this paper, an experimental study on <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> of CFRP was done with various cutting conditions and different geometry of tools such as helical-, fluted-, and burr-type tools. The investigation involves the measurement of cutting forces for the different machining conditions {{and its effect on}} the surface quality of the <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> The modern cutting tools (router tools or burr tools) selected for machining CFRPs, have complex geometries in cutting edges and surfaces, and therefore a traditional method of direct tool wear evaluation is not applicable. An acoustic emission (AE) sensing was employed for on-line monitoring of the performance of router tools to determine the relationship between AE signal and length of machining for different kinds of geometry of tools. The investigation showed that the router tool with a flat cutting edge has better performance by generating lower cutting force and better surface finish with no delamination on <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> The mathematical modeling for the prediction of cutting forces was also done using Artificial Neural Network and Regression Analysis...|$|R
