40|$|In wood industry, <b>decorative</b> <b>veneer</b> is {{a product}} of high added value. Although the {{technological}} process of sliced veneer is well known, its quality and price depend on many technological parameters of production, particularly on the quality of logs. The research, which was focused on the influence of visual defects of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) logs and the impact of climatic conditions in the drying phase of sliced veneer on the surface veneer waviness, was conducted in an industrial environment. The results indicate that the largest share of waved veneer was cut from cracked logs (71 %) and less from curved logs (20 %). The veneer was sorted manually by experienced controllers from this branch of industry. Their subjective criteria can affect the accuracy of classification of veneer and, consequently, the research results. Therefore, the possibility of using 3 D camera for measuring veneer waviness and grading the veneer into quality classes was examined...|$|E

40|$|One way to {{overcome}} the shortages of raw material for wood based industries in Indonesia nowadays is to utilize the lesser known wood species. Therefore, the basic properties of these lesser known wood species should be studied. Wood anatomy of nine lesser known wood species from East Kalimantan have been observed and described for identification purposes and for evaluation of their properties and then appropriate uses. For identification purpose several main features have been noted : 1) Perforation plat scalariform in Mastixia trichotoma and Drypetes sp.; 2) Closely spaced parenchyma bands and radial intercellular canal in Ficus variegata; 3) Parenchyma reticulate in Drypetes sp, Diospyro macrophylla and Koilodepas sp.; 4) Fiber septate in Glochidion philippicum; 5) Rays almos exlusively homocelullar with gum-like deposite in vessels o/Lansium sp.

The factors investigated were face veneer thickness and preparation, lathe-­‐check orientation, adhesive and core type.

40|$|Abstract Author: Bc. Jan Lipták Title: Review of the {{possibility}} of the use of the stone veneer for constructional materials sheathing The aim of the diploma thesis was to review whether the stone veneer is suitable or comparable material for sheathing constructional materials. The beech veneer was used for the comparison. Firstly, the history of the <b>veneers</b> and the <b>decorative</b> <b>veneers</b> manufacturing are described in the theoretical part. Then it is focused on the stone treatment, its history and the manufacturing of the stone veneer. The next part of the thesis deals with the methods of the stone and beech veneer testing: bending strength tests, glue strength tests, humidity and density assessing and tests of the surface working resistance to a falling small ball. Further, results of measurements are presented in form of tables and graphs. The results proved that the stone veneer is comparable to the beech veneer that reached better results in bending strength. The stone veneer is better in the glue strength. The density tests pointed out the higher density of the stone veneer. The humidity is influenced by the density and the stone veneer samples were of lower humidity. The tests of the surface working resistance to a falling small ball did not recorded notable differences, the degree of the damage was assessed to be of the level 4. The last part of the thesis comprises the discussion, conclusion and literature references...|$|R

50|$|Veneered MDF {{provides}} many of {{the advantages}} of MDF with a <b>decorative</b> wood <b>veneer</b> surface layer. In modern construction, spurred by the high costs of hardwoods, manufacturers have been adopting this approach to achieve a high quality finishing wrap covering over a standard MDF board. One common type uses oak veneer. Making veneered MDF is a complex procedure, which involves taking an extremely thin slice of hardwood (approx 1-2mm thick) and then through high pressure and stretching methods wrapping them around the profiled MDF boards. This is only possible with very simple profiles because otherwise when the thin wood layer has dried out, it will break at the point of bends and angles.|$|R

500|$|Chacoan wall {{faces are}} {{typically}} called [...] "veneers", {{but they were}} integral load-bearing elements rather than <b>decorative</b> overlays. The <b>veneers</b> {{are known for their}} attention to coursing and detail, and various styles have become synonymous with Chacoan building. Depending on the facing style, the joints between the stones would be filled with spalls or chinks, set in mud mortar; or the coursing could alternate between larger stones and several courses of smaller tablets. Good veneer minimized the amount of exposed mortar, which reduced maintenance, maximized stone contact, and increased the strength of the wall. It also reduced the possibility of structural failure. Aside from structural considerations, some veneers are the result of highly skilled masons working within well-developed craft traditions. Recurring veneer patterns may indicate a widespread style used during a particular period, or they may suggest the work of a specific social group or line of builders.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Astronium graveolens Jacq., also {{commonly}} known as "Gateado" or "Gateado Galán," is a timber tree often used for making fine furniture, <b>decorative</b> sliced <b>veneer,</b> sawn, keels and long structures such as beams and trusses posts (1 - 2). The species are used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat allergies, inflammation, diarrhea and ulcers. Previous phytochemical studies report the presence of gallotannins as galloylglucose compounds, trans-ocimene (3) and flavonoids. In this work, we reported the isolation of known compounds as chlorogenic acid, quercitrin, quercetin 3 -O-glucoside (4) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (5). Studies report an interesting anti-angiogenic activity for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (6), we evaluated its ability to bind and inhibit the Human Placental Growth Factor (hPlGF), a key mediator of pathological angiogenesis. Materials and Methods. The leaves of Astronium graveolens collected (July 2010) at the Experimental Station "Caparo,― Barinas State, Venezuela were defatted with n-hexane and successively extracted for 48 h with chloroform and and methanol, to give 8. 5, 8. 0 and 8. 3 g of the respective residues. A portion of methanol extract (2. 5 g), was chromatographed on Sephadex LH- 20 using MeOH as eluent. A total of 106 fractions were collected (8 ml each) and combined by TLC results on silica 60 F 254 gel-coated glass sheets with n-BuOH–AcOH–H 2 O (60 : 15 : 25) and CHCl 3 –MeOH–H 2 O (40 : 9 : 1), to give 11 pooled fractions (A–K). The fractions more interesting were purified by RP-HPLC. The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated by 1 D- and 2 D-NMR Spectroscopy (1 H, 13 C, 13 C DEPT, DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMBC, ROESY) and confirmed by mass spectrometry studies. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) was used to study the interaction of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose and the h-PlGF binding to its receptor (h-VEGF-R 1 or h-Flt- 1); the concentrations are: 0, 5 mg for h-Flt- 1, 10 ng for h-PlGF, 0, 5 mg for the biotinylated antibody and 200, 100, 50, 25, 12, 5, 6, 25, 3, 12 μM for the natural compound. Finally, we measured the binding affinity between 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose and h-PlGF with surface plasmon resonance assays, using Biacore technology. Results and Discussion. The phytochemical study of methanol extract led to isolation of phenolic compounds as chlorogenic acid, quercitrin, quercetin 3 -O-glucoside (4) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (5). The competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose is able to reduce by 58...|$|R
