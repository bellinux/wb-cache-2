50|$|The {{stage was}} {{introduced}} in 1933 by B.B. Bancroft. As proposed by Bancroft, the Hirnantian included the Hirnant Limestone and related sedimentary formations. These formations were located {{at the very top}} of Ordovician deposits, and were dominated by a fauna which included brachiopods, trilobites, and other “shelly” or <b>hard-coated</b> animals. In 1966, D. A. Bassett, Harry Blackmore Whittington, and A. Williams, writing in the Journal of the Geological Society of London, proposed a refinement to the Hirnantian stage. This expanded the stage to include all of the Foel-y-Ddinas Mudstones, of which the Hirnant Limestone is a part. This expansion brought the Hirnantian stage to its current scope.|$|E

40|$|Thin {{multilayer}} structures {{consisting of}} a nanocomposite CrZrx alloy on SiO 2 are grown by magnetron sputtering onto <b>hard-coated</b> polymeric substrates at 350 K. The grain structure and electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite alloy were investigated using atomic force microscopy, dc conductivity, spectrophotometry, and nano-scratch testing. Despite the sputtered films being grown in the same deposition run, the grain structure and properties of the thin films were observed to change depending on the siloxane-based hard-coat employed. These studies indicate {{that in addition to}} the substrate’s roughness, the hardness of the siloxane-based hard-coat correlates well with the changing properties of the sputtered thin films.

30|$|Extreme heat {{tolerance}} {{has been}} found in seeds of desert succulents (Aizoaceae, Cactaceae). A high proportion of seeds survived exposure to 103 °C for 17 h (Daws et al. 2007). In their study, survival rate of seeds correlated with maximum annual temperature, suggesting that heat tolerance has evolved, enabling these species to persist in a soil seed bank. In fireprone southeastern Australia, Judd et al. (1993) found 90 °C to 100 °C to be a threshold temperature for 90 % seed mortality if seeds of three myrtaceous shrub species were heated gradually over the course of 30 min to 60 min.

40|$|In {{this study}} samples of AISI 4140 steel were surface treated by plasma {{nitriding}} and {{coated with a}} hydrogen-free hard carbon coating, also known as tetrahedral amorphous carbon coating (ta-C). The specimens were investigated {{with respect to their}} microhardness, residual stress, coating adhesion and dry sliding wear resistance. Wear tests in which duplex-treated specimens were mated to hardened ball bearing steel were performed under unidirectional and reciprocating sliding. To examine the influence of the nitriding conditions on the performance of duplex-treated steel, the coating was deposited on hardened as well as on plasma nitrided samples, nitrided under two different nitriding conditions. The results show greatly improved sliding wear resistance of plasma-nitrided <b>hard-coated</b> specimens compared with un-coated and pre-hardened ones, observed for both unidirectional and reciprocating sliding. Furthermore, the hydrogen-free hard carbon coating produced a reduction in the coefficient of friction of approximately one order of magnitude.

40|$|Abstract. The {{surface texture}} of sheet steel plays an {{important}} role for automotive applications. To achieve appropriate surface topographies and press-forming behaviour, a new laser coating texturing (LCT) technique aimed at texturing steel work-rolls was proposed. The laser texturing process was realized by applying laser pulses at very high repetition rates to produce innumerable micro-craters with the required shape profile {{on the surface of the}} rolls. Moreover, the surface alloying of the dimples was carried out on the substrates of bearing steel GCr 15. The submicron WC-Co alloy metal powder was melted into the micro-craters by high laser energy. The effects of processing parameters on the properties of the laser textured samples were investigated. The dimpled surfaces were examined by a 3 -dimensional surface profilometer. Microstructures of the coating layers were assessed by optical and scanning electron microscopy. The experimental investigations show that the laser-dimpled <b>hard-coated</b> surfaces exhibit compatible metallurgical interfaces with the substrates. The laser coating textured roll is demonstrated to have excellent abrasion resistance and a much longer service life. The abrasive wear resistance was 5 times higher than that of the substrates.

30|$|All {{species of}} Australian acacias {{that have been}} widely planted outside their native range over decades have become {{invasive}} and have caused negative impacts. Invasions and associated impacts typically manifest only several decades after large-scale plantings (Richardson et al. 2011; Richardson et al. 2015). Given the relatively recent expansion of A. mangium plantings (Table 1), the lack of major problems with invasiveness until now in some areas has probably led to {{the assumption that the}} species poses limited problems with invasiveness. As far as we know, little or no attention was given to issues pertaining to invasiveness when planning major plantings in any of the areas listed in Table 1. Several life-history traits of A. mangium are strongly associated with invasiveness in woody plants: these include rapid growth, and the capacity to produce very large numbers of <b>hard-coated,</b> heat-tolerant and long-lived seeds that are adapted for long-distance dispersal by birds (Awang and Taylor; 1993; Franco et al. 1994; Gibson et al. 2011). Suhaili et al. (2015) argued that invasions of A. mangium into tropical heath forests of Borneo may be controlled by a proper management of plantations and monitoring of soil seed banks, but we could find no evidence that this has been attempted or is likely to be practical.|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to direct fire cues such as heat, smoke and charred wood, {{the passage of}} fire leads indirectly to changes in environmental conditions which {{may be able to}} break physical dormancy in <b>hard-coated</b> seeds. After a fire, the open canopy and the burnt material lying on the surface alter the thermal properties of the soil, resulting in elevated soil temperatures for long periods of time. We simulated daily temperature regimes experienced at different depths of soil profile after a summer fire. Our aim was to determine whether these temperature regimes and the duration of exposure (5, 15 and 30 days) play an important role breaking physical seed dormancy in six legumes from south-eastern Australia. Our results showed that simulated temperature regimes break seed dormancy. This effect is specially pronounced at temperatures that are expected to occur near the soil surface (0 - 2 cm depth). The duration of exposure interacts with temperature to break dormancy, with the highest germination rates reached after the longest duration and highest temperatures. However, the germination response varied among species. Therefore, this indirect post-fire cue could {{play a role in the}} regeneration of plant communities, and could stimulate seedling emergence independent of direct fire cues as well as in interaction with direct cues. © 2010 CSIRO...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} soil quality, organic amendments of soils may affect weed seed survival, emergence, growth and reproduction. This study evaluated the effects of applications of different qualities of organic amendments on size and composition of the weed seed bank in a field under sequential cropping over 4 years. Fertilisation systems tested included farmyard manure, vegetable fruit and garden waste compost, two types of farm compost differing in carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, cattle slurry and mineral fertiliser. All organically amended plots received equal amounts of C. Crop growth was equalised on all plots by applying supplemental mineral N. Seed bank sampling took place in May 2009 {{to a depth of}} 10 cm. The weed seed bank was analysed using the seedling emergence method. Despite equal crop growth in fertilised plots, total seed bank density was lowest in plots amended with compost with low C:N ratio and highest in slurry-amended plots. Observed differences in seed bank densities reflected differences in soil organic carbon content and microbial biomass. At plot level, <b>hard-coated</b> seeds in the seed bank (e. g. Chenopodium spp.) were inversely related to soil microbial activity. Observed differential responses of species to applied fertilisers might be attributed to interspecific differences in resistance against microbial seed degradation.

30|$|Most of the {{perceived}} invasive alien species are pioneer trees, shrubs or climbers in their natural environments that establish themselves on disturbed sites, in large forest gaps and along the forest margin (Table 1, Geldenhuys et al. 1986; Geldenhuys 1996 a, 1997). They are generally shade intolerant and thus unable to get established under their own canopies. The fruits/seeds of many invader tree species are either small, wind-dispersed (eucalypts, pines and poplars) or have long-living <b>hard-coated</b> seeds (acacias, {{some of which are}} dispersed by birds, e.g. Acacia melanoxylon; see Geldenhuys et al. 1986; Geldenhuys 1997). By contrast, the majority of the natural forest tree species have short-lived seeds, are bird or mammal dispersed and are tolerant of shade (Geldenhuys 1996 c). Several of {{the perceived}} invasive alien species have three or more uses (Geldenhuys 1986). Many are introduced commercial timber species, used in plantation forestry such as the pines, eucalypts and acacias. Several of these species have considerable use value in rural households and contribute to the conservation of the natural forest by providing essential products, such as poles, laths and firewood (Geldenhuys & Cawe 2011; Geldenhuys et al. 2016). Most of these invasive alien species facilitate establishment and growth of shade-tolerant forest species (Geldenhuys 1996 a, 1997; Geldenhuys & Delvaux 2007). Invader plant control was considered to be most effective through the management of the succession process (Geldenhuys et al. 1986).|$|E
