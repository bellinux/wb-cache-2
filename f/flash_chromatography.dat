50|$|The {{particle}} {{size of the}} stationary phase is generally finer in <b>flash</b> column <b>chromatography</b> than in gravity column chromatography. For example, {{one of the most}} widely used silica gel grades in the former technique is mesh 230 - 400 (40 - 63 µm), while the latter technique typically requires mesh 70 - 230 (63 - 200 µm) silica gel.|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, Still and {{coworkers}} published a highly influential paper reporting a purification technique known as <b>flash</b> column <b>chromatography.</b> [...] Prior to this report, column chromatography using silica gel as a stationary phase {{had already been}} established as a valuable method for the separation and purification of organic compounds. However, elution of the solvent by gravity alone was often a tedious process, requiring several hours and leading to poor separations due to band broadening via diffusion. Still's innovation was to apply pressure {{to the top of}} the column to increase the speed of solvent elution. Not only did this drastically reduce the time required to run the column, but it also allowed for the routine separation of compounds having an Rf difference of 0.10 or greater. After optimizing this procedure, Still compiled a table correlating column diameter, volume of eluant, amount of sample, and typical fraction size, providing a useful guide for application of this technique in the laboratory. Today, <b>flash</b> column <b>chromatography</b> is one of the most important methods for the purification of organic compounds, especially when working on a small scale (< 50 mg) where the techniques of recrystallization and distillation are impractical. Still's paper describing <b>flash</b> column <b>chromatography</b> remains his most highly cited publication and holds the distinction of being one of the most frequently downloaded papers from the Journal of Organic Chemistry, despite being published over 35 years ago.|$|R

5000|$|Different {{compounds}} {{in the sample}} mixture travel at different rates due to the differences in their attraction to the stationary phase and because of differences in solubility in the solvent. [...] By changing the solvent, or perhaps using a mixture, the separation of components (measured by the Rf value) can be adjusted. Also, the separation achieved with a TLC plate {{can be used to}} estimate the separation of a <b>flash</b> <b>chromatography</b> column. (A compound elutes from a column when the amount of solvent collected is equal to 1/Rf.) Chemists often use TLC to develop a protocol for separation by chromatography and they use TLC to determine which fractions contain the desired compounds.|$|E
5000|$|Column {{chromatography}} is {{an extremely}} time consuming stage in any lab and can quickly become the bottleneck for any process lab. Therefore, several manufacturers like Biotage, Buchi, Interchim and Teledyne Isco have developed automated <b>flash</b> <b>chromatography</b> systems (typically referred to as LPLC, low pressure liquid chromatography, around [...] ) that minimize human involvement in the purification process. Automated systems will include components normally found on more expensive high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems such as a gradient pump, sample injection ports, a UV detector and a fraction collector to collect the eluent. Typically these automated systems can separate samples from a few milligrams up to an industrial many kilogram scale and offer a much cheaper and quicker solution to doing multiple injections on prep-HPLC systems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resolution}} (or {{the ability}} to separate a mixture) on an LPLC system will always be lower compared to HPLC, as the packing material in an HPLC column can be much smaller, typically only 5 micrometre thus increasing stationary phase surface area, increasing surface interactions and giving better separation. However, {{the use of this}} small packing media causes the high back pressure and is why it is termed high pressure liquid chromatography. The LPLC columns are typically packed with silica of around 50 micrometres, thus reducing back pressure and resolution, but it also removes the need for expensive high pressure pumps. Manufacturers are now starting to move into higher pressure <b>flash</b> <b>chromatography</b> systems and have termed these as medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) systems which operate above [...]|$|E
