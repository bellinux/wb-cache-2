5|$|Oxford were pre-race favourites, {{and won the}} toss, electing {{to start}} the race from the Surrey station. They took an early lead and were nearly half a length up on Cambridge {{by the time the}} crews passed the Harrods Furniture Depository. The boats closed <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> another and umpire Harris was forced to issue a number of {{warnings}} to both coxes as the crews came close to clashing oars. The Light Blues pulled themselves back into contention around the Chiswick Reach and took the lead into Corney Reach. Oxford attempted to find a quicker racing line and were still in touch, but Cambridge inched away from them, passing the finishing post one-and-a-third lengths ahead in a time of 17 minutes 35 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} work {{appeared}} in Switzerland, {{the district attorney}} in Munich charged Panizza with 93 counts of blasphemy in violation of §166 of the Imperial Strafgesetzbuch (Criminal Code). As a result, Panizza became an instant literary celebrity, with authors ranging from a teenaged Thomas Mann to Theodor Fontane, the 76-year-old dean of German letters, weighing <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> {{side or the other}} of the raging debate. In April 1895, Panizza was convicted after a one-day trial, for which had written an extensive literary defense. After several failed appeals, Panizza served his full 12-month sentence at the prison in Amberg, where he was released in August 1896.|$|E
25|$|On September 14, 2009, Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, {{a senior}} al-Qaeda leader in East Africa {{as well as}} a senior leader in Shabaab, al Qaeda's {{surrogate}} in Somalia, was killed by elements of U.S. Special Operations. According to a witness, at least two AH-6 Little Bird attack helicopters strafed a two-car convoy. Navy SEALs then seized the body of Nabhan and took two other wounded fighters captive. JSOC and the CIA had been trying to kill Nabhan for some time including back in January 2007, when an AC-130 Gunship was called <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> attempt. A U.S. intelligence source stated that CIA paramilitary teams are directly embedded with Ethiopian forces in Somalia, allowing for the tactical intelligence to launch these operations. Nabhan was wanted for his involvement in the 1998 United States embassy bombings, as well as leading the cell behind the 2002 Mombasa attacks.|$|E

500|$|David Reinhard of The Oregonian {{commented on}} the criticism: [...] "Hollywood sharpsters can always make a group from the great American {{hinterland}} look ridiculous when it zeroes <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> show, particularly if that show is a cartoon. And the Oregon Lands Coalition's protest {{was a bit of}} an overreaction. But the environmental sloganeering of The Simpsons as well as Groening's cartoon commentary are symptomatic of a Hollywood and a popular culture that are hostile to the concerns and values of most Americans." [...] After the episode aired, media researchers Robert Lichter and Linda S. Lichter found in a study of prime-time television that when shows dealt with business themes, 89 percent portrayed businessmen as swindlers or liars.|$|E
500|$|Later, Kielbania heard jazz-trained flautist John Payne for {{the first}} time while sitting in on a jam session.

After {{allowing}} Payne to sit <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> performance, Morrison extended an invitation which Payne accepted. The trio of Payne, Kielbania, and Morrison continued performing for four months. [...] In the weeks they played at the Catacombs, they began to develop the template for Astral Weeks. It was around this time that Warner Bros. Records approached Morrison, hoping to sign him to their roster. Presumably their interest focused on his prior success with [...] "Brown-Eyed Girl", [...] not on Morrison's current acoustic work. Regardless, their interest allowed Morrison to return to the recording studio.|$|E

2500|$|From 1960 to 1963, further {{rehabilitation}} {{work was}} done at camp. [...] Some Presidents have expressed interest in the camp, but Jimmy Carter was the first President since FDR to visit.

In later episodes Fitch tags along with an unscrupulous investigator Marcus Hayes (Louis Gossett, Jr.) trying to cash <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> of Rockford's cases; and needs Jim's help dealing with mobsters connected to the ex-husband of his new girlfriend (played by Dionne Warwick).

2500|$|The {{consensus}} view among guidance advisors {{is that it}} is a {{good idea}} to visit colleges, preferably when college is in session and not during a summer break, with a chance to meet an actual student in the form of a tour guide, and taking notes for reference later when applying. Sometimes a college will waive the application fee based on the college visit. A benefit is seeing a school as it really is—not just glossy pictures from a brochure or a promotional video from a website. Another suggested that students should ask themselves, when visiting a particular college: [...] "can I see myself here"? Reporter Jenna Johnson in the Washington Post suggested that students contact a professor in an area of interest at the college before visiting, and try to meet with them briefly or sit <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> of their classes. Reporter Brennan Barnard in the New York Times recommended that student visitors should ask good questions (by avoiding factual questions better answered by the college's website), and ask for complimentary passes for dining or free food. Barnard recommends going beyond the usual tour to ask random strangers about life on campus and reading the student newspaper. He recommends arranging to speak with a professor in the department of interest as well as athletic coaches and music directors, possibly by emailing them in advance of the visit, to try to meet them even briefly. A follow-up [...] "thank you" [...] note to the host is a good idea (avoid texting abbreviations.) ...|$|E
