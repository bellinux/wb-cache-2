6000|$|In 1832, Thackeray came of age, and {{inherited}} his fortune,--as {{to which}} various {{stories have been}} told. It seems to have amounted to about five hundred a year, and to have passed through {{his hands in a}} year or two, interest and principal. It has been told of him that it was all taken away from him at cards, but such was not the truth. Some went in an Indian bank in which he invested it. A portion was lost at cards. But with some of it,--the larger part as I think,--he endeavoured, in concert with his stepfather, to float a newspaper, which failed. There seem to have been two newspapers in which he was so concerned, The National Standard and The Constitutional. On the latter he was engaged with his stepfather, and in carrying that on he lost the last of his money. The National Standard had been running for some weeks when Thackeray joined it, and lost his money in it. It ran only for little more than twelve months, and then, the money having gone, the periodical came to an end. I know no road to fortune more tempting to a young man, or one that with more certainty leads to ruin. Thackeray, who in a way more or less correct, often refers in his writings, if not to the incidents, at any rate to the remembrances of his own life, tells us much of the story of this newspaper in Lovel the Widower. [...] "They are welcome," [...] says the bachelor, [...] "to make merry at my charges in respect of a certain bargain which I made on coming to London, and in which, had I been Moses Primrose purchasing green spectacles, I could scarcely have been more taken in. My Jenkinson was an old college acquaintance, whom I was idiot enough to imagine a respectable man. The fellow had a very smooth tongue and sleek sanctified exterior. He was rather a popular preacher, and used to cry a good deal in the pulpit. He and a queer wine merchant and bill <b>discounter,</b> Sherrick by name, had somehow got possession of that neat little literary paper, The Museum, which perhaps you remember, and this eligible literary property my friend Honeyman, with his wheedling tongue, induced me to purchase." [...] Here is the history of Thackeray's money, told by himself plainly enough, but with no intention on his part of narrating an incident in his own life to the public. But the drollery of the circumstances, his own mingled folly and young ambition, struck him as being worth narration, and the more forcibly as he remembered all {{the ins and outs of}} his own reflections at the time,--how he had meant to enchant the world, and make his fortune. There was literary capital in it of which he could make use after so many years. Then he tells us of this ambition, and of the folly of it; and at the same time puts forward the excuses to be made for it. [...] "I daresay I gave myself airs as editor of that confounded Museum, and proposed to educate the public taste, to diffuse morality and sound literature throughout the nation, and to pocket a liberal salary in return for my services. I daresay I printed my own sonnets, my own tragedy, my own verses.... I daresay I wrote satirical articles.... I daresay I made a gaby of myself to the world. Pray, my good friend, hast thou never done likewise? If thou hast never been a fool, be sure thou wilt never be a wise man." [...] Thackeray was quite aware of his early weaknesses, and in the maturity of life knew well that he had not been precociously wise. He delighted so to tell his friends, and he delighted also to tell the public, not meaning that any but an inner circle should know that he was speaking of himself. But the story now is plain to all who can read.[1] ...|$|E

40|$|For grocery {{retailers}} in Europe, {{intense competition}} from hard discount formats like Lidl and Aldi is an established {{part of the}} competitive landscape. Due to the highly competitive retail environment, traditional retailers’ private label (PL) tiers are now set to become the new battle ground in this competition. This study analyzes how PL tiers (i. e. economy, standard and premium) affect the competition between <b>discounters</b> and traditional retailers. We use a representative UK household panel dataset (2009 - 2010) for the ready-to-eat cereal and canned soup category, and estimate a demand model for the choice between national brands (NBs) and PL tiers across the top- 7 UK retailers. Using our demand estimates, we conduct several counterfactual experiments that predict consumer responses to different strategies of traditional retailers and <b>discounters</b> in their fight for the consumer. In particular, we compare the effectiveness of three types of PLs offered by traditional retailers to fight discounters: economy PLs versus standard PLs versus premium PLs. We find that premium PLs are not very effective strategies for traditional retailers to fight with <b>discounters.</b> On the other hand, economy PLs manage to steal some market share from <b>discounters,</b> but as a downside they also cannibalize traditional retailers’ standard PLs. Standard PLs seem the most effective tool to fight with <b>discounters,</b> since they steal most market share from <b>discounters</b> (and NBs). From {{the point of view}} of the <b>discounters,</b> our results indicate that <b>discounters</b> benefit from a further increase in their NB offerings (assortment depth) as well as from a price cut in their own PLs. status: accepte...|$|R

We derive {{the solution to this}} model for three cases: (1) time consistent decision makers, (2) naïve hyperbolic <b>discounters</b> and (3) sophisticated hyperbolic <b>discounters.</b> Sophisticated hyperbolic <b>discounters</b> behave as if they were time consistent but instead have a smaller reward for completing the task.
