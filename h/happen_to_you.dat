[...] He was a regular tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.|$|E
500|$|In The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway {{contrasts}} Paris with Pamplona, and {{the frenzy}} of the fiesta with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside. [...] Spain was Hemingway's favorite European country; he considered it a healthy place, and the only country [...] "that hasn't been shot to pieces." [...] He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing, It isn't just brutal like they always told us. It's a great tragedy—and {{the most beautiful thing}} I've ever seen and takes more guts and skill and guts again than anything possibly could. It's just like having a ringside seat at the war with nothing going to <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—called afición—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisian bohemians. To be accepted as an [...] aficionado was rare for a non-Spaniard; Jake goes through a difficult process to gain acceptance by the [...] "fellowship of afición." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Black Zombie" [...] is an impassioned, self-reflective {{critique}} of problems afflicting the African-American community, including prejudice ("You believe {{when they say}} we ain't shit, we can't grow / All we are is dope dealers and gangstas and hoes"), economic insolvency ("What do we own? The skin on our backs / We rent and we ask for reparations, then they hit us with tax"), and dependency ("I'ma Colombia record slave / So get paid / Control your own destiny, you are a genius / Don't let it <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> like it did to me, I was a black zombie"). Its socially conscious lyrics deride media stereotypes of African Americans, inequality in the educational system, and black-on-black violence. According to writer Dax-Devlon Ross, the song foreshadowed the themes and [...] "world view" [...] of Nas' subsequent albums. [...] "Poppa Was a Playa" [...] features uncredited co-production by Kanye West, and discusses Nas' complicated relationship with his father, jazz musician Olu Dara, addressing his lusty, itinerant lifestyle throughout Nas' youth. Gabriel Alvarez of Complex calls it an [...] "honest dedication to his old man: a jazz player, a rolling stone" [...] and writes of the song, [...] "The love is there despite the man's faults. Nas crafts a full picture of the past, looking at the infidelity and fights from both parents' perspectives." ...|$|E
500|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket {{has been}} called a concept album chronicling {{adolescence}} and associated feelings. The band did not consider them explicitly teenage songs: [...] "The things that <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in high school are the same things that happen your entire life," [...] said Hoppus. [...] "You can fall in love at sixty; you can get rejected at eighty." [...] The record begins with [...] "Anthem Part Two", which touches on disenchantment and blames adults for teenage problems. It serves as the opposite of the band's typical [...] "party" [...] image presented to the media, with heavily politically-charged lyrics. Joe Shooman called it a [...] "generational manifesto that exhorts kids to be wary of the system that surrounds them". [...] "Online Songs" [...] was written by Hoppus about [...] "the thoughts that drive you crazy" [...] {{in the aftermath of a}} breakup, and is essentially a follow-up to [...] "Josie". [...] "First Date" [...] was inspired by DeLonge and wife Jennifer Jenkins' first date at SeaWorld in San Diego. [...] "I was about 21 at the time and it was an excuse for me to take her somewhere because I wanted to hang out with her," [...] said DeLonge. The track was written as a summary of neurotic teen angst and awkwardness. [...] "Happy Holidays, You Bastard" [...] is a joke track intended to [...] "piss parents off." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Story of a Lonely Guy", concerns heartache and rejection prior to the high school prom. The song is downbeat and melancholy, filtered through [...] "tuneful guitar lines reminiscent of The Cure and hefty drum patterns".|$|E
500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E

500|$|Some critics felt season 13 was an {{improvement}} over the previous Scully seasons. DVDDizzy rhetorically asked how the season [...] "stand up for someone just looking to jump into a full, semi-recent year of episodes", answering [...] "Pretty darn well". It explained [...] "Nearly everything that makes [...] "The Simpsons" [...] what it is can be found here. Most important is the large cast of Springfield residents used to perfection...Clearly, real thought and lots of it goes into each episode's creation", and added [...] "it's almost miraculous how fresh and sharp [...] "The Simpsons" [...] remains in its thirteenth year on air". The site explained [...] "Not every moment here is brilliant. After a rocky start, the season really hits its groove a few episodes in. Even though jokes don't always land, there are guaranteed {{to be at least}} a few amusing moments per episode. The stylings haven't changed all that much. There are tasteful homages and cultural references, including loving parodies of classic movies, television, and literature [...] as usual, tons of famous guest stars lend their voices, some as themselves and others as fictional characters". Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents a time when the show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which could <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and your family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning. DVD Talk's Ryan Keefer gave a season 3.5/5 stars and said [...] "While Jean might not have brought things to previous glory, he certainly righted the ship in Season 13." [...] Blu-Ray.com gave season 13 a 3.5/5 and Casey Broadwater's sentiment was [...] "The hit-to-miss ratio is much better here than in the previous three seasons, and while the episodes are never quite as hilarious as the Simpsons of old—from way back in the early 1990s—season 13 does mark a turning point for the series." [...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out." [...] Casey Burchby of DVD Talk gave the season a 3/5 and wrote [...] "the thirteenth season is further proof of the regrettable change in comic tone that the series took on {{in the early part of}} the last decade." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ruslan Obiang, {{a son of}} the President, is Equatorial Guinea's sports {{minister}} and president of a top soccer club, the [...] "Panthers". He has lived in Spain, where he encouraged firms {{to do business in}} his country. Several Spanish businessmen have complained about the consequences of these deals. One Spaniard who had paid $200,000 to secure a contract to build soccer stadiums described a system that involved bribes at every turn. After paying bribes for years, however, his deal eventually fell apart when he refused to pay any more in bribes to Ruslan Obiang and his associates. The businessman was critical of business in the country, saying officials exploit as much money as possible until moving on to another contractor. The businessman also noted that he had been threatened on several occasions, both with violence, and trumped-up rape charges that could have resulted in him being imprisoned. His report claimed that there is no avenue for justice in the nation, since [...] "he corruption is absolute and endemic; there is nobody you can turn to." [...] After the deal collapsed, one of his business partners was visited at his Portugal home by men in dark suits who staked outside his home for several days as a threat and then visited him in his office. Herein they warned him that if he reported his story to the media or any authorities there would be consequences. He concluded: [...] "You sign a contract with the son of the president and you believe it is worth something. You have no idea what is going to <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> We had to flee the country. We were afraid for our lives." ...|$|E
