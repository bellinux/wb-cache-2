40|$|Background—Preterm {{infants with}} a PDA {{are at risk}} for <b>death</b> <b>or</b> {{development}} of BPD. However, PDA treatment remains controversial. We investigated if PDA treatment and other clinical or echocardiographic (ECHO) factors were associated with the development of <b>death</b> <b>or</b> BPD. Methods—We retrospectively studied clinical and ECHO characteristics of preterm infants with birth weight < 1500 g and ECHO diagnosis of a PDA. Logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were performed to assess variables associated with the combined outcome of <b>death</b> <b>or</b> BPD. Results—Of 187 preterm infants with a PDA, 75 % were treated with indomethacin or surgery and 25 % were managed conservatively. <b>Death</b> <b>or</b> BPD occurred in 80 (43 %). Logistic regression found lower gestational age (OR 0. 5), earlier year of birth during the study period (OR 0. 9), and larger ductal diameter (OR 4. 3) were associated with the decision to treat the PDA, while gestational age was the only variable associated with <b>death</b> <b>or</b> BPD (OR 0. 6, 95 % CI 0. 5 - 0. 8). Conclusion—Only lower gestational age and not PDA treatment or ECHO score was associated with the adverse outcome of <b>death</b> <b>or</b> BPD. Further investigation of PDA management strategies and effects on adverse outcomes of prematurity is needed...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the TIMI risk score, Cardiotrophin- 1 (CT- 1) myotrophin and MPO {{in combination with}} NTproBNP at predicting adverse outcome following AMI. We recruited 596 patients with AMI. Patients were TIMI risk scored. The concentrations of CT- 1, myotrophin, MPO and NTproBNP were measured using non-competitive immunoassays. All patients were followed-up for death, recurrent MI, heart failure (HF) and MACE (death, MI and need for urgent revascularisation). Mortality was related to higher TIMI score (p= 0. 029) and NTproBNP levels (< 0. 0001). NTproBNP was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 4. 21). The receiver-operating curve (ROC) area under curve (AUC) for NTproBNP was greater than TIMI risk score (0. 79 vs. 0. 67). CT- 1 was raised in <b>death</b> <b>or</b> HF (0. 77 vs. 0. 73 fmol/ml; p= 0. 001). In multivariate analysis CT- 1 (HR 1. 5) and NTproBNP (HR 2. 1) predicted <b>death</b> <b>or</b> HF independently of clinical factors. The ROC AUC for CT- 1 was 0. 62; NTproBNP was 0. 77; AUC for combined markers was 0. 84. Myotrophin was raised in patients with <b>death,</b> <b>death</b> <b>or</b> HF and MACE. In Cox analysis myotrophin (HR 5. 07) and NTproBNP (HR 7. 15) independently predicted death. Myotrophin was better at predicting <b>death</b> <b>or</b> HF (HR 2. 35) and MACE (HR 1. 69). Median MPO was raised in patients experiencing <b>death,</b> <b>death</b> <b>or</b> MI, <b>death</b> <b>or</b> HF and MACE. In Cox analysis median MPO predicted death (HR 13. 05) and <b>death</b> <b>or</b> non-fatal MI (HR 5. 07). A multimarker approach with NTproBNP may be useful for risk stratification in AMI patients...|$|R
