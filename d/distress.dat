40|$|Abstract. The {{literature}} has identified several possible causes of asphalt pavement <b>distresses.</b> Load‐related <b>distresses</b> are apparent where the pavement has been over‐stressed by traffic loads applied to its surface. Climate/durability‐related <b>distresses</b> arise due to {{exposure to the}} environment. Other‐related <b>distresses</b> are caused by actions not related to load or climate such as fuel spills or construction deficiencies. In this paper, information about fourteen asphalt pavement <b>distresses</b> frequently occurred on Taiwan’s pavements was surveyed, structured and explored using formal concept analysis (FCA) method. FCA is an important mathematical tool for conceptual data analysis and knowledge acquisition. By using FCA, the concept lattice of the formal context of asphalt pavement <b>distresses</b> was created and studied. Based on the concept lattice and association rules derived from FCA, the causes of asphalt pavement <b>distresses</b> were understood. The {{findings are consistent with}} the literature and actual conditions. This study provides alternative solutions to understand the causes of asphalt pavement <b>distresses.</b> This study also clearly shows that FCA is a useful method for further exploring and extending information on pavement <b>distresses...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of <b>distressed</b> {{acquisitions}} on acquirer volatility and default risk for a worldwide sample of <b>distressed</b> firms using several risk measures. We find that, on average, absolute levels of historical and implied volatility do not change following a <b>distressed</b> acquisition. However, <b>distressed</b> acquisitions generate a significant increase in relative total, systematic and idiosyncratic volatility and default risk, hence risk rises for both shareholders and bondholders. In particular, we show that high market-to-book acquirers, frequent acquirers, low-risk acquirers, higher acquisition premia and deals closed during bull markets are associated with higher levels of post-acquisition risk. Interestingly, high-risk acquirers experience a significant reduction in volatility and default risk. Consequently, risk changes cannot exclusively be explained by transferring risk from <b>distressed</b> target to acquirer. Our results suggest that bidder pre-acquisition levels of performance and risk and market conditions affect the type of <b>distressed</b> acquisitions and consequently the risk effects in such transactions. <b>Distressed</b> acquisitions; M&A; Default risk; Volatility; Risk factors...|$|R

Corporate governance’s structure examined in this research are size of board (director and commisioner), independency of board, and audit committee.

This research uses descriptive statistic to know corporate governance’s structure in both firms group, {{and in order to}} know the differences, it uses t-test independent.
