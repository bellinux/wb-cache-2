40|$|UnrestrictedFollowing from Raudenbush and Sampson (1999), {{the current}} study {{employed}} Systematic Social Observation methodology to examine {{a small sample of}} high-risk Los Angeles neighborhoods in order to determine: 1) whether this method can reliably and validly measure physical <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> social disorder; 2) the levels of census-based geographical aggregation that physical <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> social <b>disorder</b> are best measured; 3) the relationships between social <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> family functioning; and 4) whether the relationships between social <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> family functioning are different for families with or without a history of child maltreatment. To address these aims, all the streets within 12 census tracts (1596 face blocks) and 70 families residing within those census tracts were observed. Measurement properties and associations between the variables of interest were examined using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques. Results of this study did not replicate those of Raudenbush and Sampson (1997) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{relations among}} depression, conduct <b>disorder,</b> <b>and</b> drug use from adolescence to young adulthood, and evaluated whether exposure to violence contributed to disorder co‐occurrence. We used {{data from the}} Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. Respondents were 12 – 15 years old in 1995 – 1997 (N = 1, 517), and were reinterviewed in 1997 – 2000 (n = 1, 315), and 2000 – 2002 (n = 1, 210). We examined exposure to violence at ages 12 – 15 and 14 – 17, <b>and</b> depression, conduct <b>disorder,</b> <b>and</b> drug use at ages 14 – 17 and 17 – 20. Multivariate transition models revealed an association between prior conduct <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> drug use, {{as well as a}} relationship between prior depression <b>and</b> conduct <b>disorder.</b> Adolescent exposure to violence was associated with higher odds of conduct <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> drug use but not depression. Comorbid relations between conduct <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> drug use were independent of prior exposure to violence. Although preventing adolescent exposure to violence may reduce the risk of conduct <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> drug use by young adulthood, future research needs to investigate alternative determinants of sequential comorbidity among depression, conduct <b>disorder,</b> <b>and</b> drug use in adolescence and young adulthood...|$|R
5|$|Suicide is {{the act of}} {{intentionally}} causing one's own death. Risk {{factors include}} mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality <b>disorders,</b> <b>and</b> substance abuse, including alcoholism and use of benzodiazepines. Other suicides are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide, such as firearms, drugs, and poisons, treating mental <b>disorders</b> <b>and</b> substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, {{there is little evidence}} for their effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety <b>disorders</b> <b>and</b> {{depression}} are {{the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating <b>disorders,</b> <b>and</b> higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{organizations}} have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, {{especially in the}} early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological <b>Disorders</b> <b>and</b> the U.S. National Institute of Neurological <b>Disorders</b> <b>and</b> Stroke. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes of these symptoms need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following supportive features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of dyskinesias induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> violence across geography, specifically whether <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> violence are causally related. This issue has generated much debate {{in the field of}} criminology. The broken windows thesis argues that untended disorder will lead to crime while social disorganization theory suggests that these two phenomena are merely spuriously related. To examine the longitudinal relationship between <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> violence, this dissertation used data from the city of Seattle, Washington and analyzed them with dynamic statistical tools. Group-based trajectory analysis was used to identify different patterns of <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> violence. The findings reveal a moderate level of spatial association between <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> violence. Moreover, the results show that lack of disorder may be a protective factor for places in preventing future crime. This particular finding provides a new insight for crime prevention strategy. 	I further use Granger causality tests to examine the causal association between <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> violence within selected violence <b>and</b> <b>disorder</b> hotspots. Findings from the Granger causality tests indicate that disorder does not lead to violence. As such the results suggest that public policy targeting disorder may not lead to crime reduction benefits. This particular finding challenges the notion of broken windows policing. Although broken windows policing might increase the chance to apprehend criminals due to the spatial clustering of social <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> violence, the findings suggest that reducing levels of disorder will be unlikely to have strong impacts on crime rates. Additionally, potential collateral effects of police crackdowns on disorder need to be considered. Lastly, social <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>disorder</b> seem to relate to violence differently. Specifically, social disorder corresponds with violence more strongly than physical disorder. This issue has theoretical implications and should be explored further in future research...|$|R

5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum <b>disorders,</b> <b>and</b> stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic <b>disorders,</b> <b>and</b> a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E

METHOD: A total of 2, 801 young adult twins from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health Twin Panel were assessed at personal interview for depressive personality <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> major depressive <b>disorder</b> with the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Bivariate Cholesky models were fitted to the data by using the Mx statistical program. RESULTS: In the best-fitting model, the covariation between depressive personality <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> major depressive <b>disorder</b> were accounted for by genetic and unique environmental factors only. A model that did not include genetic factors specific to major depressive disorder was rejected. The authors found no clear evidence for gender differences in sources of comorbidity of depressive personality <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> major depressive <b>disorder.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Although depressive personality <b>disorder</b> <b>and</b> major depressive <b>disorder</b> share a substantial proportion of genetic and environmental risk factors, the results from this study support the hypothesis that the two disorders are distinct entities with overlapping, but not identical, etiologies...|$|R
