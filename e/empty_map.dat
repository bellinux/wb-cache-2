40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an approach for learning environmental knowledge from task-based human-robot dialog. Previous approaches to dialog use domain knowledge to constrain {{the types of}} language {{people are likely to}} use. In contrast, by introducing a joint probabilistic model over speech, the resulting semantic parse and the mapping from each element of the parse to a physical entity in the building (e. g., grounding), our approach is flexible to the ways that untrained people interact with robots, is robust to speech to text errors and is able to learn referring expressions for physical locations in a map (e. g., to create a semantic map). Our approach has been evaluated by having untrained people interact with a service robot. Starting with an <b>empty</b> semantic <b>map,</b> our approach is able ask 50 % fewer questions than a baseline approach, thereby enabling more effective and intuitive human robot dialog. I...|$|R

Petra Christian University {{is also a}} University 2 ̆ 7 s with long-standing and well known to many people in Indonesia.

Thus someone created a virtual map for Petra Christian University building by using a Head-Mounted Display Oculus Rift to display a simulation of the map Petra Christian University building. But the virtual map that has been created earlier is simply an <b>empty</b> simulation <b>maps</b> that contain only furniture - furniture and does not contain a virtual character, so that the simulation does not have any college atmosphere. So it was decided to implement a virtual character in a map that looks like a real simulation using a rule-based system.

Giving materials to the models at the Unity are expected match the colors of the original state. Giving collision features intended to make the user cannot penetrate what as original state.

In real-world scenarios, especially in densely populated countries, the designated area where turbines {{can be placed}} is not an <b>empty</b> <b>map</b> on which the turbines can be placed arbitrarily. Even in rural areas, streets, buildings, and rivers have to be considered. In this paper, we model two constrained turbine placement scenarios and use evolutionary algorithms to find optimized turbine locations. To evaluate the locations, we combine a proven wind model with real-world data of a wind prediction model from a meteorological service. Geographical data from a free map service is used to define constrained areas in the scenarios based on administrative rules. For the evolutionary optimization process, we consider five ways to handle penalties. Starting with a simple specification that can only achieve two different values, we {{end up in a}} definition that considers distances relative of the required minimum distances to all geographical objects for each turbine. We combine the penalty definitions with three types of penalty functions. In the experimental section, we compare the various configurations and show a detailed analysis of the results.

Xyleme {{considers a}} simple data model with data trees and tree typesfor describing the data sources, and a simple query languagebased on tree queries with boolean conditions. The main components of the data model are a mediated schema modeled by an abstract tree type, as a view {{of a set of}} tree types associated with actual data trees, called concrete tree types,and a mapping expressing the connection between the mediated schema and the concrete tree types. The first contribution of this paper is formal: we provide a declarative model-theoretic semantics for Xyleme tree queries,a way of checking tree query containment, and a characterization of tree queries as a composition of branch queries. The other contributions are algorithmic and handle the potentially huge size of the mapping relation which is a crucial issue for semantic integration and query evaluation in Xyleme. First, we propose a method for pre-evaluating queries at compile time bystoring some specific meta-information about the mapping into maptranslation tables. These map translation tables summarizethe set of all the branch queries that can be generatedfrom the mediated schema and the set of all the mappings.

In particular, for n = { 0, 1, [...] ., n − 1 }, A n = {α|α: { 0, 1, [...] ., n − 1 } → A} = {α = (a 0, [...] ., an− 1) |aν ∈ A} {{and this is the}} set of all n − tuples (a 0, [...] ., an− 1) of elements in A.
