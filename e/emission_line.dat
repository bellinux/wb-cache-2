This definition has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red <b>emission</b> <b>line</b> in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|E

The red <b>emission</b> <b>line</b> from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the only source, it is considerably more expensive than helium.|$|E
25|$|The {{metallicity}} of many astronomical objects {{cannot be}} measured directly. Instead, proxies {{are used to}} obtain an indirect estimate.

40|$|We {{report on}} the radio quiet quasar SDSS J 2125 - 0813 which {{obviously}} emits optical FeII <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> and double-peaked broad Balmer <b>emission</b> <b>lines.</b> Using the accretion disk model for double-peaked broad low-ionization <b>emission</b> <b>lines,</b> we reproduce the composite line spectra at the optical band between 4100 Å and 5600 Å. Broad FeII <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> can be fit simultaneously with the broad Hβ and MgI lines, such that all broad lines have an elliptical disk profile with the same disk parameters. This results indicates that the optical FeII <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> originate from the accretion disk near the central black hole which produces the double-peaked broad Balmer <b>emission</b> <b>lines.</b> Furthermore, {{we find that the}} object has dimensionless accretion rate ṁ∼ 0. 4 - 0. 6 which is much larger than accretion rate for ADAF mode, and that the energy budget of the accretion disk is enough to power the double-peaked broad Balmer <b>emission</b> <b>lines.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|R
50|$|AB7 {{is clearly}} a Wolf Rayet star, showing {{characteristic}} broad <b>emission</b> <b>lines.</b> Narrow nebular <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> are also seen, often overlaid on the emission from the star.

25|$|The metre was {{originally}} defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth {{of the distance}} from the equator to the North Pole. In 1799, it was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889). In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain <b>emission</b> <b>line</b> of krypton-86. In 1983, the current definition was adopted.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{observations}} of NH3 from the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope {{reveal that the}} ammonia line is separated into two components – a background ridge and an unresolved core. The background corresponds well with the locations previously detected CO. The 25 m Chilbolton telescope in England detected radio signatures of ammonia in H II regions, HNH2O masers, H-H objects, and other objects associated with star formation. A comparison of <b>emission</b> <b>line</b> widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds.|$|E
25|$|The {{emission}} lines seen on {{the spectrum}} of a Seyfert galaxy may come {{from the surface of}} the accretion disc itself, or may come from clouds of gas illuminated by the central engine in an ionization cone. The exact geometry of the emitting region is difficult to determine due to poor resolution of the galactic center. However, each part of the accretion disc has a different velocity relative to our line of sight, and the faster the gas is rotating around the black hole, the broader the <b>emission</b> <b>line</b> will be. Similarly, an illuminated disc wind also has a position-dependent velocity.|$|E
40|$|We present Subaru/FOCAS {{spectropolarimetry}} of two active {{galaxies in}} the Cosmic Evolution Survey. These objects were selected to be optically dull, with the bright X-ray emission of an AGN but missing optical <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> in our previous spectroscopy. Our new observations show that one target has very weak <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> consistent with an optically dull AGN, while the other object has strong <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> typical of a host-diluted Type 2 Seyfert galaxy. In neither source do we observe polarized <b>emission</b> <b>lines,</b> with 3 -sigma upper limits of P_BLR < 2 %. This means that the missing broad <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> (and weaker narrow <b>emission</b> <b>lines)</b> are not due to simple anisotropic obscuration, e. g., by the canonical AGN torus. The weak-lined optically dull AGN exhibits a blue polarized continuum with P = 0. 78 +/- 0. 07 % at 4400 A < lambda_rest < 7200 A (P = 1. 37 +/- 0. 16 % at 4400 A < lambda_rest < 5050 A). The wavelength dependence of this polarized flux {{is similar to that}} of an unobscured AGN continuum and represents the intrinsic AGN emission, either as synchrotron emission or the outer part of an accretion disk reflected by a clumpy dust scatterer. Because this intrinsic AGN <b>emission</b> lacks <b>emission</b> <b>lines,</b> this source is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow.

25|$|Hydrocarbons {{heavier than}} methane {{are present in}} a {{relatively}} narrow layer between 160 and 320km in altitude, corresponding to the pressure range from 10 to 0.1mbar and temperatures from 100 to 130K. The most abundant stratospheric hydrocarbons after methane are acetylene and ethane, with mixing ratios of around 10−7. Heavier hydrocarbons like methylacetylene and diacetylene have mixing ratios of about 10−10—three orders of magnitude lower. The temperature and hydrocarbon mixing ratios in the stratosphere vary with time and latitude. Complex hydrocarbons {{are responsible for the}} cooling of the stratosphere, especially acetylene, having a strong <b>emission</b> <b>line</b> at the wavelength of 13.7μm.|$|E
25|$|The {{kinematics}} of disk {{galaxies are}} usually determined by Hα or 21-cm emission lines, which are typically {{not present in}} lenticular galaxies due to their general lack of cool gas. Thus kinematic information and rough mass estimates for lenticular galaxies often comes from stellar absorption lines, which are less reliable than <b>emission</b> <b>line</b> measurements. There is also {{a considerable amount of}} difficulty in deriving accurate rotational velocities for lenticular galaxies. This is a combined effect from lenticulars having difficult inclination measurements, projection effects in the bulge-disk interface region, and the random motions of stars affecting the true rotational velocities. These effects make kinematic measurements of lenticular galaxies considerably more difficult compared to normal disk galaxies.|$|E
25|$|Type II Seyfert galaxies {{have the}} {{characteristic}} bright core, {{as well as}} appearing bright when viewed at infrared wavelengths. Their spectra contain narrow lines associated with forbidden transitions, and broad lines associated with allowed strong dipole or intercombination transitions. In some Typenbsp&II Seyfert galaxies, analysis with a technique called spectro-polarimetry (spectroscopy of polarised light component) revealed obscured typenbsp&I regions. In the case of NGC 1068, nuclear light reflected off a dust cloud was measured, which led scientists {{to believe in the}} presence of an obscuring dust torus around a bright continuum and broad <b>emission</b> <b>line</b> nucleus. When the galaxy is viewed from the side, the nucleus is indirectly observed through reflection by gas and dust above and below the torus. This reflection causes the polarisation.|$|E
40|$|We compute chi {{values for}} blue <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> in active M dwarfs. Using flux-calibrated spectra from nearby M dwarfs and {{spectral}} M dwarf templates from SDSS, we derive analytic relations that describe how the chi {{values for the}} CaII H and K {{as well as the}} H-beta, H-gamma, H-delta, H-epsilon and H 8 Balmer <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> vary as a function of spectral type and color. The chi values are useful for numerous M dwarf studies where the intrinsic luminosity of <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> cannot be estimated due to uncertain distances and/or non-flux-calibrated spectra.

40|$|A {{population}} of quasars showing very weak broad <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> {{has recently been}} unveiled at z> 2. 7 based on SDSS spectra. These objects could either be quasars with extremely high accretion rates, high redshift counterparts of the so called BL Lac objects or quasars that have just started their quasar phase so that the broad <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> are not yet photoionized. Spectra of these objects exist only in the UV rest-frame, such that only the high ionization <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> have been observed. Observation of the optical rest-frame range for these targets, including low ionization broad <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> and narrow forbidden <b>emission</b> <b>lines,</b> would allow to disentangle the aforementioned scenarii. In addition, a large wavelength coverage is mandatory to characterize the UV-optical continuum and compare it to other quasar populations, and to study the effect of dust. Scientific Case: Quasar spectra are characterized by a power-law continuum emission originating from matter accreted {{in the vicinity of}} a central black hole and by strong permitted broad <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> (with FWHM> 4000 km/s for Type 1 quasar). These lines are Doppler broadened and originate from photoionized gas located ∼ 10 17 cm from the black hole. This gas is either a wind originating from the accretion disk or is confined to individual clouds outside the disk...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} observable {{effects of}} anisotropic turbulence on the velocity profiles and eclipse behavior of <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> from accretion disks. Turbulence expands the local line broadening profile, enhancing the surface brightness of saturated <b>emission</b> <b>lines.</b> Anisotropic turbulence produces anisotropic <b>emission</b> in such <b>lines.</b> The effects become observable when the turbulence exceeds the thermal velocity. Each {{term in the}} velocity-velocity correlation matrix produces a distinctive azimuthal pattern of enhanced emission-line surface brightness {{on the face of}} the accretion disk. These patterns express themselves as changes in the observable shapes of the disk's <b>emission</b> <b>lines.</b> The best place to look for turbulence effects is in saturated <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> of heavy elements such as Ca, Mg, and Fe, which have a smaller thermal velocity at a given sound speed and at moderate inclination (60 - 70 degrees), since the Keplerian shear broadening dominates at higher inclinations...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of astronomical spectroscopy, {{scientists}} were puzzled by the spectrum of gaseous nebulae. In 1864 William Huggins noticed that many nebulae showed only <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> rather than a full spectrum like stars.

[...] However, there were several <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> that could not be linked to any terrestrial element, brightest among them lines at 495.9nm and 500.7nm. These lines were attributed to a new element, nebulium, until Ira Bowen determined in 1927 that the <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> were from highly ionised oxygen (O+2). These <b>emission</b> <b>lines</b> could not be replicated in a laboratory because they are forbidden lines; the low density of a nebula (one atom per cubic centimetre) allows for metastable ions to decay via forbidden <b>line</b> <b>emission</b> rather than collisions with other atoms.|$|R

2500|$|All {{elements}} absorb X-rays to some extent. Each element has {{a characteristic}} absorption spectrum {{which consists of}} a [...] "saw-tooth" [...] succession of fringes, each step-change of which has wavelength close to an <b>emission</b> <b>line</b> of the element. Absorption attenuates the secondary X-rays leaving the sample. For example, the mass absorption coefficient of silicon at the wavelength of the aluminium Kα line is 50 m²/kg, whereas that of iron is 377 m²/kg. This means that a given concentration of aluminium in a matrix of iron gives only one seventh of the count rate [...] {{compared with the same}} concentration of aluminium in a silicon matrix. Fortunately, mass absorption coefficients are well known and can be calculated. However, to calculate the absorption for a multi-element sample, the composition must be known. For analysis of an unknown sample, an iterative procedure is therefore used. It will be noted that, to derive the mass absorption accurately, data for the concentration of elements not measured by XRF may be needed, and various strategies are employed to estimate these. As an example, in cement analysis, the concentration of oxygen (which is not measured) is calculated by assuming that all other elements are present as standard oxides.|$|E
