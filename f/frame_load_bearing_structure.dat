40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> of {{an existing}} multi storey office building in Celje. The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> is made of reinforced concrete, based on strip and isolated foundation footings, slabs, columns and walls. It is analysed with the programme Tower 7, which utilises the final elements method. Two computational models of the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> are built. The first one is used to analyse the typical ceiling construction in the building. Besides the slab, we also include some vertical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements {{above and below the}} slab into the model. To analyse the vertical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements we create a more complex three-dimensional computational model of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> construction. The ceiling slab analysis takes into account both the dead load as well as the live load. The analysis of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> also includes snow load and the horizontal effects of wind and earthquake. The dynamic effect is determined by the means of a linear modal analysis with a response spectrum. The core of the thesis is represented in the analysis and the dimensioning of typical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements in the building. Firstly, dimensioning of the lower and upper reinforcement is executed. The calculation results are compared to the amount of built-in reinforcement, information about which is gathered from the original project documentation that followed the old PBAB regulation. Next, is the dimensioning of wall AB and column AB. The reinforcement for both is constructed in accordance with ductile behaviour requirements. The results show that the existing wall and column reinforcements only partially satisfy the requirements of evrokod regulations currently in place...|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands, timber {{is rarely}} used as primary {{material}} in medium rise buildings. The production of these timber buildings {{is very small}} compared to the total medium rise production.

40|$|For the {{assessment}} of masonry bridges a crucial aspect {{the identification of the}} actual <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure.</b> To identify and quantify the contribution of all the elements of a bridge, static and dynamic tests on 1 : 3 prototypes have been performed; similarity to the real bridges has been retained by reducing not only the geometric scale but also the material properties.

In this way, it has been demonstrated that all the elements contribute to the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structure</b> and their contribution grossly estimated. Damages may be recognized only if their extent is large enough to be detected also visually, so that dynamic tests are useful to discover some hidden element, such as internal spandrels, rather than for estimating the structural damage.
