The team was expected to fight for promotion but the efforts were not enough to bring the team to the top level again. In the upcoming years, the club was affected by financial problems that cut some <b>of</b> the <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>wanting</b> the team back to the top.

40|$|Marketers present {{compromise}} {{food products}} (e. g. light chips) {{as a way}} to reduce consumers' conflict between the short-term <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>wanting</b> a snack and the long-term goal of a healthy body. Policy makers welcome compromise products {{as a way to}} fight the obesity epidemic. Compromise products are typically associated with health. Two experiments and a survey were conducted to explore the effects of health references on the consumed amount of compromise products. Health references appear to increase consumption of compromise products for consumers with relatively weak food restriction goals, such as dietary restrained young women and dietary unrestrained older women. This suggests that associating compromise products with health messages may enhance rather than solve the obesity problem.

40|$|Raising {{an infant}} {{can be a}} tumultuous time for parents, with an {{increased}} risk of depression and anxiety, strain on marital and social relations, role conflict, increased stress and fatigue, difficulties working and poorer overall psychological well-being. These difficulties during the infant years can affect parent and child mental health, child competence, marital support, the parent-child relationship and even child cognitive, social and motor development. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess what predicts parents’ need for help when raising infants, and to identify specific areas in which parents <b>want</b> <b>more</b> information and support. Measures included developmental history, postnatal depression, parental self-efficacy, happiness, couple relationship, social network, perceptions of baby behaviours, and satisfaction with sources of parenting information and support within a sample of 159 parents of infants. It was hypothesised that (1) the majority <b>of</b> parents will <b>want</b> <b>more</b> information and support than they are currently receiving; (2) the majority <b>of</b> parents will <b>want</b> information on parent programs; (3) those who are high in postnatal depression, low on happiness, low on parental self-efficacy, are unhappy in their current relationship or social network, or who report baby behaviours as intense problems will be <b>more</b> likely to <b>want</b> <b>more</b> information and support regarding parenting; and (4) those who are high in postnatal depression, low on happiness, low on parental self-efficacy, are unhappy in their current relationship or social network, or who report baby behaviours as intense problems will be <b>more</b> likely to <b>want</b> information about parenting programs. Results revealed that the majority <b>of</b> parents <b>want</b> <b>more</b> information and support, over a third <b>of</b> parents <b>want</b> information on parenting programs, and Self-Efficacy is an important predictor of parents’ need for help while raising infants. Furthermore, satisfaction with informal support is a predictor <b>of</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>more</b> information and support regarding parenting. Findings provide a basis from which future parenting programs and interventions can be designed, and suggests the best modes of delivery...|$|R

40|$|This article {{studies the}} extent to which {{participation}} in productive associations in Nicaragua contributes to increase individuals'access to social programs and credit services. By participating in productive associations, individuals give a good signal to firms and are rewarded with better transactions and more access to the services they provide, ceteris paribus. Estimates using 2005 data indicate that households that participate in productive associations display higher access to credit and to social programs that promote investment. Additionally, participation in productive associations is weakly associated to more favorable credit outcomes among those households that receive loans, such as lower interest rates and a lower probability <b>of</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>more</b> credit than what was accessible to them.

50|$|Part two {{which is}} the section title, Before Testosterone, narrates what led Valerio to decide that {{changing}} sex was the right path for him. This section of the book describes cultural and ethnic background of both his mother and father. As a child Valerio had much difficulty with his mother’s acceptance {{that he was not}} happy being a girl. Valerio talks about one of his relationships that lead him to discover that being a lesbian, and sex between two women, did not arouse him. He discovered that his attraction towards women wasn’t a lesbian attraction rather that it was a heterosexual attraction, one from a man to a woman. The beginning chapters in this section detail many of Valerio’s relationships and friendships that helped him to accept his true <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> <b>wanting</b> to become a male. The later chapters detail more of the physical changes that he believed needed {{to be taken care of}} for him to ultimately appear as male such as binding his breasts, and wearing men's underwear as well as stuffing it.|$|R

Now she fansy’d to her self, that upon a larger Allowance of Corn, this Hen might be brought in time to lay twice a day. She try’d the Experiment; but the Hen grew fat upon’t, and gave quite over laying.
