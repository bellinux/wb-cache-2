2500|$|As oxygen levels decrease, fish may {{at first}} {{increase}} movements {{in an attempt}} to escape the hypoxic zone, but eventually they greatly reduce their activity levels, thus reducing their energetic (and therefore oxygen) demands. Atlantic herring show this exact pattern. Other examples of fishes that reduce their activity levels under hypoxia include the common sole, the guppy, the small-spotted catshark, and the viviparous <b>eelpout.</b> [...] Some sharks that ram-ventilate their gills may understandably increase their swimming speeds under hypoxia, to bring more water to the gills.|$|E

2500|$|The lake also {{supports}} a strong sport fishery. While commercial fishing declined, sport fishing has remained. The deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing {{is in the}} Canadian side of the lake. As a result, a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings and fishermen are advised to have their passport. If their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake, upon returning to the American shore, passengers will have to [...] "drive to a local government reporting station and pose for pictures" [...] to Customs officers by videophone. There are cumbersome rules for fishing boat operators as well, {{who will have to}} fax passenger personal information to a government agency an hour before leaving; officers will be watching and doing spot checks from patrol boats and government aircraft". Authorities in 2008 from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission have tried stocking the lake with brown trout in an effort to build what's called a put-grow-and-take fishery. There was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the American side, from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in Ohio alone, during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined, and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake. In 1984, Ohio sold 27,000 nonresident fishing permits, and sport fishing was described as big business. In 1992, there were accounts of fishermen catching 8, 10, and 12 pound walleyes, and that the [...] "runt of a five-man daily limit of 25 walleye might be a nuisance of 5 pounds." [...] It is possible to fish off piers in winter for a fish called the burbot, also known by pseudonyms such as <b>eelpout,</b> mudblow, lawyer fish, cusk, or freshwater cod which looks [...] "ugly" [...] but tastes great; the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of [...] "Erie's glacial relics." ...|$|E

It celebrates the <b>eelpout</b> (or burbot, scientific name Lota lota), an indigenous bottom dwelling fish that inhabits the regions lakes, in some cases being found as deep as 300m.

40|$|Zoarcidae (<b>eelpouts),</b> {{including}} 298 recognized valid species, is {{the most}} diverse family in the suborder Zoarcoidei (order Perciformes). Many of the species exhibit a great degree of phenotypic plasticity. In the present work, we analyze the genome of six Arctic species from the most diversified zoarcid genus Lycodes (L. eudipleurostictus, L. paamiuti, L. pallidus, L. seminudus, L. squamiventer, and L. reticulatus) providing the first information on the species-specific karyotype and pattern of major ribosomal gene chromosomal localization. The study revealed an unexpected consistency of the chromosomal features across species that apparently contrasts with {{the high level of}} inter-specific and intra-specific plasticity of morphological characters. The comparison between the chromosomal features of these Arctic <b>eelpouts</b> with those of the Antarctic species Lycodichthys dearborni (same subfamily, Lycodinae), suggests a conservative organization of the genome, at the level of gross architecture of chromosomes and karyotypes, within the family Zoarcidae...|$|R

5000|$|There {{have also}} been studies based on the {{carcasses}} of other, non-mammalian marine vertebrates that have fallen to the deep sea. In particular, the chance discovery of a whale shark carcass and three mobulid ray carcasses led to observations on the communities that form surrounding large elasmobranch falls as opposed to whale falls. [...] Whale sharks inhabit waters of roughly 1,000 meters depth regularly, which suggests {{it could be a}} regular form of food fall in areas where it is abundant. [...] Many <b>eelpouts</b> (Zoarcidae) were found surrounding the whale shark with some evidence of direct feeding as boreholes were observed on the carcass. Another theory suggests that the <b>eelpouts</b> were waiting for their main prey, amphipods and other small benthic animals. The three rays found were at varying stages of decomposition, leading to varying assemblages found surrounding the individuals. A higher abundance of scavengers was found surrounding the more intact individuals, including scavengers typical of whale falls like hagfish. Around the least intact individual a bacterial mat was observed in the zone of enrichment, but no clams or mussels typical of this environment (i.e. whale falls) were seen.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Stomach {{contents}} of 34 bearded seals taken in three High Arctic localities (Grise Fiord, Pond Inlet and Clyde) during the summers from 1978 - 1980 were examined. At least 12 {{species of fish}} were present but sculpins (Cottidae) and arctic cod (Boreogadus sa&) comprised {{the bulk of the}} diet. <b>Eelpouts</b> (Lycodes spp.) and polar cod (Arctog & glacialis) were also ingested in considerable amounts.

The whelk Buccinum and the shrimp Sclerocrongon boreus accounted for most of the invertebrate component of the diet. Clams, cephalopods, anemones, sea cucumbers, polychaete worms and other invertebrates occurred in small amounts. The largest measured weight of stomach contents was 7. 6 kg from a seal that had fed heavily on arctic cod. There were no significant dif-ferences amongst the three localities in the amount of food ingested; however, the proportions of arctic cod and sculpins varied considerably among cod (c 350 g). localities.
