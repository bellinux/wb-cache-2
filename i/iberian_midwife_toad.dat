50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> {{or brown}} midwife toad (Alytes cisternasii, in Spanish sapo partero ibérico) is {{a species of}} frog in the family Alytidae (formerly Discoglossidae) found in Portugal and western Spain. It is {{typically}} found in open habitats such as meadows and open oak forests. Habitat loss {{is one of the}} threats to its survival.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 40 mm, males being rather smaller than females. The snout is rounded and the eyes large, with {{vertical}} slit pupils. There are tiny, often orange, warts on the upper eyelids. The parotoid glands are relatively small and the tympani distinct. There are many tubercles on the body and concentrations of glandular warts under the arms, in the groin area and on the ankles. The limbs are fairly short. The colour of the upper surface is brownish-grey with dark spots, and the warts are often reddish. The underparts are unspotted and greyish-white.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> Alytes cisternasii is an {{endemic species}} of the southwestern and central parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Allozyme {{analysis}} of Iberian midwife toads indicated no inter- or intrapopulation variation and a more sensitive method is required to quantify genetic differentiation and gene flow between populations of this species. We describe here the development of primers for the amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of six polymorphic microsatellite loci in A. cisternasii...|$|E
25|$|Since anurans {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to motion, females use conspicuous movements to communicate interest. A female frog may also send vocal signals {{of her own}} to males, motivating copulation and competitive behaviors. Female <b>Iberian</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> (Alytes cisternasii) use courtship calls to distinguish themselves from other male competitors. The African common platanna (Xenopus laevis) uses duet calling when males are not visible, allowing females to distinguish territorial males from satellite males. The Emei music frog (Babina daunchina) female calling stimulates male movement towards sound or phonotaxis.|$|R

40|$|<b>Midwife</b> <b>toads</b> {{present one}} of the {{simplest}} calls in anurans, with the whole energy concentrated in a single band without frequency modulation. The tuning curves of the <b>Iberian</b> <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> Alytes cisternasii show the typical bimodal pattern in anurans, with two best excitatory frequencies at 0. 412 kHz (corresponding to the amphibian papilla) and at 1. 358 kHz (corresponding to the basilar papilla and matching the male call frequency). In this study, the hypothesis that complex calls arose in anurans because they were inherently more attractive to females, since they provided greater acoustic stimulation, was tested. However, our results indicate that splitting the call energy to stimulate both inner ear organs simultaneously, the male call is not more attractive to female <b>midwife</b> <b>toads,</b> but sometimes renders it unattractive. The biological role of the amphibian papilla is discussed in ecological and evolutionary terms...|$|R
50|$|Kammerer {{succeeded in}} making <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> breed in the water by {{increasing}} the temperature of their tanks, forcing them to retreat to the water to cool off. The male <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> were not genetically programmed for underwater mating so over the span of two generations, Kammerer reported that his <b>midwife</b> <b>toads</b> were exhibiting black nuptial pads on their feet to give them more traction in this underwater mating process.|$|R
40|$|Distribution of the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> (Alytes obstetricans) in the canton Basel-Landschaft (NW Switzerland). The <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> (Alytes obstetricans) {{is among}} the most {{strongly}} declining of Swiss amphibian species. This article documents the status of the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> in the canton of Basel-Landschaft in northern Switzerland. The survey showed that only a few known populations had gone locally extinct. Many hitherto unknown populations were reported for the first time. Most populations were very small. Regular counts of the number of calling males in the amphibian breeding sites of federal importance show that population counts fluctuated strongly but remained stationary over eight years. The distribution of a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) was also surveyed in order to assess whether it represents a threat for <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> populations in canton Basel-Landschaft. The chytrid fungus turned out to be widespread but there was no evidence for chytrid-associated population declines. Overall, the status of the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> in canton Basel-Landschaft is good. The canton should ensure that the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> remains widespread in its territory because the species is declining elsewhere in Switzerland...|$|R

50|$|Five {{separate}} {{species of}} <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> are found across western Europe, northern Africa, and Majorca. Shy, nocturnal animals, they give away their presence by their ringing call. During the day, the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> hides under stones and logs or in underground tunnels. It often hides in dry, sandy soil, which it finds easier {{to dig into}} using its forelegs and snout. It emerges at dusk to forage for food, but always returns to the same hiding places before dawn. During the winter, the common <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> hibernates in its hole or in a burrow that has been deserted by a small animal.|$|R

2500|$|In {{his book}} The Case of the <b>Midwife</b> <b>Toad</b> (1971) Koestler defended the {{biologist}} Paul Kammerer, {{who claimed to}} have found experimental support for Lamarckian inheritance. According to Koestler, Kammerer's experiments on the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> may have been tampered with by a Nazi sympathizer at the University of Vienna.

40|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the alleged Lamarckian fraud of Paul Kammerer’s <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> experiments has intrigued generations of biologists. A re-examination of his descriptions of hybrid crosses of treated and nontreated toads reveals parent-of-origin effects like those documented in epigenetic inheritance. Modification of the extracellular matrix {{of the egg}} as described by Kammerer provides a plausible cause for altered gene methylation patterns. Traits such as altered egg and adult body size in Kammerer’s ‘‘treated’’ toads are inherited epigenetically in other tetrapods. A preliminary model involving the environmental silencing of a maternally inherited allele can be attempted to explain the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> experiments. Given available molecular tools and our current understanding of epigenetics, new experimentation with the <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> is strongly encouraged.

50|$|The Trust has {{endangered}} the Mallorcan <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> in Spain {{by introducing}} the pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. The pathogen causes chytridiomycosis, {{which is now}} recognised as a principal driver of the mass extinction crisis in amphibians. The Trust's breeding facility in Jersey, {{that had been used}} for re-introduction of the species to its native habitat, has been identified as the source of chytridiomycosis which affects the Mallorcan <b>midwife</b> <b>toad.</b> It is the first case, where it could be shown that the anthropogenic movement of amphibians is spreading the fatal disease. The trust were however, successful in the mitigation of the impact of chytridiomycosis after a large scale re-introduction programme, and thanks to the work of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Mallorcan <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> became the only amphibian to be downgraded from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable.|$|R

50|$|In the 1920s, {{experiments}} by Paul Kammerer on amphibians, {{particularly the}} <b>midwife</b> <b>toad,</b> appeared to find evidence supporting Lamarckism.

In The Case of the <b>Midwife</b> <b>Toad</b> (1971), author and journalist Arthur Koestler surmised that the tampering had been done by a Nazi sympathiser to discredit Kammerer for his political views, and that his research might actually have been valid. However, most biologists believe that Kammerer was a fraud, and even among those who believe he was honest, most believe that he misinterpreted the results of his experiments.|$|R

50|$|The Alytidae are {{a family}} of {{primitive}} frogs. Their common name is painted frogs or <b>midwife</b> <b>toads.</b> Most are endemic to Europe, {{but there are also}} three species in northwest Africa, and a species formerly thought to be extinct in Israel.|$|R

50|$|The Majorcan <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1977 and {{was described as}} Baleaphryne muletensis. Only later the toad was accounted as a <b>midwife</b> <b>toad.</b> This {{was due to the}} fact that the species was thought extinct and was described from the fossil record. Later the species was 'rediscovered' in 1979 when froglets and young frogs were discovered. Currently the species is protected as a Majorcan endemic species, and breeding programs have been started to prevent the extinction of this species. The number of wild animals is estimated at around 300 to 700 breeding pairs. It was previously housed and bred at the Durrell Wildlife Park, with the goal of releasing into the wild, which was successful.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Midwife</b> <b>toads</b> (Alytes) are a genus {{of frogs}} in the Alytidae family (formerly Discoglossidae), and {{are found in}} most of Europe and northwestern Africa. Characteristic of these toad-like frogs is their parental care: the males carry a string of fertilised eggs on their back, hence the name [...] "midwife". The female expels a strand of eggs, which the male fertilizes externally. He then wraps them around his legs {{to protect them from}} predators in the water. When they are ready to hatch, the male wades into shallow water, where he allows the tadpoles to leap out of their eggs. Five {{separate}} species of <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> are found across western Europe, northern Africa, and Majorca.|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} levels of Mallorcan <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> tadpoles, Alytes muletensis, were compared in two natural torrent pools which differed {{in their use}} by predatory viperine snakes, Natrix maura. Activity levels were lower in a pool regularly used by snakes {{than they were in}} a snake-free pool, but were reduced in both pools when snakes were experimentally introduced in nylon bags. In the presence of snakes, however, activity was more suppressed in the pool that was usually snake-free. Corresponding reductions in activity were also observed when tadpoles were treated with chemical cues from Mallorcan N. maura in a gravitational flow-through system. However, tadpoles failed to respond to chemical cues from other species of amphibian-eating snakes, or even to those from N. maura collected from a different population in mainland Spain. As none of the snakes used had previously eaten <b>midwife</b> <b>toads,</b> the responses cannot be related to previous diet, and seem to be specific to those N. maura from the island of Mallorca. As viperine snakes were probably introduced to Mallorca about 2000 years ago, the evolution of anti-predator behaviour in <b>midwife</b> <b>toad</b> tadpoles must have occurred relatively recently...|$|R
