5|$|Robert died {{fighting}} the Scots {{at the battle}} of Bannockburn and the region around the castle was attacked in 1314 and 1319, causing significant damage to neighbouring Church Brough. Around this time the village of Market Brough was established along the road overlooked by the castle, in an attempt by the Cliffords to maximise the possibilities for profits <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> along the valley. Market Brough acquired a royal charter in 1330 and seems to have rapidly overtaken Church Brough as the main settlement in the area.|$|E

In his youth the explorer James Cook learned his trade on colliers, shipping coal from the port. HMS Endeavour, the ship commanded by Cook on his voyage to Australia and New Zealand, {{was built in}} Whitby in 1764 by Tomas Fishburn as a coal carrier named Earl of Pembroke. She was bought by the Royal Navy 1768, refitted and renamed.|$|E

5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Driberg {{convened a}} group of Christian socialists that met {{regularly}} at the Lamb public house in Bloomsbury to discuss issues such as imperialism, colonialism, immigration and nuclear disarmament. The group's dispatches, Papers from the Lamb, led to the foundation in 1960 of the Christian Socialist Movement. Although no longer an MP, Driberg remained {{a member of the}} Labour Party's NEC and was active in party affairs. In 1957, in the face of antagonism <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> union leaders repelled by his lifestyle, he became Labour Party chairman, a largely ceremonial role. He travelled widely during his year in office, generally as a Reynolds News correspondent but using the party title to advantage whenever he could. Thus, in a 1958 visit to Moscow to interview space scientists, he obtained two meetings with Nikita Khrushchev.|$|E

5|$|In May 1967, the Eastern Region {{declared}} independence {{as a state}} {{called the}} Republic of Biafra, {{under the leadership of}} Lt. Colonel Emeka Ojukwu. The Nigerian Civil War began as the official Nigerian government side (predominated by soldiers from the North and West) attacked Biafra (Southeastern) on 6 July 1967 at Garkem. The 30-month war, with a long siege of Biafra and its isolation <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> and supplies, ended in January 1970. Estimates of the number of dead in the former Eastern Region are between 1 and 3 million people, from warfare, disease, and starvation, during the 30-month civil war.|$|E
5|$|In The Acharnians, Aristophanes blames Aspasia for the Peloponnesian War. He {{claims that}} the Megarian decree of Pericles, which {{excluded}} Megara <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> with Athens or its allies, was retaliation for prostitutes being kidnapped from the house of Aspasia by Megarians. Aristophanes' portrayal of Aspasia as responsible, from personal motives, for {{the outbreak of the}} war with Sparta may reflect memory of the earlier episode involving Miletus and Samos. Plutarch reports also the taunting comments of other comic poets, such as Eupolis and Cratinus. According to Podlecki, Douris appears to have propounded the view that Aspasia instigated both the Samian and Peloponnesian Wars.|$|E
5|$|James Cook's voyages of 1771–74 {{demonstrated}} conclusively {{the likely}} hostile nature of any hidden lands. This caused {{a shift of}} emphasis {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, away <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> and towards sealing and whaling, and then exploration and discovery. After the first overwintering on continental Antarctica in 1898-99 (Adrien de Gerlache), the prospect of reaching the South Pole appeared realistic, and the race for the pole began. The British were pre-eminent in this endeavor, which was characterized by the rivalry between Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Shackleton's efforts fell short; Scott reached the pole in January 1912 only to find that he had been beaten by the Norwegian Amundsen.|$|E

5|$|The city grew wealthy <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> caravans; the Palmyrenes were renowned merchants who {{established}} colonies {{along the}} Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled {{the construction of}} monumental projects, such as the Great Colonnade, the Temple of Bel, and the distinctive tower tombs. The Palmyrenes were a mix of Amorites, Arameans, and Arabs. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke Palmyrene (a dialect of Aramaic); Greek was used for commercial and diplomatic purposes. The culture of Palmyra was influenced by Greco-Roman culture and produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic deities, Mesopotamian and Arab gods.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} been {{controlled}} by many groups, from the Brigantes, the largest Brythonic kingdom of Great Britain, to the Romans, to Anglo-Saxons, Celts and Danes. After the Norman conquest in 1066, the Harrying of the North brought destruction. The area experienced Anglo-Scottish border fighting until {{the unification of}} Britain under the Stuarts, with some parts changing hands between England and Scotland many times. Many of the innovations of the Industrial Revolution began in Northern England, and its cities were the crucibles {{of many of the}} political changes that accompanied this social upheaval, <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> unionism to Manchester Capitalism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the economy of the North was dominated by heavy industry such as weaving, shipbuilding, steelmaking and mining. The deindustrialisation that followed {{in the second half of}} the 20th century hit Northern England hard, and many towns remain deprived compared with those in Southern England.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{documentary}} {{evidence about the}} nature of trade in Æthelberht's Kent. It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control of trade by the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. There is archaeological evidence suggesting that the royal influence predates any of the written sources. It has been suggested that one of Æthelberht's achievements was to take control of trade away from the aristocracy and to make it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods which gave it an advantage in trading with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> was important in itself.|$|E

5|$|There {{was another}} {{political}} consideration. The Lucky Dragon incident had {{touched off a}} storm of protest, and there were calls <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> unions and the Labour Party for a moratorium on nuclear testing, resulting in a stormy debate in the House of Commons on 5 April 1954 in which Churchill blamed Attlee for the McMahon Act. The new Eisenhower administration in the United States looked favourably on the idea, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden was sounded out about it by the U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. The United States had now finished its Operation Castle series of tests, and such a moratorium would restrict further nuclear weapons development by the Soviet Union; {{but it would also}} lock the United Kingdom into a permanent state of inferiority.|$|E
5|$|There were varying {{types of}} land {{ownership}} and tenure {{depending on the}} topography and climate of one's locality. In hilly, peripheral areas far <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> routes, most peasant farmers owned and cultivated their own fields. In frontier regions such as Hunan and Sichuan, owners of wealthy estates gathered serfs to till their lands. The most advanced areas had few estates with serfs tilling the fields; these regions had long fostered wet-rice cultivation, which did not require centralized management of farming. Landlords set fixed rents for tenant farmers in these regions, while independent small farming families also owned their own lots.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Władysław still {{tried to}} take {{a leading role in}} European politics, and {{negotiate}} a peaceful settlement to the Thirty Years' War, a settlement which he hoped would ease his way into regaining the Swedish crown. Following the armistice of Stuhmsdorf, Władysław came to increasingly realize that his prospects for regaining the Swedish throne were dim. In the years 1636–1638 he proposed several reforms to strengthen his and his dynasty's power in the Commonwealth. His first plan was an attempt to secure a hereditary province within the country, which would not be threatened by the possible power shift following a future royal election; this, however, did not gain sufficient support in the Sejm. Next, Władysław attempted to create an order of chivalry, similar to the Order of the Golden Fleece, but this plan was scuttled down as well, with the szlachta and the magnates seeing this as an attempt to create a royal, loyalist elite, and traditionally opposing anything that could lead to the reduction of their extensive power. Popular vote and opposition also resulted in the failure of the plan to raise taxes <b>from</b> <b>trade</b> tariffs; here it was not only the nobility but even the merchants and burghers from towns, like Gdańsk (Danzig) who were able to muster enough support (including from foreign powers) to stop the king's reforms. In fact, the defeat of his plans was so total, that he was forced to make certain conciliatory gestures to the nobility, as the Sejm passed several laws constraining his authority (such as to hire foreign troops), further indicating the limits of royal power in the Commonwealth.|$|E
