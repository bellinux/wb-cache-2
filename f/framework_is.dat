Since there are {{a large number of}} frameworks in existence, each is at best a relative version of the truth. Also because of the variety it may be costly to find an appropriate framework, and even more costly to find an inappropriate one. SIS <b>frameworks</b> <b>are</b> mostly post hoc applications of general strategic frameworks and so do not incorporate any special features of the computer world which might not have been apparent when the <b>frameworks</b> <b>were</b> devised. It is argued that SIS <b>frameworks</b> <b>are</b> externally imposed meanings and will stifle creativity by focusing attention away from bright ideas generated internally, will create the conditions for a power struggle for that meaning, and tend to move the locus of control for SISs outside the company. Finally, even the simplest <b>framework</b> may <b>be</b> understood in more than one way, creating the possibility of further hidden divisions...|$|R

This short communication aims {{to present an}} alternative method for section of {{one-piece cast}} frameworks and for casting implant-supported frameworks. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three-unit implant-supported nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) <b>frameworks</b> <b>were</b> tested for vertical misfit (n = 6). The <b>frameworks</b> <b>were</b> cast as one-piece (Group A) and later transversally sectioned through a diagonal axis (Group B) and compared to <b>frameworks</b> that <b>were</b> cast diagonally separated (Group C). All separated <b>frameworks</b> <b>were</b> laser welded. Only {{one side of the}} <b>frameworks</b> <b>was</b> screwed. RESULTS. The results on the tightened side were significantly lower in Group C (6. 43 +/- 3. 24 mu m) when compared to Groups A (16. 50 +/- 7. 55 mu m) and B (16. 27 +/- 1. 71 mu m) (P<. 05). On the opposite side, the diagonal section of the one-piece castings for laser welding showed significant improvement in the levels of misfit of the frameworks (Group A, 58. 66 +/- 14. 30 mu m; Group B, 39. 4. 8 +/- 12. 03 mu m; Group C, 23. 13 +/- 8. 24 mu m) (P<. 05).
