40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on functional status, and quality of life of individuals with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) after postoperative one year of TKA. Methods: Twenty-seven volunteered patients with knee OA undergoing TKA were enrolled into the study. Pain levels, functional status, and health related quality of life were evaluated before and after a year of TKA. Pain levels were assessed by visual analog scale (VAS). Functional status was evaluated by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC), and Lequesne Index, and health related quality of life was assessed by Short Form- 36 Questionnaire (SF- 36). Results: There were significant improvements in VAS, Lequesne Index, WOMAC scores, and all of subscales of SF- 36 Questionnaire in one year after the TKA compared to pretreatment scores (p< 0. 0001). There was a positive correlation between postoperative Lequesne Index and postoperative WOMAC scores (pain score (r= 0. 821, p= 0. 0001), stiffness score (r= 0. 634, p= 0. 0001), and <b>function</b> <b>score</b> (r= 0. 755, p= 0. 0001)).
