Sheila Jasanoff’s concepts of ‘co-production’ and ‘political cultures’ have been used to explore how both countries used different styles of scientific reasoning and justification of the risks of agricultural antibiotic use. It will be argued that national dynamics between policy, science and public knowledges co-produced different risk classifications and patterns of agricultural antibiotic use between both countries. UK’s political culture used ‘expert committees’ to remove the issue from public debate and to inform agricultural antibiotic policies. In contrast, the Swedish ‘consensus-oriented’ political culture made concerns related to agricultural antibiotic use into a cooperative debate that included multiple discourses. Understanding how national policies, science and public knowledges interact with the risks related to agricultural antibiotic use can provide valuable insights in understanding and addressing countries agricultural use of antibiotics. status: accepte...|$|R

Four varietal types of growth habit could be distinguished. Experiments on vegetative growth were mainly with varieties whose growth was inhibited in short days (SD) {{before the onset of}} flowering (not reversed by subsequent long days (LD)), whereas in LD growth continued for at least 6 to 7 months. The SD stimulus was perceived by the leaves and its effect increased with number of leaves. Preceding LD treatment decreased or nullified sensitivity to SD.

40|$|The {{negative}} gravitropic {{response in}} the grass leaf-sheath pulvinus {{is a consequence of}} cell elongation involving all cells except those of the uppermost region of the upper flank of an horizontally oriented pulvinus. The lowermost layer of cells elongate maximally, and the regions in between elongate to intermediate extents. The resulting curvatures of a responding pulvinus can be expressed mathematically by relating the angle of curvature (theta) to the original length (L 0) and the maximal length of the lower surface (L 1) and the diameter of the organ (D), using the equation, theta = (L 1 -L 0) /D, where theta is in radians. The elongation response (S) of any individual cells within the pulvinus can be expressed by the equation, S = 0. 5 - r cos theta, where r is the radius of the pulvinus and theta is in degrees. Microscopic measurement of cell lengths in different regions of the pulvinus supports the mathematical predictions. Indirect support is also obtained from the use of colchicine, coumarin, dichlorobenzonitrile (DCBN) and isopropyl N-chlorophenyl carbamate which exaggerate the inherent asymmetry during gravitropic response. Coumarin and DCBN also induce thickenings in the radial walls which appear first in the statenchyma, and later, in cells located towards the outer periphery of the pulvinus. The distribution patterns of these thickenings suggest that the asymmetric growth response of the pulvinus may be due to a differential and radial, centrifugal transport of <b>growth</b> <b>promotors</b> from the central statenchyma region...|$|E

40|$|This report {{contains}} the findings and recommendations on antimicrobial use (AMU) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) practice and policies in Indonesia. The observations {{were made by}} a team of Dutch and Indonesian experts during an identification mission in August 2015. The mission did address AMU/AMR in both human and veterinary health. It was found that the use of antimicrobials in Indonesia was widespread and uncontrolled on both the human and the veterinary side. This situation was recognised by the Indonesian public and private stakeholders. The awareness on AMR is low within the general public but also within {{a large part of the}} professional stakeholders. There are only limited data available on antimicrobial usage in the human and veterinary sector or on the development of antimicrobial resistance. Research in this area is fragmented and poorly coordinated and reporting lines are not clear. Several initiatives have been taken on both the human and veterinary side to reduce the use of antibiotics, through regulation and increasing awareness of public and professionals. However, from the interviews it appeared that the actual use is not being reduced. The Ministry of Health has drafted a road map on the implementation of existing regulations and guidelines. However, human and financial resources are lacking to support the implementation of this roadmap and to measure the effect of the implementation. The Ministry of Agriculture has recently approved a regulation to ban the use of antibiotics as <b>growth</b> <b>promotor.</b> However, no plan has been made to implement this regulation or to enforce this regulation. On the veterinary side a road map to support the reduction of antibiotic use in the livestock sector is not available. Recommendations are given in this report to support the reduction of AMU/AMR on both the human and veterinary side. On the veterinary side the development of a road map describing a feasible strategy should be the first priority. Second priority should be to establish an intersectoral coordinating mechanism for AMU/AMR involving both human and veterinary stakeholders. The development of monitoring and surveillance programmes for AMU/AMR and capacity building is important to support the policy and intervention programmes and is a logical third step...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{fermentation}} {{within the}} monogastric digestive tract is growing, particularly relative to animal health. This {{is of particular}} importance {{in relation to the}} forthcoming European ban on inclusion of anti-microbial <b>growth</b> <b>promotors</b> in animal diets. Fermentable carbohydrates are recognized as having an important role in fermentation in the monogastric digestive tract, and are often added to diets without having been examined for their actual fermentability, particularly in relation to the target animal. We describe an in vitro method to assess feed ingredients, as potential components of monogastric diets, which stimulate a positive fermentation (i. e., ones which will be well fermented and produce more short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and less ammonia). This technique requires use of a batch culture containing the test substrate and an inoculum of appropriate origin. During fermentation, cumulative gas production is measured at regular intervals, as an indicator of kinetics of the reaction. When fermentation is complete, organic matter losses and end-products such as SCFA and ammonia, are measured. This paper illustrates use of the technique with 45 carbohydrate-based ingredients using faeces from unweaned piglets as inoculum. By assessing potential fermentability {{of a large number of}} ingredients, it is possible to make an informed choice as to which substrates are most suited for inclusion in a diet. By combining results with information about transit time, diets can be designed which should stimulate desirable fermentation along the entire digestive tract. In vitro fermentability is a potentially valuable characteristic in diet design, in order to stimulate microbial activity in the digestive tract...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of various glycoprotein molecules {{on the surface}} of follicular keratinocytes was studied with a panel of lectins with specificity for various sugar moieties on biopsy specimens from both bald/balding scalp and normal occipital scalp, of 23 patients with androgenetic alopecia as well as on biopsies of normal forearm skin of four patients. The most significant differences between bald and normal scalp biopsy were noted with Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA I). We noted an increased (91. 8 % ± 3. 1; mean ± SE) expression of UEA I binding sites on the infra-infundibular follicular keratinocytes in anagen terminal scalp hairs, compared to 28. 5 % ± 5. 2 in the indeterminate (anagen) hairs of balding scalps, and 23. 2 % ± 6. 3 in the anagen follicles of vellus forearm hairs. By contrast, the telogen hairs demonstrated minimal UEA I staining: 4. 0 % ± 0. 8, mean ± SE in telogen scalp hairs, 1. 8 % ± 0. 5 in telogen hairs of balding scalps (0 % in completely bald scalps, in which all the hairs were in the telogen phase), and 1. 9 % ± 0. 2 in telogen forearm hairs. The percentage of UEA I staining correlated with the length of the infrainfundibular follicles in all cases studied. In three cases of hair regrowth after hair <b>growth</b> <b>promotors,</b> the UEA. I staining increased to 80. 6 % ± 6. 1 in anagen hairs and correlated with increased length of infraindundibular follicles. Our data indicate that there are 1) marked differences between anagen and telogen follicles in UEA I binding to infraindundibular follicular keratinocytes; 2) the percentage of UEA I staining reflects the size (length) of the infraindundibular hair follicle; and 3) the anagen follicles of balding scalps (indeterminate hairs) show UEA I staining resembling that exhibited by anagen follicles of vellus hairs...|$|E

Nesta fase, os animais sao susceptiveis as enterites (diarreias) de origem alimentar e/ou infecciosa, consideradas como a principais causas de baixo desempenho de cabritos. Assim, este experimento foi conduzido para avaliar o efeito de promotores de crescimento sobre o desempenho de cabritos leiteiros, na fase de aleitamento. Foram utilizados 30 crias, femeas, sendo 15 da raca Saanen e 15 da raca Anglo-Nubiana. Os animais foram aleitados com leite de vaca durante todo o periodo {{experimental}} e receberam capim elefante e concentrado {{ad libitum}} a partir de 15 dias de idade. Os tratamentos foram: T 1 = leite de vaca, T 2 = leite de vaca+salinomicina e T 3 = leite de vaca+probiotico. Os resultados mostraram que nao houve diferenca (P> 0, 05) entre tratamentos. Os valores encontrados para ganho de peso (g/animal/dia) e para peso ao desaleitamento (Kg) foram: 126, 5 126, 8, 122, 4 e 10, 2, 10, 4 e 10, 0, respectivamente. Nao foi observado ocorrencia de enterite nos animais. Entre raca, tambem, nao foi detectada diferenca (P> 0, 05) significativa. [Use of <b>growth</b> <b>promotors</b> for dairy kids, at the suckling phase]. The suckling phase of dairy kids is {{the period of}} higher potential for growth. In this phase, the animals are susceptible to the alimentary and infectious enteritis. These types of enteritis are the principal cause of low kid's performance. So, this experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of growth promoters on performance of dairy kids during the suckling phase. Thirty females kids of the Anglo-nubiana breed (15) and of the Saanen breed (15) were used. The animals were artificially reared with cow milk, during the trial and they received napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum) and concentrate ad libitum after 15 days of age. The treatments were T 1 - cow milk, T 2 - cow milk + salinomicine T 3 - cow milk + probiotic. The results showed {{that there was no}} significant difference (P> 0. 05) among treatments and breed. The values to weight gain (g/animal/day) and wean weight (kg/animal) were 126. 5, 126. 8, 122. 4 e 10. 2, 10. 4 e 10. 0, respectively. There was not enteritis in animals. 199...|$|E
40|$|Contraction {{of blood}} vessels for the {{regulation}} of blood flow and pressure is dependent on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) located in the medial layer of the vascular wall. Adult, differentiated VSMC have a well developed contractile system and a low rate of proliferation. Under the influence of hormones, growth factors, inflammatory mediators and tissue factors, cells may modulate to a ”synthetic” phenotype, characterized by diminished contractility, {{a high rate of}} proliferation, and a tendency to migrate out of the organized tissue. Such cells are believed to form the ”neointima”, a thickening of the innermost layer of the wall characteristic of responses to endothelial injury, and important for the development of atherosclerotic lesions and of restenosis following vascular surgery. To study conditions of importance for maintaining the vessel wall in its contractile state, it is desirable to develop methods to keep blood vessels in organ culture, whereby tissue factors are preserved and experimental conditions can be well controlled. The aim of this thesis work was to study contractile and metabolic properties as well as biochemical composition and receptor expression in an arterial preparation (rat tail artery) kept in organ culture. After 4 days of culture arterial rings the morphology of the tissue was well preserved, but signs of phenotypic modulation were observed, particularly in the areas adjacent to the cut ends of the rings, where PDGF receptors appeared and the differentiation marker calponin was decreased. Culture with fetal calf serum (FCS) as <b>growth</b> <b>promotor</b> caused decreased contractility and ultrastructural signs of tissue damage. Detailed examination of this phenomenon disclosed that it is mainly caused by increased intracellular [Ca 2 +]i, stimulated by vasoconstrictors present in FCS. Tight control of intracellular [Ca 2 +]i is thus essential for tissue preservation. Cultured rings showed increased rate of lactate production but decreased O 2 consumption, such that ATP production rate was the same as in fresh rings. Culture under hypoxia, however, caused reduced ATP production, suggesting decreased rate of energy consuming processes, such as protein turnover. Cultured rings maintained tension in hypoxic solution, in contrast to fresh rings. Reasons for this might be the increased reliance on glycolysis, and also an altered pattern of intracellular Ca 2 + waves, as revealed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. These results show that organ culture of vascular smooth muscle is useful for studying early events during phenotypic modulation in response to a variety of stimuli...|$|R

E 2 and membrane-impermeable bovine serum albumin-conjugated E 2 (E 2 -BSA) enhanced nerve growth factor secretion and mRNA expression in {{both types of}} macrophages E 2 enhanced nerve <b>growth</b> factor <b>promotor</b> activity in THP- 1 -derived macrophages and two activator protein- 1 binding sites on the promoter {{were responsible for the}} enhancement. E 2 and E 2 -BSA enhanced transcriptional activity and DNA binding of activator protein- 1. E 2 and E 2 -BSA shifted the activator protein- 1 composition from c-Jun homodimers to c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers. E 2 and E 2 -BSA transiently induced c-Fos mRNA, which was constitutively undetectable in both types of macrophages. Adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 suppressed E 2 -induced nerve growth factor production and c-Fos expression. E 2 and E 2 -BSA increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate level in both types of macrophages. Antisense oligonucleotide against guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor, GPR 30 suppressed the E 2 -induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate signal, c-Fos expression, and nerve growth factor secretion in both types of macrophages. These results suggest that E 2 may enhance nerve growth factor production by inducing c-Fos expression via cyclic adenosine monophosphate signal in macrophages. These effects may be mediated via GPR 30...|$|R
