25|$|The {{prostate}} {{is found}} {{as a male}} accessory gland in all placental mammals excepting <b>edentates,</b> martens, badgers and otters. The prostate glands of male marsupials are proportionally larger than those of placental mammals. In some marsupial species, {{the size of the}} prostate gland changes seasonally. The structure of the prostate varies, ranging from tubuloalveolar (as in humans) to branched tubular. The gland is particularly well developed in dogs, foxes and boars, though in other mammals, such as bulls, it can be small and inconspicuous. Dogs can produce in one hour as much prostatic fluid as a human can in a day. They excrete this fluid along with their urine to mark their territory. In many rodents and bats, the prostatic fluid contains a coagulant. This mixes with and coagulates semen during copulation to form a mating plug that temporarily prevents further copulation. In cetaceans the prostate gland is surrounded by a very powerful compressor muscle.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Paratheria" [...] {{was coined}} by British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas in 1887 {{in a review}} of tooth {{development}} in mammals. He found that the [...] "Edentata" [...] were especially distinctive. In this group, he included the sloths, anteaters, and armadillos, which are still placed together as Xenarthra, as well as the pangolins and the aardvark. According to Thomas, edentate teeth would be derived from the very earliest stage of mammalian dental evolution. Consequently, he suggested that they should be given a grouping separate from the other major groupings of mammals, for which terms had been introduced by Thomas Huxley: Eutheria (placentals) and Metatheria (marsupials). For this new grouping, he suggested the name Paratheria [...] "to indicate their position by the side of, but separate from, the other Mammals" [...] (the Greek παρά para means [...] "beside"). Thomas had included one other mammal among the <b>edentates,</b> the aardvark; however, he was unable to provide a satisfactory scenario for the origin of its wholly unique dentition, which he could only compare with that of some fish. Thomas's arrangement was foreshadowed by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville's 1839 classification; he placed <b>edentates</b> (except the sloth Bradypus, which he considered to be a primate) as a major division, the Maldentés ("poorly toothed"). This group was considered to be distinct from the other monodelphes (placentals), the Bien dentés ("well-toothed").

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} 6 dental statuses as {{risk factors}} for malnutrition in geriatric patients admitted to a convalescent and rehabilitation hospital. Materials and Methods: One hundred twenty (59 men and 61 women) geriatric patients admitted to a convalescent and rehabilitation hospital were recruited. Three biochemical and hematologic parameters (albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte count) were used for analysis. Malnutrition was defined as Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18. 5 and albumin level under 35 g/L. The number of natural or prosthetic teeth in the dentate patients, {{and the presence of}} one or both dentures in the <b>edentate</b> patients, were recorded. Risk factors associated with malnutrition were investigated, namely: (1) edentulism among all patients, (2) edentulism without a set of complete dentures among all patients, (3) edentulism without a set of complete dentures among the <b>edentate</b> patients, (4) decreased number (. 05). The status of <b>edentate</b> patients without a set of complete dentures compared with other <b>edentate</b> and dentate patients was the only independent risk factor (P <. 05) in the 6 statuses studied. Conclusion: Primary healthcare workers caring for hospitalized geriatric patients should identify <b>edentate</b> patients without a set of complete dentures for the possibility of malnutrition. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Since <b>edentate</b> {{subjects}} have {{a reduced}} masticatory function, {{it can be}} expected that the morphology of the cancellous bone of their mandibular condyles has changed according to the altered mechanical environment.

500|$|Thomas's {{hypothesis}} {{received little}} support, or even attention, in subsequent years. In 1893, Henry Fairfield Osborn remarked that new studies of edentate teeth {{indicated that they}} were not as distinct as Thomas thought. William Berryman Scott did, however, place Paratheria as a separate subclass in 1904, although he apparently did not follow Thomas's theories about the origins of edentate teeth. In 1910, William King Gregory reviewed the interrelationships of mammals and placed <b>edentates</b> among other placentals, though he gave [...] "Paratheria" [...] as an alternative name for his superorder Edentata, which included Xenarthra and tentatively Pholidota (pangolins), Tubulidentata (aardvarks), and the fossil Taeniodonta.

60|$|Another no less suggestive {{observation}} {{was made}} by Mr. Darwin, whose personal investigations during the voyage of the Beagle led him to remark upon the singular fact, that the fauna, which immediately precedes that at present existing in any geographical province of distribution, presents the same peculiarities as its successor.

60|$|Assuming {{that these}} two young bats had, before I found them, existed like parasites {{clinging}} to the parent, their adroit actions when liberated, and their angry demonstrations at my approach, were very astonishing; for in all other mammals born in a perfectly helpless state, like rodents, weasels, <b>edentates,</b> and even marsupials, the instincts of self-preservation are gradually developed after the period of activity begins, when the mother leads them out, and they play with her and Avith each other.

40|$|Background: Tooth loss is {{associated}} with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk. This association may however be due to residual confounding. We aimed to assess whether tooth loss {{is associated}} with specific CVD mortality endpoints in a national population sample adjusting for potential confounders. Methods and Results: We used a prospective cohort design and data from the Scottish Health Survey. We combined data from surveys in 1995, 1998, 2003 and linked this to mortality records. Dental status was classified through self-reports as natural teeth only, natural teeth and dentures, and no natural teeth (<b>edentate).</b> Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate risk of CVD mortality by dental status adjusting for potential confounders. The sample consisted of 12871 participants. They were followed for 8. 0 (SD: 3. 3) years. During 103173 person-years, there were 1480 cases of all-cause mortality, 498 of CVD, and 515 of cancer. After adjusting for demographic, socio-economic, behavioural and health status, <b>edentate</b> subjects had significantly higher risk of all-cause (HR, 1. 30; 95 % CI, 1. 12, 1. 50) and CVD mortality (HR, 1. 49; 95 % CI, 1. 16, 1. 92) compared to subjects with natural teeth only.

60|$|But {{it is very}} {{remarkable}} that while the Miocene fauna of the Arctogaeal province, as a whole, is of the same character as the existing fauna of the same province, as a whole, the component elements of the fauna were differently associated. In the Miocene epoch, North America possessed Elephants, Horses, Rhinoceroses, and a great number and variety of Ruminants and Pigs, which are absent in the present indigenous fauna; Europe had its Apes, Elephants, Rhinoceroses, Tapirs, Musk-deer, Giraffes, Hyaenas, great Cats, <b>Edentates,</b> and Opossum-like Marsupials, which have equally vanished from its present fauna; and in Northern India, the African types of Hippopotamuses, Giraffes, and Elephants were mixed up with what are now the Asiatic types of the latter, and with Camels, and Semnopithecine and Pithecine Apes of no less distinctly Asiatic forms.|$|E
60|$|We {{must also}} notice the {{preponderance}} of low or archaic types among the animals of South America. <b>Edentates,</b> marsupials, and rodents form {{the majority of the}} terrestrial mammalia; while such higher groups as the carnivora and hoofed animals are exceedingly deficient. Among birds a low type of Passeres, characterised by the absence of the singing muscles, is excessively prevalent, the enormous groups of the ant-thrushes, tyrants, tree-creepers, manakins, and chatterers belonging to it. The Picariæ (a lower group) also prevail to a far greater extent than in any other regions, both in variety of forms and number of species; and the chief representatives of the gallinaceous birds--the curassows and tinamous, are believed to be allied, the former to the brush-turkeys of Australia, the latter (very remotely) to the ostriches, two of the least developed types of birds.|$|E
6000|$|Of <b>Edentates</b> {{there are}} four. The giant {{armadillo}} does not range so far, and the delicate little pink fairy armadillo, the truncated Chlamydophorus, is a dweller in the sand-dunes of Mendoza, {{and has never}} colonized the grassy pampas. The Tatusia hybrida, called [...] "little mule" [...] from the length of its ears, and the Dasypus tricinctus, which, when disturbed, rolls itself into a ball, the wedge-shaped head and wedge-shaped tail admirably fitting into the deep-cut shell side by side; and the quirquincho (Dasypus minutus), all inhabit the pampa, are diurnal, and feed exclusively on insects, chiefly ants. Wherever the country becomes settled, these three disappear, owing to the dulness of their senses, especially that of sight, and to the diurnal habit, which was an advantage to them, and enabled them to survive when rapacious animals, which are mostly nocturnal, were their only enemies. The fourth, and most important, is the hairy armadillo, with habits which are in strange contrast to those of its perishing congeners, and which seem to mock many hard-and-fast rules concerning animal life. It is omnivorous, and will thrive on anything from grass to flesh, found dead and in all stages of decay, or captured by means of its own strategy. Furthermore, its habits change to suit its conditions: thus, where nocturnal carnivores are its enemies, it is diurnal; but where man appears as a chief persecutor, it becomes nocturnal. It is much hunted for its flesh, dogs being trained for the purpose; yet it actually becomes more abundant as population increases in any district; and, if versatility in habits or adaptiveness can {{be taken as a}} measure of intelligence, this poor armadillo, a survival of the past, so old on the earth as to have existed contemporaneously with the giant glyptodon, is the superior of the large-brained cats and canines.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundEmerging {{evidence}} suggests that an individual’s level of mastication {{may play a role}} in their cognitive status. This suggests that in <b>edentate</b> individuals wearing complete denture, non-optimal mastication via inadequate denture could be related to cognitive status. ObjectivesTo examine the impact of quality of denture on cognitive status of a sample of elderly <b>edentate</b> Brazilian individuals wearing complete denture. MethodsThis study is a cross-sectional analysis of data collected from 117 <b>edentate</b> elders (mean age 73. 7 ± 5. 6 years) wearing complete denture, in southern Brazil. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Brazilian version of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Clinical examination was conducted to evaluate the quality of dentures by use of the FAD (functional assessment of dentures) instrument. Masticatory ability was assessed by self-reported questions. ResultsThe mean MMSE score for the total sample was 23. 1 (SD= 4. 4) and was associated with age (p= 0. 001), education (p< 0. 0001), depressive symptoms (p= 0. 003), as well as the masticatory ability (p= 0. 001) and functional quality of dentures (p< 0. 0001). Unsatisfactory masticatory ability was more frequent in <b>edentate</b> individuals with lower FAD score (p< 0. 0001) and led to a lower MMSE total score. Unsatisfactory masticatory ability was associated with MMSE scores (p= 0. 002) after adjustment. ConclusionThe study results support the potential role of optimal functional quality of dentures in maintaining cognitive activity in elders. This association may be explained via mastication pathway. Clinical significanceThe potential beneficial effect of functional dentures on cognitive status via mastication could encourage preventive strategies to decrease substantial risk of morbidity in elders...|$|R

60|$|I do {{not know}} of a more {{striking}} instance in the animal kingdom of adaptation of structure to habit than is afforded by the hairy armadillo--Dasypus villosus. He appears to us, roughly speaking, to resemble an ant-eater saddled with a dish cover; yet this creature, with the cunning Avhich Nature has given it to supplement all deficiencies, has discovered in its bony encumbrance a highly efficient weapon of offence. Most other <b>edentates</b> are diurnal and almost exclusively insectivorous, some feeding only on ants; they have unchangeable habits, very limited intelligence, and vanish before civilization. The hairy armadillo alone has struck out a line for itself. Like its fast disappearing congeners, it is an insect-eater still, but does not like them seek its food {{on the surface and}} in the ant-hill only; all kinds of insects are preyed on, and by means of its keen scent it discovers worms and larvae several inches beneath the surface. Its method of taking worms and grubs resembles that of probing birds, for it throws up no earth, but forces its sharp snout and wedge-shaped head down to the required depth; and probably while working it moves round in a circle, for the hole is conical, though the head of the animal is flat. Where it has found a rich hunting-ground, the earth is seen pitted with hundreds of these neat symmetrical bores. It is also an enemy to ground-nesting birds, being fond of eggs and fledglings; and when unable to capture prey it will feed on carrion as readily as a wild dog or vulture, returning night after night to the carcase of a horse or cow as long as the flesh lasts. Failing animal food, it subsists on vegetable diet; and I have frequently found their stomachs stuffed with clover, and, stranger still, with the large, hard grains of the maize, swallowed entire.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{the truth}} which Mr. Darwin {{perceived}} and promulgated as [...] "the {{law of the}} succession of types" [...] is, that, in all these provinces, the animals found in Pliocene or later deposits are closely affined to those which now inhabit the same provinces; and that, conversely, the forms characteristic of other provinces are absent. North and South America, perhaps, present one or two exceptions to the last rule, but they are readily susceptible of explanation. Thus, in Australia, the later Tertiary mammals are marsupials (possibly with exception of the Dog and a Rodent or two, as at present). In Austro-Columbia the later Tertiary fauna exhibits numerous and varied forms of Platyrrhine Apes, Rodents, Cats, Dogs, Stags, Edentata, and Opossums; but, as at present, no Catarrhine Apes, no Lemurs, no Insectivora, Oxen, Antelopes, Rhinoceroses, nor Didelphia other than Opossums. And in the wide-spread Arctogaeal province, the Pliocene and later mammals {{belong to the same}} groups as those which now exist in the province. The law of succession of types, therefore, holds good for the present epoch as compared with its predecessor. Does it equally well apply to the Pliocene fauna when we compare it with that of the Miocene epoch? By great good fortune, an extensive mammalian fauna of the latter epoch has now become known, in four very distant portions of the Arctogaeal province which do not differ greatly in latitude. Thus Falconer and Cautley have made known the fauna of the sub-Himalayas and the Perim Islands; Gaudry that of Attica; many observers that of Central Europe and France; and Leidy that of Nebraska, on the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains. The results are very striking. The total Miocene fauna comprises many genera, and species of Catarrhine Apes, of Bats, of Insectivora; of Arctogaeal types of Rodentia; of Proboscidea; of equine, rhinocerotic, and tapirine quadrupeds; of cameline, bovine, antilopine, cervine, and traguline Ruminants; of Pigs and Hippopotamuses; of Viverridae and Hyaenidae among other Carnivora; with Edentata allied to the Arctogaeal Orycteropus and Manis, and not to the Austro-Columbian <b>Edentates.</b> The only type present in the Miocene, but absent in the existing, fauna of Eastern Arctogaea, is that of the Didelphidae, which, however, remains in North America.|$|E
