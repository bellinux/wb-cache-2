The aim of the present study was to examine variations in somatotype and anthropometry in three different competitive dance styles: DanceSport Standard, Latin American and Ten Dance. Anthropometry and somatotype data were collected from thirty couples competing in Standard (n= 24 individuals), Latin American (n= 14) and Ten Dance (n= 22) styles. A single tester (ISAK Level 1) carried out all anthropometric measurements using the Heath-Carter protocol and somatotypes were calculated using the Heath-Carter's decimal equations. Results indicated that the mean somatotype for the male dancers was 2. 4 - 3. 9 - 3. 2, whilst for females it was 2. 7 - 2. 7 - 3. 5. Factorial analysis reported Standard dancers scored significantly higher for ectomorphy, sitting height and arm span than Latin dancers (p< 0. 05). Correlation analysis with the Standard dancer's International Ranking highlighted moderate positive correlation with mesomorphy (r= 0. 434, p< 0. 05) and negative correlation with ectomorphy (r=- 0. 546, p< 0. 001).

Players were categorized according to playing position (i. e., role) as middle blockers (n= 28), opposite hitters (n= 41), passer-hitters (n= 54), setters (n= 30), and liberos (n= 28). Within each position, players were divided into a more successful group and a less successful group according to team ranking in the latest regional championship and player quality within the team. Height and body mass, somatotype by the Heath-Carter method, and four tests of lower body power, speed, agility and upper body power (i. e., dependent variables) were assessed. Players in different positions differed significantly in height and all three somatotype components, but no significant differences were found in body mass, body mass index or measured physical performance variables. Players of different performance level differed significantly in both anthropometric and physical performance variables. Generally, middle blockers were taller, more <b>ectomorphic,</b> less mesomorphic and endomorphic, whereas liberos were shorter, less <b>ectomorphic,</b> more mesomorphic and endomorphic than players in other positions.

[Methods] The somatotypes of 23 elite boxing athletes and 23 nonathletes were measured with the Heath-Carter method. The subjects were divided into four weight divisions as follows: lightweight, light middleweight, middleweight, and heavyweight class. [Results] The endomorphic compo-nent values of the boxing athletes were lower than those of the nonathletes. However, the mesomorphic component values of the boxing athletes were higher than those of the nonathletes. There was no significant difference in the ec-tomorphic component between the two groups. The higher weight divisions tended to have higher values of height, weight, and BMI than the lower weight divisions. The higher weight divisions also tended to have higher values for the endomorphic and mesomorphic components and a lower value for the <b>ectomorphic</b> component than the lower weight divisions. The group of nonathletes consisted of eight endomorphs, four mesomorphs, six ectomorphs, and five central types. Among the boxing athletes, there were 16 mesomorphic, four <b>ectomorphic,</b> and two central types and one endomorphic type.

Somatotype was estimated by the Heath-Carter anthropometric method. Results: significant differences were found in all the variables of the somatotype during the periods studied (p < 0. 01), except for height (p = 0. 176) and humeral breadth in women (p = 0. 067). Important distinctions were also found in the endomorphic, mesomorphic and <b>ectomorphic</b> components (p < 0. 01). Men measurements registered remarkable differences in all the variables (p < 0. 01), with the exception of weight (p = 0. 156), calf breadth (p = 0. 906) and arm breadth in contraction (p = 0. 284). Measurement results of endomorphic (p< 0. 01), <b>ectomorphic</b> (p < 0. 01) and mesomorfic components (p < 0. 05) revealed considerable differences. During the period 1984 - 1985, men classified as balanced mesomorph 2. 7 - 4. 8 - 3. 1 which switched to mesomorph-endomorph 3. 8 - 4. 3 - 2. 5 in the period 2009 - 2010. And the population of women in the 1984 - 1985 period is classified as mesomorph-endomorph 4. 2 - 4. 7 - 2. 1 and changes to a mesomorphic-endomorph biotype 6. 6 - 4. 1 - 1. 3 in the 2009 - 2010. Conclusions: the somatotype of the adolescent population, especially women in Valparaiso, Chile has changed to a predominant endomorphic biotype, and its mesomorphic component has decreased.

The somatotype was determined using the RI with the Curtis key, classifying the subjects as <b>ectomorphic</b> (n= 30), mesomorphic (n= 31) and endomorphic (n= 87). The somatotype was significantly related to place of residence, physical activity, waist and hip circumference, WHR and BMI index, total protein intake, animal protein intake, vitamin E intake (p≤ 0. 05) and to fat, phosphorus and thiamine intake (p≤ 0. 1).

The study was carried out on the Scheduled Tribes, namely Mina, Bhil, Sahariya, Garasia, Damor and Kathodi of Rajasthan. Samples are collected from the place of residence and schools. The data for somatotype were collected following the internationally accepted standards. The calculated somatotypes are plotted on somatochart triangle to determine their physique. Study of body physique reveals that in all the tribal groups <b>ectomorphic</b> component is dominant, which indicates their linear physique. This is also reflective of their overall poor conditions and undernutrition prevailing in the area. Both males and females of Bhils show least endomorphy rating i. e. lowest relative fatness and highest ectomorphy rating indicating linear physique than the other tribal groups. Distribution of somatotypes on somatochart indicates that values plotted, in all the age groups, lie in mesomorphic ectomorph or endomorphic ectomorph region, thus showing a greater linearity among the tribal groups...|$|E
40|$|According to the evidence, {{there is}} a need for more {{thorough}} assessment and quantification of body size and shape and the risk of breast cancer. Using the somatotype methodology, we carried out an original research in order to explore possible associations between body shape and the risk of breast cancer in Uruguayan women. With this objective, 254 recent breast cancer cases and 1, 000 frequency-matched healthy controls were interviewed on menstrual and reproductive story, and a series of skinfolds, circumferences and diameters were measured specifically to calculate somatotype. A positive association with breast cancer was found for high endomorphy (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2. 82, p < 0. 001), mainly among pre-menopausal women (OR = 4. 98, p < 0. 001) and normoweight women (OR = 5. 12, p = 0. 002), whereas almost no differences were observed for mesomorphic and <b>ectomorphic</b> women. Analysis showed a high meso-endomorphic pattern in the study population. Further studies are needed to confirm the present results obtained in a country with high incidence of the disease...|$|E
