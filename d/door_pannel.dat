50|$|On 24 October 1769, near Ardrossan, {{travelling}} in his {{carriage and}} four servants following him, Alexander met two men, {{one of whom}} was Mungo Campbell, an officer of excise at Saltcoats, and son of a Provost of Ayr, one of twenty-four children. Alexander, as Mungo had previously been caught shooting game on his estates, asked Mungo to hand over the gun he was carrying, which he refused, saying that he would rather die. The earl then ordered his fowling-piece, which was not loaded, to be brought from the carriage and in the scuffle that ensued, Mungo fired at Lord Eglinton, who was mortally wounded in the bowels, and died ten hours later at about one oâ€™clock the following morning, at Eglinton Castle, where he had been taken in his carriage. The preserved <b>door</b> <b>pannel</b> (sic) contradicts the stated course of events by stating that the Earl was instantly shot upon leaving his carriage.|$|E
