40|$|High heat <b>flux</b> <b>testing</b> for the United States {{fusion power}} {{program is the}} primary mission of the Plasma Materials Test Facility (PMTF) located at Sandia National Laboratories - New Mexico. This facility, {{which is owned by}} the United States Department of Energy, has been in {{operation}} for over 17 years and has provided much of the high heat flux data used in the design and evaluation of plasma facing components for many of the world`s magnetic fusion, tokamak experiments. In addition to domestic tokamaks such as Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) at Princeton and the DIII-D tokamak at General Atomics, components for international experiments like TEXTOR, Tore-Supra, and JET also have been tested at the PMTF. High heat <b>flux</b> <b>testing</b> spans a wide spectrum including thermal shock tests on passively cooled materials, thermal response and thermal fatigue tests on actively cooled components, critical heat flux-burnout tests, braze reliability tests and safety related tests.

40|$|The current ITER design employs beryllium, {{carbon fiber}} {{reinforced}} composite and tungsten as plasma facing materials. Since these materials are exposed to high heat fluxes during the operation, {{it is essential to}} perform high heat <b>flux</b> <b>tests</b> for R&D of ITER components. Static heat loads corresponding to cycling loads during normal operation, are estimated to be up to 20 MW/m(2) in the divertor targets and around 0. 5 MW/m(2) at the first wall in ITER. For the static high heat <b>flux</b> <b>testing,</b> tests in electron beam facilities, particle beam facilities, IR heater and in-pile tests have been performed. Another type, more critical heat loads, which have high power densities and short durations, corresponding to transient events, i. e. plasma disruption, vertical displacement events (VDEs) and edge localized modes (ELMs) deliver considerable heat flux onto the plasma facing materials. For this purpose, tests in electron beam (short pulses), plasma gun and high power laser facilities have been carried out. The present work summarizes the features of these facilities and recent experimental results as well as the current selection of ITER plasma facing components...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} a permanent magnetic alloy, Nd-Fe-B, coated by a triple layer of nickel-copper-nickel was studied. The corrosion resistance was investigated by (i) <b>flux</b> <b>tests,</b> carried out at 90 °C in an atmosphere containing chlorides or at 70 °C containing sulfides, (ii) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and (iii) potentiodynamic polarization tests, carried out in solution at different temperatures (0 - 90 °C) containing chlorides or sulfides.

40|$|The W—for tungsten—Environment in Steady-state Tokamak (WEST) {{project is}} based on an upgrade of the Tore Supra tokamak from a carbon limiter to an X-point {{divertor}} device. A new set of actively cooled tungsten coated plasma facing components will cover a part of the vessel to provide a fully metallic environment. This paper deals with the validation program performed for tungsten coatings (≥ 15 μm) on a CuCrZr substrate. The first step was dedicated to the qualification under high heat <b>flux</b> <b>tests</b> of the coating on small inertially cooled samples. To study the thermal behavior and the non-uniformity, the second step was dedicated to the validation of the coating on large inertially cooled samples with geometry and shape (540 × 120 mm) representative of the WEST coated components. The last step was dedicated to the optimization of the coating and to the high heat <b>flux</b> <b>tests</b> up to 10. 5 MW m− 2 on relevant coated actively cooled prototypes. Non-uniformity and thickness of the coating (15 and 30 μm) correspond to specifications.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the option to start the ITER operation with a full tungsten (W) divertor, high heat <b>flux</b> <b>tests</b> were performed in the electron beam facility FE 200, Le Creusot, France. Thereby, in total eight small-scale and three medium-scale monoblock mock-ups produced with different manufacturing technologies and different tungsten grades were exposed to cyclic steady state heat loads. The applied power density ranges from 10 to 20 MW/m 2 with a maximum of 1000 cycles at each particular loading step. Finally, on a reduced number of tiles, critical heat <b>flux</b> <b>tests</b> {{in the range of}} 30 MW/m 2 were performed. Besides macroscopic and microscopic images of the loaded surface areas, detailed metallographic analyses were performed in order to characterize the occurring damages, i. e., crack formation, recrystallization, and melting. Thereby, the different joining technologies, i. e., hot radial pressing (HRP) vs. hot isostatic pressing (HIP) of tungsten to the Cu-based cooling tube, were qualified showing a higher stability and reproducibility of the HIP technology also as repair technology. Finally, the material response at the loaded top surface was found to be depending on the material grade, microstructural orientation, and recrystallization state of the material. These damages might be triggered by the application of thermal shock loads during electron beam surface scanning and not by the steady state heat load only. However, the superposition of thermal fatigue loads and thermal shocks as also expected during ELMs in ITER gives a first impression of the possible severe material degradation at the surface during operational scenarios at the divertor strike point...|$|R
