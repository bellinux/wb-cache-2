5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage,</b> {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result of <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> to the surroundings.|$|E
25|$|The explosions {{were caused}} by {{homemade}} organic peroxide–based devices packed into backpacks.

40|$|Over the years, a myth has {{developed}} that insurance coverage {{is not available}} or allowed for intentional <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage.</b> This myth has two primary bases: one, the “fortuity” doctrine, which provides that insurance should only cover losses that happen by chance; and two, public policy, which allegedly disfavors allowing insurance for intentional <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage.</b> This article dispels that myth. Many types of liability insurance policies expressly cover intentional torts including trademark infringement, copyright infringement, invasion of privacy, defamation, disparagement, and improper employment practices such as discrimination. In addition, punitive damages, which typically are awarded for intentional misconduct, are covered by insurance policies in most jurisdictions. Further, a public policy analysis actually favors allowing insurance recoveries for intentional <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage.</b> No empirical evidence has been offered to support {{the argument that the}} availability of liability insurance increases misconduct by policyholders while the public policy interests of compensating innocent victims and enforcing the terms of contracts are advanced by allowing insurance for intentional <b>injuries</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage...</b>|$|R

25|$|While at Gibraltar Sanders {{observed}} Spanish gunboats {{capture a}} merchant brig between Cabritta Point and Ceuta. He set out at sunset and recaptured the brig, while sinking {{one of the}} gunboats. He went on to save several English merchant vessels from the Algeciras flotilla and captured or destroyed several privateers and trading vessels. Some of these encounters involved an action but none resulted in material <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> to Espoir.|$|E
25|$|Forensic {{engineering}} is {{the investigation of}} materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> to property. The consequences of failure are dealt with by the law of product liability. The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery. The subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, {{although it may be}} of use in criminal law cases. Generally the purpose of a Forensic engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an accident. It can also involve investigation of intellectual property claims, especially patents.|$|E
25|$|The {{defendants}} {{also argued}} that Steinberg was estopped from defending his copyright {{on the grounds that}} he had taken no action over a period of eight years to stop others from counterfeiting his posters and adapting his idea to other locations, and had not acted in response to newspaper ads promoting the movie. The court rejected this argument, holding that the defendants had not proved any of the elements of estoppel: (1) a representation in fact; (2) reasonable reliance thereon; and (3) <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> resulting from denial by the party making the representation. While the defendants argued that Steinberg had made a representation of his acquiescence to their use of his image in the movie poster by not complaining about the ads in the newspaper, the judge rejected this line of reasoning and noted that the defendants had continued to use the infringing advertisements even after becoming aware of Steinberg's objections. Further, there was no existing relationship between the parties that could give rise to estoppel.|$|E

25|$|Italy has {{class action}} legislation. Consumer {{associations}} can file claims {{on behalf of}} groups of consumers to obtain judicial orders against corporations that cause <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> to consumers. These types of claims are increasing and Italian courts have recently allowed them against banks that continue to apply compound interest on retail clients’ current account overdrafts. The introduction of class actions is on the new government’s agenda. On November 19, 2007, the Senato della Repubblica passed a class action law in Finanziaria 2008, a financial document for the economy management of the government. Now (from 10 December 2007), in order of Italian legislation system, the law is before the House {{and has to be}} passed also by the Camera dei Deputati, the second house of Italian Parliament, to become an effective law. In 2004, the Italian parliament considered the introduction of a type of class action, specifically in the area of consumers’ law. To date, no such law has been enacted, but scholars demonstrated that class actions (azioni rappresentative) do not contrast with Italian principles of civil procedure. Class action is regulated by art. 140 bis of the Italian consumers' code and will be in force from 1 July 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Insurance fraud {{has existed}} since the {{beginning}} of insurance as a commercial enterprise. Fraudulent claims account for a significant portion of all claims received by insurers, and cost billions of dollars annually. [...] Types of insurance fraud are diverse, and occur in all areas of insurance. [...] Insurance crimes also range in severity, from slightly exaggerating claims to deliberately causing accidents or damage. [...] Fraudulent activities affect the lives of innocent people, both directly through accidental or intentional <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage,</b> and indirectly as these crimes cause insurance premiums to be higher. [...] Insurance fraud poses a significant problem, and governments and other organizations make efforts to deter such activities.|$|E

As in the case where I erect a building, and when the timber is being lifted a piece of it falls upon the house of my {{neighbor}} and bruises his house, he will have a good action, and that, although the erection of my house was lawful and the timber fell without my intent. Similarly, if a man commits an assault upon me and I cannot avoid him if he wants to beat me, and I lift my stick in self-defense in order to prevent him, and there is a man behind me, although my lifting my stick was lawful to defend myself and I injured him without intent [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|His durability, regeneration, and {{endurance}} also increase {{in proportion to}} his temper. Hulk is resistant to <b>injury</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage,</b> though {{the degree to which}} varies between interpretations, but he has withstood the equivalent of solar temperatures, nuclear explosions, and planet-shattering impacts. Despite his remarkable resiliency, continuous barrages of high-caliber gunfire can hinder his movement to some degree while he can be temporarily subdued with intense attacks with chemical weapons such as anesthetic gases, although any interruption of such dosages will allow him to quickly recover. [...] He has been shown to have both regenerative and adaptive healing abilities, including growing tissues to allow him to breathe underwater, surviving unprotected in space for extended periods, and when injured, healing from most wounds within seconds, including, on one occasion, the complete destruction of most of his body mass. His future self, the [...] "Maestro", was even eventually able to recover from being blown to powder. As an effect, he has an extremely prolonged lifespan.|$|E
