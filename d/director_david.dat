5|$|According to Dance, Clemens was {{requested}} by 20th Century Fox as a love interest for Ellen Ripley. <b>Director</b> <b>David</b> Fincher initially intended to reunite Paul McGann, Richard E.

5|$|Bruce {{was among}} five former Premier League players signed by Birmingham manager Trevor Francis to add {{experience}} to a squad expected to challenge for promotion.

5|$|<b>Director</b> <b>David</b> Silverman had {{difficulty}} devising a legible Scrabble {{board for the}} opening scene that would convey {{the idea that the}} Simpsons were only able to devise very simple words.

5|$|<b>Director</b> <b>David</b> Yates {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he had originally shot a three-hour film of Order of the Phoenix.

Harry skips stones in front of the Glenfinnan Monument in Glenfinnan in another cut scene.|$|E
