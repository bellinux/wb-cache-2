5|$|By 1139, an {{invasion}} of England by Robert and Matilda appeared imminent. Geoffrey and Matilda had secured much of Normandy and, together with Robert, spent {{the beginning of the}} year mobilising forces for a cross-Channel expedition. Matilda also appealed to the papacy at the start of the year; her representative, Bishop Ulger, put forward her legal claim to the English throne on the grounds of her hereditary right and the oaths sworn by the barons. Arnulf of Lisieux led Stephen's case, arguing that because Matilda's mother <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> a nun, her claim to the throne was illegitimate. The Pope declined to reverse his earlier support for Stephen, but from Matilda's perspective the case usefully established that Stephen's claim was disputed.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 an {{election}} promise by Viktor Yanukovych (leader of the Party of Regions) to adopt Russian {{as the second}} official language might also have increased the turnout of his base, but it was rebutted during the campaign by his opponent (Viktor Yushchenko), who pointed out that Yanukovych could have already taken steps towards this change {{while he was a}} Prime Minister of Ukraine if this <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> his priority. During his campaign Yushchenko emphasized that his being painted as a proponent of the closure of Russian schools frequently made by his opponents is entirely baseless and stated his view that the issue of school language, as well as the churches, should be left to local communities. Nevertheless, during Yuchshenko's presidency the transfer of educational institutions from Russian to Ukrainian continued.|$|E
25|$|The French chose Picot as French High Commissioner for the {{soon to be}} {{occupied}} {{territory of}} Syria and Palestine. The British appointed Sykes as Chief Political Officer to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. On 3 April 1917, Sykes met with Lloyd George, Curzon and Hankey to receive his instructions in this regard, namely to keep the French onside while pressing for a British Palestine. First Sykes in early May and then Picot and Sykes together visited the Hejaz later in May to discuss the agreement with Faisal and Hussein. Hussein was persuaded {{to agree to a}} formula to the effect that the French would pursue the same policy in Syria as the British in Baghdad; since Hussein believed that Baghdad would be part of the Arab State, that had eventually satisfied him. Later reports from participants expressed doubts about the precise nature of the discussions {{and the degree to which}} Hussein <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> informed as to the terms of Sykes–Picot.|$|E
25|$|Prussia's {{victory over}} Austria {{increased}} the already existing tensions with France. The Emperor of France, Napoleon III, {{had tried to}} gain territory for France (in Belgium and on the left bank of the Rhine) as a compensation for not joining the war against Prussia and was disappointed by the surprisingly quick outcome of the war. Accordingly, opposition politician Adolphe Thiers claimed that it was France, not Austria, who <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> defeated at Königgrätz. Bismarck, at the same time, did not avoid war with France, though he feared the French {{for a number of}} reasons. First, he feared that Austria, hungry for revenge, would ally with the French. Similarly, he feared that the Russian army would assist France to maintain a balance of power. Still, however, Bismarck believed that if the German states perceived France as the aggressor, they would then unite behind the King of Prussia. To achieve this he kept Napoleon III involved in various intrigues, whereby France might gain territory from Luxembourg or Belgium. France never achieved any such gain, but it was made to look greedy and untrustworthy.|$|E

500|$|A {{committed}} Christian, Booth is an Anglican lay-preacher, {{and often}} invokes religious and ethical arguments while talking about {{issues such as}} sportsmanship. Booth became intensely religious in the 1950s after befriending Pastor Roy Gray, a colleague in district cricket and a classmate at Sydney Teachers College. Gray challenged his friend's faith, and Booth reflected that [...] "Until that point, sport <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> my God". During Booth's career, the media made much of his religious convictions. After scoring his maiden Test century, Booth was asked whether he felt that God was with him. He replied in the affirmative, and the next day, a newspaper printed the headline [...] "England can't win. God is on Brian Booth's side." ...|$|E

This study, however, was still in its preliminary stages {{at the time of the}} trial, and had only been presented as a poster at the International Meeting for Autism Research the year before, and Walker himself warned that [...] "We haven't done anything to demonstrate that the measles virus is causing autism or even causing bowel disease." ...|$|E

500|$|On 7 January 1610, Galileo {{observed}} with his telescope {{what he described}} {{at the time as}} [...] "three fixed stars, totally invisible by their smallness", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it. Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these [...] "stars" [...] relative to Jupiter were changing {{in a way that would}} have been inexplicable if they <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> fixed stars. On 10 January, Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days, he concluded that they were orbiting Jupiter: he had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest moons. He discovered the fourth on 13 January. Galileo named the group of four the Medicean stars, in honour of his future patron, Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Cosimo's three brothers. Later astronomers, however, renamed them Galilean satellites in honour of their discoverer. These satellites are now called Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.|$|E
500|$|On September 12, {{the explorers}} {{resigned}} themselves to wintering {{on the ice}} and camped on a large floe, letting the ice take them where it would, [...] "which", writes Kjellström, [...] "it <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> doing all along" [...] (p.47). Drifting rapidly due south towards Kvitøya, they hurriedly built a winter [...] "home" [...] on the floe against the increasing cold, with walls made of water-reinforced snow to Strindberg's design (see plan, below, left). Observing the rapidity of their drift, Andrée recorded his hopes that they might get far enough south to feed themselves entirely from the sea. However, the floe began to break up directly under the hut on October 2 from the stresses of pressing against Kvitøya, and they were forced to bring their stores on to the island itself, which took a couple of days. [...] "Morale remains good", reports Andrée {{at the very end of}} the coherent part of his diary, which ends: [...] "Med sådana kamrater bör man kunna reda sig under snart sagdt hvilka omständigheter som helst." [...] ("With such comrades one should be able to manage under, I may say, any circumstances".) It is inferred from the incoherent and badly damaged last pages of Andrée's diary that the three men were all dead within a few days of moving onto the island.|$|E
500|$|Espinoza {{positioned}} {{the colt}} {{in third place}} early in the race as Dortmund took the lead, followed closely by Firing Line. The three remained ahead of the pack throughout the race, and broke clear of their rivals entering the straightaway with American Pharoah making a forward move on the outside. The favorite took the lead entering the final furlong and won by a length from Firing Line and Dortmund in 2:03.02, with Frosted finishing strongly in fourth. Espinoza, who won {{the race for the}} third time, said, [...] "I feel like the luckiest Mexican on earth. He has been a special horse since the first time I rode him. He has a lot of talent and is an unbelievable horse. Turning for home I started riding a little bit harder. At the eighth pole I just couldn't put that other horse away, but he got it done." [...] Espinoza's performance attracted some scrutiny as he appeared to have struck the winner 32 times with his whip during the race. In post-race analysis, one of the stewards at Churchill Downs said, [...] "we watched [...] many, many times prior to making it official, and that wasn't anything that got our attention." [...] Baffert said, [...] "He was hitting him on the saddle towel. He doesn't hit that hard." [...] Gary Stevens, rider of second-place Firing Line, commented that he had used his whip heavily as well, stating that the race was [...] "as tough a race as I've been in in 20 years the last eighth of a mile." [...] The Blood-Horse writer Steve Haskin, while condemning whip overuse in general, offered analysis that Espinoza [...] "did a lot of waving with the whip" [...] and may not have actually hit the horse as many times as it seemed. Reflecting on the race, Baffert said that the colt did not bring his [...] "super A-game" [...] to the Derby and that {{it was the first time}} American Pharoah <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> tested by other aggressive horses.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the start}} of the series, the lack of a {{relationship}} with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me and nobody is going to tell me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>been</b> deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said we have to play this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E
2500|$|Before departing for the Peninsula, McClellan {{moved the}} Army of the Potomac to Centreville on a [...] "shakedown" [...] march. He {{discovered}} there how weak Johnston's force and position <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>been,</b> and he faced mounting criticism. On March 11, Lincoln relieved McClellan {{of his position}} as general-in-chief of the Union armies {{so that he could}} devote his full attention to the difficult campaign ahead of him. Lincoln himself, with the assistance of Secretary of War Stanton and a War Board of officers, assumed command of the Union armies for the next four months. The Army of the Potomac began to embark for Fort Monroe on March 17. The departure was accompanied by a newfound sense of concern. The first combat of ironclad ships occurred on March 8 and March 9 as the CSS Virginia and the USS Monitor fought the inconclusive Battle of Hampton Roads. The concern for the Army was that their transport ships would be attacked by this new weapon directly in their path. And the U.S. Navy failed to assure McClellan that they could protect operations on either the James or the York, so his idea of amphibiously enveloping Yorktown was abandoned, and he ordered an advance up the Peninsula to begin April 4. On April 5, McClellan was informed that Lincoln had canceled the movement of Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell's corps to Fort Monroe, taking this action because McClellan had failed to leave the number of troops previously agreed upon at Washington, and because Jackson's Valley Campaign was causing concern. McClellan protested vociferously that he was being forced to lead a major campaign without his promised resources, but he moved ahead anyway.|$|E
