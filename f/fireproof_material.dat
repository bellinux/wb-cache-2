5|$|The North End Halifax {{neighbourhood}} of Richmond {{bore the}} brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative <b>fireproof</b> <b>material,</b> blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. It has now become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.|$|E

This paper summarized the research status methods and distinguishing features of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> in China {{which would make}} progress to our research on <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials.</b> The Research of <b>Fireproof</b> <b>Materials</b> in China With the rapid development of social economy in recent years, many monster high-rise buildings spring {{up all over the}} country. The Chinese technologist gradually realized the importance of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> of fire accident prevention accompanied more and more fire accidents. According to the literature on <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> recently, the research of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> divide into three directions approximately: the classes of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials,</b> the principle of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> and the special applications of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> in different fields [1] 1. 1 The research on class of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> classified various materials which include HPL(Pecorative high-Pressure Lcminate), fire resistant doorsets, fire-resisting wood windows, fire roller shutter, Anti-fire Glass, fireproof storage box, fire-retardant coatings and fire-proof sealing materials. 1. 2 The research on the principle of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> analyzed the flameproof procedures based on principle and prevention measures for preventing even holding back fires though experimentations and theoretical analysis [2] 1. 3 The applied research of dedicated <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> studied the application of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> in different situation. In accordance with different situation and different environmental needs, certain differences also existed in the selection of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> [3 - 4]. The research had revealed the particularity, advantages of various <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> and different application or selection in different situation. The special research of Chinese <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> in many different fields would be more professional in future...|$|R

50|$|A flapper is a {{wildland}} firefighting {{tool that}} resembles a broom or a leaf rake with wide, overlapping metal bristles {{in the form of}} a hand fan. It is also called a swatter or a beater. It is designed for extinguishing minor fires in rural areas such as heaths. A flapper is built with a long handle and a series of lamellae which allows firefighters to stand well back from the fire. The lamellae are constructed in either rubber or steel, though practically any other <b>fireproof</b> <b>material</b> could be used.|$|E
50|$|A {{fireplace}} poker, (also {{known as}} a fire iron) is a short, rigid rod, preferably of <b>fireproof</b> <b>material,</b> used to adjust coal and wood fuel burning in a fireplace, {{and can be used}} to stir up a fire. A fireplace poker is usually metallic and has a point at one end for pushing burning materials (or a hook for pulling/raking, or a combination) and a handle at the opposite end, sometimes with an insulated grip. Iron is the most popular metal from which the pokers are wrought. Brass is a more expensive alternative for a home poker set.|$|E
50|$|For protection, a {{battering}} ram {{was suspended}} in a mobile shelter called a tortoise, or testudo. According to Vegetius, {{it was given}} this name because the ram would swing out of the shelter much like a tortoise’s head comes out of its shell. Such shelters would provide the men within protection against missiles and incendiary devices. They were constructed from a framework of strong timbers with planks and wicker hurdles on the sides. The entire shelter would then be covered with a <b>fireproof</b> <b>material</b> such as uncured hides. According to Apollodorus of Damascus, the shelter should be fixed to the ground while the ram was being used to both prevent skidding and strain on the axles from {{the weight of the}} moving apparatus. This would also increase the strength of the impact on the walls.|$|E

In 1931, Semiluki became the administrative center of Semiluksky District. In July 1942, it was occupied by Nazi Germany. It was liberated on January 25, 1943. A factory of <b>fireproof</b> <b>materials</b> was almost completely destroyed by the Nazis. Town status was granted to Semiluki in 1954.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>fireproofing</b> <b>materials</b> in providing effective protection from fire strongly {{depends on the}} thermophysical properties and {{on the behavior of}} the material during fire exposure. Not only active insulators but also nonactive coatings may undergo significant changes in their structure and properties when exposed to high temperatures. The present study focused on the measurement of some key properties for a set of three reference <b>fireproofing</b> <b>materials</b> of different nature. The changes in morphology and in the physical properties during fire exposure were investigated and they were dramatic for the case of active <b>fireproofing</b> <b>materials.</b> For these materials, the time required to reach a steady-state condition in the heat transfer may be significant. The use of a simple heat-transfer model, based on the experimental data obtained for the reference materials studied, demonstrated the importance of accounting for changes in the physical properties, paving the way to further applications in advanced studies of the fireproofing performance in complex geometries and critical scenarios...|$|R

[...] Romero eventually had {{to pull out of}} the production, as he was busy with Monkey Shines. As stipulated by King when selling the rights to Paramount, Pet Sematary was shot in Maine where the story was set. The house used for the Creeds' home is a private residence near Hancock, while Jud's house across the street was actually a facade constructed around an existing house that was insulated with <b>fireproof</b> <b>material</b> for film's climax. Other locations included an abandoned granite quarry on Mount Desert Island in Acadia National Park, where the burial ground was constructed, a forest near Ellsworth for the pet sematary, and Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor for the graveyard scenes.|$|E
50|$|Distillation was {{performed}} by a process akin to charcoal burning, involving the entire village in a group effort. A large, shallow conical pit was dug, 100 feet (30 m) in diameter and lined with clay. A central drain was constructed, with an underground lined drain leading outwards to a collection pit beyond the burning pit. This drain was protected by a strainer dome to avoid ash entering the tar drain and to separate the burning bark from the flammable tar. The pit was then stacked with carefully arranged layers of birch bark, above an insulating and filtering layer of linden husks. The bark was very carefully stacked, {{so that there was}} no airspace between layers and so combustion could be controlled. A completed pit might be filled ten or twenty feet high (3-6 m). An airtight cover of earth, animal dung and damp <b>fireproof</b> <b>material</b> was placed over the pit, {{in the manner of a}} charcoal clamp. A fire of straw was then lit in the centre, spreading slowly outwards into the birch bark.|$|E

5000|$|Reconstruction {{was based}} on 1961 {{drawings}} of the old cathedral by the Historic American Buildings Survey. This facilitated building a replica to the same measurements at the same location, but with modern <b>fireproof</b> <b>material</b> in its construction. The materials used {{in the construction of}} the new cathedral consisted of concrete and steel with vinyl siding duplicating the original finish, roof covering of asphalt shingles (bitumen-soaked paper covered with aggregate) and copper for the roofing of the domes. The Cathedral of St. Michael was re-consecrated in 1978. The old Chapel of St. John the Baptist (The Precursor) was renamed in honor of St. Innocent Veniaminov of Alaska. All of the icons and religious artifacts were donated by wealthy Russians and Imperial government officials in the early 19th century; those saved from the fire were reinstalled in the new cathedral in the same order that had existed in the original building. Its frontage is in the form of a Greek cross with a bell tower, which was [...] "neither Byzantine nor Gothic”. Similar churches are stated to exist in St Petersburg, in an architectural style dated to late 18th century and early 19th century. It has two domes and one is above the sanctum of the cross.|$|E
5000|$|With {{almost two}} dozen layers, TransHab's foot-thick {{inflatable}} shell is a marvel of innovative design. The layers are fashioned {{to break up}} particles of space debris and tiny meteorites that may hit the shell with a speed seven {{times as fast as}} a bullet. The outer layers protect multiple inner bladders, made of a material that holds in the module's air. The shell also provides insulation from temperatures in space that can range from +121°C (+250°F) in sunlight to -128°C (-200°F) in the shade.The key to the debris protection is successive layers of Nextel, a material commonly used as insulation under the hoods of many cars, spaced between several-inches-thick layers of open cell foam, similar to foam used for chair cushions on Earth. The Nextel and foam layers cause a particle to shatter as it hits, losing more and more of its energy as it penetrates deeper.Many layers into the shell is a layer of super-strong woven Kevlar that holds the module's shape.

50|$|This structure, and the International {{style in}} which it was built had {{enormous}} influences on American architecture. One of the style's characteristic traits was to express or articulate the structure of buildings externally. It was a style that argued that the functional utility of the building’s structural elements when made visible, could supplant a formal decorative articulation; and more honestly converse with the public than any system of applied ornamentation.A building's structural elements should be visible, Mies thought. The Seagram Building, like virtually all large buildings of the time, was built of a steel frame, from which non-structural glass walls were hung. Mies would have preferred the steel frame to be visible to all; however, American building codes required that all structural steel be covered in a <b>fireproof</b> <b>material,</b> usually concrete, because improperly protected steel columns or beams may soften and fail in confined fires. Concrete hid the structure of the building — something Mies wanted to avoid at all costs — so Mies used non-structural bronze-toned I-beams to suggest structure instead. These are visible from the outside of the building, and run vertically, like mullions, surrounding the large glass windows. This method of construction using an interior reinforced concrete shell to support a larger non-structural edifice has since become commonplace. As designed, the building used 1,500 tons of bronze in its construction.|$|E

5000|$|Construction of the Xanadu {{house in}} Kissimmee, Florida, {{began with the}} pouring of a {{concrete}} slab base and the erection of a tension ring 40 ft in diameter to anchor the domed roof of {{what would become the}} [...] "Great Room" [...] of the house. A pre-shaped vinyl balloon was formed and attached to the ring, and then inflated by air pressure from large fans. Once the form was fully inflated, its surface was sprayed with quick-hardening polyurethane plastic foam. The foam, produced by the sudden mixture of two chemicals that expand on contact to 30 times their original volume, hardened almost instantly. Repeated spraying produced a five-to-six-inch-thick structurally sound shell within a few hours. Once the foam cured, the plastic balloon form was removed to be used again. Once the second dome was completed and the balloon form removed, the two rooms were joined together by wire mesh which was also sprayed with foam to form a connecting gallery or hall. This process was repeated until the house was complete. Window, skylight, and door openings were cut and the frames foamed into place. Finally, the interior of the entire structure was sprayed with a 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) coating of <b>fireproof</b> <b>material</b> that also provided a smooth, easy-to-clean finish for walls and ceilings. The exterior was given a coat of white elastomeric paint as the final touch.|$|E
50|$|Suddenly, Pontiac was a boom town. People flooded in {{and money}} for {{improvements}} was available. In 1856 Pontiac was officially incorporated. By 1866 {{the people of}} Livingston County could afford to spend $18,000 to construct a new stone jail in Pontiac. In 1870 the state established the Reform School at Pontiac. It {{was to be a}} model correctional institution for boys. Jesse W. Fell donated sixty-four acres, valued at $10,000, and more land was purchased. Livingston County issued $50,000 in bonds. The town of Pontiac added another $25,000 in bonds and the first buildings were constructed. In 1892 this facility became the Illinois State Reformatory and is now the Pontiac Correctional Center. In 1870 a fire destroyed $50,000 worth of buildings in downtown Pontiac and, like many Illinois towns, the town fathers, spurred on by insurance companies, created a “fire district,” a zone in the commercial part of the city where buildings had to be constructed of brick or some other <b>fireproof</b> <b>material.</b> These districts make Pontiac a classic example of one of the key visual features of the American Midwest: towns with brick commercial districts surrounded by wooden residences. Rebuilding was rapid. Growth continued. In 1871 The Chicago and Paducah Railroad was built with the aid of local bonds. By 1877 the new railroad was doing $21,600 worth of business, while the older Chicago and Alton Railroad was handling $61,578 worth of goods. A second and larger courthouse was built. During Independence Day celebrations on 4 July 1874, stray fireworks started a blaze which burned the courthouse, the Union Block, and the Phoenix Block. Undaunted, Livingston County set out to find the best possible architect to design a new and more splendid building. They settled on J.C. Cochrane, known for his work on the Capitol building in Springfield and for the Richland County courthouse. The building was finished in 1875 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.|$|E
