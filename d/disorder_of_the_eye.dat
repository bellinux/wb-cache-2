40|$|Abstract. Glaucoma is {{a serious}} {{progressive}} degenerative <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> {{that leads to the}} continuous loss of retinal ganglion cells.

The results of the study indicated that Salvia miltiorrhiza extracts were unable to prevent intraocular pressure increase in the laser-induced glaucoma model, but the treatment did reduce cell loss during glaucoma progression. Therefore, the results provide the basis {{for the development of a}} novel therapeutic agent that exhibits neuroprotective effects against glaucoma.

40|$|Dry {{eye disease}} (DED) is a common, {{debilitating}} <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> affecting more than 25 % {{of all people}} in the United States. In a comprehensive report, the dry eye workshop (DEWS) committee firmly established an essential role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of dry eye [1]. In autoimmune-mediated diseases like Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), exocrinopathy of the lacrimal gland leads to aqueous-defi-cient dry eye, known clinically as keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). KCS {{is among the most}} common and debilitating clinical manifestations of SS, and as it progresses, the eye develops pathological characteristics that include (i) trans-differentiation of the ocular surface from a nonkeratinized, mucus-secreting epithelium to one that is pathologically keratinized and “skin-like ” and (ii) altered glycosylation and loss of goblet cells (GCs). This process, known as squamous metaplasia (SQM), is a devastating, end-stage consequence of dry eye disease that can cause considerable morbidity as advanced keratinization couples with subepithelial fibrosis to cause corneal opacification and blindness. Although immune-mediated inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of KCS and the development of SQM, little i...|$|E

40|$|Background: Waardenburg {{syndrome}} (WS) {{is a rare}} hereditary disorder essentially characterised by deafness and pigment <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{hair and}} skin. Method: Between October 2010 and December 2011, we identified six patients with WS during an aetiological survey of 582 deaf participants recruited in schools for the deaf and ear, nose and throat outpatient clinics in seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ten regions <b>of</b> Cameroon. Two classic characteristics of WS were used as diagnostic criteria: deafness and pigmentation abnormalities (heterochromia iridis, white forelock and depigmented skin patches). In addition, to identify dystopia canthorum, a sign of WS type I, we calculated the W-index. Results: WS comprised 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole sample, 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic cases, and 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic syndromic cases. All patients with WS had severe to profound congenital sensorineural and symmetrical hearing loss with flat audiograms. They also had pigment <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and <b>the</b> skin. In <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> dystopia canthorum, they were all classified as having WS type II. The pedigree was suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance in two cases, and the four others seemed to be de novo cases. Conclusion. The results suggest that WS type II {{is the most common}} syndromic form of hearing loss among Cameroonians. This has implications for retrospective genetic counselling and hearing tests for earlier management in affected families...|$|R

40|$|Darier disease (DD) is an {{autosomal}} dominant genodermatosis caused by mutations in ATP 2 A 2 and characterized by multiple warty papules coalescing in seborrheic areas and specific histological skin changes. Rare patients are described with variable bone involvement, but this association {{has never been}} sufficiently emphasized. Aniridia is a developmental <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> due to heterozygous mutations in PAX 6.

Here, we describe a 14 -year-old girl showing the unique combination of DD, multiple bone cysts, and bilateral aniridia. Molecular investigations demonstrated that such a complex phenotype is due to double de novo heterozygous mutations in ATP 2 A 2 and PAX 6. Review of the literature indicates that, in DD, bone cysts are true developmental abnormalities of the skeleton. This finding suggests a role for ATP 2 A 2 in bone biology. More systematic studies are expected in order to estimate the true prevalence of bone cysts in DD {{and the relationship between}} skeletal changes and ATP 2 A 2 perturbatio...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the possibility of}} genetic involvement in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Although ROP is most often associated with low birthweight and low gestational age, these factors do not necessarily predict the severity of ROP. The possible involvement of other factors, including genetic variants, has been considered. Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a hereditary vitreoretinal disorder with clinical manifestations {{similar to those of}} ROP. Three genes involving the wingless/int 1 (Wnt) receptor signaling pathway—FZD 4 for frizzled 4, LRP 5 for low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5, and ND for Norrie disease protein—are associated with the development of FEVR. Methods: In the present study, 17 Japanese patients with advanced ROP were screened for these three candidate genes of FEVR. Genomic DNA from each patient was subjected to PCR and direct sequencing of the ND, FZD 4, and LRP 5 genes. Results: One patient had a heterozygous mutation in the 5 ′ untranslated region of the ND gene. Another had a leucine insertion in the signal peptide of LRP 5. None showed any mutation in FZD 4. Conclusions: These findings suggest that genetic changes in the Wnt receptor signaling pathway associate to the development of advanced ROP.

40|$|Two female {{neonates}} {{were diagnosed}} post partum with bilateral aniridia. The first patient had the familial form, {{caused by a}} point mutation in the paired box 6 (PAX 6) gene. The second patient had a sporadic aniridia caused by a de novo microdeletion involving both the PAX 6 gene {{as well as the}} Wilms tumour suppressor-I (WT 1) gene. This made screening for the presence of a Wilms tumour necessary. The second patient died several months after birth, due to respiratory insufficiency. Aniridia is a rare developmental <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> with absence of most of the iris tissue, caused by an abnormality in the PAX 6 gene on chromosome 11 p 13. Familial aniridia is usually due to a point mutation of the PAX 6 gene, which causes solely ocular abnormalities. Sporadic aniridia is caused by a de novo deletion or microdeletion of chromosome 11 p 13, which affects not only the PAX 6 gene but also the adjacent WT 1 gene. In these patients, the Wilms tumour, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation (WAGR) syndrome can be present, and screening for a Wilms tumour is indicated. Unless previous investigation of a family member has demonstrated the WT 1 gene to be normal, chromosome studies should always be performed in patients with aniridia...|$|E
