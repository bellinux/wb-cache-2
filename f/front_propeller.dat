500|$|The An-70 is a {{monoplane}} with a high-mounted wing {{design that}} features four distinctive propfan engines. Designed by the Progress Design Bureau, {{each of the}} D-27 engines is rated at 13,800shp (which can be uprated to 16,000shp), {{which is used to}} drive the SV-27 [...] contra-rotating scimitar propellers designed by Aerosila; eight on the <b>front</b> <b>propeller</b> and six on the aft propeller. The propfan engines deliver slipstream to the supercritical wings that feature double-slotted trailing edges to provide high lift coefficients at low speeds. The modernisation of the aircraft during 2010–12 saw upgrades to the engines, including the incorporation of FADEC, and the further separation of the two propellers. The aircraft's cruise speed is 750km/h (405kt) at an operational altitude of Antonov claimed in 1997 that the aircraft had a design maximum speed of 850km/h (460kt, or Mach0.8), which would have compared favourably with Mach0.77 of the larger turbofan-powered C-17. According to DASA's evaluation, the propfan engines were 10percent more efficient than conventional turboprops.|$|E

In 1941, a full-sized fuselage mockup was constructed in order to evaluate the interior layout. The fuselage was streamlined, having a round cross-section, with the interior consisting of two decks.

50|$|The Cierva C.6 {{prototype}} {{was fitted}} with ailerons mounted on two small wings, also with elevators and a rudder. This complete three-axis control scheme was needed because the pilot had only limited {{control over the}} rotor. Only the <b>front</b> <b>propeller</b> was powered, so this aircraft could not hover, and could lose control at low speed. The vertical axis rotor spun freely; the faster the autogyro flew, the faster the rotor would spin and the greater lift it produced.|$|E
50|$|The initial Nomad design (E.125) or Nomad 3 was {{incredibly}} complex, almost two engines in one. One was a turbo-supercharged two-stroke diesel, having some resemblance {{to half of}} a Napier Sabre. Mounted below this were the rotating parts of a turboprop engine, based on the Naiad design, the output of which drove the <b>front</b> <b>propeller</b> of a contra-rotating pair. To achieve higher boost, the crankshaft drove a centrifugal supercharger, which also provided the scavenging needed for starting the engine from rest. During take-off additional fuel was injected into the rear turbine stage for more power, and turned off once the aircraft was cruising.|$|E

50|$|A {{properly}} equipped C-Series half-ton class pickup could tow up to 8,000 lbs (4 tons) of braked trailer, while {{a properly}} equipped C-Series three quarter-ton or one-ton class pickup could tow up to 12,000 lbs (6 tons) of braked trailer. Adding four-wheel drive reduced towing capability {{due to increased}} curb weight, which resulted from additional driveline components (transfer case, front axle, front differential, <b>front</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft, and so on) needed to facilitate four-wheel drive. A properly equipped K-Series half-ton or three quarter-ton class pickup could tow up to 6,500 lbs (3.25 tons) of braked trailer, whilst a properly equipped K-Series one-ton class pickup could tow 500 lbs more, up to 7,000 lbs (3.5 tons) of braked trailer.|$|E
5000|$|One {{problem with}} scaling up any piston engine design is that {{eventually}} a point is reached where the crankshaft becomes a major engineering challenge. This {{was a problem}} that affected almost all engines of the [...] class, including BMW's own 18-cylinder BMW 802 project. For the 803 the engineers decided to avoid this problem by simply not using a common crankshaft, and driving a set of independent contra-rotating propellers. The front engine drove the <b>front</b> <b>propeller</b> directly, while the rear engine drove a number of smaller shafts that passed between the cylinders of the front engine before being geared back together to drive the rear prop. This layout resulted in a rather large gearbox {{on the front of}} the engine, and the front engine needing an extended shaft to [...] "clear" [...] the gearbox.|$|E

50|$|Conventional {{four-wheel drive}} pickups {{featured}} manual locking hubs and a two-speed dual range New Process 205 transfer case with four drive modes: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, while Four High yielded a locked 50:50 torque split. Four Low applied reduction gearing. The <b>front</b> and rear <b>propeller</b> shafts were locked {{at all times}} in Four High and Four Low. Neutral allowed for flat towing, or use of the power take off (PTO).|$|R
5000|$|The Ca.3 was a three-engined biplane {{of wooden}} construction, with a fabric-covered frame. The crew of four {{were placed in}} an open central nacelle (front gunner, two pilots and rear gunner-mechanic). The rear gunner manned upper machine guns, {{standing}} upon the central engine in a protective [...] "cage" [...] in <b>front</b> of a <b>propeller.</b> The fixed conventional undercarriage had double mainwheels under each engine and a tailskid under the extreme tail of each boom. A substantial double nosewheel prevented damaging and dangerous noseovers.|$|R
50|$|The {{demand for}} {{increasing}} power ratings could first be answered with larger rudderpropellers. Limits {{were set to}} this trend by mechanical stress {{and the fact that}} with an increasing propeller diameter, the draft of the vessel inevitably increases. Schottel therefore developed a thruster where the required power is divided between two counter-rotating thrusters that share a single shaft. The Twin Propeller is equipped with a pull propeller and a push propeller. The vortex street of the <b>front</b> pull <b>propeller</b> passes between the blades of the rear push propeller without impeding it. Contraction of the slip stream in the pull propeller means that more water reaches the push propeller from the sides. The strut is equipped with a fin, thus the swirl energy generated in the propeller stream is recovered. Additionally, the flow around the fins creates a lift component in the thrust direction, which has a thrust-enhancing effect.|$|R
