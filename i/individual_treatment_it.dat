40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} a hyposmotic shock and {{extracellular}} ATP on the efflux of K+(Rb+) from human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB- 231 and MCF- 7) has been examined. A hyposmotic shock increased the fractional efflux of K+(Rb+) from MDA-MB- 231 cells via a pathway which was unaffected by Cl− replacement. Apamin, charybdotoxin or removing extracellular Ca 2 + {{had no effect on}} volume-activated K+(Rb+) efflux MDA-MB- 231 cells. An osmotic shock also stimulated K+(Rb+) efflux from MCF- 7 cells but to a much lesser extent than found with MDA-MB- 231 cells. ATP-stimulated K+(Rb+) efflux from MDA-MB- 231 cells in a dose-dependent fashion but had little effect on K+(Rb+) release from MCF- 7 cells. ATP-stimulated K+(Rb+) efflux was only inhibited slightly by replacing Cl− with NO 3 −. Removal of external Ca 2 + during treatment with ATP reduced the fractional efflux of K+(Rb+) in a manner suggesting a role for cellular Ca 2 + stores. Charybdotoxin, but neither apamin nor iberiotoxin, inhibited ATP-stimulated K+(Rb+) release from MDA-MB- 231 cells. Suramin inhibited the ATP-activated efflux of K+(Rb+). UTP also stimulated K+(Rb+) efflux from MDA-MB- 231 cells whereas ADP, AMP and adenosine were without effect. A combination of an osmotic shock and ATP increased the fractional efflux of K+(Rb+) to a level greater than the sum of the <b>individual</b> <b>treatments.</b> <b>It</b> appears that the hyposmotically-activated and ATP-stimulated K+ efflux pathways are separate entities.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{compare the}} effects of pelvic floor muscle {{training}} (PFMT) performed during group treatment sessions (GT) and <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> sessions (<b>IT)</b> to a control group (CG) of women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). HypothesisThe group treatment sessions would have better effects compared to <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> sessions. Study designThis randomized controlled pilot study included women aged over 18 years, who complained of urinary leakage on stress and who had not undergone physical therapy for SUI before. Forty-nine women were randomly allocated to the PFMT in group treatment session (GT) (n= 17), PFMT in <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> session (<b>IT)</b> (n= 17) and control group (CG) (n= 15). The study {{was carried out in}} an outpatient physical therapy department in São Carlos, Brazil. Subjects on intervention groups were treated with the same PFMT protocol for 6 weeks, with two 1 -h weekly sessions. The GT group carried out the PFMT in group <b>treatment</b> session and <b>IT</b> group in <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> session. The CG did not receive any treatment during the corresponding time. They were evaluated before and after treatment for primary outcome, urinary loss, and secondary outcomes, King's Health Questionnaire, pressure perineometry, pelvic floor muscle strength by digital palpation and subjective satisfaction. Participants, evaluator and the physical therapist were not blinded. Forty-five women completed the study and were included in the analysis. The statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon test for intragroup analysis and Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney test for intergroup analysis (p< 0. 05). ResultsIn intragroup analysis, there was a significant reduction in urinary loss measured by pad test only in the IT group. For primary outcome, {{there was a significant difference}} only after treatment between GT and CG (p< 0. 0001; effect size − 0. 91; 95 % confidence interval from 0. 56 to 5. 80) as well as between IT and CG (p< 0. 0001; effect size − 0. 90; 95 % confidence interval from 0. 54 to 5. 84). There were differences after treatment in GT and IT groups for secondary outcomes: perineometry, muscle strength and in the domains of the quality of life questionnaire. For the CG group, there were not significant differences in any variables. In intergroup analysis for all variables, there were no differences between GT and IT groups. The two treated groups had similar subjective satisfaction (86 %). There were no complaints of adverse effects due to treatment from either group.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of various processing <b>treatments</b> (<b>individual</b> and combination) on iron, β-carotene, phytic acid, polyphenols and ash content of pearl millet (Pennisetum americanam). Grains were subjected to soaking, pressure cooking, steaming, malting, pearling and extrusion cooking for different time intervals such as soaking for 3, 6, 9 and 12  h; steaming for 5, 10, 15 and 20  min; pressure cooking for 2, 5, 7 and 10  min; controlled germination (malting) for 12, 18, 24, 36, 40, 46 and 52  h along with three combinations of treatments. Data revealed that phytic acid was reduced maximum (38. 23 %) by malting, whereas polyphenols (49. 28 %) and ash content (22. 09 %) were decreased maximum by pressure cooking. Loss of β-carotene and iron was also higher (29. 79, and 16. 03 %, respectively) during pressure cooking in comparison to other processing methods. However, combined treatments showed higher retention of β-carotene and iron with more reduction of anti-nutrients over the <b>individual</b> <b>treatments.</b> Overall, <b>it</b> can be concluded that combination of domestic treatments is a better approach in improving the nutritional profile of pearl millet, which can be consumed directly or as one of the ingredients for formulations like weaning foods, bakery products, etc...|$|R

In this study, we present a conceptual framework for estimating <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> effects, referred to as predicted <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> effects.

It is shown, that the treatment sequences PN+EBH+PVD and EBH+PN+PVD are suitable for improving material properties. These multi-combined surface treatments lead to a significant improvement in load-supporting capacity. Critical load values of cohesive failure measured by scratch tests are tripled {{when compared to the}} <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> of PVD, and increased by at least 20 % in comparison to the duplex treatments of EBH+PVD or PN+PVD. The metallurgical compatibility of the single treatments is essential for the success of combined treatments.

Based on the model wear-test assembly block-on-cylinder, it was proved, that the specific wear rate of multi-combined treated specimens is reduced about 20 - 50 % while wear of counterpart components is decreased as well.

40|$|Abstract: A {{recent study}} of the {{relationship}} between spiritual experience and psychopathology (reported in detail elsewhere) suggested that psychotic phenomena could occur in the context of spiritual experiences rather than mental illness. In the present paper, this finding is illustrated with three detailed case histories. Its implications are then explored for psychopathology, for psychiatric classification, and for our understanding of the concept of mental illness. It is argued that pathological and spiritual psychotic phenomena cannot be distinguished by 1) form and content alone (as in traditional psychopathology), 2) by their relationship either with other symptoms or with pathological causes (as in psychiatric classification), or 3) by reference to the descriptive criteria of mental illness implied by the "medical " model. The distinction is shown to depend, rather, on the way in which psychotic phenomena themselves are embedded in the values and beliefs of the person concerned. This in turn is shown to have implications for diagnosis (it shows the need for clinicians to attend to the values and beliefs of <b>individual</b> patients), for <b>treatment</b> (<b>it</b> points to a cognitive problem-solving model), and for research in psychopathology (especially as related to the emerging sciences of dynamic brain imaging and cognitive neuroscience) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of Council Regulation (ECC) 2377 / 90, German {{agriculture}} has been se-verely affected by stringent restrictions concerning the use of medications in animals reared for human consumption. In commercial fish production, legal administration has been limited to a few desinfectants and antibiotic drugs. Currently, no permitted antiparasitic drug is available to treat fish stock threatened by endogenous parasites. After demonstrating the detrimental effects of fish-pathogenic parasites on commer-cial fish production by examining an exemplary fish-rearing facility, this paper contin-ues to investigate alternative, non chemical ways to effectively disrupt parasitic life cycles in an economic fashion. Using different diagnostic procedures, numerous parasite species are identified in a fish-rearing facility in Saxony. The trematode Bucephalus polymorphus is quickly found to be causing reoccurring fish-mortality in the aforementioned facility because of its high intensities in examined fish and invertebrate hosts. It can be shown that B. polymorphus is able to survive several years in its 1 st intermediate host, zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. Exposing different species of fish to cercariae of B. polymorphus demonstrates varying susceptibility rates among investigated spe-cies. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and several cyprinid species show high susceptibilities. The role of pike perch (Sander lucioperca) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) as final hosts of the infection is investigated. After feeding on infected fish, adult trematodes are detected in the digestive tract of all examined pike perch, whereas none of the perch receiving a similar diet can be diagnosed with a B. - polymorphus- infection. To develop a practical anti parasitic treatment of the facilities´ production water which is taken from a nearby reservoir, three non chemical water treatments are examined for their effectiveness against B. - polymorphus- cercariae in the laboratory. An impact resulting from pouring suspended cercariae from a height of 36 to 200 cm leads to injury and death of a proportion of exposed individuals. Exposure to ultra-sonic waves with specific energy inputs of 0, 0005 to 0, 001 kWh/ l results in cercarial mortalities ranging from 60 to 100 %. After being submitted to ultraviolet light at a dose of 1800 to 2850 J/ m 2, examined cercariae show slightly reduced activity. Field trials with carp (Cyprinus carpio) and rainbow trout (O. mykiss) demonstrate that ultrasonic treatment with a specific energy input of 0, 000652 kWh/ l {{as well as an}} exposure of production water to ultraviolet light at a dose of 58 J/ m 2 can potentially be used to reduce infections with B. polymorphus. The aforementioned findings are compared to additional potential treatment possibili-ties (ozonation, filtration, use of electric current and biological manipulation). All pro-cedures are then discussed concerning their sustainability, economic efficiency and ecological tolerability. Summarizing the <b>individual</b> <b>treatments</b> <b>it</b> is concluded that none can be unrestrictedly recommended to treat all of the production water in a cost-efficient and effective manner. Consequentially, periodic cleaning and disinfection are shown to still be the primary means to limit parasitic infections of commercial fish populations by reducing the number of host organisms in the fish's vicinity. Additionally, a time-limited water treatment of single production-subunits holding the most susceptible fish species us-ing UV- doses of > 400 J/ m 2 is recommended to treat waterborne parasitic stages {{at the time of their}} highest occurrence. UV-lamps are mobile, their use affects numer-ous parasitic stages and is comparatively cost-effective. The treatment facilities can be maintained by staff members. In case of a malfunction, only single subunits which can easily be sanitised are affected. Furthermore, the use of ultraviolet light involves low hazard risks and has no negative impact on water parameters. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Ten-year {{fracture}} {{risk assessment}} with the fracture risk assessment system (FRAX) is increasingly used to guide treatment decisions. Osteoporosis pharmacotherapy reduces fracture risk, {{but the effect}} is greater than can be explained from the increase in bone mineral density (BMD). Whether this invalidates fracture predictions with FRAX is uncertain. A total of 35, 764 women (age ≥ 50 years) and baseline BMD testing (1996 – 2007) had FRAX probabilities retroactively calculated. A provincial pharmacy database was used to identify osteoporosis medication use. Women were categorized as untreated, current high adherence users [medication possession ratio (MPR) ≥ 0. 80 in the year after BMD testing], current low adherence users (MPR < 0. 80), and past users. Fractures outcomes to 10 years were established form a population-based health data repository. FRAX and femoral neck BMD alone stratified major osteoporotic and hip fracture risk within untreated and each treated subgroup (all p-values < 0. 001) with similar area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In untreated and each treated subgroup, a stepwise gradient in observed 10 -year major osteoporotic and hip fracture incidence was found {{as a function of}} the predicted probability tertile (all p-values < 0. 001 for linear trend). Concordance (calibration) plots for major osteoporotic fractures and hip fractures showed good agreement between the predicted and observed 10 -year fracture incidence in untreated women and each treated subgroup. Only in the highest risk tertile of women highly adherent to at least 5 years of bisphosphonate use was observed hip fracture risk significantly less than predicted, though major osteoporotic fracture risk was similar to predicted. In summary, this work suggests that the FRAX tool can be used to predict fracture probability in women currently or previously treated for osteoporosis.
