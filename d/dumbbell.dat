5|$|In 2012, MDOT {{announced}} a construction project along the US23/US223 freeway in southern Monroe County what would rebuild the northbound lanes of the freeway between exits1 and 5 {{in addition to}} improving the interchange ramps in the area. The interchange between US223 the freeway at exit5 will also be upgraded to contain a pair of roundabouts in a configuration known as a <b>dumbbell</b> interchange.|$|E
5|$|An {{interchange}} {{is planned}} between MD 12 and US 113 south of Snow Hill {{in order to}} improve safety and traffic flow as a follow up to widening US 113; however, the project is currently on hold. This proposed interchange is to be a <b>dumbbell</b> interchange, a variation of the diamond interchange with two roundabouts on MD 12 where it intersects the ramps to US 113. The proposed cost needed to build this interchange is $24.2 million, which includes engineering, acquisition of land, and the actual construction.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{closed the}} {{southbound}} ramps of the interchange between the BaltimoreWashington Parkway and Arundel Mills Boulevard starting Monday, May 7, 2012. The closure {{was for the}} expedited replacement of the existing <b>dumbbell</b> interchange with Maryland's first diverging diamond interchange. The new interchange was part of $5 million in road upgrades being funded by the Cordish Company ahead of the June 6 opening of the company's Maryland Live! development, which features a casino, near Arundel Mills. The new interchange opened on June 11.|$|E
40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{properties of}} spherical tracers coupled through a repulsive potential {{to a system}} of active <b>dumbbells</b> are analyzed. We model the dumbbells' dynamics with Langevin equations and the activity with a self-propulsive force of constant magnitude directed along the main axis of the molecules. Two types of tracers are considered. Thermal tracers are coupled to the same bath as the <b>dumbbells</b> while athermal tracers are not; both interact repulsively with the <b>dumbbells.</b> We focus our attention on the intruders' mean square displacement and how it compares to the one of the <b>dumbbells.</b> We show that the dynamics of thermal intruders, with mass similar to the one of the <b>dumbbells,</b> display the typical four time-lag regimes of the dumbbells' mean square displacement. The thermal tracers' late-time diffusion coefficient depends on their mass very weakly and it is close to the one of the <b>dumbbells</b> at low Péclet only. Athermal tracers only have ballistic and late-time diffusive regimes. The late time diffusion coefficients of athermal tracers and <b>dumbbells</b> have similar values at high Péclet number when their masses are of the same order, while at low Péclet number this coefficient gets close to the one of the <b>dumbbells</b> only when the tracers are several order of magnitude heavier than the <b>dumbbells.</b> We propose a generalization of the Enskog law for dilute hard disks, that describes the athermal tracers' mean square displacement {{in the form of a}} scaling law in terms of their mass...|$|R
40|$|Assembly and {{directed}} orientation of anisotropic particles with an external ac electric field {{in a range}} from 1 kHz to 2 MHz were studied for asymmetric composite <b>dumbbells</b> incorporating a silica, titania, or titania/silica (titania:silica = 75 : 25 vol %) sphere. The asymmetric composite <b>dumbbells,</b> which were composed of a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) -coated sphere (core−shell part) and a polystyrene (PSt) lobe, were synthesized with a soap-free emulsion polymerization to prepare PMMA-coated inorganic spheres and another soap-free emulsion polymerization to form a polystyrene (PSt) lobe from the PMMA-coated inorganic spheres. The composite <b>dumbbells</b> dispersed in water were directly observed with optical microscopy. The <b>dumbbells</b> incorporating a silica sphere oriented parallel to an electric field in the whole frequency range and they formed a pearl chain structure at a high frequency of 2 MHz. The titania-incorporated <b>dumbbells</b> formed chain structures, in which they contacted their core−shell parts and oriented perpendicularly to a low-frequency (kHz) field, whereas they oriented parallel to a high-frequency (MHz) field. Since the alignment of <b>dumbbells</b> in the chains depends {{not only on the}} interparticle forces but also on the torque that the induced dipoles in the <b>dumbbells</b> experience in the electric field, the orientation of <b>dumbbells</b> perpendicular to the electric field was the case dominated by the interparticle force, whereas the other orientation was the case dominated by the torque. The present experiments show that the incorporation of inorganic <b>dumbbells</b> is an effective way to control the assembled structure and orientation with an electric field...|$|R

5|$|Haumea {{displays}} large {{fluctuations in}} brightness {{over a period}} of 3.9 hours, which can only be explained by a rotational period of this length. This is faster than any other known equilibrium body in the Solar System, and indeed faster than any other known body larger than 100 km in diameter. While most rotating bodies in equilibrium are flattened into oblate spheroids, Haumea rotates so quickly that it is distorted into a triaxial ellipsoid. If Haumea were to rotate much more rapidly, it would distort itself into a <b>dumbbell</b> shape and split in two. This rapid rotation is thought to have been caused by the impact that created its satellites and collisional family.|$|E
5|$|MD32 heads {{west from}} Odenton along the {{southern}} edge of Fort George G. Meade. The freeway has a <b>dumbbell</b> interchange with MD198 (Laurel Fort Meade Road) just north of Tipton Airport. MD32 curves northwest and has an interchange with Samford Road, which is one of two interchanges that provide access to the NSA. The median of MD32 widens at the interchange as the eastbound ramps enter and exit on the left to a roundabout, from which Samford Road crosses the westbound lanes of MD32. Immediately to the north of a trumpet interchange with Canine Road, which provides access to the NSA, the National Vigilance Park, and the National Cryptologic Museum, the freeway has a cloverleaf interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway.|$|E
5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals {{come in a variety of}} shapes-sphere, <b>dumbbell,</b> torus, etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.|$|E

5|$|M-81 {{starts at}} a {{junction}} with M-13, {{with the two}} directions of each highway separated by a median. This central feature ends for M-81 immediately east of the intersection as the highway runs east out of Saginaw. The trunkline follows Washington Road easterly through residential subdivisions to an interchange with I-75/US23 in an industrial area of Buena Vista Township. This interchange, exit151 along the freeway, is built with roundabouts {{on either side of}} the bridge that carries Washington Road over the freeway in a variant of the diamond interchange design called a <b>dumbbell</b> interchange. After leaving the industrial properties on the east side of I-75/US23, M-81 follows Washington Road through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. North of the community of Arthur, the highway intersects M-15 (Vassar Road). Further east, M-81 crosses out of Saginaw County; across the border in Tuscola County, the highway follows Saginaw Road.|$|E
5|$|MD 198 curves {{northeast}} and meets {{the northern end}} of MD 197 (Laurel Bowie Road) before crossing the Patuxent River, where the route leaves the city of Laurel and enters Anne Arundel County. The highway, now named Laurel Fort Meade Road, passes one of the main entrances to Laurel Park Racecourse and passes through Maryland City. MD 198 drops to four lanes at its partial cloverleaf interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295) and then becomes a two-lane road a short distance east of the interchange. The state highway crosses the Little Patuxent River, then curves southeast and expands to a four-lane divided highway as it parallels MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). At the entrance to Tipton Airport, MD 198 curves north and meets MD 32 at a <b>dumbbell</b> interchange. The highway passes through an S-curve then reaches its northern terminus at an entrance to Fort Meade. The road continues into the military installation as Mapes Road.|$|E
5|$|Maryland and Delaware plan to {{continue}} to upgrade US 113 to introduce freeway elements and access control to improve service on the U.S. Highway. MDSHA has a Phase 5 in its US 113 divided highway project {{for the construction of}} an interchange between US113 and MD12 in Snow Hill. As of 2007, the interchange was planned to be a <b>dumbbell</b> interchange, a variation on the diamond interchange with roundabouts replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the crossroad. The work would include adding service roads to improve access among US 113, MD 12, Washington Street, and Brick Kiln Road. , Phase 5 was stalled in the design stage with no estimated completion date. The state has long-term plans to establish partial control of access on US 113 between Pocomoke City and {{the south end of the}} Snow Hill bypass. Once that project is complete, the only remaining stretch of US 113 in Maryland without access controls will be from Hayes Landing Road to the south end of the Berlin bypass.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} and phase behavior of hard <b>dumbbells</b> under gravity. The fluid shows layering near the wall, where subsequent layers of <b>dumbbells</b> align alternatingly parallel or perpendicular to the wall. We observe coexistence of a fluid with a plastic crystal (PC) and an aligned crystal (CP 1) in a single sediment for short <b>dumbbells.</b> For longer <b>dumbbells,</b> we observe a direct fluid–CP 1 coexistence, while for <b>dumbbells</b> of almost tangent spheres, the aperiodic crystal phase appears in between the fluid and CP 1 phase. The locations of the coexistences between these phases are well described by a simple expression based on an approximation similar to the local density approximation, which has been successfully applied to hard spheres under gravity [M. Marechal and M. Dijkstra, Phys. Rev. E, 2007, 75, 061404]. The fluid–PC-CP 1 coexistence could not be explained using this expression. We attribute this discrepancy to a lattice constant mismatch between the PC and CP 1 phases. Finally, we show using direct simulations that the plastic crystal stacks preferably as the hexagonal close packed crystal for short <b>dumbbells,</b> {{as is the case}} for a bulk plastic crystal [M.

At {{the north end of}} the bridge, SR202 intersects SR203 in a roundabout, forming the latter's terminus. The highway continues southeast along the Snoqualmie River, passing Fall City Airport and crossing Tokul Creek via a long hairpin turn. SR202 passes Snoqualmie Falls, enters a roundabout at Tokul Road, and travels south across the Snoqualmie River towards downtown Snoqualmie. From Snoqualmie, it travels southeast through the Three Forks lowlands and crosses the South Fork Snoqualmie River into North Bend. The highway turns southwest onto Bendigo Boulevard and travels through the city's downtown, exiting via a crossing of the South Fork Snoqualmie River. SR202 passes the North Bend Premium Outlets mall and intersects I-90, where it terminates at a partial <b>dumbbell</b> interchange.|$|E
5|$|West of its {{interchange}} with MD108, MD32's name {{changes to}} Sykesville Road {{and becomes a}} north-south highway, which continues as a partially controlled-access two-lane highway through a mix of farmland and large-plot residential subdivisions. The state highway is paralleled to the west by its old alignment, Ten Oaks Road. East {{of the community of}} Dayton, the state highway passes by MDSHA's Dayton shops. In Glenelg, MD32 passes under Triadelphia Road and expands to a two-lane divided highway for its <b>dumbbell</b> interchange with Burnt Woods Road, which also provides access to the northern end of Ten Oaks Road and Pfefferkorn Road. The state highway becomes undivided again and veers northeast and north toward West Friendship. MD32 crosses the Middle Patuxent River and Terrapin Branch before its intersection with MD144 (Frederick Road), where the highway expands to a four-lane divided highway. The state highway has a diamond interchange with I-70 and US40 (Baltimore National Pike) before reducing to a four-lane undivided highway that continues north to MD32's intersection with MD99 (Old Frederick Road).|$|E
5|$|MDSHA has {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} east–west corridor between the MD 28–MD 97 intersection at Norbeck and the I-95–MD 198 interchange, a corridor that forms the most direct route from Laurel to Rockville. Plans for the MD 198 portion of the corridor call for expanding the route to a four-lane divided highway from MD 650 to US 29 and widening the highway to six lanes from the Montgomery–Prince George's County line to west of I-95. The proposals also include adding a center turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also {{conducted a study}} concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed improvements are associated with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred alternative {{that came out of the}} study was to expand MD 198 from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing <b>dumbbell</b> interchange.|$|E

5|$|The MD 198 {{divided highway}} was {{extended}} west from Sweitzer Lane {{to what was}} then US 29 in 1985. That same year, the state highway was expanded to a divided highway from US 1 to the Patuxent River. MD 198 was rebuilt as a divided highway from the Patuxent River to {{just west of the}} Baltimore–Washington Parkway in 1987. The divided highway was extended through the parkway interchange in 1991. As part of the construction, the original five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange had a loop ramp added from the northbound parkway to westbound MD 198. That same year, MD 198 was extended east from the Little Patuxent River to newly constructed MD 32 in Fort Meade. The state highway's western terminus was relocated from an acute intersection with MD 650 to an orthogonal intersection in 1997. The west leg of the intersection became operational when the extended Norbeck Road, a county highway connecting the ends of MD 28 and MD 198, opened in 2004. MD 198's eastern end was extended along its current course when the MD 198–MD 32 <b>dumbbell</b> interchange was completed in 2002. The MD 198–US 29 interchange opened in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In general terms, {{gravitational}} waves are radiated by objects whose motion involves acceleration and its change, {{provided that the}} motion is not perfectly spherically symmetric (like an expanding or contracting sphere) or rotationally symmetric (like a spinning disk or sphere).

The heavier the <b>dumbbell,</b> and the faster it tumbles, the greater is the gravitational radiation it will give off.
