The molecular structures of each isomer were evaluated {{on the basis of}} single point energy with zero point vibration correction.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering for the MSc in Polymer TechnologyIsobutylene Isoprene Rubber (IIR) which {{is also known as}} Butyl Rubber is widely used in tire inner tubes & curing membranes due to its unique properties: impermeability to gas & stability at elevated temperatures respectively. Due to comparatively low unsaturation. Butyl Rubber is known to be cure incompatible with <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>rubber.</b> Therefore, preparation of co-vulcanizable blends of Butyl Rubber is not usually recommended. Pneumatic tire sidewall is subjected to cyclic dynamic deformation under various weather conditions. Among pneumatic tires, agricultural tires are supposed to be used under severe weather conditions especially during soil preparation. On top ofthat, sidewalls of agricultural tires do possess larger surface area which will be in contact with severe weather conditions. Being agricultural tires are expensive, those tires are supposed to be re-capped at least three times during the life span. To withstand during the period ofthrce lives oftreads. the sidewall should possess superior 1 lexibility and...|$|E

30|$|In our {{previous}} work, we {{have studied the}} effect of nano-ZnO on the cure properties of polybutadiene rubber (BR) [20]. It was observed that the nano-ZnO reduces curing time and also enhances physico-mechanical as well thermal stability properties of butadiene rubber compound at lower concentration compared to the conventional micro-ZnO. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, the effect of nano-ZnO as cure activator has not yet been explored for SBR/BR rubber blend. In the open literature, it has already been reported that nano-zinc oxides are effective activators and reinforcing agents in rubber systems. The “little size effect,” “surface effect” and “quantum effect” of nano-ZnO governs the properties of the composites [21]. Although considerable amount of work has been done so far on the use of nano-ZnO in place of conventional ZnO as a cure activator and for enhancing the mechanical properties of elastomer, the study on SBR/BR-nano-ZnO composites is scarcely available in the literature [22]. In the tire industry, SBR/BR blend is of considerable importance as it is widely used in passenger car tire-tread compound. Hence, investigation of nanocomposite based on SBR/BR blends and nano-ZnO would not only be providing valuable information but also have wide applications. Typically SBR/BR blend shows slower curing rate than other <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>rubbers</b> such as NR and BR [3]. Hence, it will be of interest to study the cure properties of this blend with nano-ZnO.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of carbon black types P- 803 and S 800 on elastic, strength and deformation properties of rubbers intended for production of molded rubber products has been studied. As objects of research the rubber mixtures based on combination of <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>rubber</b> SRI- 3 +SRD and {{special purpose rubber}} BNRS- 18 AMN were used. The studies of chemical composition of the surface of various carbon black types revealed that the surf ace of carbon black type S 800 contains {{a large amount of}} sulfur and a minimal amount of oxygen, the presence of which may influence the curing process, and consequent-ly on the elastic and mechanical properties of rubbers. It was established that P- 803 carbon black type substitution by S 800 type leads to increase in streng th characteristics, Shore A hardness and to decrease in relative compression set of vulcanizates based on BNRS- 18 AMN. In rubber based on combination of rubbers SRI- 3 +SRD with carbon black type S 800 re vealed decrease resistance against growth tears and increase Shore A hardness of vulcani zates, compared with samples of rubber with carbon black type P- 803. The character of changes in rubber properties {{may be due to the}} {{influence of}} the carbon black type on the structure and density of curing grid...|$|E
40|$|The grating {{process of}} the vinyl acids to the {{aliphatic}} and aromaticc polymer fibres and also the influence of such a treatment on the adhesion activity to the rubbers on base of the <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> raw <b>rubbers</b> have been investigated. It {{has been shown that}} the two-component initiating vanadium salt-hydrogen peroxide system is effective for production of the grated polyacryl acid {{on the surface of the}} polyamide cords with high stretch rate. The special features of the gated polymerization reaction have been studied, the mechanism of the initiation and gating process has been proposed. The procedure increasing the chemical activity of the fible surface on base of the completely-para-aromatic polyamide Tvaron with use of the metal-organic compounds has been shown. To create the covalent bonds on the fibre-rubber boundary the bifunctional compounds both low-molecular ones (glycidilmetaacrylate) and high-molecular ones (epoxy NA) being active relatively to the modified fibre and rubber matrix have been proposed. The scientific bases on the treatment of the aromatic polyamide SVM for its use as a reinforcing material for production of the hydrobrake and fuel hoses have been developed.
