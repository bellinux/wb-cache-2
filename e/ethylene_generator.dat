40|$|Abstract approved:, [...] In the Northwest, two {{tree fruit}} {{production}} problems {{may be related}} to the role of ethylene on plant growth and development: flowers and developing fruits are subject to low temperature injury during early spring, and to the low fruit set of 'Cornice'. Ethylene may be involved in influencing dormancy and flower and ovule senescence. Thus, manipulation of the ethylene levels during various stages of development may alleviate these problems. The role of ethylene on floral bud break was studied by the appli-cations of ethylene inhibitors and ethephon, an <b>ethylene</b> <b>generator,</b> during various stages of floral bud development. Lower concentrations of a fall ethephon spray at the onset of dormancy delayed subsequent anthesis by 8 and 13 days on peach and prune fruit trees without exces-sive damage. This ethephon spray was associated with high levels of internal bud ethylene and ABA. The slower in the rate of flowe...|$|E
40|$|Efficient sucrose loading in rubber-producing cells (laticifer cells) is {{essential}} for retaining rubber productivity in Hevea brasiliensis, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of this process remain unknown. Here, we functionally characterized a putative Hevea SUT member, HbSUT 3, mainly in samples from regularly exploited trees. When expressed in yeast, HbSUT 3 encodes a functional sucrose transporter that exhibits high sucrose affinity with a K(m) value of 1. 24 mm at pH 4. 0, and possesses features typical of sucrose/H(+) symporters. In planta, {{when compared to the}} expression of other Hevea SUT genes, HbSUT 3 was found to be the predominant member expressed in the rubber-containing cytoplasm (latex) of laticifers. The comparison of HbSUT 3 expression among twelve Hevea tissues demonstrates a relatively tissue-specific pattern, i. e. expression primarily in the latex and in female flowers. HbSUT 3 expression is induced by the latex stimulator Ethrel (an <b>ethylene</b> <b>generator),</b> and relates to its yield-stimulating effect. Tapping (the act of rubber harvesting) markedly increased the expression of HbSUT 3, whereas wounding alone had little effect. Moreover, the expression of HbSUT 3 was found to be positively correlated with latex yield. Taken together, our results provide evidence favouring the involvement of HbSUT 3 in sucrose loading into laticifers and in rubber productivity...|$|E

Some of his other chemistry research includes antiauxin chemistry (isothiazoles, isoxasoles, pyrazoles), plant chemistry, cell membrane chemistry (glyceride and phospholipid syntheses, liposomes), plant hormone chemistry (abscissic acid analogs, <b>ethylene</b> <b>generators),</b> and nitride sulfide chemistry. He also performed research pertaining to reaction mechanisms, coenzyme A antimetabolites, biorational design of herbicides, and periselective addition reactions of one- and threedipoles, as well as fundamental organic research.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ethylene}} biosynthesis inhibitors including α-amino isobutyric acid, CoCl 2 and NiCl 2, and an inhibitor of ethylene action, Ag+, on fungal elicitor-induced paclitaxel production were assessed in cell suspension cultures of Taxus chinensis, T. chinensis var. mairei and T. yunnanensis to elucidate {{the role of}} ethylene in paclitaxel synthesis. All these ethylene inhibitors enhanced the paclitaxel yield, and most significantly (up to three-fold) by the combination of CoCl 2 (20 μM) and Ag+ (30 μM). On the contrary, ethrel, an ethylene-releasing reagent, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), an inhibitor of both jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene biosynthesis, depressed the elicitor-induced paclitaxel production. Importantly, {{the positive or negative}} effects of these <b>ethylene</b> inhibitors or <b>generator</b> on paclitaxel production were mainly observed when they were added to the culture before or simultaneously with the fungal elicitor, but became less significant or negligible when they were added 24 h after the elicitor. These findings suggest that the control of ethylene production is important for the elicitation of paclitaxel biosynthesis of the cultured Taxus spp. cells. Therefore, the application of ethylene inhibitors to Taxus cell cultures before elicitor treatment is an effective measure to enhance elicitor-induced paclitaxel production.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 In the Northwest, two {{tree fruit}} {{production}} problems {{may be related}} to the role of ethylene on plant growth and development: flowers and developing fruits are subject to low temperature injury during early spring, and to the low fruit set of 'Comice'. Ethylene may be involved in influencing dormancy and flower and ovule senescence. Thus, manipulation of the ethylene levels during various stages of development may alleviate these problems. The role of ethylene on floral bud break was studied by the applications of ethylene inhibitors and ethephon, an <b>ethylene</b> <b>generator,</b> during various stages of floral bud development. Lower concentrations of a fall ethephon spray at the onset of dormancy delayed subsequent anthesis by 8 and 13 days on peach and prune fruit trees without excessive damage. This ethephon spray was associated with high levels of internal bud ethylene and ABA. The slower in the rate of flower differentiation and development was related to the high levels of internal ethylene during dormancy and this could account for the bloom delay the following spring. The study indicated two preferred methods to delay floral bud development with a fall application of ethephon without reduced yield performance on Prunus: 1) fall ethephon applied between 10 - 100...|$|E
