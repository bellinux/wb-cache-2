5|$|For {{the scenery}} <b>design,</b> <b>layout</b> {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring {{was done with the}} computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E

The course is conducted as an experimental laboratory, inspired by the ever-changing tempo of life, discovery of new techniques, new fields of operation...in close contact with current problems of leading magazines, department stores, advertising agencies and manufactures.

2500|$|The {{new head}} office was commended at the time. It {{featured}} in the 7 September 1967 edition of The Queensland Master Builder, which detailed the building's construction techniques and highlighted its modern technology. According to the MRD's magazine Queensland Roads, there were hopes [...] "that the construction of this building with its landscaped gardens and surroundings in the old Spring Hill area of Brisbane, [...] provide an incentive for other businesses and developers to {{follow the example of}} the Main Roads Department". Commissioner Barton viewed the MRD as [...] "a giant consulting engineers and construction organisation", and stated [...] "why should a department like Main Roads be any different from private business ... e hope that when our officers are dealing with people they will get the idea that we are here to do business just as efficiently and effectively as anybody else in the community". The Courier-Mail added that [...] "the building <b>design,</b> <b>layout</b> of office space and staff facilities, gives the Main Roads Department an air of big business, not the traditional Government department organisation", while the Mines and Main Roads Minister, Ronald Ernest Camm, claimed that the new building [...] "would {{be one of the most}} effective ways of organising Main Roads personnel and facilities for a bolder attack on the problems of the future".|$|E
2500|$|The JetStar has {{a fairly}} typical {{business}} jet <b>design</b> <b>layout,</b> with a swept wing and a cruciform tail. The wing has a 30° sweepback and features large fuel tanks at about half-span, extending some distance {{in front and}} behind the wing. [...] The wings hold 10,000 pounds of fuel, and each slipper tank holds 4,000 pounds of fuel for a total fuel load of 18,000 pounds. [...] The wing also includes leading edge flaps (not slats) along {{the front of the}} wing outboard of the tanks (these leading edge flaps reduce the stalling speed by an additional three knots), while double-slotted trailing edge flaps span the entire rear surface inboard of the ailerons. [...] The wing incorporates inflatable rubber deicing boots for the removal of accumulated inflight ice. The horizontal stabilizer is mounted nearly halfway up the fin to keep it clear of the engines' jet blast. One feature is that the horizontal stabilizer is trimmable by pivoting the entire tail fin and stabilizer assembly, which has a distinctive unpainted area {{at the base of the}} fin that is noticeable in most pictures. The JetStar does not have any tail deicing capability, nor was it required for certification. [...] A speed brake is located on the underside of the fuselage to aid deceleration for landing. The original prototypes used a tricycle landing gear with one wheel per leg, but after an accident in 1962 the nose gear was modified with two tires.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} animation {{was done}} {{independently of the}} background design, and they were layered on the same screen after each element was produced. This allowed the same character animation {{to be placed in}} multiple backgrounds. For example, Sacagawea appears in both the opening and final scenes of Case 15 in an identical physical stance. Brøderbund was very efficient with its workflow, having an assembly-like system. The company's plan was to keep the look consistent throughout. Instead of putting each artist in charge of both <b>design</b> <b>layout</b> and painting, the tasks were given to two separate work streams, done by two separate groups of artists with different skill sets. Approximately 2-3 artists painted the backgrounds for the game, which began as prototype backgrounds before being coloured in. The same system applied with the colour models for animated characters. A full-time onsite employee came up with {{the look and feel of}} the design while freelance artists were hired to fulfil the vision. Layout artists were required to complete animation on top of static images. Many of those who worked on this game also contributed to World, U.S.A., and Word. Much of the design work took place between 1996-7. The Opening, Closing, and Jailbreak sequences required special attention to ensure they were aesthetically impressive and succinctly told a visual narrative. In mid 1997, the three cut-scene sequences had to be painted over in order to give them a 3D effect which matched the backgrounds of the game levels. Artist David Sacherri described Time designers Stuart Lowder and Leila Joslyn as [...] "wonderful people to work for", adding that the gaming industry was [...] "young" [...] at the time, and so this was reflected in the technology used. The tool for freelance artists was Photoshop, and they developed painting techniques as they went. They didn't have tools such as wacom tablets or handheld styluses, and instead simply painted with a mouse. To give trees a [...] "leafy look", an improvised technique was to [...] "ha the mouse fade after two to three pixels [...] several strokes”.|$|E
40|$|A well <b>designed</b> {{facility}} <b>layout</b> {{consists of}} an adequate arrangement of departments and an efficient material handling system that minimizes the total material handling cost between departments. Block <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> and input and output (I/O) points location are the two major decisions in {{that need to be}} made when <b>designing</b> the <b>layout</b> of a facility. Although both decisions are interrelated, the classical approach to facility <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> is to consider them independently. In this thesis, an integrated approach to <b>design</b> the block <b>layout</b> and to locate the I/O points is presented. In particular, we consider three different cases: (i) block <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> with fixed I/O points, (ii) block <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> with flexible I/O points, and (iii) block <b>layout</b> <b>design</b> with flexible department shapes and flexible I/O points. Four mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations are presented for these facility layout problems, with the objective of minimizing the total material handling cost. A case study of a manufacturing company is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. A comparison is performed between the existing and proposed layouts. These proposed layouts provide estimated savings of 50 % and more as compared with the existing layout...|$|R
