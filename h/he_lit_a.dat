500|$|Cooper {{boarded the}} aircraft, a Boeing 727-100 (FAA {{registration}} N467US), and took seat 18C (18E by one account, 15D by another) {{in the rear}} of the passenger cabin. <b>He</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigarette and ordered a bourbon and soda. On-board witnesses described him as a man in his mid-forties, between [...] and [...] tall. He wore a black lightweight raincoat, loafers, a dark suit, a neatly pressed white collared shirt, a black necktie, and a mother of pearl tie pin.|$|E
2500|$|In time, Saichō {{attracted}} other monks both on Mount Hiei, {{and from}} the Buddhist community in Nara, and a monastic community developed on Mount Hiei, which eventually became Enryaku-ji. Saichō {{was said to have}} carved an image of the Bhaiṣajyaguru and enshrined it. Additionally, <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> lamp of oil before the Buddha and prayed that the lamp would never be extinguished. This lamp is now known as the [...] and has remained lit for 1200 years.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1970, {{coverage}} of the Chicago Seven trials provided the mainstream media an opportunity to highlight the most radical aspects of the movement. [...] Yippie leader Jerry Rubin's guest appearance on the Phil Donahue Show in that year (April 1) represents the virtual apex of such publicity — surpassed only by his appearance November 7 that same year on The David Frost Show, where <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> joint and tried to pass it to Frost, then summoned an army of expletive-using hippies planted in the audience to swarm the stage, all on live television.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>Lit</b> up <b>a</b> Humongous Cigar and Puffed {{it in our}} Faces for Half an Hour ...|$|R
60|$|Thain {{was silent}} for <b>a</b> moment. <b>He</b> had <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigar now and was smoking steadily.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> {{stopped and}} <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> {{cigarette}} without changing his odd expression.|$|R
2500|$|On 19 July Latham {{took off}} from Cap Blanc-Nez, very near Sangatte, but after only [...] his Antoinette IV {{suffered}} engine failure and Latham had to ditch in the Channel, thereby performing the world's first landing of an aircraft on the sea. The undamaged fuselage remained afloat, so <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigarette and awaited rescue by the French torpedo-destroyer Harpon that was following. After recovery of the aircraft, the engine was examined and a stray piece of wire was found inside the engine. [...] Levavasseur stated that the misfire was caused by this wire.|$|E
2500|$|Silva {{asked him}} where he shot the picture and was looking around to take the photo too. Carter pointed to a place [...] away. Then Carter {{told him that he}} had chasing the vulture away. He was {{completely}} shocked by the situation he had just photographed. He said to Silva [...] "I see all this, and all I can think of is Megan". Megan was his young daughter. <b>He</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigarette and became more and more emotional by the minute. [...] "I can't wait to hug her when I get home." [...] A few minutes later they got into the small UN plane and left Ayod for Kongor.|$|E
60|$|Philip, {{a little}} disconcerted, was silent as <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigarette.|$|E
60|$|My husband's {{composure}} {{was something}} wonderful. <b>He</b> laughed and <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigar.|$|R
60|$|Having {{received}} his money, <b>he</b> calmly <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigarette, puffed away upon {{it for a}} minute, and then went out slamming the door as hard as possible after him.|$|R
60|$|They {{finished}} dinner presently. Fenn looked {{with admiration}} at the gold, coroneted case from which Catherine helped herself {{to one of}} her tiny cigarettes. <b>He</b> himself <b>lit</b> <b>an</b> American cigarette.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> {{cigarette}} {{and passed the}} box {{across the table to}} her.|$|E
60|$|Lord Dredlinton {{shrugged his}} shoulders. <b>He</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> {{cigarette}} and dismissed the subject.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigar ostentatiously, and strolled {{into the}} waist {{with his hands}} in his pockets.|$|E
60|$|Then taking torches, <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> them at <b>a</b> {{lamp and}} gave one {{to each of}} us.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> paused, and <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigarette. Then {{with his}} hands behind his back he stepped out by Mannering's side.|$|R
60|$|Before {{long they}} were on the way to London. Mr. Sabin, whilst luncheon was being served, talked only of the lightest matters. But afterwards, when coffee was served and <b>he</b> had <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigarette, <b>he</b> leaned over towards Felix.|$|R
60|$|Nicholas Fenn nodded. <b>He</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> very pungent {{cigarette}} from a paper packet by his side.|$|E
60|$|Mannering took up {{the menu}} and ordered dinner. Then <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> {{cigarette}} and looked around.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> {{cigar and}} began to pace {{up and down the}} parlor of the cottage.|$|E
60|$|She <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigar, {{and handed}} the matches to Amelius. Finding that he stood fairly {{committed}} to the adventure, he resigned himself to circumstances with his customary facility. <b>He</b> too <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigar, and took a chair by the fire, and looked about him with an impenetrable composure worthy of Rufus Dingwell himself.|$|R
25|$|In the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the {{cauldron}} {{resembled the}} end of a scroll that lifted out from the stadium rim and spiralled upwards. It was lit by Li Ning, a Chinese gymnast who was raised to the rim of the stadium by wires. He ran around the rim of the stadium while suspended and as he ran, an unrolling scroll was projected showing film clips of the flame's journey around the world. As he approached the cauldron, <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> <b>an</b> enormous wick, which then transferred the flame to the cauldron. The flame then spiralled up the structure of the cauldron before lighting it at the top.|$|R
6000|$|... "On the trail," [...] said Horton. [...] "I {{wanted to}} keep him, but <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> out <b>a</b> little while ago, and {{borrowed}} a rifle. What he wanted it for I don't know, but he wouldn't be lonely, anyway. One of the boys who was staying here pulled out for the railroad just before him." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Harding {{nodded and}} crossed his knees. <b>He</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigar {{from the box}} Mr. Bundercombe passed round.|$|E
60|$|This done, <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> match {{he had in}} {{his pocket}} and began an {{examination}} of his cramped prison.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigarette, and Kipps {{was moved}} to do the same, with a sacramental expression. Presently speech flowed more freely.|$|E
6000|$|And Lush {{immediately}} rose, lifted Fetch, {{though she}} was rather heavy, {{and he was not}} fond of stooping, and carried her out, disposing of her in some way that took him a couple of minutes before he returned. <b>He</b> then <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigar, placed himself at an angle where he could see Grandcourt's face without turning, and presently said-- ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> has <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> {{plethora of}} major Broadway shows, {{including}} many for Hal Prince {{and is a}} frequent collaborator with director Des McAnuff. He is also a collaborator and co-founder of David Parsons's Parsons Dance Company. He has worked at regional theaters such as La Jolla, San Diego, California, Shakespeare Theatre DC, Old Globe Theatre, the Guthrie Theater, The Goodman Theatre, and Hartford Stage.|$|R
5000|$|Sai Baba of Shirdi is {{certainly}} the most influential modern [...] "Supersoul" [...] to tend to the Dhuni which <b>he</b> kept <b>lit</b> at <b>a</b> place called Dwarkamayi, until October 15, 1918 when he moved on.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> pipe, {{resumed his}} grip {{of his two}} friends, and rocked to and fro in a gale of laughter.|$|E
60|$|He {{was evidently}} {{looking for the}} sheet of paper, for {{presently}} <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> torch and went over the whole cave carefully.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Granger, {{hearing the}} crash, {{thought that the}} front door had blown open. Rising, <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> candle and went to see.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he laughed, {{and gave}} me a merry look as <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> on <b>a</b> tall, dry weed near by. He shook it hard with his little bill; when down fell a shower of seeds, and there was dinner all ready on a snow-white cloth. All the while he ate he kept looking up at me with his quick, bright eyes; and, when he had done, he said, as plainly as a bird could say it: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And fancy me having Connie's last cig.," [...] said Beatrice, {{putting the}} thing between her teeth. <b>He</b> held <b>a</b> <b>lit</b> match to her, and she puffed daintily.|$|R
60|$|Da Souza {{had left}} the room quietly. Trent read the letter through twice and locked it up in his desk. Then <b>he</b> rose and <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> pipe, {{knocking}} out the ashes carefully and filling the bowl with dark but fragrant tobacco. Presently he rang the bell.|$|R
