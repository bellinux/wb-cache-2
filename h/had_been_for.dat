5|$|After briefly {{stopping}} in Albany, where its convoy was delayed due to {{concerns over the}} presence of German warships en route, the 10th Battalion departed Australian waters in November and proceeded towards Egypt. Initially, the plan <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the battalion to continue on the United Kingdom from where it would subsequently move to the Western Front. Poor conditions and overcrowding in training camps in the United Kingdom resulted {{in the decision to}} disembark the Australians in Alexandria instead. Arriving there on 4 December 1914, the battalion was sent into camp at Mena, near Cairo.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his writing, {{at the time of his}} death Wallace <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> many years a {{well-known}} figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics. He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the Order of Merit in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Dannatt gave {{evidence}} to the Iraq Inquiry, focusing predominantly on his role as ACGS in 2002. He described an initial reluctance to commit the Army and stated that planning <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> a minimal land commitment {{and the provision of}} naval and air support to the United States. He also repeated his previous assertions that the army had been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests. Dannatt's evidence was followed by that of his predecessor as CGS, General Sir Mike Jackson.|$|E

6000|$|On October 10, 1856, {{about four}} hundred people were camped in Tasajara Valley, California. It could not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the prospect, since a more barren, dreary, monotonous, and uninviting {{landscape}} never stretched before human eye; {{it could not}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> convenience or contiguity, as the nearest settlement was thirty miles away; it could not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> health or salubrity, as the breath of the ague-haunted tules in the outlying Stockton marshes swept through the valley; it could not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> space or comfort, for, encamped on an unlimited plain, {{men and women were}} huddled together as closely as in an urban tenement-house, without the freedom or decency of rural isolation; it could not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> pleasant companionship, as dejection, mental anxiety, tears, and lamentation were the dominant expression; it was not a hurried flight from present or impending calamity, <b>for</b> the camp <b>had</b> <b>been</b> deliberately planned, and for a week pioneer wagons <b>had</b> <b>been</b> slowly arriving; it was not an irrevocable exodus, for some had already returned to their homes that others might take their places. It was simply a religious revival of one or two denominational sects, known as a [...] "camp-meeting." ...|$|R

5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> Rowe {{to act as}} a {{surrogate}} mother; she would give the baby to Jackson as a friendly favor and he would raise it. Jackson intended to issue a statement following the birth that the identity of the mother was a secret, {{in the same way that}} the identities of many surrogates are protected. Katherine's involvement, however, influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter than it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E

5|$|The campus newspaper, the FSView & Florida Flambeau, is 100 {{years old}} now and publishes weekly {{during the summer and}} semiweekly on Mondays and Thursdays during the school year {{following}} the academic calendar. After changing hands three times in 13 years, the FSView was sold to the Tallahassee Democrat in late July 2006, making it part of the Gannett chain. This exchange was allowed because the FSView <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> a long time a for-profit business that was not legally associated with Florida State University. Since most collegiate newspapers are supported by their colleges, this was also among the first times that a major corporation had acquired a college newspaper.|$|E
5|$|The expedition's next {{destination}} was Sarawak, {{on the island}} of Borneo. By the time they left Sarawak, the conflict between Beebe and Horsfall had grown {{to such a degree that}} Beebe decided Horsfall was endangering the expedition and must be sent home. In response to Beebe's dismissal, Horsfall retorted that he had been ill-treated by Beebe from the beginning of the expedition, and that his subsequent actions <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the express purpose of revenge. Continuing without Horsfall, Beebe and Blair traveled to Batavia in Java, to the island of Madura just to the north, and to Belitung between Borneo and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} intention <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the new railway, once completed, {{to be run}} by Union Railways as {{a separate}} line {{from the rest of}} the British railway network. As part of the 1998 rescue it was agreed that, following completion, section 1 would be purchased by Railtrack with an option to purchase section2. In return, Railtrack was committed to operate the whole route as well as St Pancras railway station, which, unlike all other former British Rail stations, had been transferred to LCR/Union Railways in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{situation}} in the North Sea in late 1918 remained much as it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the previous four years—with the Grand Fleet maintaining its endless watch over the High Seas Fleet—the war on the Western Front was rapidly drawing to a close. Operation Michael, the last German offensive, had been stopped in late summer, and with the aid {{of hundreds of thousands of}} American doughboys, the Allies had begun to overwhelm the German Army. On 3 October, Prince Max of Baden replaced Georg von Hertling as Chancellor of Germany, and immediately asked President Woodrow Wilson to arrange an armistice.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in his {{previous}} congressional term, when Weaver entered the 49th United States Congress, {{he was the only}} Greenback member. The new president, Democrat Grover Cleveland, was friendly to Weaver, and asked his advice on Iowa patronage.

5|$|After {{purchasing}} a decrepit yacht, the Granma, on 25 November 1956 Castro set sail from Tuxpan, Veracruz, with 81 revolutionaries armed with 90 rifles, 3 machine guns, around 40 pistols and 2 hand-held anti-tank guns. The 1,200 mile crossing to Cuba was harsh, {{and in the}} overcrowded conditions of the ship, many suffered seasickness, and food supplies ran low. At some points they had to bail water caused by a leak, and at another a man fell overboard, delaying their journey. The plan <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the crossing to take 5 days, and on the ship's scheduled day of arrival, 30 November, MR-26-7 members under Frank Pais led an armed uprising against government buildings in Santiago, Manzanillo and several other towns. However, the Granmas journey ultimately lasted 7 days, and with Castro and his men unable to provide reinforcements, Pais and his militants dispersed {{after two days of}} intermittent attacks.|$|E

25|$|Amsterdam is {{much younger}} than Dutch cities such as Nijmegen, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. In October 2008, {{historical}} geographer Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed {{as early as the}} late 10th century.

5|$|After the war, the Australian Army {{moved away}} from the machine gun {{battalion}} concept and no similar units were raised. The machine gun role was subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions. The idea was arguably misunderstood by Australian commanders throughout the war and this may have influenced the decision {{to move away from the}} concept. When the units had been established, the intent <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> machine gun battalions to provide highly mobile fire support but this only worked where the principles of open warfare worked. Once the focus of Australian Army combat operations shifted to the Pacific, the machine gun battalions were largely misused, being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks, rather than as offensive weapons for long range fire support. The medium machine guns were also largely used in the same manner as light machine guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference for organic fire support over attached sub-units, over-estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen. The difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{raised its}} price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The {{schedule}} switched to quarterly {{beginning with the}} March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that Amazing and Fantastic had lost $15,000, though Amazings circulation (at nearly 26,000) {{was as good as}} it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that Amazing would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.|$|E
5|$|At 1800 on 20 January 1944, the {{headquarters}} of Major General A. H. Ramsay's 5th Division, which had come up from Lae, replaced that of the 9th Division. At {{the same time the}} 8th Infantry Brigade replaced the 20th. The 8th Infantry Brigade, which had spent much of the war on garrison duty in Western Australia, began departing Cairns on 10 January. The original intention <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> it to go to Lae to relieve the 29th Infantry Brigade, which had fought in the Salamaua-Lae campaign, but in December it was decided to ship it directly to Finschhafen. The brigade contained three infantry battalions, the 4th, 30th and 35th, all from New South Wales. It also still had the support of the 2/12th Field Regiment, 532nd EBSR, and A Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion. The brigade suffered its first casualties on the night of 21/22 January in a friendly fire incident, which was a common occurrence with units inexperienced in jungle warfare. Two Australians were killed and two wounded by their own comrades.|$|E
