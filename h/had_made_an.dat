5|$|She was not {{the first}} woman balloonist. On 20 May 1784, the Marchioness and Countess of Montalembert, the Countess of Podenas and a Miss de Lagarde had taken a trip on a {{tethered}} balloon in Paris. Neither was she the first woman to ascend in an untethered balloon: in Blanchard's time, Citoyenne Henri, who <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> ascent with André-Jacques Garnerin in 1798, was widely credited with that ballooning first, although the honour actually belonged to Elizabeth Thible. Thible, an opera singer, <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> ascent to entertain Gustav III of Sweden in Lyon on 4 June 1784, fourteen years before Citoyenne Henri. Blanchard was, however, the first woman to pilot her own balloon and the first to adopt ballooning as a career.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} line-up for the Second Test at Lord's. Brown managed only 24 and 32 {{in the middle}} order as Australia won by 409 runs. Including the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, he had totalled 123 runs at 24.60 in his five innings in the middle-order. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who was noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that although Brown <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> unbeaten double century on his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Loxton and Harvey had better claims to selection.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, he was {{appointed}} {{to sit on the}} University Council of Victoria's third university La Trobe on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards and American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> impact.|$|E

Edward managed to make a surprise attack at Kenilworth Castle, where the younger Montfort was quartered, {{before moving on to}} cut off the earl of Leicester. The two forces then met at the second great encounter of the Barons' War, the Battle of Evesham, on 4August 1265. Montfort stood little chance against the superior royal forces, and after his defeat he was killed and mutilated on the field.|$|E
5|$|The Tevis novel {{had been}} optioned several times, {{including}} by Frank Sinatra, but attempts to adapt {{it for the}} screen were unsuccessful.

Rossen, who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> abortive attempt to write a pool-themed play called Corner Pocket, optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1967, he was {{a leading}} member of a strong Scottish {{international}} team that lost only once to England, in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2–1 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the 1966 World Cup, he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most {{of the credit for}} the 3–2 win, some commentators wished he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> effort to run up a bigger score.|$|E

5|$|In 1896, Young lost {{a no-hitter}} {{with two outs}} {{in the ninth inning}} when Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a single. On September 18, 1897, Young pitched the first no-hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders {{committed}} four errors while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit, but the Cleveland third baseman sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning, saying he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said, that, despite his teammate's gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.|$|E
5|$|In January 1141 William {{was elected}} Archbishop of York.

Then Henry of Blois tried to secure the see for Henry de Sully, another nephew of Stephen and Henry's. Sully's election was opposed by Pope Innocent II, who refused to confirm him as archbishop while he retained his post as Abbot of Fécamp. It was only at a third election, held in January 1141, that William was selected. Whether {{he had been a}} candidate in the previous two elections is unknown.|$|E

She and Chan <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> earlier successful run with heroin from Bali to Australia during their October visit.

5|$|Reed {{kicked his}} second field {{goal of the}} game from 41-yards to give the Steelers the lead going into the final quarter. The Chargers drove 74yards on 17plays, {{converting}} on a field goal {{to give them the}} lead again, with 6:45 remaining. On the Steelers' ensuing drive, the offense drove 73yards and Reed converted on his third field goal of the day, giving the Steelers an 11–10 lead with 15seconds remaining in regulation. The Chargers attempted to score on their final play, but Troy Polamalu forced and recovered a fumble, returning it for a touchdown. The call was reversed when the officials ruled that San Diego <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> illegal forward pass. After the game, head referee Scott Green admitted that the touchdown should have been counted. With the touchdown not counted the final score kept Pittsburgh under the 5point spread by which they were favored, and resulted in over $32million being lost in bets. The game was the first regular season game in NFL history to end with a final score of 11–10.|$|E
5|$|Stephenie Meyer's paranormal romance novel Twilight was {{originally}} optioned by Paramount Pictures' MTV Films in April 2004, but the screenplay that was subsequently developed was substantially different from its source material.

5|$|The 4th Canadian Division <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> {{attempt to}} capture the {{northern}} half of Hill 145 at around 3:15pm, briefly capturing the peak before a German counterattack retook the position.

When {{it became obvious that}} the position was completely outflanked and there was no prospect of reinforcement, the German troops pulled back. The German forces were evacuated off the ridge with German artillery batteries moved west of the Vimy–Bailleul railway embankment or to the Oppy–Méricourt line. By nightfall of 10 April, the only Canadian objective not yet achieved was the capture of the Pimple.|$|E

However, Canadian businessman Nelson Skalbania emerged as a rival bidder for the team before joining the Calgary consortium. The group agreed to purchase the Flames for $16 million, at the time the highest price ever paid for a National Hockey League franchise. The sale was announced on May 21, 1980, and the franchise relocated to Canada where it became the Calgary Flames. The Flames have since used the Atlanta logo for both its alternate captains, and the team's former affiliate that played in the American Hockey League, the Adirondack Flames.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{investigation into}} corruption that St Vincent began {{caused him to}} become extremely unpopular as many influential men {{were involved in the}} various money making schemes perpetrated. The board of inquiry set up by St Vincent was responsible for the impeachment of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and his trial for misappropriation of public funds. St Vincent <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> enemy of Pitt and Pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the First Lord and the Addington administration. St Vincent left the office on 14 May 1804 when Addington was replaced as Prime Minister by Pitt.

Australia replaced Brownwho {{had scored}} 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings with the all rounder Loxton, who <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> unbeaten 47 against Surrey and 159 not out against Gloucestershire. England made 363 after electing to bat. On the second day, Australia {{were in trouble}} when Hassett came in at 2/13. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter was beaten in flight by Jack Young. Aiming to break Young's restrictive leg side bowling, Hassett charged down the pitch and lofted a drive for four. However, in attempting a similar lofted drive over cover, he mishit the ball, which was caught by Cyril Washbrook at wide mid-off. This left Australia at 3/82 and they eventually made 221 to avoid the follow on by eight runs.|$|E
