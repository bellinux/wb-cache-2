40|$|In practice, it’s {{hard to see}} how Australia is a “creative middle power,” writes Gwilyn Croucher SINCE THE ELECTION of the Rudd Labor {{government}} in November 2007, the prime minister and his senior ministers have claimed that Australia is a “creative middle power”. Kevin Rudd signalled his desire to see Australia as a “middle power” while in opposition, and as prime minister he has succeeded in introducing the concept into many speeches and interviews, as have other senior ministers and some senior bureaucrats. This has garnered some international press coverage, becoming the new moniker for the government’s diplomatic approach. Despite its growing prominence in official discourse, there has been comparatively little substantiation of either the concept or the implications this concept has for policy implementation and Australian international relations. While the Rudd government claims it is seeking to assert Australia as a “creative middle power,” steps toward this goal have been meagre. Asserting a “middle power” strategy On 19 September 2006 Kevin Rudd, as opposition spokesman for foreign affairs, trade and international security, gave a speech to the Sydney Institute during which he outlined Labor’s foreign policy, emphasising that through three pillars of foreign policy Australia should assert itself as a “creative middle power” engaging in “middle power diplomacy. ” The first pillar is the alliance with the United States. Rudd reiterated that it had been a key plank of Labor policy for over a half century, and argued that the alliance {{is in the interest of}} Australia and the region as a US presence is critical for the stability of Southeast Asia. The second pillar is Australia’s membership of the United Nations. This is critical for Australia’s foreign policy because it is a forum to engage in middle power diplomacy, which requires “a rules based order [that] allows smaller states to negotiate the international security, political and economic systems with a degree of predictability. ” The third is Australia’s comprehensive involvement with Asia, through engaging with ASEAN and other forums. In the decades of the Cold War, the archetypical middle power in international politics was seen as a country with a preference for multilateral cooperation. Regional institution building was one avenue for asserting middle power status to counterbalance the asymmetry of power relations in the global system. Through policy entrepreneurship, technical expertise and intellectual leadership, a state can assert itself when military and economic power is not an option. This vision for Australian diplomacy, Rudd argues, contrasts with the collapse of middle power democracy during the Howard government years. Specifically this involved the failure to take an active role in facilitating a new nuclear non-proliferation treaty or the signing of the Kyoto protocol. The extent to which these pillars of policy translate into active middle power diplomacy is limited given the disjuncture between policy development and political rhetoric. “Australia’s back in business” During a speech to the East Asia summit on 26 March 2008 Kevin Rudd reiterated his 2006 vision and argued that “it is best means of enhancing Australia’s national interests” (Rudd 2008 a). He also more concretely flagged some of the specific policy areas that Labor would pursue. Australia was to act in concert with the United Nations on the problem of climate change, the Millennium Development Goals and nuclear weapons proliferation. Thus “in all these domains, Australia intends to prosecute an active, creative middle power diplomacy in partnership with the community of nations. ” Rudd reiterated the concept in at least a dozen speeches and was joined in this sentiment at various times by Foreign Minister Stephen Smith, Deputy Leader Julia Gillard, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel Warren Snowdon and Minister for Trade Simon Crean. All articulated the vision for Australian relations with the world in speeches and interviews, though on each occasion the detail they provided was limited. Some of the prominent speeches in which the term was used include the following, in chronological order: • East Asia Forum address 26 March 2008 (Rudd provides some detail, appears to be first mention in 2008) • Australian American Association, 30 March 2008 (Rudd). • Brookings Institute, 31 March 2008 (Rudd) • Speech to the Lowy Institute for a launch of a special issue of the Diplomat (Stephen Smith) • UK business groups meet and greet, 4 April 2008 (Rudd) • 2020 Summit 16 April 2008 (Rudd) • Australian Public Service heads dinner 30 April 2008 (Rudd) • Victorian ALP conference 24 May (Rudd) • Australian and New Zealand Leadership Forum, (Julia Gillard) • Tasmanian ALP conference 6 September (Rudd) • RSL National Congress 9 September (Rudd) • Address at Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers Association Conference 9 September 2008 (Rudd) • Speech to parliament regarding Australia and the UN, 3 December 2008 (Rudd) As the chronology demonstrates, during the end of March and beginning of April Rudd made frequent references to the concept. This coincides with his US visit, where he elaborated the concept in a press conference at the UN in New York on the 30 March 2008. When he was asked by a journalist, “Mr Rudd, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the Secretary-General about your express desire for Australia to be more activist as a middle power state and more creative in its diplomacy?” he responded, What I said to the Secretary-General was that he would find us active across a range of spheres of policy. Our conversation ranged across climate change, security policy challenges – obviously in Iraq and Afghanistan, together with the humanitarian challenges in Darfur, and other areas as well concerning the actual physical organization of the United Nations. He would have, I think, concluded from that, Australia’s back in business. We take the UN multilateral system seriously. Remember, there are three pillars of Australia’s foreign policy. Our alliance with the United States, our membership of the United Nations, and our policy of comprehensive engagement in Asia, and we are prosecuting all three. The last part of this answer shows an apparent re-branding of Australian diplomatic policy for the media, in a context in which he could expect to get international press coverage (as limited as that coverage may be). During the following months he continued to label Australia as a creative middle power in press reports and interviews. Other senior members followed the same trend. In so far as the rhetoric, Australia was a creative middle power that was “back in business. ” Punching above our weight? During 2008 other senior members of the Rudd government articulated the new stance on Australian diplomacy. In repeating Rudd’s sentiment, though, fellow ministers have provided only limited detail of its implementation, aside from the general principles set out by the prime minister. This is particularly striking given the declaration that Australia was to now assert itself in different ways. Some of the noteworthy absences include several speeches on trade in which Simon Crean discusses Australia’s engagement in multilateral trade issues but does not suggest (or imply) how the approach Australia will take to trade negotiations will differ dramatically to strategies pursued under the previous government. While the approach of the Labor government to climate change is markedly different from the Howard Liberal government, it is problematic to argue that this alone is an act of international leadership. So too with Australia’s interaction with the multilateral trade system. While a renewed focus on the WTO, as the desired international forum for further trade negotiation, delineates Rudd from Howard, it remains to be seen whether this will be at the expense of opportunity for major bilateral agreements. Policy implementation One area in which the Rudd government claimed to show leadership is through attempts to influence the negotiation of a new non-proliferation treaty. Minister Warren Snowdon argued that by helping to facilitate these negotiations the Australia government is acting as a middle power. This is one of the few areas in which the government seems to be actively pursuing policy that matches the rhetoric. Importantly, the term “creative middle power” does not yet appear to be used prominently in policy documents. A search of publicly available Australian government documents during January 2009 reveals very few direct references to the concept, leaving the primary definitions of “creative middle power” policy and diplomacy to speeches and interviews. A good example of the disjuncture between policy rhetoric and implementation is the reference to creative middle power in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s 2007 – 08 annual report. The index suggests that pages 115 – 16 cover “creative middle power diplomacy”. There is, however, no use of the term in this section; instead, it is about Australian participation in the Bali Conference of the Parties on Climate Change in December 2007. This suggests that the language of “middle power diplomacy” has not yet been integrated into the way the department describes international action. During a speech to Brookings Institute in New York on 31 March 2008, Rudd argued that “the Government intends to deploy what I have described as ‘creative middle power diplomacy’ – both globally and regionally. This means for example that you will see Australia being more active in the global efforts to meet the challenges of climate change following our ratification of the Kyoto Protocol within a week of taking office. ” The scant reference to “middle power diplomacy” in the department’s annual reports suggests the possibility that it was an exercise in re-branding policy to match rhetoric. The extent that policies, such as signing of Kyoto protocol, can be considered diplomatically proactive – as implied in Rudd’s definition of middle power – when compared to Howard government policy is questionable. In this case, John Howard’s decision to wed any international response to climate change to that of the United States set Australia apart from all other major industrialised nations and several developing nations. Failing to sign the Kyoto protocol was, in some sense then, diplomatically decisive in the face of widespread international opposition, especially given the concessions Australia gained through the negotiating process (for example clause 3. 7 of the Kyoto Protocol). While Australia’s support for the US position, given the long and close relationship, obviously played a role in the calculation, refusing to sign the protocol came at some cost to Australia’s international image. Thus, claiming that the decision to sign Kyoto is the action of a proactive and creative middle power is problematic. In this case the new Rudd doctrine for international engagement seem more to be about acting as a good international citizen than being any sort of leader. Being the second last Annex B country to sign Kyoto (especially given the many concession already granted to Australia) is hardly the action of a country in the vanguard. A similar argument can be made in regard to other policies Rudd that rhetoric implies are part of middle power diplomacy. Thus, there is meagre evidence that the actions of the Rudd Labor government match the creative middle power rhetoric. Despite its growing prominence in official discourse, there has been comparatively little substantiation of the implications of Australia acting as a “middle power” for policy and international relations. While the integration into policy can be expected to take considerable time, the evidence so far suggests the possibility that it is an exercise in rebranding rather than policy change. • Gwilym Croucher is a PhD candidate in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne Photo: Peta Curnow/ iStockphoto. co...|$|E
