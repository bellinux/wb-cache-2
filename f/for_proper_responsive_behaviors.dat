30|$|A {{hierarchical}} {{and distributed}} control strategy of TCAs is established, {{which is used}} to balance the power fluctuation of tie line caused by renewable energy through controlling heat pumps. Target assignment and compensating algorithm are introduced to achieve maximum utilization of DR resources in controlled regions. Besides, the nearly center-free hierarchical and distributed control strategy decreases the amount of communication data. We also improve OTR-O to OTR-I by integrating model prediction and customers’ <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> model. The combined analysis is used to investigate the performance of proposed method. The results indicate that VPPs composed of heat pumps can follow the given target, and then balance power fluctuation of tie line caused by renewable energy, which is better than centralized control strategy. Moreover, instead of getting full participation in demand response, customers’ <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> brings some negative influences on control effects. But considering the customers’ <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> is much closer to the actual situation, and will be more customer-friendly.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at finding out the {{various aspects of the}} {{material}} reflective function in mother-infant interactions. The participants were 9 mothers and their 18 -month-old infants. First, it was analyzed hoe involved the mothers were with their infants. The results suggested that <b>responsive</b> <b>behaviors</b> were observed more significantly than initiative behaviors, as observed in previous studies. In addition, with respect to the communication styles of behaviors, easy styles that could be communicated directly were observed more than those using some objects. Second, an exploratory research on material reflective functions focused on <b>responsive</b> <b>behaviors</b> was examined by conducting micro analysis interview.

Every pointing behavior by infants at the month'sage of 9, 11, 13, 17, 21, 24 and 30 was analyzed {{in terms of the}} cause and the object of pointing as well as its accompanying vocalization. In addition, every mothers' verbal and/or non-verbal behavior immediately after the infants' pointing behavior was examined. It was demonstrated that mothers' <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> varied according to developmental levels of infants' pointing behavior, but that it was always to carry out a M-I interactional activity. At lower levels, even if the infant pointing behavior showed no communicative intention, it was taken as a communicative behavior in the mother's <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> with the aid of contexts and situations.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to explain pro-{{environmental}} behavior, environmental sociologists often study environmental attitudes. While much of this work is atheoretical, the focus on attitudes suggests that researchers are implicitly drawing upon attitude theory in psychology. The present research brings sociological theory to environmental sociology by drawing on identity theory to understand environmentally <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior.</b> We develop an environment identity model of environmental behavior that includes not only the meanings of the environment identity, but also the prominence and salience of the environment identity {{and commitment to the}} environment identity. We examine the identity process as it relates to behavior, though not to the exclusion of examining the effects of environmental attitudes. The findings reveal that individual agency is important in influencing environmentally <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior,</b> but this agency is largely through identity processes, rather than attitude processes. This provides an important theoretical and empirical advance over earlier work in environmental sociology. Environmental sociologists have been interested in understanding and predicting environmentally <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> (Buttel 1987; Stern 2000). Usually, the approach has been to examine the correspondence between attitudes toward the environment and environmental behavior (Tarrant and Cordell 1997).

40|$|Poor {{oral health}} {{has been a}} {{persistent}} problem in nursing home residents for decades, with severe consequences for residents and the health care system. Two major barriers to providing appropriate oral care are residents' <b>responsive</b> <b>behaviors</b> to oral care and residents' lack of ability or motivation to perform oral care on their own. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} strategies that nursing home care providers can apply to either prevent/overcome residents' <b>responsive</b> <b>behaviors</b> to oral care, or enable/motivate residents to perform their own oral care. We searched the databases Medline, EMBASE, Evidence Based Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Web of Science for intervention studies assessing the effectiveness of eligible strategies. Two reviewers independently (a) screened titles, abstracts and retrieved full-texts; (b) searched key journal contents, key author publications, and reference lists of all included studies; and (c) assessed methodological quality of included studies. Discrepancies at any stage were resolved by consensus. We conducted a narrative synthesis of study results. We included three one-group pre-test, post-test studies, and one cross-sectional study. Methodological quality was low (n = 3) and low moderate (n = 1). Two studies assessed strategies to enable/motivate nursing home residents to perform their own oral care, and to studies assessed strategies to prevent or overcome <b>responsive</b> <b>behaviors</b> to oral care. All studies reported improvements of {{at least some of the}} outcomes measured, but interpretation is limited due to methodological problems. Potentially promising strategies are available that nursing home care providers can apply to prevent/overcome residents' <b>responsive</b> <b>behaviors</b> to oral care or to enable/motivate residents to perform their own oral care. However, studies assessing these strategies have a high risk for bias. To overcome oral health problems in nursing homes, care providers will need practical strategies whose effectiveness was assessed in robust studies...|$|R

30|$|Dynamic {{responses}} of timber joints depend upon frequency characteristics of input waves.

Dynamic tests under harmonic waves {{are suitable for}} understanding the fundamental frequency dependence of timber joints in dynamic response. Harmonic waves of single frequencies, however, affect them {{in a different way}} from actual seismic waves of the same peak input accelerations, because a seismic wave is composed of various frequency components. A difference between the dynamic responses under harmonic waves and those under seismic waves may be the successive transition of <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> related to the characteristic nonlinear load-slip relationships and cyclic stiffness degradation of nailed timber joints [1].

Participants were mothers of children who were considered at-risk for being nonspeaking. A quantitative within-group research design was used for this project comparing maternal directive and <b>responsive</b> <b>behaviors</b> across toy play activities. The mothers were asked to play with their children using three types of toys: a) familiar, b) unfamiliar, and c) complex toys, both with and without a BIGmack VOCA that had been programmed to say 2 ̆ 2 more 2 ̆ 2 when pressed. Dyads participated in two experimental sessions in their home. During the first home visit, dyads were asked to 2 ̆ 2 play and have fun 2 ̆ 2 and asked to play with all three types of toys without the BIGmack, allowing for collection of baseline data of responsive and directive maternal behaviors in each type of toy play. At the next home visit, children and mothers were separated within the house and then children were taught to activate the BIGmack to request 2 ̆ 2 more 2 ̆ 2 in play. Children and mothers were then reunited and again asked to 2 ̆ 2 play and have fun 2 ̆ 2 with the same three types of toys with the BIGmack present.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{contribution}} of permissive and <b>responsive</b> parenting <b>behavior</b> to empathic behavior in children and to investigate the moderating effect of sensory processing sensitivity on these relationships. A total of 280 Dutch children (51. 2 % boys, M = 4. 8 years) participated in this study. Data were gathered using web-based questionnaires filled in by the primary caregiver, to assess child temperament, parenting and child adjustment. We expected that permissive parenting behavior would predict lower levels of empathy, especially among children high on sensory processing sensitivity. However, results did not support these hypotheses: No such associations were found. We also expected that <b>responsive</b> parenting <b>behavior</b> would predict higher levels of empathy, especially among children high on sensory processing sensitivity. Results indicated that as parents showed more <b>responsive</b> parenting <b>behavior,</b> children indeed demonstrated more empathic behavior.

40|$|Precise {{control over}} the <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> of hydrogels is crucial for medical {{applications}} of these materials. To better understand how pH-triggered gelation and materials properties of the resultant gels can be controlled, a series of multiblock copolymers has been prepared by genetic engineering. The advantage of genetically engineered materials {{is that they are}} well-defined, monodisperse materials. In particular, the exact length and sequence of each block of a multiblock copolymer can be controlled. In this system triggerable gelation is based on the self-association of the naturally occurring Fos leucine zipper domain to form crosslinks in response to changes in pH. A polyelectrolyte domain (C) is interspersed with the leucine zipper domains (F) and renders the network water-soluble. Three block copolymers, consisting of three (L 2 FC 3), five (L 2 FC 5), and seven (L 2 FC 7) blocks, respectively, were prepared via bacterial protein expression. The <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> of these materials with respect to pH and temperature was characterized using circular dichroism and rolling ball viscometry. The different architectures of these block copolymers play a role in modulating the response to pH.

40|$|Addressable polymer {{structures}} play {{an increasingly}} important role {{in a variety of}} areas, such as surface engineering, drug delivery, and micro/nanofluidics. In these structures, addressability results from the sensitivity of incorporated polymer chains to variations in temperature, electric or magnetic field strength, pH, ionic strength, etc. Macromolecules responsive to multiple types of stimuli are attracting increasing interest. Such molecules are often constructed from several building blocks where each constituent responds to a different stijulus. Although redox responsive polymers have received relatively little attention, redox is {{one of the very few}} stimuli that allows one to directly address single molecules. To utilize stimulus <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> and construct 'functioning' molecular nanosystems such as molecular crawlers or motors, an external stimulus should be applied as a signal directly to a specific polymer chain, and be used for controlling its chain conformation and thus physical properties. In order to lay the foundation of such systems, in this Thesis several stimulus responsive macromolecules were studied based on two main polymer classes: (a) temperature responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamides) (PNIPAM), and (b) redox-responsive poly(ferrocenylsilanes) (PFS).

The hydrophobic core of the micelles consists of either a poly[5, 6 -bis(ethoxymethyl) bicyclo[2. 2. 1]hept- 2 -ene]-block with a glass transition Tg at room temperature or a poly[endo,exo[2. 2. 1]bicyclohept- 5 -ene- 2, 3 -diylbis (phenylmethanone) ] with a Tg of 143 °C. For the polyelectrolyte shell, the precursor block poly[endo,exo[2. 2. 1]bicyclohept- 5 -ene- 2, 3 -dicarboxyclic tert-butylester] was transformed into the free acidic block by cleavage of the tert-butyl groups using trifluoroacetic acid. Micellar solutions were prepared by dialysis, dissolving the copolymers in dimethyl sulfoxide which was subsequently replaced by water. All polymers form micelles with radii between 10 and 20 nm at a pH-value below 5, where the carboxylic acid groups are in the protonated state. The block copolymer micelles show a strong increase of the hydrodynamic radius with increasing pH-value, due to the repulsion among the formed carboxylate anions resulting in a stretching of the polymer chains.

40|$|Natural systems produce macromolecules that {{assemble}} into complex, highly ordered structures. In particular, {{proteins and}} peptides {{derived from the}} 20 naturally occurring amino acids are sequenced macromolecules that can fold into secondary and tertiary structures and can self assemble into quaternary structures. Through weak interactions, these ordered systems produce high-strength materials, provide physical cues to induce cell functions and morphologies, efficiently harvest energy, and transport materials. One of the key challenges {{in the field of}} polymer chemistry is the ability to generate synthetic systems that can demonstrate the highly ordered structure, self-assembly, and <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> of these macromolecules. Synthetic polypeptides have received attention because of their unique structural properties and biocompatibility. Like their naturally occurring analogs, these molecules have a poly(amino acid) backbone and posses the ability to fold into secondary structures. Synthetic homo polypeptides are synthesized by the ring opening polymerization of N-carboxyanhydrides formed from naturally occurring amino acids. Although these macromolecules' secondary structure can be controlled to some extent, we are limited by the given side chain, which dictates polymer function, structure, and <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> to temperature or pH among many other properties. We have developed a new approach to the manipulation of synthetic polypeptide composition and function through the introduction of a new NCA polymer, poly(Y-propargyl-L-glutamate) (PPLG) which contains a pendant alkyne group that can be reacted with an azide by the 1, 3 cycloaddition "click" reaction. With this system, we can incorporate functional groups that are ordinarily difficult to introduce because of cross-reactions or exhaustive protection-deprotection steps. In addition, we can more directly mimic the adaptive function and <b>responsive</b> <b>behavior</b> of naturally occurring polypeptides. This thesis focuses {{on the development of the}} PPLG system and the use of the system for synthetic biomimics, drug delivery, and gene delivery. For synthetic biomimics, as an initial example, densely grafted polymers were synthesized to demonstrate the utility of this synthetic approach. In addition, synthetic antimicrobial polypeptides were synthesized to mimic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides. For drug and gene delivery, a library of pH responsive peptides were synthesized and characterized. by Amanda Catherine Engler. Thesis (Ph. D.)
