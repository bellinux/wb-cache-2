25|$|A natural {{development}} from digital delay-processing hardware was {{the appearance of}} software-based delay systems. In large part, this coincided with the popularity of both professional and consumer audio editing software. Software delays, in many cases, offer much greater flexibility than even the most recent digital hardware delays. Abundant system memory on modern personal computers offers practically limitless storage for the audio buffer, and the natural efficiency of audio delay algorithms has made the implementation trivial for delays offering shifting or random <b>delay</b> <b>times,</b> or the insertion of other audio effects during the feedback process. Many authors of software plugins have added functionality to emulate {{the sounds of the}} earlier analog units.|$|E

The propagation <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> depends on the properties of the exploding wire plasma and vacuum gap parameters such as the number of injection slots, gap spacing, gap polarity, etc. In the absence of prebreakdown current in the vacuum gap, the breakdown can be initiated only after the plasma completely bridges the gap spacing.

40|$|An optimal discrete-time direct output-feedback control {{algorithm}} is developed with {{the consideration of}} sampling period and appropriate <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> in its control force action. Optimal-delayed output-feedback gains are derived through a variation process and will be complementarily arranged {{with respect to the}} applied <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> by either altering their magnitude or phases to assure the efficacy and stability of the delayed direct digital control system. Parametric studies of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems with different feedback types demonstrate the relationships of the delayed gains and the modal properties corresponding to the sampling period used and the intentionally <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> added. The maximum allowable <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> defined at the onset of instability of controlled system can be the optimal <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> that reaches the optimal control performance if the <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> is considered in the delayed feedback gains.

40|$|The average <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of the nodes (intersections and roundabouts) in dynamic {{traffic flow}} {{is one of}} the key {{elements}} of predicting travel time. However, determining and updating the average <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of the dynamic traffic flow as regards to the calculation of travel time has received very limited attention, even though most of the current techniques uses historical data for the statistical calculations.
