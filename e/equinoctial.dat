25|$|On 7 September, a {{month after}} they had been {{scheduled}} to depart, the force sailed from Britain heading for the Bay of Biscay. It arrived off Rochefort on the 20 September, but due to heavy fog was unable to land for several days. Hawke and the naval officers were already extremely concerned about the worsening weather, fearing <b>equinoctial</b> gales that would make the sea more and more dangerous as the autumn wore on.|$|E
25|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{consisting of}} a ring fixed in {{the plane of the}} equator, the armilla {{is one of the most}} ancient of astronomical instruments. Slightly developed, it was crossed by another ring fixed in the plane of the meridian. The first was an <b>equinoctial,</b> the second a solstitial armilla. Shadows were used as indices of the sun's positions, in combinations with angular divisions. When several rings or circles were combined representing the great circles of the heavens, the instrument became an armillary sphere.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus also {{observed}} solar equinoxes, {{which may be}} done with an equatorial ring: its shadow falls on itself when the Sun is on the equator (i.e., {{in one of the}} <b>equinoctial</b> points on the ecliptic), but the shadow falls above or below {{the opposite side of the}} ring when the Sun is south or north of the equator. Ptolemy quotes (in Almagest III.1 (H195)) a description by Hipparchus of an equatorial ring in Alexandria; a little further he describes two such instruments present in Alexandria in his own time.|$|E
25|$|Why did Hipparchus need a {{lunar eclipse}} {{to measure the}} {{position}} of a star? The <b>equinoctial</b> points are not marked in the sky, so he needed the Moon as a reference point. Hipparchus already had developed a way to calculate the longitude of the Sun at any moment. A lunar eclipse happens during Full moon, when the Moon is in opposition. At the midpoint of the eclipse, the Moon is precisely 180° from the Sun. Hipparchus is thought to have measured the longitudinal arc separating Spica from the Moon. To this value, he added the calculated longitude of the Sun, plus 180° for the longitude of the Moon. He did the same procedure with Timocharis' data (Evans 1998, p.251). Observations such as these eclipses, incidentally, are the main source of data about when Hipparchus worked, since other biographical information about him is minimal. The lunar eclipses he observed, for instance, took place on April 21, 146 BC, and March 21, 135 BC (Toomer 1984, p.135 n. 14).|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton, {{belonging}} to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy <b>equinoctial</b> gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent {{to take off the}} English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, {{at the time of the}} Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.|$|E

2500|$|Ari Belenkiy {{describes}} Hypatia's astronomical work as pivotal for {{the politics}} of the region, focusing on controversies related to observations of the equinox and the timing of festivals, ultimately serving to highlight errors in Ptolemy's work and the need for independent observation. [...] In two consecutive works (2010, 2016) Belenkiy proposed an astronomical-calendrical paradigm for Hypatia's murder. [...] Comparing two principal sources on Hypatia, of Socrates Scholasticus and Philostorgius, Belenkiy suggests that Hypatia carried <b>equinoctial</b> observations in 414-415 , initiated on the request of governor Orestes, which could be the litmus test of who was right in the conflicts over the Easter day in 414 [...] waged by Cyril, the Bishop of the Alexandrian Church, with the local Jewish and Novatian communities. Hypatia's success in establishing the correct day of the vernal equinox could undermine the Alexandrian Church's authority in the timing of Easter, as it used <b>equinoctial</b> computations based on Ptolemy's Syntaxis (Almagest). Perhaps fearing the test will lead to undesired consequences, a gang of Cyril's followers are reported (by Socrates Scholasticus) to have ambushed and murdered her. [...] Her murder thus was plausibly due to her astronomical observations.|$|E

2500|$|About 140 AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer, sexagesimally {{subdivided}} {{both the}} {{mean solar day}} and the true solar day to at least six places after the sexagesimal point, and he used simple fractions of both the <b>equinoctial</b> hour and the seasonal hour, none of which resemble the modern second. [...] Muslim scholars, including al-Biruni in 1000, subdivided the mean solar day into 24 <b>equinoctial</b> hours, each of which was subdivided sexagesimally, that is into the units of minute, second, third, fourth and fifth, creating the modern second as [...] of the mean solar day in the process. With this definition, the second was proposed in 1874 as the base unit {{of time in the}} CGS system of units. Soon afterwards Simon Newcomb and others discovered that Earth's rotation period varied irregularly, so in 1952, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined the second as a fraction of the sidereal year. Because the tropical year was considered more fundamental than the sidereal year, in 1955, the IAU redefined the second as the fraction [...] of the 1900.0 mean tropical year, which was adopted in 1956 by the International Committee for Weights and Measures and in 1960 by the General Conference on Weights and Measures, becoming a part of the International System of Units (SI).|$|E
2500|$|Hipparchus also {{discovered}} that the <b>equinoctial</b> points moved along the ecliptic (plane of the Earth's orbit, or what Hipparchus {{would have thought of}} as the plane of the Sun's orbit about the Earth) in a direction opposite that of the movement of the Sun, a phenomenon that came to be named [...] "precession of the equinoxes". He reckoned the value as 1° per century, a value that was not improved upon until about 1000 years later, by Islamic astronomers. Since this discovery a distinction has been made between the tropical year and the sidereal year [...]|$|E
2500|$|Hipparchus is {{generally}} recognized as discoverer of the precession of the equinoxes in 127. [...] His two books on precession, On the Displacement of the Solsticial and <b>Equinoctial</b> Points and On the Length of the Year, are both {{mentioned in the}} Almagest of Claudius Ptolemy. According to Ptolemy, Hipparchus measured the longitude of Spica and Regulus and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, Timocharis and Aristillus, he concluded that Spica had moved 2° relative to the autumnal equinox. He also compared the lengths of the tropical year (the time it takes the Sun {{to return to a}}n equinox) and the sidereal year (the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving ("precessing") through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century.|$|E
2500|$|Strabo {{uses the}} astronomical cubit (pēchus, {{the length of}} the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the little finger) as a measure of the {{elevation}} of the sun. The term [...] "cubit" [...] in this context is obscure; {{it has nothing to do}} with distance along either a straight line or an arc, does not apply to celestial distances, and has nothing to do with the gnōmōn. Hipparchus borrowed this term from Babylonia, where it meant 2°. They in turn took it from ancient Sumer so long ago that if the connection between cubits and degrees was known in either Babylonia or Ionia it did not survive. Strabo states degrees in either cubits or as a proportion of a great circle. The Greeks also used the length of day at the summer solstice as a measure of latitude. It is stated in <b>equinoctial</b> hours (hōrai isēmerinai), one being 1/12 of the time between sunrise and sunset on an equinox.|$|E
2500|$|The {{remaining}} {{chapters of}} book II {{are dedicated to}} meteorological matters. [...] Chapter 10 specifies that the new or full Moon preceding the Sun’s ingress into Aries {{can be used as}} a starting point for investigations concerning the weather patterns of the year. Lunations which precede the Sun’s ingress into any the other <b>equinoctial</b> and solstice signs (Cancer, Libra and Capricorn) can also be used for [...] seasonal concerns, and within these [...] "monthly investigations" [...] bring more particular details based on lunations and the conjunctions of the planets. [...] The recorded weather effects of the fixed stars in the zodiac constellations are systematically discussed, concluding with the relevance of generally observed sky phenomena such as shooting stars, cloud formations and rainbows. [...] These final considerations are expected to add localised details to the original exploration of eclipse cycles. Ptolemy's theme throughout the book is that charts of this nature cannot be judged in isolation, but are to be understood within the pattern of cycles to which they belong, and where there are strong connections between the degree points involved; for: ...|$|E
2500|$|First [...] {{demonstrated}} {{the form of}} the world by a plain wooden sphere... thus expressing a very big thing by a little model. Slanting this sphere by its two poles on the horizon, he showed the northern constellations toward the upper pole and the southern toward the lower pole. He kept this position straight using a circle that the Greeks called horizon, the Latins limitans, because it divides visible stars from those that are not visible. On this horizon line, placed so as to demonstrate practically and plausibly... the rising and setting of the stars, he traced natural outlines to give a greater appearance of reality to the constellations... He divided a sphere in half, letting the tube represent the diameter, the one end representing the north pole, the other the south pole. Then he divided the semicircle from one pole to the other into thirty parts. Six lines drawn from the pole he drew a heavy ring to represent the arctic polar circle. Five divisions below this he placed another line to represent the tropic of Cancer. Four parts lower he drew a line for the <b>equinoctial</b> circle [...] The remaining distance to the south pole is divided by the same dimensions.|$|E
2500|$|Hipparchus gave {{an account}} of his {{discovery}} in On the Displacement of the Solsticial and <b>Equinoctial</b> Points (described in Almagest III.1 and VII.2). He measured the ecliptic longitude of the star Spica during lunar eclipses {{and found that it}} was about 6° west of the autumnal equinox. By comparing his own measurements with those of Timocharis of Alexandria (a contemporary of Euclid, who worked with Aristillus early in the 3rd century BC), he found that Spica's longitude had decreased by about 2° in the meantime (exact years are not mentioned in Almagest). Also in VII.2, Ptolemy gives more precise observations of two stars, including Spica and concludes that in each case a 2°:40' change occurred during 128 BC and AD 139 (hence, 1° per century or one full cycle in 36000 years, that is, the precessional period of Hipparchus as reported by Ptolemy cf. page 328 in Toomer's translation of Almagest, 1998 edition)). He also noticed this motion in other stars. He speculated that only the stars near the zodiac shifted over time. Ptolemy called this his [...] "first hypothesis" [...] (Almagest VII.1), but did not report any later hypothesis Hipparchus might have devised. Hipparchus apparently limited his speculations, because he had only a few older observations, which were not very reliable.|$|E
