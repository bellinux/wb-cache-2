50|$|The {{access control}} domain deals with {{implementation}} of access controls across all electronic forms of information processing systems like operating systems, applications, networks or mobile platforms. Access control is the selective restriction {{of access to}} a place or other resource. Typically an organization's access control policy establishes the requirement of controls {{that need to be}} implemented for controlling access to information, information processing facilities and business processes on the basis of business and security requirements. The policy should aim to control the assimilation, authorization, and dissemination of information in a controlled manner. The typical organizational objectives of the access control policy are to <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure for user registration and de-registration, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to grant the correct level of access privilege, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to control password use, password change and password removal, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure for managements review of access rights, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure for unattended equipment, maintain a clear desk policy, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to control network service access, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> control method for authentication of remote users, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure for configuration ports, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to segregate networks, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to use precise routing controls, <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to control system utilities and to <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> procedure to secure communications over mobile computing devices.|$|R

5|$|Demosthenes grew {{interested}} in politics during his time as a logographer, and in 354BC he gave his first public political speeches.
