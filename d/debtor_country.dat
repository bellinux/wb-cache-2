A vulture fund is a private equity or hedge fund where companies or people buy the debt of a poor country and litigate to recover the funds, often {{at the expense of}} aid and debt relief. Prime Minister Gordon Brown commented on the practices saying [...] "We particularly condemn the perversity where Vulture Funds purchase debt at a reduced price and make a profit from suing the <b>debtor</b> <b>country</b> to recover the full amount owed - a morally outrageous outcome".|$|E

50|$|Creditors then discuss among {{themselves}} a proposed debt treatment. Once creditors {{agree on a}} treatment, {{the chairman of the}} meeting will then present this proposed treatment to the delegation of the <b>debtor</b> <b>country.</b> If the <b>debtor</b> <b>country</b> disagrees and asks for amendments to the creditors' proposal, the chairman will then convey this request to the creditors, who discuss it and consider a new proposal. This process continues until a common agreement between creditors and the <b>debtor</b> <b>country</b> is reached.|$|E
40|$|The {{availibility}} {{of international}} capital plays {{a crucial role}} in the economic development of many third world countries. Since the early 1980 s, successful economic development of many developing countries has been threatened by a continuing financial crisis. The origins of this financial crisis can be traced to the doubts about the willingness and ability of <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> to meet their existing debt obligations. The main problem for many <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> is their inability to generate enough net foreign income to pay the interest and the principal due on foreign loans. In this respect, the world recession as well as severe economic difficulties of many <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> have aggravated this problem. The world recession experienced in the early 1980 s led to the decline of many of the export prices of the <b>debtor</b> <b>countries,</b> which strained their ability to earn sufficient foreign incomes to service their external debts. Furthermore, many <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> have encountered severe econonomicdifficulties since 1980, particularly rising unemployment and falling output. This situation usually precludes pursuing restrictive domestic economic policies which would enhance the <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> 2 ̆ 7 capacity to meet their external debt obligations...|$|R

Each session includes a one-day meeting called a “Tour d'Horizon” during which Paris Club creditors discuss debt situations of <b>debtor</b> <b>countries,</b> or methodological issues regarding the debt issues more broadly.

50|$|The Paris Club (Club de Paris) is a {{group of}} {{officials}} from major creditor countries whose role is to find coordinated and sustainable solutions to the payment difficulties experienced by <b>debtor</b> <b>countries.</b> As <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> undertake reforms to stabilize and restore their macroeconomic and financial situation, Paris Club creditors provide an appropriate debt treatment. Paris Club creditors provide debt treatments to <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> in the form of rescheduling, which is debt relief by postponement or, in the case of concessional rescheduling, reduction in debt service obligations during a defined period (flow treatment) or as of a set date (stock treatment).|$|R
50|$|Through a debt-for-nature swap, a <b>debtor</b> <b>country</b> reduces {{its total}} {{outstanding}} external debt. The <b>debtor</b> <b>country</b> {{is able to}} buy back part of its debt in more favorable terms and pay for conservation initiatives rather than debt service. This leads to higher international purchasing power for the <b>debtor</b> <b>country.</b> Also, some argue that converting outstanding debts in USD to local currency debts lowers the long-term debt burden on developing countries. Additionally, debt-for-nature terms enable long-term planning and funding.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{argue that the}} {{international}} debt crisis of 1982 can best {{be understood as a}} prolonged negotiation between commercial banks and their own governments over who would bear the economic losses generated by loans made to developing countries. This interpretation of the debt crisis is contrasted with the more familiar approach that emphasizes conflict between <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> and their creditors. The main conclusion is that the failure of governments of industrial countries to resolve this conflict with their banks transformed an unremarkable financial crisis into a decade-long economic crisis for <b>debtor</b> <b>countries.</b> The analysis also suggests that recent capital inflows to developing countries are less likely to generate the same economic costs for <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> even if changes in the economic environment generate similar losses for investors. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact on the wealth of bank share holders on the {{transfer}} of official resources to the <b>debtor</b> <b>countries.</b> The main aim was to derive actual estimates of increases in shareholder wealth following important news concerning future transfers from the multilaterals to the debtor nations. The main result, is that stock market expects virtually all additional resources provided to <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> to be used for debt service to commercial banks. While the estimated magnitude of these effects are informative, the emphasis should be on the direction of these effects as they are robust to overestimation problems. Clearly, official resources provided to <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> do devolve to creditor banks. However, the <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> should at least gain in so far as the reduction of a debt overhang eliminates investment distortions. The results stem from {{the fact that some of}} the monies provided by the multilaterals are specifically earmarked for debt service or are in the form of general balance-of-payments support that the developing countries can use for private debt service. Official creditor resources that are specially provided to finance development projects are less likely to be allocated to bank debt service.

40|$|Most {{developing}} country debt is denominated in U. S. dollars {{and has a}} floating interest rate. The pricing of floating rate debt and related interest rate options are examined in this paper. Formulas for pricing ceilings and floors on floating rate debt are derived for several different models of interest rate variability. A framework for pricing risky debt and loan guarantees is presented, {{and the implications of}} the <b>debtor</b> <b>country’s</b> default option are analyzed. The elimination of large principal repayments, by collateralizing the principal, serves to reduce the <b>debtor</b> <b>country’s</b> incentive to use its default option. ...|$|R

[...] There were several stages of strategies to slow and end the crisis. The IMF moved to restructure the payments and reduce consumption in <b>debtor</b> <b>countries.</b> Later it and the World Bank encouraged opened markets.

40|$|Are broad reforms the {{children}} of high inflation? Do growth recoveries follow? We find that countries that had external debt crises with high inflation both reformed more and recovered better than countries that had external debt crises with low inflation. Countries with extremely high inflation also later wound up with lower inflation than countries that has moderately high inflation. The low inflation <b>debtor</b> <b>countries</b> had more aid than the high inflation <b>debtor</b> <b>countries,</b> which may have created stronger incentives to reform in the high inflation countries.

The creditors are less concerned about the relative small debt figures of SSA because of the lower risks for the equilibrium of the financial system. But from the debtors' viewpoint, the debt situation is possibly even more critical in low-income Africa than in the richer major <b>debtor</b> <b>countries.</b> SSA has a predominance of official creditors with the best obtainable credit terms. Notwithstanding these good terms, SSA is so poor that it has difficulties with fulfilling its debt service. There is no single solution for the African debt crisis.
