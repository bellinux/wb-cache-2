5|$|In the meantime, Władysław still {{tried to}} take {{a leading role in}} European politics, and {{negotiate}} a peaceful settlement to the Thirty Years' War, a settlement which he hoped would ease his way into regaining the Swedish crown. Following the armistice of Stuhmsdorf, Władysław came to increasingly realize that his prospects for regaining the Swedish throne were dim. In the years 1636–1638 he proposed several reforms to strengthen his and his dynasty's power in the Commonwealth. His first plan was an attempt to secure a hereditary province within the country, which would not be threatened by the possible power shift following a future royal election; this, however, did not gain sufficient support in the Sejm. Next, Władysław attempted to create an order of chivalry, similar to the Order of the Golden Fleece, but this plan was scuttled down as well, with the szlachta and the magnates seeing this as an attempt to create a royal, loyalist elite, and traditionally opposing anything that could lead to the reduction of their extensive power. Popular vote and opposition also resulted in the failure of the plan to raise taxes from trade tariffs; here it was not only the nobility but even the merchants and burghers from towns, like Gdańsk (Danzig) who were able to muster enough support (including from foreign powers) to stop the king's reforms. In fact, the defeat of his plans was so total, that he was forced to make certain conciliatory <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nobility, as the Sejm passed several laws constraining his authority (such as to hire foreign troops), further indicating the limits of royal power in the Commonwealth.|$|E

In the match, both keepers faced missiles thrown by sets of opposing fans, including plastic cups, chocolate and £1 coins. Referee Iain Brines was also hit by a coin thrown from the Aberdeen supporters' end. A month later, Załuska received a £500 fine and a warning from the SFA for his actions.|$|E

25|$|After {{two weeks}} of preparation, the tour went awry for the Australians. They fell to a 170-run loss in the First Test in Cape Town, with Lawry giving finger <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd and {{continuously}} arguing with the umpires. The Australian skipper managed only 2 in the first innings as the hosts took a 218-run lead that set up the match. Lawry scored 83 in the second innings, {{which was to be}} the highest Australian score for the series, an indication of his team's lack of batting form. At the end of match, angered by officiating that he considered to be unacceptable, Lawry refused to accept a presentation by the two umpires. The series moved on to Kingsmead at Durban. Host captain Ali Bacher outwitted Lawry by persuading the Australian skipper to toss long before the start of play. Bacher won the toss and decided—against conventional wisdom—to bat first on a green pitch that would normally offer assistance to the bowlers. Immediately after, ground staff ran onto the field and cut off all the grass, making it ideal for batting, thereby giving the South Africans the advantage. Knowing the rules in greater detail, Bacher had tricked Lawry. The laws of cricket allowed for the wicket to be mown up to half an hour before the start of play, so Bacher had talked Lawry in tossing early so that he could change the pitch condition to advantage his team. South Africa amassed 9/622 declared and Australia fell to its first innings defeat in four years, folding for 157 and 336. Lawry could not see off the hosts' opening bowlers, falling for 15 and 14, as South Africa took a 2–0 lead. The last two Tests brought no respite, as South Africa registered two large victories by 307 and 323 runs respectively. Lawry only managed 79 runs in the last two Tests, and passed 20 only once. Bacher's side, which was {{regarded as one of the}} finest in Test history, had inflicted what remains the heaviest Test series defeat in Australian cricket history. Lawry's men did not win any of the three matches against provincial sides after the start of the Tests, meaning that they went eight matches without victory.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Max Jakob Friedländer notes how St. George seems hesitant and {{unsure of}} himself in such a solemn and reserved setting. He has a very young face, and seems barely in his teens, with a gawky face, which according to Friedländer [...] "forms a strange contrast to the aged, ponderous canon". George is unsteady on his feet, and appears to struggle with having to raise his helmet while simultaneously presenting the donor, and [...] "this seems to embarrass him". George is the only figure whose feet are exposed. The uncertain manner in which he <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Virgin gives {{the impression of a}} shy and uncertain nature; and he raises his helmet in a hesitant manner. Friedländer observes that George's head is slightly inclined, his face [...] "twisted into an empty smile".|$|E
500|$|Dances are {{performed}} at multicultural festivals. One {{of the popular}} traditional dances of the Cook Islands is the Maori Ura, a sacred ritual usually performed by a female who moves her body to tell a story, accompanied by intense drumming by at least 5 drummers. Moving the hips, legs and hands give off different <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience to tell a tale, typically related to the natural landscape such as the ocean and birds and flowers, but also feelings of love and sadness. The ura dance has three distinct components; the ura pa'u (drum dances), korero (legends) and kaparima (action songs). To perform the ura, women typically wear a pareu and a kikau (grass) skirt, with flowers and shell headbands and necklaces known as ei. Men during the dance are said to [...] "vigorously flap their knees in a semi-crouched position while holding their upper bodies steady", and they typically wear kikau skirts and headbands. The drumming group, {{an integral part of}} the Ura, typically consists of a lead drummer (pate taki), support lead (pate takirua), a double player (tokere or pate akaoro) playing wooden gongs, and two other players playing skin drums (pa'u and mango).|$|E

2500|$|Luca {{arrives at}} the diner. Although he is a {{stranger}} to the people gathered there, his obvious charisma attracts their attention. To the familiar tune of the [...] "Habanera" [...] from Bizet's Carmen, Luca antagonizes the men by flirting with their girlfriends and by pushing or slapping them and, in one case, kissing {{one of the men}} on the lips. He is particularly attracted to Lana. Dino appears. Luca <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Man wanted" [...] sign, and Dino invites Luca to his office to discuss the matter. During this time, Dino shows his crassness and lack of respect for Lana by pinching her bottom and groping her in public. He seems to regard her more as a chattel than as his wife.|$|E
2500|$|Initially González and Raleigh {{planned to}} name their {{manuscript}} All This Is Mine—certainly an ironic title for a coauthored text. The title Caballero (which in English {{can be translated}} as [...] "gentleman") refers to {{more than just the}} aristocratic Don Santiago who stands at the novel's center. It emphasizes masculinity and makes apparent the authors' [...] "gendered critique of the possessive individuality of the autonomous (male) subject in resistance". María Eugenia Cotera moreover reads the title as containing an [...] "ironic reversal", for although [...] "its gendered singularity <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conventions of heroic narratives, the novel itself denies readers the heroic figure that would normally stand at the center of such narratives". Other critics have read Caballero as an ironic take on the genre of historical romance, and their elucidations often hinge upon the novel's title.|$|E
2500|$|His {{high school}} {{football}} ability was great, but his lack of maturity at times was a struggle. Harrison did not pay attention to his grades or college entrance tests, and by his senior year he had become disruptive to his football team. Early in his senior year, Coventry staff had to suspend him for two games for challenging an assistant coach to a fight. After he returned from his suspension, in his next game, he began the game by carrying 3 times for nearly 100 yards and 2 touchdowns. [...] After his second TD, he ran down the opposing team's sideline, and was ejected and later suspended for one game for making obscene <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fans. [...] Harrison was in court soon thereafter, after he shot a BB gun in the school locker room towards a defensive coach. He pled guilty to a minor charge {{and was able to}} return to school to finish his senior year. Due to his off-the-field issues, powerhouse football programs like Ohio State, Notre Dame, and Nebraska rescinded their scholarship offers.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, Mayall {{featured}} in a production of the play Cell Mates alongside Stephen Fry. Not long into the run, Fry had a nervous breakdown and fled to Belgium, where he remained for several days, and the play closed early. In 2007, Mayall said of the incident: [...] "You don't leave the trenches … selfishness is one thing, being a cunt is another. I mustn't start that war again." [...] Edmondson poked fun at the event during their stage tours. In , after Mayall gave mocking <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience and insulted their town in a silly voice, Edmondson said, [...] "Have you finished yet? It's just I'm beginning to understand why Stephen Fry fucked off." [...] In , after Richie accidentally fondles Eddie, he replies, [...] "I see why Stephen Fry left that play." [...] Towards {{the end of the}} Cell Mates run, Mayall revealed a replica gun—a prop from the play—to a passer-by in the street. Mayall was cautioned over the incident and later conceded that this was [...] "incredibly stupid, even by my standards". From 1999, Mayall was the voice of the black-headed seagull Kehaar, in the first and second series of the animated television programme, Watership Down. In the late 1990s Mayall was {{featured in}} a number of adverts for Virgin Trains.|$|E

Then, blushing deeply in spite of her other emotions, she threw both her beautiful arms round the neck of the person who must be, she naturally concluded, the right man. To her utter confusion, he also shrank back from her embrace.|$|E

The ceremony was very quickly disposed of, and all parties present having signed the register (for which purpose, {{when it came to}} his turn, Mr Crummles carefully wiped and put on an immense pair of spectacles), they went back to breakfast in high spirits.

6000|$|And then, indeed, I {{tasted the}} {{ultimate}} bitterness of life. For {{the first time}} I felt utter futility, and was wrung by emotion that begot no action, by shame and pity beyond words. I had parted from her dully and I had seen my uncle break and die with dry eyes and a steady mind, but this chance sight of my lost Beatrice brought me to tears. My face was wrung, and tears came pouring down my cheeks. All the magic she had for me had changed to wild sorrow. [...] "Oh God!" [...] I cried, [...] "this is too much," [...] and turned my face after her and made appealing <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beech trees and cursed at fate. I wanted to do preposterous things, to pursue her, to save her, to turn life back so that she might begin again.

I did not, of course, tear my hair coram populo over my loss, and she took it for lordly indifference. Afterwards, I daresay, I did tell them some of my adventures--such as they were--and they marvelled greatly at the extent of my experience. Hermann would {{translate}} what he thought the most striking passages. Getting up on his legs, and as if delivering a lecture on a phenomenon, he addressed himself, with <b>gestures,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two women, who would let their sewing sink slowly on their laps. Meantime I sat before a glass of Hermann's beer, trying to look modest. Mrs. Hermann would glance at me quickly, emit slight [...] "Ach's!" [...] The girl never made a sound. Never. But she too would sometimes raise her pale eyes {{to look at me}} in her unseeing gentle way. Her glance was by no means stupid; it beamed out soft and diffuse as the moon beams upon a landscape--quite differently from the scrutinising inspection of the stars. You were drowned in it, and imagined yourself to appear blurred. And yet this same glance when turned upon Christian Falk must have been as efficient as the searchlight of a battle-ship.|$|E
60|$|The stable-yard {{exhibited}} unequivocal {{symptoms of}} the glory and strength of the Eatanswill Blues. There was a regular army of blue flags, some with one handle, and some with two, exhibiting appropriate devices, in golden characters four feet high, and stout in proportion. There was a grand band of trumpets, bassoons, and drums, marshalled four abreast, and earning their money, if ever men did, especially the drum-beaters, who were very muscular. There were bodies of constables with blue staves, twenty committee-men with blue scarfs, and a mob of voters with blue cockades. There were electors on horseback and electors afoot. There was an open carriage-and-four, for the Honourable Samuel Slumkey; and there were four carriage-and-pair, for his friends and supporters; and the flags were rustling, and the band was playing, and the constables were swearing, and the twenty committee-men were squabbling, and the mob were shouting, and the horses were backing, and the post-boys perspiring; and everybody, and everything, then and there assembled, was for the special use, behoof, honour, and renown, of the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, of Slumkey Hall, {{one of the candidates}} for the representation of the borough of Eatanswill, in the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom. Loud and long were the cheers, and mighty was the rustling of one of the blue flags, with 'Liberty of the Press' inscribed thereon, when the sandy head of Mr. Pott was discerned in one of the windows, by the mob beneath; and tremendous was the enthusiasm when the Honourable Samuel Slumkey himself, in top-boots, and a blue neckerchief, advanced and seized the hand of the said Pott, and melodramatically testified by <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd, his ineffaceable obligations to the Eatanswill GAZETTE.|$|E
