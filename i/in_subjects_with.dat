25|$|Stereoscopic acuity is {{the ability}} to detect {{differences}} in depth with the two eyes. For more complex targets, stereoacuity is similar to normal monocular visual acuity, or around 0.6–1.0 arc minutes, but for much simpler targets, such as vertical rods, may be as low as only 2 arc seconds. Although stereoacuity normally corresponds very well with monocular acuity, it may be very poor, or absent, even <b>in</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> normal monocular acuities. Such individuals typically have abnormal visual development when they are very young, such as an alternating strabismus, or eye turn, where both eyes rarely, or never, point in the same direction and therefore do not function together.|$|E
25|$|In Alzheimer's disease, {{sulfatide}} in {{the brain}} tissue decreases tremendously, starting {{in the early stages}} of the disease. In the mild stages of Alzheimer's disease, the loss of sulfatide can be up to 50% in the white matter and up to 90% in the gray matter {{in the brain}}. Sulfatide concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid is also lower <b>in</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> Alzheimer's disease. The characteristic loss of neuronal function associated with Alzheimer's disease occurs via the loss of neurons and synapses, and the deficit is lipid class specific to sulfatides. When comparing sulfatide depletion to other neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease is the only case in which sulfatide is so dramatically depleted; in dementia no marked sulfatide depletion is observed, while in Parkinson's disease, sulfatide levels are dramatically elevated, and multiple sclerosis patients only have a moderate sulfatide depletion. Additionally, the loss of sulfatide has been observed to only occur at the very beginning of the disease while at more severe stages, minimal additional sulfatide loss occurs.|$|E
25|$|Molecular genetic {{research}} into alexithymia remains minimal, but promising candidates {{have been identified}} from studies examining connections between certain genes and alexithymia among those with psychiatric conditions {{as well as the}} general population. A study recruiting a test population of Japanese males found higher scores on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale among those with the 5-HTTLPR homozygous long (L) allele. The 5-HTTLPR region on the serotonin transporter gene influences the transcription of the seretonin transporter that removes serotonin from the synaptic cleft, and is well studied for its association with numerous psychiatric disorders. Another study examining the 5-HT1A receptor, a receptor that binds serotonin, found higher levels of alexithymia among those with the G allele of the Rs6295 polymorphism within the HTR1A gene. Also, a study examining alexithymia <b>in</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> obsessive-compulsive disorder found higher alexithymia levels associated with the Val/Val allele of the Rs4680 polymorphism in the gene that encodes Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme which degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine. These links are tentative, and further research will be needed to clarify how these genes relate to the neurological anomalies found in the brains of people with alexithymia.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that acupuncture's effects in gastrointestinal disorders may relate to its effects on the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system, which have been {{said to be the}} [...] "Western medicine" [...] equivalent of [...] "yin and yang".

Acupuncture has also been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects, which may be mediated by the activation of the vagus nerve and deactivation of inflammatory macrophages. Neuroimaging studies suggest that acupuncture stimulation results in deactivation of the limbic brain areas and the default mode network.|$|E

[...] The study also reported significantly less functional connectivity between STS and V3 in the autism group. [...] Note, however, that decreased temporal correlation between activity in STS and V3 would be expected simply {{from the lack of}} an evoked response in STS to intent-laden animations <b>in</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>with</b> autism.
