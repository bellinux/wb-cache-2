40|$|The {{simplicity}} and cost-effectiveness of direct compression {{makes it a}} preferred method of commercial tablet manufacturing. Excipients {{play a central role}} in determining the success of direct compression. Currently available directly compressible excipients are typically effective at relatively high proportion of > 50 % (w/w). For high-dose APIs, incorporation of such high excipient load is inappropriate, as this may necessitate the formation of large tablets, which may be difficult to ingest. Thus, high-dose APIs (especially for poorly flowable and difficult to compact) are often considered unsuitable for tablet manufacturing by direct compression. In interactive mixtures, small guest particles (typically < 10 µm) adhere to larger host particles. We hypothesized that small binder particles could express a binder action as well as a <b>flow</b> <b>additive</b> action, if they could form a suitable interactive mixture with large APIs. However, many such small particles are highly cohesive, which limits their de-agglomeration, dispersion and consequently the ability to form a homogeneous interactive mixture. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to understand the impact of the cohesion of small binder particles on their interactive mixing behaviour and consequently extension of their potential excipient performance i. e., binder and <b>flow</b> <b>additive</b> actions. A model pharmaceutical binder, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was co-sprayed with L-leucine to engineer small low-cohesion binder particles. In these composite particles, L-leucine enriched at the surfaces and manipulated the surface physico-chemical properties (such as morphology, surface energy and its crystalline character), which allowed control over cohesion. Low cohesion small binder particles de-agglomerated efficiently and formed a more homogeneous interactive mixture with paracetamol (active pharmaceutical ingredient, API) compared with high cohesion binder particles. The homogeneous interactive mixing allowed small binder particles to express enhanced binder and <b>flow</b> <b>additive</b> actions. The <b>flow</b> <b>additive</b> action improved while inherent binder activity reduced with reducing cohesion. This decline in binder activity was attributed to the reduction in the compactability (or bonding ability) of binder particles. However, manipulation of mechanical properties (increasing plastic deformability) allowed improvement of the binder activity of such low cohesion binder particles. High performance excipients are necessary to facilitate direct compression of high-dose APIs. Our study showed that binder and <b>flow</b> <b>additive</b> action are mutually exclusive excipient properties and the knowledge of interactive mixing allowed creation of composite excipients with elements of both <b>flow</b> <b>additive</b> and binder action. Manipulation of the surface physico-chemical and mechanical properties via smart particle engineering enabled small binder particles to express an optimum <b>flow</b> <b>additive</b> and binder performances. Thus, this knowledge could enable rational engineering and development of high-performance direct compression excipients, which would enable direct compression of poorly compactable and poorly flowable high-dose APIs. ...|$|E

It examines a TPU powder which had been cryogenically milled in two different sizes; coarse powder (D 50 ∼ 200 μm) with rough surfaces in comparison with a fine powder (D 50 ∼ 63 μm) with extremely fine <b>flow</b> <b>additives.</b> It is found that the coarse powder coalesces at lower temperatures and excessively smokes during the SLS processing. In comparison, the fine powder with <b>flow</b> <b>additives</b> is better processable at significantly higher powder bed temperatures, allowing a lower optimum laser energy input which minimizes smoking and degradation of the polymer.

40|$|Many {{large-scale}} {{and safety}} critical {{systems can be}} modeled as flow networks. Traditional approaches {{for the analysis of}} flow networks are whole-system approaches in that they require prior knowledge of the entire network before an analysis is undertaken, which can quickly become intractable as the size of network increases. In this thesis we study an alternative approach to the analysis of flow networks, which is modular, incremental and order-oblivious. The formal mechanism for realizing this compositional approach is an appropriately defined theory of network typings. Typings are formalized differently depending on how networks are specified and which of their properties is being verified. We illustrate this approach by considering a particular family of <b>flow</b> networks, called <b>additive</b> <b>flow</b> networks. In <b>additive</b> <b>flow</b> networks, every edge is assigned a constant gain/loss factor which is activated provided a non-zero amount of flow enters that edge. We show that the analysis of <b>additive</b> <b>flow</b> networks, more specifically the max-flow problem, is NP-hard, even when the underlying graph is planar. The theory of network typings gives rise to different forms of graph decomposition problems. We focus on one problem, which we call the graph reassembling problem. Given an abstraction of a flow network as a graph G = (V,E), one possible definition of this problem is specified in two steps: (1) We cut every edge of G into two halves to obtain a collection of |V| one-vertex components, and (2) we splice the two halves of all the edges, one edge at a time, in some order that minimizes the complexity of constructing a typing for G, starting from the typings of its one-vertex components. One optimization is minimizing “maximum” edge-boundary degree of components encountered during the reassembling of G (denoted as α measure). Another is to minimize the “sum” of all edge-boundary degrees encountered during this process (denoted by β measure). Finally, we study different variations of graph reassembling (with respect to minimizing α or β) and their relation with problems such as Linear Arrangement, Routing Tree Embedding, and Tree Layout...|$|R

However, although stable, the conventional titanium implants {{are not very}} bioactive which in some instances could reduce their efficacy. This thesis described the research progress of using polymeric ultrafine-particles with bioactive additives to enrich the surface of titanium substrate, thereby increasing the biocompatibility and osteo-inductivity of the biomaterial. During this doctoral project, three different types of polymers were examined, initially the conventional polyester, and later the novel epoxy {{as well as the}} epoxy/polyester hybrid polymers. Physical characterizations confirmed that all of the coating powders were ultrafine particles, and homogeneous surfaces were constructed from these particles with the correct incorporation of the functional and <b>flow</b> <b>additives.</b> The biocompatibility of the enriched surfaces were confirmed after examining their water contact angles, cell attachment/proliferation abilities, and their mitochondrial activities.

After comparing between calcium oxide and calcium phosphate as the bioactive additive, and a series of different epoxy and polyester based polymers in the presence/absence of micron-sized TiO 2, the results showed that the calcium oxide and micron-sized TiO 2 containing epoxy/polyester hybrid surface was the best candidate for future clinical in vivo studies.

Kinetic and structural assessment of melt phase n-alkanes illustrate the different crystallographic forms present within the homologous series. Studies demonstrate the alternating behaviour of the even and odd numbered homologues which converges as a function of increasing molecular weight. Greater crystal lattice stabilities were found for those n-alkanes which have an even carbon number and which crystallise into the triclinic crystal structure. Solid state phase behaviour of the n-alkanes was found to vary depending on the number and parity of n. Nucleation kinetic studies of n-alkanes and homologous mixtures from model diesel fuel solvents (dodecane, m-xylene, decalin, pristane and a dewaxed fuel) are assessed using turbidity as the method of crystallite detection. Saturation temperatures are found to be related to both alkane structure and molecular chain length for all solvent systems. N-alkane solubilities are lower for n-alkane like solvents. The width of the meta stable zone varies as a function of solvent in order of dodecane approx = pristane < decalin < m-xylene < dewaxed fuel, respectively. This zone expansion illustrates the active role played by the solvent on the nucleation process.

40|$|Powder coating is a dry coating technology, {{which has}} several {{advantages}} over conventional liquid coatings. However, wider applications were limited by its inferior surface finish and increased film thickness. Making powder finer (fine powder technology) can provide much better surface appearance and smaller film thickness comparable to liquid coating, but it’s {{much more difficult}} to produce fine powder products with narrow particle size distributions than coarse powder. Another issue that restricts the applications is its electrostatic spraying method, which limits the applications mainly to be with conductive substrates, like metals. In this study, to ensure a narrow particle size distribution of fine powder products, nine kinds of modification were conducted with the classifier of widely-used air classifying mill (ACM) by changing the air flow through it. For each kind of modification, the experiments were conducted under five operating conditions and were repeated for three times. According to the results of 150 samples, the particle sizes and particle size distributions of products were greatly affected by the classifier configuration. All nine kinds of modification showed better performance than the original classifier on narrowing particle size distributions, without compromising any collection efficiency. In addition, non-conductive plastics were employed as substrates in fine powder experiments, using two popular commercial coating powders. Results showed that lowering the particle sizes and narrowing particle size distributions of coating powders contributed to better surface finishes on the workpieces.

40|$|The major {{challenge}} in fine powder coating technology {{is to improve}} the flowability of powders, so that the fine particles can be fluidized, pneumatically transported and then sprayed onto substrates homogenously.

In this study, the concept of modified additives were exploited to improve the film quality and to enhance the performance of the modified additives on improving the flowability of the fine coating powders. The modified additives were produced by encapsulating the commercial nano-additives with three organic materials, epoxy, polyester and hybrid with a wet encapsulation method. The encapsulated additives were evaluated by TEM {{to make sure they are}} still in nano-scale.

40|$|Powder coating is a dry coating {{technology}} {{competing with}} conventional liquid coatings and offers many {{benefits such as}} the elimination of volatile organic compounds, high efficiency of material usage and improved coating durability. However, the rough and thick film surface restricts its wide application. The fine powder coating, which can solve the film quality issues, also has its own limitation: the powder is too cohesive to handle. Although, nanoparticle <b>flow</b> <b>additives</b> can significantly improve the flowability of fine powders, it leads to another obstacle at the same time. Since the inorganic nano additives are not fully compatible with the organic fine powder coating materials during the curing process, the agglomerates formed by nanoparticles can result in film defects such as seeds and pinholes, {{as well as the}} reduction of gloss. A technology of encapsulating polymer resins on the surface of nano silica additive is used for this work. By modifying the surface of the inorganic additives, the compatibility issues are expected to be solved while the effect of additive on flowabilities remains. The modified additives were prepared by encapsulating commercial nano silica additives with 2 organic materials, polyester or hybrid, in 4 different Resin-to-Encapsulated Additive ratios (R-EA ratios) and evaluated by TEM. The additives were incorporated into fine coating powders in 4 different additive loading ratios (LOAs).
