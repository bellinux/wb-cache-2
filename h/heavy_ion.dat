As a result, the resonance condition for <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> introduces distinctly different signatures in abundance, spectra, and intensity profiles, depending on ion mass and charge.

The Russian experiments were conducted in 2011, and no results were released, strongly implying that no ununennium atoms were identified. From April to September 2012, an attempt to synthesize the isotopes 295Uue and 296Uue was made by bombarding a target of berkelium-249 with titanium-50 at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for <b>Heavy</b> <b>Ion</b> Research in Darmstadt, Germany.

The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the tension on the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E

40|$|Background – The {{possibility}} of using high-energy accelerated heavy-ion beams in radiotherapy of malignant tumors {{is an exciting}} development. Also, <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> comprise {{an important component of}} cosmic rays. The DNA molecule should be an important candidate target in heavy ion-induced cell lethality. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and tumor suppressor p 53 are two important nuclear proteins that recognize <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> as a DNA damage signal. We studied the expression of PARP and p 53 in cultured mammalian cells exposed to accelerated <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> (Fe or Ar).

These particles also make {{an important contribution to}} radiation doses. Besides the practical applications, HIIS data will be used to study several important scientific questions. By measuring <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> that stop in HIIS, the anomalous component of cosmic rays can be studied, evidence can be searched for of <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> trapped in the earth's magnetic field and by comparing HISS data with observations from outside the magnetosphere, the mean ionic charge state can be determined of solar energetic particles.

5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became {{the director of the}} lab. He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists to shut down the lab. Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of the lab as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic <b>Heavy</b> <b>Ion</b> Collider, expanded the lab's program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program.|$|E
5|$|The Dubna team {{repeated}} the experiment in 2012, creating seven atoms of element 117 and confirming their earlier synthesis of element 118 (produced {{after some time}} when a significant quantity of the berkelium-249 target had beta decayed to californium-249). The results of the experiment matched the previous outcome; the scientists then filed an application to register the element. In May 2014, a joint German–American collaboration of scientists from the ORNL and the GSI Helmholtz Center for <b>Heavy</b> <b>Ion</b> Research in Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany, claimed to have confirmed discovery of the element.

5|$|The name {{seaborgium}} and symbol Sg {{were announced}} at the 207th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in March 1994 by Kenneth Hulet, one of the co-discovers. However, IUPAC resolved in August 1994 that an element could not be named after a living person, and Seaborg was still alive at the time. Thus, in September 1994, IUPAC recommended a set of names in which the names proposed by the three laboratories (the third being the GSI Helmholtz Centre for <b>Heavy</b> <b>Ion</b> Research in Darmstadt, Germany) with competing claims to the discovery for elements 104 to 109 were shifted to various other elements, in which rutherfordium (Rf), the Berkeley proposal for element 104, was shifted to element 106, with seaborgium being dropped entirely as a name.|$|E

The bursts were observed only during periods when the solar wind velocity was considerably higher than its nominal value. The characteristics of these ions, in particular their anisotropies, were examined. Using the well known formulae for transformation of distributions from the solar wind frame of reference to the spacecraft frame, the angular distributions expected from either protons, or <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> from the water group, were studied, showing that the measurements are consistent with <b>heavy</b> <b>ions,</b> and not with protons.

5|$|The {{probability}} {{of the creation}} of strangelets decreases at higher energies. As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> programs of the 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (in the range of 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies in the range of 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about as likely as producing an icecube in a furnace.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety of}} high energy {{particle}} collisions was {{a topic of}} widespread discussion and topical interest during {{the time when the}} Relativistic <b>Heavy</b> <b>Ion</b> Collider (RHIC) and later the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)—currently the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator—were being constructed and commissioned. Concerns arose that such high energy experiments—designed to produce novel particles and forms of matter—had the potential to create harmful states of matter or even doomsday scenarios. Claims escalated as commissioning of the LHC drew closer, around 2008–2010. The claimed dangers included the production of stable micro black holes and the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets, and these questions were explored in the media, on the Internet and at times through the courts.|$|E
5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of einsteinium {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> target {{is attached to a}} thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|E

5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for <b>Heavy</b> <b>Ion</b> Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E
