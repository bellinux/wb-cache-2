500|$|By lap 39, Alonso {{had reduced}} the time deficit {{between himself and}} Massa as the latter was lapping the two Virgin cars. At the start of lap 40, Massa held a 1.2 second lead over Alonso, who in turn, was 5.2 seconds in front of Vettel. Hamilton in fourth place was 18.1 seconds behind the race, but was {{maintaining}} a steady gap to teammate Button in fifth. Webber was told by Red Bull over the radio {{to increase the gap}} to Button, because his car was suffering from an issue with its oil consumption, and was told that braking harder into the track's turns would possibly assist in moving some oil around the inside of his car. Petrov made an error which allowed Kobayashi to take advantage but Petrov held off the challenge. A radio transmission from Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley was intercepted on lap 48, with Smedley telling Massa, [...] "OK, so, Fernando (Alonso) is <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> Can you confirm you understood that message?" [...] Based on Smedley's tone, commentators surmised that it had been a coded message from engineer to driver telling Massa to move over and allow Alonso through.|$|E
500|$|The borough has a {{place in}} several American idioms. The phrase [...] is meant to convey an {{extremely}} short time such as an instant, sometimes in hyperbolic form, as in [...] "perhaps <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> would believe is possible," [...] referring to the rapid pace of life in Manhattan. The expression [...] "melting pot" [...] was first popularly coined to describe the densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side in Israel Zangwill's play The Melting Pot, which was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet set by Zangwill in New York City in 1908. The iconic Flatiron Building {{is said to have}} been the source of the phrase [...] "23 skidoo" [...] or scram, from what cops would shout at men who tried to get glimpses of women's dresses being blown up by the winds created by the triangular building. The [...] "Big Apple" [...] dates back to the 1920s, when a reporter heard the term used by New Orleans stablehands to refer to New York City's horse racetracks and named his racing column [...] "Around The Big Apple." [...] Jazz musicians adopted the term to refer to the city as the world's jazz capital, and a 1970s ad campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau helped popularize the term.|$|E
500|$|There {{was wide}} {{commentary}} {{in the news}} media about the social situation in and around Moston. Writing in The Times, Jon Ronson focused on Manchester's apparent economic imbalance, pointing out that while [...] "superficially, it is a city of growth" [...] — hosting international environmental conferences in 1993 and bidding to host the 2000 Olympic Games — this could not disguise the realities of the poor quality of [...] "built-to-collapse" [...] housing, the city council's policy on homelessness, poverty, street violence and drug culture, all of which played parts in the events leading up to Capper's murder. The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where [...] "you can expect to be mugged," [...] created through drug abuse and hopelessness, and populated by people who [...] "don't work, have no money, and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark." [...] Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where [...] "expensive canal-side cafes are springing up <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> can count them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at the corpses floating past." [...] David Ward, writing in The Guardian, similarly drew attention to the housing policies, and quoted an older Moston resident as saying: [...] "These people are moving in and out every three months. They're illiterate half of them — just shagging and having kids." [...] The Daily Mail – in what Barker and Petley called [...] "ideological overdrive" [...] – described Capper's killers as [...] "the product of a society that tolerates petty crime, the break-up of families and feckless spending... Most of Suzanne's tormentors were on social security... an underclass which is a grave threat to Britain's future." [...] Author Carol Anne Davis agreed that when looking for answers about how this crime came about one need only [...] "look at the upbringings of these women who were single parents to three children by their mid twenties, had teenage boyfriends who were barely legal and who supported themselves through drug dealing and theft." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{people might}} {{react to a}} {{direction}} by thinking [...] "why should I?" [...] or [...] "You can't make me", called a polarity response because it motivates the subject to consider the polar opposite of the suggestion. The conscious mind recognizes negation in speech ("Don't do X") but according to Erickson, the unconscious mind pays {{more attention to the}} [...] "X" [...] than the injunction [...] "Don't do". Erickson thus used this as the basis for suggestions that deliberately played on negation and tonally marked the important wording, to provide that whatever the client did, it was beneficial: [...] "You don't have to go into a trance, so you can easily wonder about what you notice no <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> feel ready to become aware that your hand is slowly rising....." ...|$|E

I'm <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are now. You're damaged goods." [...] Ali, already afflicted with Parkinson's, insisted that he remained faster than Frazier and pointing to a heavy bag suggested a contest of who can hit the bag the fastest. Frazier immediately took off his coat, and moving to the bag, threw a dozen rapid punches at it accompanied by loud grunts. Without removing his coat, Ali strolled towards the bag, held the ready stance, mimicked a Frazier grunt without throwing a punch, and then addressed Frazier with the words [...] "Wanna see it again, Joe?" [...] Everyone laughed, except Frazier.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2010 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Alonso became {{involved}} in a controversy with teammate Massa, as Ferrari were accused of using team orders during the race. The incident started when Massa was leading the race and defended his pole position when Alonso tried to overtake him. Alonso said [...] "This is ridiculous" [...] on the team radio, supposedly complaining about Massa. Ferrari engineer Rob Smedley then contacted Massa through radio to say [...] "Fernando is <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> Can you confirm you understood that message?". Shortly after this, Massa slowed down and was overtaken by Alonso {{in what appeared to}} be team orders. Shortly after the race notable people of the senior personnel in Ferrari, Massa and Alonso were summoned to the stewards. The matter was then referred to the FIA World Motor Sport Council and Ferrari were given a $100,000 fine but the result of the race was unchanged.|$|E

2500|$|The three {{following}} songs, [...] "Halogen (I Could Be a Shadow)", [...] "Future Sick", and [...] "Suns Irrupt", follow {{three different}} types of forgetting a breakup. Reminiscent of music released in the New Romanticism period, [...] "Halogen (I Could Be a Shadow)" [...] was described by Méndez as [...] "a spectacularly enveloping piece," [...] with its somber instrumentation of [...] "steady, comforting percussion, delicate, inviting synths, and vintage girl group-evoking background vocals" [...] resulting in [...] "a gorgeous vessel for ecstatic release". Fitzmaurice described it as the [...] "near-double" [...] of [...] "Kim and Jessie" [...] by M83, Aizlewood compared the song to {{the works of the}} Thompson Twins, while Phares said the song sounded like music that would [...] "play over the credits of a sci-fi teen sex comedy". With its [...] "seasick synths" [...] as well as [...] "bits of arena rock guitar and girlish harmonies", the heavy, playfully sad [...] "Future Sick" [...] manages to convey [...] "the feeling of growing older in a world that's growing <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are". It depicts Palomo lamenting [...] "mid-volume under his own creation's drunken abstraction" [...] about wanting {{to go back into the}} past, because thinking of the future is making him ill. It is at this point where, according to The Observer, some of the wooziness that Era Extraña takes from Psychic Chasms [...] "veers into nausea". Mitchell described the instrumentation of [...] "Suns Irrupt" [...] as [...] "hypnotic and firework fizzling synths with a woozy synth background". Palomo repeatedly whisper-growls the line [...] "sSuns irrupt / I wake up I wake up", and Fitzmaurice compared its repetitiveness to [...] "Someone Great" [...] by LCD Soundsystem.|$|E

40|$|When {{moving from}} a {{starting}} position to a single target, movement time is <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> when <b>you</b> must continue the movement on to a second target (i. e., one-target advantage). Processes underlying both the movement integration and constraint hypotheses account for the preparation and control of sequential aiming movements. In the present experiments, we investigate {{the time course of}} these processes by varying the number of targets and target size during movement preparation and execution. Aiming movements with a stylus to one or two targets on a horizontally positioned touch screen were performed. Results revealed the emergence of the OTA only when participants knew the number of targets in advance of target presentation.
