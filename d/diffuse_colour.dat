40|$|We {{present an}} {{interactive}} approach for decompositing bitmap drawings and studio photographs into opaque and semi-transparent vector layers. Semi-transparent layers are especially challenging to extract, since they require the inversion of the non-linear compositing equation. We make this problem tractable by exploiting the parametric nature of vector gradients, jointly separating and vectorising semi-transparent regions. Specifically, we constrain the foreground colours to {{vary according to}} linear or radial parametric gradients, restricting the number of unknowns and allowing our system to efficiently solve for an editable semi-transparent foreground. We propose a progressive workflow, where the user successively selects a semi-transparent or opaque region in the bitmap, which our algorithm separates as a foreground vector gradient and a background bitmap layer. The user can choose to decompose the background further or vectorise it as an opaque layer. The resulting layered vector representation allows a variety of edits, such as modifying the shape of highlights, adding texture to an object or changing its <b>diffuse</b> <b>colour...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} serious adverse events {{potentially}} occurring during vertebroplasty is cement leakage. Associated risks for the patient could be reduced if cement filling is preoperatively planned. This requires a better understanding of cement flow behaviour. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate bone cement distribution in artificial inhomogeneous cancellous bone structures during a simulated stepwise injection procedure. Methods: Four differently coloured 1 -mL cement portions were injected stepwise into six open-porous aluminum foam models with simulated leakage paths. Each model was subsequently cross-sectioned and high-resolution pictures were taken, followed by anatomical site allocation based on the assumption about a posterior insertion of the cannula. A radial grid consisting of 36 equidistant beams (0 °– 350 °) was applied to evaluate the cement flow along each beam by measuring the radial length of each cement portion (total length) and of all four portions together (distance to border). Independently from the injection measurements, the viscosity of 20 cement portions was measured at time points corresponding to the start of the first and the end of the last injection. Results: Despite some <b>diffuse</b> <b>colour</b> transitions at the borderlines, no interfusion between the differently coloured cement portions was observed. The two highest values for total length of each of the first three injected cement portions and for distance to border were indicated in directions anterior bilateral to the cannula along the 120 °, 240 ° and 250 ° beams and posterolateral along the 60 ° beam. The two highest total lengths for the fourth cement portion were registered in the direction of the cannula along the 170 ° and 180 ° beams. Standard deviations of total length for each of the last three injected portions and for distance to border were with two highest values in directions anterior bilateral to the cannula along the 120 °, 150 °, 240 ° and 250 ° beams and opposite to the direction of the cannula along the 10 ° beam. The two highest values for the first cement portion were registered posterior bilateral to the cannula along the 70 ° and 350 ° beams. The values for averaged standard deviations of the total length of the fourth cement portion and the distance to border were significantly higher in comparison to the first cement portion (p ≤  0. 020). Dynamic viscosity at the start of the first injection was 343  ±  108  Pa∙s and increased to 659  ±  208  Pa∙s at the end of the fourth injection. Conclusion: The simulated leakage path seemed to be the most important adverse injection factor influencing the uniformity of cement distribution. Another adverse factor causing dispersion of this distribution was represented by the simulated bone marrow. However, the rather uniform distribution of the totally injected cement amount, considered as one unit, could be ascribed to the medium viscosity of the used cement. Finally, with its short waiting time of 45  s, the stepwise injection procedure was shown to be ineffective in preventing cement leakage...|$|E

He painted still lifes, seascapes, and landscapes, which were new genres in Croatian art at the time. His palette became lighter and brighter as he worked outdoors: browns, greys and dull greens became purer, and were joined the purple of heather, the yellow of broom, and the rich array of blues of the sea. Abandoning his previously detailed style, his smaller studies from nature are more creative. With thick impasto and impulsive brush strokes, around 1907 a new style emerged in his work – pointillism in a light, bright colours, that he used for his landscapes of Pelješac. Initially (1908–1912), these were disciplined strokes on larger canvases, but in his later (1914–1918), smaller paintings with impressionistically captured motifs, the strokes became softer and more <b>diffuse</b> <b>colours.</b> He {{was one of the}} first Croatian artists to paint the coastal landscapes, and it dominated his work after the turn of the century.|$|R

30|$|The {{state of}} {{conservation}} of Crevoladossola {{is characterized by the}} presence of a <b>diffused</b> <b>colour</b> alteration which is responsible for the current dark to light grey appearance of the originally white stone blocks (Fig.  1 d). The altered blocks also show reduced granular cohesion so that mild mechanical actions on the surfaces result in grain detachments and powdering. The combined action of atmospheric corrosion and thermal weathering on the dolomitic matrix causes intergranular crack formation and enhanced chemical dissolution along the grain borders and the cleavage plane (Fig.  1 e) [1, 44]. These last appear deeply corroded forming fissures and micro-cracks which can cross the grains almost up to their entire thickness (Fig.  1 f). The cross-section observation (Fig.  1 f) does not show the presence of a continuous superficial deposition; on the other hand, the surface discontinuities and micro-fissures appear partly filled by soil dust and particulate matter which can be responsible for the observed colour alteration. Given the previously discussed conditions, the most external and altered stone material has to be considered unstable and loss of material occurs {{as a result of the}} rain wash. Where the erosive mechanism is particularly active, namely along the borders and edges of the blocks, a remarkable surface recession is observed. In such condition, the resulting surface still suffers from granular disaggregation and it is characterized by a lighter colour due to the removal of the superficial altered stone material (Fig.  1 d).|$|R

40|$|Vector {{graphics}} provides powerful {{tools for}} drawing scalable 2 D imagery. With {{the rise of}} mobile computers, {{of different types of}} displays and image resolutions, vector graphics is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, vector graphics is not the leading framework for creating and manipulating 2 D imagery. The reason for this reluctance of employing vector graphical frameworks is {{that it is difficult to}} handle complex behaviour of colour across the 2 D domain. A challenging problem within vector graphics is to define smooth colour functions across the image. In previous work, two approaches exist. The first approach, known as diffusion curves, <b>diffuses</b> <b>colours</b> from a set of input curves and points. The second approach, known as gradient meshes, defines smooth colour functions from control meshes. These two approaches are incompatible: diffusion curves do not support the local behaviour provided by gradient meshes and gradient meshes do not support freeform curves as input. My research aims to narrow the gap between diffusion curves and gradient meshes. With this aim in mind, I propose solutions to create control meshes from freeform curves. I demonstrate that these control meshes can be used to render a vector primitive similar to diffusion curves using subdivision surfaces. With the use of subdivision surfaces, instead of a diffusion process, colour gradients can be locally controlled using colour-gradient curves associated with the input curves. The advantage of local control is further explored in the setting of vector-centric image processing. I demonstrate that a certain contrast enhancement profile, known as the Cornsweet profile, can be modelled via surfaces in images. This approach does not produce saturation artefacts related with previous filter-based methods. Additionally, I demonstrate various approaches to artistic filtering, where the artist locally models given artistic effects. Gradient meshes are restricted to rectangular topology of the control meshes. I argue that this restriction hinders the applicability of the approach and its potential to be used with control meshes extracted from freeform curves. To this end, I propose a mesh-based vector primitive that supports arbitrary manifold topology of the mesh...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of space debris was {{recently}} discovered by Schildknecht in near -geosynchronous o r b i t (GEO). These objects were later identified as exhibiting properties associated with high area-to-mass ratio (HAMR) objects. According to their brightness magnitudes (light curve), shapes, high rotation rates and composition properties (albedo, amount of specular and <b>diffuse</b> reflection, <b>colour,</b> etc), {{it is thought that}} these objects are multi-layer insulation (MLI). Observations have shown that this debris type is very sensitive to environmental disturbances, particularly solar radiation pressure, {{due to the fact that}} their shapes are easily deformed leading to changes in the AMR. This paper proposes a simple yet effective model of the thin, deformable membrane based on a multi-body dynamics. The membrane is modelled as a series of flat plates, connected through flexible joints, representing the flexibility of the membrane itself. The mass of the membrane, albeit low, is taken into account with lump masses in the joints. The dynamic equations for the masses, including the constraints defined by the connecting flat plates, are derived using fundamental Newtonian mechanics. The physical properties of the objects required by the model (membrane density, reflectivity, composition, etc.), are assumed to be those of multi-layer insulation. This flexible membrane model is then propagated together with classical orbital and attitude equations of motion near a GEO to predict the orbital evolution under the perturbations of solar radiation pressure, Earth gravity field, third bodies (Sun and the Moon) and self-shadowing from deformation. These results are then compared to a rigid body model...|$|R

40|$|When {{we look at}} {{everyday}} things, we {{not only}} perceive their 3 D shape and identity, but also we generally enjoy a distinct visual impression of their material properties. Without touching an object, we can usually tell at a glance whether it is soggy or dry, soft or hard, smooth or rough. How does the visual system recognize materials? What are the major challenges that the visual system faces? Despite the enormous variety and vividness of material perception, it is only just beginning to emerge as a major topic of study in vision research [e. g. 1 – 7]. Here I present a framework for understanding human visual perception of materials and introduce a number of novel demonstrations of our visual aptitude for estimating material properties. The main thesis I will present is that despite our exquisite sensitivity to changes in physical states (e. g. subtle changes in appearance allow us {{to tell the difference}} between fresh and stale bread) the visual system does not generally estimate the intrinsic physical attributes of materials (e. g. density or coefficient of viscosity). Instead, it adopts a heuristic strategy for classifying material appearance based on the statistical behaviour of materials in our environment. In the real world, the observed appearance of a material is subject to constraints such as gravity and natural illumination conditions. Consequently, there exists a large set of simple low-level image measurements (e. g. contrast distributions, amplitude spectra, optic flow patterns, etc.) that reliably correlate with changes in physical state. I will present a taxonomy that organizes these cues, and embed all extant research on material perception within this framework. Broadly I organize the cues into three classes: (1) optical cues, i. e., information arising from the manner in which a material interacts with light, such as its specular reflectance, or sub-surface scattering coefficients. This class of cues has received the most attention, as there is a considerable body of work on the estimation of <b>diffuse</b> albedo and <b>colour.</b> (2) geometric cues, i. e., the characteristic 3 D shapes adopted by a material subject to natural forces. (3) dynamic cues, i. e., the way that a material tends to change shape over time or interact with other objects in the scene. I use a variety of physics-based computer graphics simulations to demonstrate these cues and their low-level correlates. Finally I show circumstances under which high-level (cognitive) factors can influence our perception of materials...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of space debris was {{recently}} discovered by Schildknecht in near -geosynchronous orbit (GEO). These objects were later identified as exhibiting properties associated with High Area-to-Mass ratio (HAMR) objects. According to their brightness magnitudes (light curve), high rotation rates and composition properties (albedo, amount of specular and <b>diffuse</b> reflection, <b>colour,</b> etc), {{it is thought that}} these objects are multilayer insulation (MLI). Observations have shown that this debris type is very sensitive to environmental disturbances, particularly solar radiation pressure, {{due to the fact that}} their shapes are easily deformed leading to changes in the Area-to-Mass ratio (AMR) over time. This thesis proposes a simple effective flexible model of the thin, deformable membrane with two different methods. Firstly, this debris is modelled with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) by using Bernoulli-Euler theory called “Bernoulli model”. The Bernoulli model is constructed with beam elements consisting 2 nodes and each node has six degrees of freedom (DoF). The mass of membrane is distributed in beam elements. Secondly, the debris based on multibody dynamics theory call “Multibody model” is modelled as a series of lump masses, connected through flexible joints, representing the flexibility of the membrane itself. The mass of the membrane, albeit low, is taken into account with lump masses in the joints. The dynamic equations for the masses, including the constraints defined by the connecting rigid rod, are derived using fundamental Newtonian mechanics. The physical properties of both flexible models required by the models (membrane density, reflectivity, composition, etc.), are assumed to be those of multilayer insulation. Both flexible membrane models are then propagated together with classical orbital and attitude equations of motion near GEO region to predict the orbital evolution under the perturbations of solar radiation pressure, Earth’s gravity field, luni-solar gravitational fields and self-shadowing effect. These results are then compared to two rigid body models (cannonball and flat rigid plate). In this investigation, when comparing with a rigid model, the evolutions of orbital elements of the flexible models indicate the difference of inclination and secular eccentricity evolutions, rapid irregular attitude motion and unstable cross-section area due to a deformation over time. Then, the Monte Carlo simulations by varying initial attitude dynamics and deformed angle are investigated and compared with rigid models over 100 days. As the results of the simulations, the different initial conditions provide unique orbital motions, which is significantly different in term of orbital motions of both rigid models. Furthermore, this thesis presents a methodology to determine the material dynamic properties of thin membranes and validates the deformation of the multibody model with real MLI materials. Experiments are performed in a high vacuum chamber (10 - 4 mbar) replicating space environment. A thin membrane is hinged at one end but free at the other. The free motion experiment, the first experiment, is a free vibration test to determine the damping coefficient and natural frequency of the thin membrane. In this test, the membrane is allowed to fall freely in the chamber with the motion tracked and captured through high velocity video frames. A Kalman filter technique is implemented in the tracking algorithm to reduce noise and increase the tracking accuracy of the oscillating motion. The forced motion experiment, the last test, is performed to determine the deformation characteristics of the object. A high power spotlight (500 - 2000 W) is used to illuminate the MLI and the displacements are measured by means of a high resolution laser sensor. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and multibody dynamics of the experimental setups are used for the validation of the flexible model by comparing with the experimental results of displacements and natural frequencies...|$|R
6000|$|For, curiously enough, {{while the}} first half of the romance is a scene of disorderly passion, the second is the glorification of the family. A modern writer of genius has inveighed with {{whimsical}} bitterness against the character of Wolmar,--supposed, we may notice in passing, to be partially drawn from D'Holbach,--a man performing so long an experiment on these two souls, with the terrible curiosity of a surgeon engaged in vivisection.[54] It was, however, much less difficult for contemporaries than it is for us to accept so unwholesome and prurient a situation. They forgot all the evil that was in it, in the charm of the account of Wolmar's active, peaceful, frugal, sunny household. The influence of this was immense.[55] It may be that the overstrained scene where Saint Preux waits for Julie in her room, suggested the far lovelier passage of Faust in the chamber of the hapless Margaret. But we may, at least, be sure that Werther (1774) would not have found Charlotte cutting bread and butter, if Saint Preux had not gone to see Julie take cream and cakes with her children and her female servants. And perhaps the other and nobler Charlotte of the Wahlverwandtschaften (1809) would not have detained us so long with her moss hut, her terrace, her park prospect, if Julie had not had her elysium, where the sweet freshness of the air, the cool shadows, the shining verdure, flowers <b>diffusing</b> fragrance and <b>colour,</b> water running with soft whisper, and the song of a thousand birds, reminded the returned traveller of Tinian and Juan Fernandez. There is an animation, a variety, an accuracy, a realistic brightness in this picture, which will always make it enchanting, even to those who cannot make their way through any other letter in the New Heloïsa.[56] Such qualities place it as an idyllic piece far above such pieces in Goethe's two famous romances. They have a clearness and spontaneous freshness which are not among the bountiful gifts of Goethe. There are other admirable landscapes in the New Heloïsa, though not too many of them, and the minute and careful way in which Rousseau made their features real to himself, is accidentally shown in his urgent prayer for exactitude in the engraving of the striking scene where Saint Preux and Julie visit the monuments of their old love for one another.[57] [...] "I have traversed all Rousseau's ground with the Heloïsa before me," [...] said Byron, [...] "and am struck to a degree I cannot express, with the force and accuracy of his descriptions and the beauty of their reality."[58] They were memories made true by long dreaming, by endless brooding. The painter lived with these scenes ever present to the inner eye. They were his real world, of which the tamer world of meadow and woodland actually around him only gave suggestion. He thought of the green steeps, the rocks, the mountain pines, the waters of the lake, [...] "the populous solitude of bees and birds," [...] as of some divine presence, too sublime for personality. And they were always benign, standing in relief with the malignity or folly of the hurtful insect, Man. He was never a manichæan towards nature. To him she was all good and bounteous. The demon forces that so fascinated Byron were to Rousseau invisible. These were the compositions that presently inspired the landscapes of Paul and Virginia (1788), of Atala and René (1801), and of Obermann (1804), as well as those punier imitators who resemble their masters as the hymns of a methodist negro resemble the psalms of David. They were the outcome of eager and spontaneous feeling for nature, and not the mere hackneyed common-form and inflated description of the literary pastoral.[59] ...|$|R
