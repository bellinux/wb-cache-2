25|$|The Nokia 770 Internet Tablet is a {{wireless}} Internet appliance from Nokia, originally {{announced at the}} LinuxWorld Summit in New York City on 25 May 2005. It is designed for wireless Internet browsing and e-mail functions and includes software such as Internet radio, an RSS news reader, ebook reader, <b>image</b> <b>viewer</b> and media players for selected types of media.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} desktop environment, version 4.7 updates many {{applications}} within the Software Compilation. Dolphin file manager has been updated {{to include a}} cleaner user interface. Marble, the virtual globe software, now supports voice navigation, a map creation wizard, {{as well as many}} new plugins. Gwenview <b>image</b> <b>viewer</b> now allows users to compare two or more photos side by side. The Kontact database has also been ported to Akonadi which allows the database to be easily accessible from other applications. Furthermore, the KMail database has also been ported to Akonadi. DigiKam has been updated to support face detection, image versioning, and image tagging. Other applications such as Kate, Kalzium, KAlgebra, KStars, and KDevelop have also been updated in this release. Moreover, version 4.7 fixed over 12,000 bugs.|$|E
500|$|Further {{interface}} behavior {{changes are}} made on the April 2014 [...] "Windows 8.1 Update", which are oriented towards non-touch environments (such as desktop and laptop PCs) that use a keyboard and mouse, and improve integration between Windows Store apps and the desktop. When a mouse is in use, the Desktop is shown on startup by default, the Start screen uses context menus instead of a toolbar {{across the bottom of}} the screen for manipulating tiles, an autohiding title bar with minimize and close buttons is displayed within apps at the top of the screen, the taskbar can display and pin apps alongside desktop programs and be accessed from within apps, and visible search and power buttons are added to the Start screen. In non-touch environments, the default <b>image</b> <b>viewer</b> and media player programs were changed back to Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Player in lieu of the Xbox Video and Photos apps.|$|E
50|$|<b>Image</b> <b>viewers</b> give maximal {{flexibility}} {{to the user}} by providing a direct view of the directory structure available on a hard disk. Most <b>image</b> <b>viewers</b> do not provide any kind of automatic organization of pictures and therefore the burden remains on the user to create and maintain their folder structure (using tag- or folder-based methods). However, some <b>image</b> <b>viewers</b> also have features for organizing images, especially an image database, and hence {{can also be used}} as image organizers.|$|R

40|$|Data carving is {{generally}} used to recover deleted images in digital investigations, but carving {{time can be}} significant and the deleted images may have been overwritten. Thus, thumbnails of (deleted) images are an alternative evidence,and can often be found within databases created by either operating systems or <b>image</b> <b>viewers.</b> Existing literature generally focus on the extraction of thumbnails from databases created by the operating system. Understanding thumbnails created by image reviewers is relatively understudied. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new approach of automating extraction of thumbnails produced by <b>image</b> <b>viewers.</b> We then evaluate the utility of our approach using popular <b>image</b> <b>viewers...</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1988, Bridges {{authored}} a freeware <b>image</b> <b>viewer</b> {{program called}} PICEM. Other image viewers {{at the time}} were commercial. [...] PICEM also allowed the user to adjust images' brightness and contrast and to save the image being viewed to other formats including the BSAVE (graphics image format). PICEM became popular enough that Microsoft offered tech help in using it in conjunction with QuickBasic.|$|E
2500|$|Even with {{cost-saving}} measures in place, Nintendo priced the Virtual Boy {{at a relatively}} high [...] Though slightly less expensive and significantly less powerful than a home console, this was considerably more costly than the Game Boy handheld. With seemingly more advanced graphics than Game Boy, the Virtual Boy {{was not intended to}} replace the handheld in Nintendo's product line, as use of the Virtual Boy requires a steady surface and completely blocks the player's peripheral vision. Design News described the Virtual Boy as the logical evolution of the View-Master 3D <b>image</b> <b>viewer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Image editing {{software}} also commonly includes tools for adjusting colors {{with reference to}} HSL or HSV coordinates, or to coordinates in a model based on the [...] "intensity" [...] or luma defined above. In particular, tools {{with a pair of}} [...] "hue" [...] and [...] "saturation" [...] sliders are commonplace, dating to at least the late-1980s, but various more complicated color tools have also been implemented. For instance, the Unix <b>image</b> <b>viewer</b> and color editor xv allowed six user-definable hue (H) ranges to be rotated and resized, included a dial-like control for saturation (S'HSV), and a curves-like interface for controlling value (V)â€”see fig. 17. The image editor Picture Window Pro includes a [...] "color correction" [...] tool which affords complex remapping of points in a hue/saturation plane relative to either HSL or HSV space.|$|E

A comparison of <b>image</b> <b>viewers</b> reveals that many freely available software packages are available that offer {{most of the}} organization features available in commercial software.

40|$|Today, {{in digital}} forensics, images {{normally}} provide important information within an investigation. However, not all images {{may still be}} available within a forensic digital investigation as they were all deleted for example. Data carving {{can be used in}} this case to retrieve deleted images but the carving time is normally significant and these images can be moreover overwritten by other data. One of the solutions is to look at thumbnails of images that are no longer available. These thumbnails can often be found within databases created by either operating systems or <b>image</b> <b>viewers.</b> In literature, most research and practical focus on the extraction of thumbnails from databases created by the operating system. There is a little research working on the thumbnails created by the image reviewers as these thumbnails are application-driven in terms of pre-defined sizes, adjustments and storage location. Eventually, thumbnail databases from <b>image</b> <b>viewers</b> are significant forensic artefacts for investigators as these programs deal with large amounts of images. However, investigating these databases so far is still manual or semi-automatic task that leads to the huge amount of forensic time. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new approach of automating extraction of thumbnails produced by <b>image</b> <b>viewers.</b> We also test our approach with popular <b>image</b> <b>viewers</b> in different storage structures and locations to show its robustness...|$|R

5000|$|Manual image organizers. This kind of {{software}} provides a direct {{view of the}} folders present on a user's hard disk. Sometimes referred to as <b>image</b> <b>viewers,</b> they allow the user only to see the pictures but do not provide any automatic organization features. They give maximum flexibility to a user and show exactly what the user has created on his hard drive. While they provide maximum flexibility, manual organizers rely on the user to have his/her own method to organize their pictures. Currently {{there are two main}} methods for organizing pictures manually: tag and folder based methods. While not mutually exclusive, these methods are different in their methodology, outcome and purpose. Presently, many commercial image organizers offer both automatic and manual image organization features. A comparison of <b>image</b> <b>viewers</b> reveals that many free software packages are available that offer most of the organization features available in commercial software.|$|R
