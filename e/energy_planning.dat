40|$|Swedish {{legislation}} requires municipalities {{to produce}} an <b>energy</b> <b>plan.</b> Each municipal government is required to prepare and maintain {{a plan for the}} supply, distribution, and use of energy. Legislation also requires an assessment of the environmental impacts of any activities before implementation. Whether municipal <b>energy</b> <b>plans</b> have contributed to or preferably controlled the development of local energy systems has been a subject for debate. In the research project "Strategic Environmental Assessment of Local Energy Systems", financed by the Swedish Energy Agency, the municipal <b>energy</b> <b>plan</b> as a tool for developing local energy systems is studied. In this study, twelve municipal <b>energy</b> <b>plans</b> from Östergötland County in southern Sweden have been analysed. Different kinds of municipalities are represented in this county. The analysis has been based on a number of questions in different categories assessing energy system characteristics, environmental impact assessment and aims, the planning process, and goals for the plans.

2500|$|The {{establishment}} of the new competitive market failed: the distribution networks were not unbundled and privatized, and ENEE continued operating as a vertically integrated state-owned enterprise that maintained its central role in <b>energy</b> <b>planning</b> and policy making. [...] In addition, the principles of cost covering tariffs and targeted subsidies were not properly implemented due both to inadequate political commitment and to an important dependency on imported oil for power generation, which led to high and volatile generation prices that were not passed on to retail tariffs.|$|E

50|$|Approaches to <b>energy</b> <b>{{planning}}</b> {{depends on}} the planning agent and {{the scope of the}} exercise. Several catch-phrases are associated with <b>energy</b> <b>planning.</b> Basic to all is resource planning, i.e. a view of the possible sources of energy in the future. A forking in methods is whether the planner considers the possibility of influencing the consumption (demand) for energy. The 1970s energy crisis ended a period of relatively stable energy prices and stable supply-demand relation. Concepts of Demand Side Management, Least Cost Planning and Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) emerged with new emphasis on the need to reduce energy demand by new technologies or simple energy saving.|$|E

40|$|Increasing global {{environmental}} problems require a rapid response from universities (Sharp, 2002). Energy consumption of universities is increasing due to, for example, expansion in use of electronics and new building constructions (Levine, 2009; Sharp, 2002). There are {{increasing numbers of}} initiatives on university campuses to address climate change. The American College and University President 2 ̆ 7 s Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) is an effort {{by a group of}} colleges and universities that have pledged to eliminate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their campus operations and become carbon neutral by a target date set by each university itself (ACUPCC, 2006). This research presented an optimization approach to help decision makers of universities find an optimal <b>energy</b> <b>plan</b> that meet their environmental goals while minimizing costs associated with those <b>energy</b> <b>plans.</b> The optimization approach takes into consideration annual energy demand, budget constraints, and environmental constraints. This study analyzed the usefulness of a long-term planning approach. The results showed that a single long-term <b>energy</b> <b>plan</b> was better than integrated multiple short-term <b>energy</b> <b>plans</b> for a given planning horizon. However, long-term <b>energy</b> <b>plans</b> required higher capital investments. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyze uncertainties associated with natural gas, electricity, and carbon prices. The optimization approach developed in this work can be used by university decision makers to make long-term decisions to meet their environmental goals in a cost effective manner...|$|R
