25|$|Stance width helps {{determine}} the rider's {{balance on the}} board. The size of the rider {{is an important factor}} as well as the style of their riding when determining a proper stance width. A common measurement used for new riders is to position the bindings so that the feet are placed a little wider than shoulder width apart. Another, less orthodox form of measurement may be taken by putting your feet together and place your hands, palm down, on the ground <b>in</b> a straight <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> body by squatting down. This generally gives a good natural measurement for how wide of a base your body uses to properly balance itself when knees are bent. However, personal preference and comfort are important and most experienced riders will adjust the stance width to personal preference. Skateboarders should find that their snowboarding and skateboarding stance widths are relatively similar.|$|R

40|$|PaLMS Feto-Maternal Medicine Laboratory {{has been}} {{receiving}} {{an increasing number}} of requests to perform first trimester screening in twin pregnancy. It has been the standard practice of the laboratory not to perform serum screening in addition to nuchal translucency assessment of twin pregnancies due to the uncertainty of its clinical usefulness. The reasons for these uncertainties are: 1. Twin pregnancies seem to be at a lower overall risk of aneuploidy compared with women of a similar age who have singleton pregnancies. 1 2. The relative contribution of each feto-placental unit to the final blood test is uncertain. 3. The rigor with which the sensitivity and specificity of the test has been established in twin gestations is far less than that applied to singleton pregnancies. Even those who advocate calculating a risk have calculated it as a pseudo-risk because the advocates concede that the true risk cannot be estimated in twin pregnancies. 2 Although these uncertainties exist our laboratory has decided to alter the standard practice and perform first trimester screening in twin pregnancies on request. It will be up to the individual referrers and clinicians to ascertain the clinical usefulness of the result {{in the presence of a}} twin pregnancy. How the serum screening results affects clinical decision-making would be of interest to the laboratory. Should you decide to incorporate serum screening into risk assessment for twin pregnancies we ask that you inform us of how this has changed clinical management. To assist clinicians in providing such feedback we will be distributing a feedback form.

40|$|Introduction The marking {{criteria}} for the dissertation is likely to carry different weightings for the grading of this chapter in your dissertation thesis, to that of your research proposal (See Feather, 2010, on How to Write an Undergraduate Marketing Dissertation Proposal). For example, here at The Business School at the University of Huddersfield, there is more weighting given to the methodology in the proposal, than in the main disseration. The reasoning behind this, is that, {{if you can get}} it right for the proposal, it should be straight forward when it comes to the research methodology chapter in the thesis, as you may be just changing it a little depending upon what has impacted on your research whilst you were undertaking the primary data collection, and writing up the various chapters of your thesis. Therefore, you may be in a position where you are simply tightening up your writing <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> supervisor’s comments, the feedback you received on this section in your proposal, and changing the pre-tense to the past-tense. Having said this, in all my years of experience supervising and grading students’ work, this chapter appears to be the weak link in the chain of writing for the undergraduate dissertation. Mainly, because it may be the first time that students have been introduced to such concepts of phenomenology, interpretivism, epistimology, feminism, action reseach, positivsim and so on. These are very scary words to some students (Quinlan, 2011), but you should not be put off by these words, as it is these words, and the knowledge acquired by reading, understanding and applying these words that will make your work stand out, and possibly gain you those extra marks you feel you may need in order to meet your desired objective. That is, in obtaining a good grade for your dissertation that counts towards your degree classification. Some dissertations (at some institutions), are 40 credit modules, and therefore, are equivalent to two 20 credit modules. So it is important that you get this part right, as it is your plan of action, or, how you intend to undertake (pre-tense for the proposal), or have taken (past-tense for the dissertation), for your chosen research subject...|$|E
40|$|Consumer {{researchers}} are increasingly {{concerned with the}} well-being of consumers. In recent years, we have embraced well-being as an independent topic of study, an important implication of marketing practices, and a pursuit predictive of judgment and behavior. Yet, the variety {{of ways in which}} we measure and define well-being are increasing and sometimes contradictory and lead to contradictory results. In my dissertation, I propose that consumer well-being is best studied as a multi-dimensional dynamic process. In the first essay, I use this dynamic conceptualization to examine how well-being changes over the lifespan. This question has received {{a great deal of attention}} in psychology, economics, sociology, and philosophy but prior work has produced equivocal results. I contribute to this important debate by testing a new method of measuring and studying well-being, one that measures multiple dimensions of well-being at once and allows each to vary independently. By separately measuring multiple contributors to well-being and examining both individual and aggregate patterns across the lifespan, I find clues as to why previous work has resulted in conflicting findings and I find I am able to explain more variance in judgments of overall well-being than alternative methods of study. In my second essay, I demonstrate how a dynamic conceptualization of well-being can help researchers to better understand the costs and benefits associated with marketplace phenomena, specifically, hyped events. In 6 studies over 22 hyped events, I find that hype causes people to deviate from otherwise preferred activities and that this deviation is largely detrimental to consumer well-being. I found a single positive influence of hype: it sometimes improves social well-being. Hyped events helped solitary viewers feel connected to others via a shared cultural experience. Building on this insight, two studies conducted before, during, and after Super Bowls 50 and 51 revealed that focusing on the social elements of hyped events increased benefits to well-being compared to focusing on the details of the events. This essay demonstrates the limited benefits and extensive costs to believing the hype, particularly when it causes you to deviate from activities more <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> values, goals, and preferences...|$|E

40|$|The ILO’s AbilityAsia {{programme}} has adapted this manual, Getting Hired: A Guide for Job-Seekers with Disabilities to help you. The {{guide is}} intended for individuals {{who are looking for}} salaried or paid employment in the formal sector. This means you probably live in a town or city. The guide can be used by individuals or groups, including organizations of individuals with disabilities. It can also be used on its own or {{as a part of a}} training workshop. Organizations of people with disabilities, placement agencies, non-governmental organizations and community organizations can also use the companion training manual Getting Hired: A Trainer’s Manual for Conducting a Workshop for Job-Seekers with Disabilities to deliver a workshop on this topic. While this guide has been prepared for adults with disabilities, the basic principles for finding a job and getting hired are the same for anyone. Non-disabled people may also find this book valuable. This guide may be useful to help you get full-time work, or part-time work while you are studying. People with disabilities are no longer viewed as requiring protection and care; they are seen as individuals who have rights, including the right to access training and employment. With preparation and training you can become a valued member of the workforce. This has been proven time and again, by businesses and employers who hire people with disabilities and keep track of their overall performance, productivity and safety records. Your right to meaningful work is guaranteed in a number of international instruments. Most recently the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Convention, which entered into force on 3 May 2008, is being signed and ratified by many countries around the world. The ILO Convention concerning Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled Persons), 1983 (No. 159) promotes equal treatment and equal opportunity for people with disabilities in work and training situations. Many countries also have laws to protect the right of people with disabilities to engage in work. You should talk with a local organization of disabled persons to learn more about your human rights, your employment rights and how they are protected in your country. This guide provides some additional information on your rights but is primarily designed to help you build the practical skills you need to find a job. It is general and we hope that you will find it useful. However, each country is different and local job-seeking practices may vary; therefore you should ask for information from local leaders and employment specialists and follow the accepted methods in your country. The ILO encourages you to seek the job you desire and to advance yourself and your community through active participation. We wish you success in your job search and hope you find meaningful work <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> goals...|$|E
