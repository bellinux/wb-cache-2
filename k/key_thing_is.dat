However, Pakistan’s E&P companies are reluctant to invest their capital on such low permeable reservoirs, as the gas production from tight gas sandstone reservoirs is often marginally profitable; reducing costs is a key strategy for every investor and to improve profitability from such low-permeability reservoirs. For profitability and increased gas recovery from shale gas reservoirs, {{it is essential for}} government to provide investors with certain incentives and security for development of shale gas reservoirs.

Besides, the 1980 s and 1990 s groups have significantly different requirementsfrom the work environment.

Frings had Ratzinger prepare the text of a lecture that Frings was to give in Rome.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{analysis}} of unemployment in the Czech regions. The <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the {{effort to create a}} simple model which determinates unemployment in regions. To this, three basic factors are used - inflation, outcome and criminality as they represent fiscal, monetary and social policies. Firstly, the effects of these factors are tested separately by OLS to find their mutual correlation. The average effects of dependence between factors and unemployment in regions are also established by using panel regression. Original and static Phillip's curves are used to measure the impact of level of unemployment on the inflation. The expanded model of Phillip's curve and the dynamic model of natural level of unemployment are used to estimate natural levels of unemployment in regions. The difference version of Okun's law is used to estimate the impact of economy outcome on the level of unemployment. Subsequently, the extended model of Okun's law is used to distinguish the effect of economic cycle on this impact. Correlation of level of unemployment with criminality is measured by simple model, where the change of the first variable is determined by the change of the second variable. All this knowledge is used to create the complex model, which explains the change of the level of unemployment in [...] ...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The Synoptic Translation Prototype as {{a practical}} solution to the Tophoven version of transparency as ethical accountability : potential possibility to ‘reanimate’ translation processes to ‘watch them happen’ [...] . however, there exists the opposite ethical concern of a right to privacy for translators and their processes 2. The conceptual/theoretical apparatus of ethical/strategic layers. Firstly, dealing only with the usual specialist translation ethics of relative fidelity etc., it allows a text to be conceived as having different layers that can be treated separately and according to different strategic and ethical criteria, based on their different skopoi. Secondly, {{it is crucial to}} the theory that translation (whether or not specialised, though it is much clearer in specialised translation) is always dealing with ethical realms that are not specific to translation. So, you can also create a ‘layer’ or ‘layers’ for revisions/adaptations based upon ‘external’ ethical concerns (medical, journalistic, legal, intercultural, etc.). These can be organised according to a hierarchy based upon a synthetic skopos (itself obviously subject to ethical criteria). 3. A combination of the above means that the STP could provide multidimensional visualisation and searchability of translation databases, which are traces of multiple versions and translation possibilities, altered over time. It presently allows static visualisation (with dynamic and modifiable interaction between the original and a chosen version), but in the future might even be programmed to animate time-lapsed translation procedures, thus adding a fourth dimension. 4. The <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the STP is designed as a tool for translation practice, not primarily for ethical oversight of translation (though the Tophoven angle means that it could well be used for this). The idea, though, with regard to ethics, is that it can be adapted as a pedagogical or working tool to heighten translators’ awareness of particular ‘ethical layers’ in practice...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} how Sweden {{relates to}} {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) in the construction process. LCA means analyzing a products impact and the analysis includes the whole life span of the product. A building has a high complexity and the combination with its unique shape will make the LCA more comprehensive, unlike e. g. aluminum cans. Recently {{there has been a}} development of a working procedure in the construction industry. This method is called BIM which means building information modelling and the <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to gather all the information of the building in the same model. The benefits by using BIM are that a lot of double work is minimized and different involved stakeholders can take part of the model and work in the same model. The purpose with the thesis is to contribute to a more sustainable design through increased use of LCA. The aim has been to study the opportunities of integration between LCA and BIM, and also study the opportunities of making the procedure more efficient. Firstly a study has been done concerning whether how LCA is performed in Sweden and what problems there are concerning the making of a LCA in the construction sector. Next step was to find the benefits with BIM that reduce the problems. The thesis questions have been answered with mainly a literature study and a few interviews. The last question, considered as the main question, has also been answered with a case study. The case study includes an attempt of making an LCA on a part of the building of Jönköping University, School of Engineering by using BIM. The result shows that there is barely anyone that is performing LCA on buildings in Sweden today. LCA is performed when there is a demand from clients, but it is rarely. The knowledge of LCA is therefore poor and there are no standard methods. The results from the analysis of buildings today are not reliable. BIM facilitates the performance of LCA in several ways, but the problems with unreliable results remains. Linking the analysis to BIM makes an awareness of sustainability in an early stage, which can be considered more important than getting a correct result. BIM gives us the opportunity to save time in a time consuming procedure and hopefully contributing to a reliable result. This could be seen as {{a step in the right}} direction towards a sustainable development. ...|$|E

While most of today's leaders know they must change the rules of the game, few understand how to create a revolution in their own companies.

40|$|THE latest Nobel Prize winners for Economics were {{reportedly}} awarded {{for their work}} on developing a theory that explains how many people will remain unemployed despite {{a large number of}} job vacancies. In these economically difficult times, the choice of winners seems appropriate because the theory throws some light on why there are both vacant positions and unemployment at the same time, says the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. "One conclusion is that more generous unemployment benefits give rise to higher unemployment and longer search times," says the academy. The winners' work resulted in the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, named after the three laureates, which is used to estimate how various factors can affect the labour market.
