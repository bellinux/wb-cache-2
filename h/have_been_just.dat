5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, {{as can be seen}} by the wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths changed {{over the course of the}} 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them all up to original strength).|$|E
5|$|Francis Penny Burnage, {{son-in-law}} of Charles, became {{chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co, and Gabriel {{continued to work}} for that company. They moved quickly to add manufacturing capacity to what would otherwise <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> a sales organisation: in December 1934 the company took over Cornelius Redman & Sons, renaming it Churchill-Redman Ltd. The facility was used initially to manufacture American machine tools under licence, rather as the machine tool company had started out in the early 1900s. A particularly notable example of its output was the licence granted in 1937 by Jones & Lamson of Springfield, Vermont, for the Fay automatic lathe. It {{was to become a}} pattern for Gabriel to orchestrate take-overs of other companies but not subsume them: they would have their own management team and retain a separate corporate identity.|$|E

5|$|The {{first state}} {{trunkline}} highway designated {{along the path}} of the modern US41 was M-15, in use as far back as 1919. The 1925 draft plan for the establishment of the US Highway System would have replaced M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was to follow the route that US41 follows today. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> US2. The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US41. In between Powers and Covington, US41 was planned to follow US2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US141 between Powers and Covington. When the system was created on November 11, 1926, US41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M-15. The original map showed US41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette. The new US41 designation was instead routed to follow the former M-15.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} {{of the outer}} planets is also necessary {{to account for the}} existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions. Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000AU. Originally, however, the Kuiper belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30AU. Its inner edge would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.|$|E

Small numbers of seabirds, mainly fulmars, northern gannets, black-legged kittiwakes, and common guillemots, use the rock for resting in summer, and gannets and guillemots occasionally breed successfully if the summer is calm with no storm waves washing over the rock.

25|$|During the Sri Lankan Civil War, {{multiple}} Human Rights Organizations {{have reported}} cases of rape, violence and disappearance {{of women in the}} 1990s, claiming to be committed by security forces. Amnesty International, for instance, believes that these actions might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> a fraction of a widespread violence, claiming that many women have avoided giving testimony about the forces' treatment. Government officials, including the president, have denied the claims and agreed to co-operate with the investigations and prosecute whomever they find guilty. The UN Special Rapporteur, on the other hand, have reported that individual investigations and proceedings relating to these cases have started at the local magistrates courts.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} {{effects of}} the Marshall Plan may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> {{as important as the}} economic ones. Marshall Plan aid allowed the nations of Western Europe to relax austerity measures and rationing, reducing discontent and bringing political stability. The communist influence on Western Europe was greatly reduced, and throughout the region communist parties faded in popularity in the years after the Marshall Plan. The trade relations fostered by the Marshall Plan helped forge the North Atlantic alliance that would persist throughout the Cold War. At the same time, the nonparticipation of the states of the Eastern Bloc {{was one of the first}} clear signs that the continent was now divided.|$|E

Clark managed to lure Socred MP Richard Janelle to the government caucus, but this still left the Tories five seats short of a majority.

25|$|Around 1500–1000 BC {{the complex}} {{fell out of}} use and was despoiled by the later Bronze Age farmers. Fragments of pots {{appear to have been}} cast out of the chamber.

Between 1000 BC and 500BC the stones were covered by a thick layer of turf. It is estimated that the place was abandoned around 800BC. Only in 1857 was the overlying 1.5metres of peat removed.|$|E
25|$|On 26 March 1959 against West Indies at Lahore, Mushtaq succeeded his elder {{brothers}} Wazir and Hanif into Test cricket.

He scored only 18 runs in the match as Pakistan were defeated by an innings and 156 runs. The first of his ten Test hundreds would come in his 6th Test, 101 against India in Feroz Shah Kotla. He is believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> 17 and 78 days {{old at the time}} of the innings which became a record. The record stood for over 40 years until it was bettered by Mohammad Ashraful. His next century came against England in 1962 and he would have to wait another 9 years until his next.|$|E
25|$|Robert Quigley King came to {{a largely}} undeveloped Springfield at age nine in 1840, with his sister, Mary Elizabeth, age three and his brother, David Jr. age one. He {{attended}} the early Springfield schools. He later recalled hunting for squirrels in a woods that later became the train station (now demolished) {{and what would be}} close to the location of the present Clark County Library. His father died when he was eighteen. Nonetheless, his mother was able to send him and, as they arrived at college age, his brothers to Wittenberg College. At one time, she had them all in college at the same time—and Almena could afford that. When Robert Quigley King first started at Wittenberg, it held classes in the lecture room of the First Lutheran Church. However, while he was a student, Wittenberg moved to what is now the western part of its present-day campus. He was in the first class to graduate from Wittenberg. The history of early Springfield mentions how much he liked to hunt, especially in the woods that later became today's Snyder Park, which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> down Buck Creek from his childhood home at the King Homestead.|$|E
