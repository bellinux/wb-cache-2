Just as weather forecasts or drug dosages can be modeled with fair accuracy, but never with complete certainty, machinists can predict with charts and formulas the approximate speed and feed values that will work best on a particular job, but cannot know the exact optimal values until running the job. In CNC machining, usually the programmer programs speeds and <b>feedrates</b> that are as maximally tuned as calculations and general guidelines can supply. The operator then fine-tunes the values while running the machine, based on sights, sounds, smells, temperatures, tolerance holding, and tool tip lifespan. Under proper management, the revised values are captured for future use, so that when a program is run again later, this work need not be duplicated.|$|E

DOE is currently funding demonstrations of gold amalgamation that may also control mercury to the desired levels. Performance data from a variety of sources was reviewed to determine ranges of achievable mercury control. Preliminary costs were estimated for using these technologies to control mercury emissions from mixed waste incineration. Mercury emissions control for mixed waste incineration may need to be more efficient than for incineration of other hazardous wastes because of higher mercury concentrations in some mixed waste streams. However, mercury control performance data for wet scrubbing and carbon adsorption is highly variable. More information is needed to demonstrate control efficiencies that are achievable under various design and operating conditions for wet scrubbing, carbon adsorption, and gold amalgamation technologies. Given certain assumptions made in this study, capital costs, operating costs, and lifecycle costs for carbon injection, carbon beds, and gold amalgamation generally vary for different assumed mercury <b>feedrates</b> and for different offgas flowrates.

40|$|International audienceIn {{high speed}} machining, the real <b>feedrate</b> is often {{lower than the}} {{programmed}} one. This reduction of the <b>feedrate</b> is mainly due to the physical limits of the drives, and affects machining {{time as well as}} the quality of the machined surface. Indeed, if the tool path presents sharp geometrical variations the <b>feedrate</b> has to be decreased to respect the drive constraints in terms of velocity, acceleration and jerk. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} smooth 5 -axis tool paths in order to maximize the real <b>feedrate</b> and to reduce the machining time. Velocity, acceleration and jerk limits of each drive allow to compute an evaluation of the maximum reachable <b>feedrate</b> which is then used to localize the areas where the tool path has to be smoothed. So starting from a given tool path, the proposed algorithm iteratively smoothes the joint motions in order to raise the real <b>feedrate.</b> This algorithm has been tested in 5 -axis end milling of an airfoil and in flank milling of an impeller for which a N-buffer algorithm is used to control the geometrical deviations.

40|$|Abstract. Magnesium alloys {{have been}} {{increasingly}} used in automotive and aerospace components and in portable microelectronic devices {{due to their}} “ultralightness ” and high specific strength. Machining is an important method used to process magnesium alloys. The advantages of machining over other processing methods such as die casting include reduction in power consumption and excellent surface finish. However, the ignition of chips presents a dangerous problem during machining. This problem has attracted considerable research interests. Though coolants can be used effectively to prevent ignition, the pollution of environment and reclamation of chips can not be resolved easily. Therefore, one better approach is to control the machining parameters for minimizing ignition hazard of magnesium alloy chips during dry machining. A systematic study was conducted for a few different magnesium alloys (including AM 50 A and AZ 91 D) to understand effect of cutting parameters (cutting speed, feedrate and depth of cut) on ignition of chips during face milling. It is interesting to find that for any fixed cut depth ignition in the forms of sparks, flares or ring of fire occurs only in the moderate cutting speeds and <b>feedrates</b> and can thus be easily prevented by adopting either higher or lower cutting speeds or <b>feedrates.</b> Chips produced in different machining conditions were collected and their morphology was analyzed to understand mechanisms of ignition...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a study into {{the enhancement of}} productivity in micromilling processes by considering a fundamental treatment of tool path trajectory generation techniques and process optimization strategies that account {{for the impact of}} scale effects present in high-speed, high-precision micromachining operations. Micromilling is increasingly applied to the production {{of a wide variety of}} micro components, due to its high precision and flexibility. However, the productivity of micromilling is limited by the low <b>feedrates</b> necessitated by the inherent high precision and small feature size. In this study, several scale effects present at the microscale are identified, in particular the increase of the ratio of tool size to feature size, and the corresponding impact on trajectory generation and process optimization is investigated. The scale effects are shown to cause increased geometric error when the standard method of VF-NURBS is applied to microscale feedrate optimization. The method of Enhanced Variable-Feedrate NURBS (EVF-NURBS) is proposed and shown to successfully compensate for the scale effects leading to reduced geometric error. A key contribution of this study is the construction and experimental validation of the Variable-Feedrate Intelligent Segmentation (VFIS) method for increased <b>feedrates</b> and improved stability. The VFIS method provides a cutting time reduction of more than 50 % in some cases, while effectively constraining geometric error.
