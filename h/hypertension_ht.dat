5|$|<b>Hypertension</b> (HTN or <b>HT),</b> {{also known}} as high blood {{pressure}} (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the influences of}} aging and hypertension on thoracic aortic wall distensibility, we obtained instantaneous dimensional change of the thoracic descending aorta (TDA) with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), simuktaneously with systemic oressure of the brachial artery (Cuff method) in 31 normotension subject (N) and 19 <b>hypertension</b> patients (<b>HT).</b> We measured minimum dimension (Do,mm) and maximum demension in the ejection phase (Dmax,mm) of the TDA, and calculated the systolic dimensional change (△D＝Dmax－Do,mm), the percent dimensional change (%△D＝(△D/Do) × 100,%), and wall compliance(△D/△P, mm/mmHg, △P : pulse oressure of the brachial artery) of the TDA. In N between 5 th, 6 th and 7 th decades, with getting older, both %△D and △D/△P were significantly decreased without dignificant change in Do, but not diggerent vbetween 7 th decade and 8 th decade (%△D : 5 th decade 9. 5 ± 2. 0 %, 6 th decade 8. 2 ± 0. 6 %, 7 th decade 5. 7 ± 1. 6 %, and 8 th decase 4. 0 ± 0. 7 %, M±SD; p＜ 0. 01, vs 5 th and 6 th decades, △D/△P : 5 th decade 0. 05 mm/mmHg, 6 th decade 0. 04 mm/mmHg, 7 th decade 0. 03 mm/mmHg, and 8 th decade 0. 02 mm/mmHg; p＜ 0. 01). In 6 th decade, both %△D and △D/△P in HT (5. 6 ± 1. 3 %, 0. 02 mm/mmHg, respectively) were significantly less than those in N (both p＜ 0. 01) without significant defference of Do. However, in 7 th decade %△ D and △D/△P were not dignificant between N and HT. Thus, we concluded that (1) lrage vessel distensibility decreased with becoming older, (2) in kess than 7 th decade, hypertension aggected the wall distensibilty, and (3) in 7 th decade, aging might bemore important determinant of aortic wall distensibility irrespective of blood pressure...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purposes}} of this study were to examine left atrial (LA) functional reserve in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and to determine whether LA strain has an incremental diagnostic value over clinical and conventional echocardiographic parameters. BackgroundPatients with HFpEF have multiple cardiovascular reserve abnormalities. Although the LA is dysfunctional in HFpEF, the diagnostic value of LA strain remains unknown. MethodsThe LA at rest and during passive leg lifts was echocardiographically assessed in 40 patients with HFpEF and in 46 patients with <b>hypertension</b> without HF (<b>HT</b> controls). Global peak atrial longitudinal strain during ventricular systole (global LAS) and booster strain during atrial contraction (global LAB) were assessed using speckle tracking. ResultsPatients with HFpEF had an enlarged LA and reduced LA emptying fraction compared with HT controls at rest, while LA stroke volume (SV) was similar between the groups. During leg lifts, increases in LA reservoir and contractile function (i. e., global LAS and LAB) were blunted in HFpEF patients compared with HT controls, resulting in impaired LASV responses. Global LAS and LAB during leg lifts accurately differentiated HFpEF from HT controls (areas under the curve: 0. 95 and 0. 92, respectively). Resting global LAS had a significant incremental diagnostic value over clinical (age and sex) and conventional echocardiographic parameters (E/E′ ratio, left ventricular mass index, and maximum LA volume index) (global chi-square: 49. 6 vs. 30. 8; p < 0. 0001). The diagnostic value was further improved by adding global LAS during leg lifts (global chi-square: 72. 2 vs. 49. 6; p < 0. 0001). ConclusionsAn enlarged LA compensates for LA dysfunction and maintains LASV at rest in patients with HFpEF. However, depressed LA reserve affects LA performance during leg lifts. Evaluation of LA function, including LA strain using leg lifts, might provide incremental diagnostic value for HFpEF...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the left {{ventricular}} function in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), mechanocardiographic findings were analyzed in 25 cases of HCM and 35 normal subjects. Based on {{the presence or absence}} of pressure gradient (PG) and hypertension, the patients were divided into 3 groups, i. e., 14 cases of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), 5 cases of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with <b>hypertension</b> (HOCM with <b>HT)</b> and 6 cases of hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy (nonobst. HCM). The results were as follows: 1) The contour of the carotid pulse tracing (CPT) was divided into four types (three types of bisferiens pulse; A, B and C and no bisferiens pulse; D). The bisferiens pulse existed in 20 out of 25 cases of HCM, and PG was found in descending order, type A, B and C. Since all types, A, B and C, were observed in nonobst. HCM, it seems that the bisferiens pulse is not caused by left ventricular outflow-tract-stenosis alone. The systolic second wave (SSW) in the apexcardiogram (ACG) at rest or following isoproterenol (IP) infusion was found in 12 cases, including 3 cases of nonobst. HCM. Therefore, it was concluded that the SSW was not pathognomonic in HOCM. The bulge and absence of the rapid filling wave (RFW) were found in 22 cases and 17 out of 25 cases of HCM, respectively. These results suggested the existence of asynergy and a decrease in left ventricular compliance in HCM. 2) The "a/T" ratio showed markedly higher values in HOCM, HOCM with HT and nonobst. HCM, when compared with normal subjects, but no significant differences were observed among the three groups of HCM. 3) "t-time" (the time from initial upstroke (U-point) to one half of the total height of CPT) was significantly shortened in HOCM, but not significantly changed in either HOCM with HT or nonobst. HCM, when compared with normal subjects. The results suggested the presence of the hyperkinetic state during the initial ejection phase in HOCM. This was supported by the fact that the isovolumetric contraction period (ICP) was shortened significantly in HOCM. ETc was significantly shortened, PEPc lengthened and PEP/ET increased in nonobst. HCM. These results suggested that there might be an inflow disturbance into the left ventricle due to a decrease of left ventriccular compliance and the decrease of the stroke volume in nonobst. HCM. 4) Following IP infusion, the changes in ETc increased significantly in HOCM, while they decreased in normal subjects, which suggested that left ventricular outflow tract stenosis might be augumented by the inotropic action of IP...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is a {{major issue}} in public health, and the {{financial}} costs associated with hypertension continue to increase. Cost-effectiveness studies focusing on antihypertensive drug combinations, however, have been scarce. The cost-effectiveness ratios of the traditional treatment (hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol) and the current treatment (losartan and amlodipine) were evaluated in patients with grade 1 or 2 <b>hypertension</b> (<b>HT</b> 1 - 2). For patients with grade 3 <b>hypertension</b> (<b>HT</b> 3), a third drug was added to the treatment combinations: enalapril was added to the traditional treatment, and hydrochlorothiazide was added to the current treatment. METHODS: Hypertension treatment costs were estimated {{on the basis of the}} purchase prices of the antihypertensive medications, and effectiveness was measured as the reduction in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (in mm Hg) at the end of a 12 -month study period. RESULTS: When the purchase price of the brand-name medication was used to calculate the cost, the traditional treatment presented a lower cost-effectiveness ratio [US$/mm Hg] than the current treatment in the HT 1 - 2 group. In the HT 3 group, however, there was no difference in cost-effectiveness ratio between the traditional treatment and the current treatment. The cost-effectiveness ratio differences between the treatment regimens maintained the same pattern when the purchase price of the lower-cost medication was used.

40|$|Background: {{the aging}} process causes {{decreasing}} in the function of various organs. Skletal muscle {{is one of the}} organs affected by aging process. It is known as sarcopenia.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between age, nutritional status, and chronic diseases such as stroke, <b>hypertension</b> (<b>HT),</b> diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with handgrip strength. Methods: a cross-sectional study to determine factors related to the handgrip strength in elderly patients was conducted in Geriatric outpatient clinic of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital and Mohammad Hoesin Hospital from August to October 2015.
