Iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested.

5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> needed for the tubes.|$|E

In the latter method, a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium-mercury alloy, which reduces and dissolves Yb3+. The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid. The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating.

5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} may {{be studied}} {{by a variety}} of techniques, including both direct and indirect observations. Two experimental techniques that have proved very useful in this area of study are field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. By visualizing the displacement of atoms or clusters over time, it is possible to extract useful information regarding {{the manner in which the}} relevant species diffuse-both mechanistic and rate-related information. In order to study surface diffusion on the atomistic scale it is unfortunately necessary to perform studies on rigorously clean surfaces and in ultra <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> (UHV) conditions or in the presence of small amounts of inert gas, as is the case when using He or Ne as imaging gas in field-ion microscopy experiments.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of americium and curium in 1944 was {{closely related to}} the Manhattan Project; the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children Quiz Kids five days before the official presentation at an American Chemical Society meeting on 11 November 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war. After the {{discovery of}} americium isotopes 241Am and 242Am, their production and compounds were patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor. The initial americium samples weighed a few micrograms; they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity. The first substantial amounts of metallic americium weighing 40–200 micrograms were not prepared until 1951 by reduction of americium(III) fluoride with barium metal in <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> at 1100°C.|$|E

25|$|The thus {{produced}} NdCl3 quickly absorbs {{water and}} converts to NdCl3·6H2O hydrate, which is stable for storage, {{and can be}} converted back into NdCl3 when necessary. Simple rapid heating of the hydrate is not practical for that purpose because it causes hydrolysis with consequent production of Nd2O3. Therefore, anhydrous NdCl3 is prepared by dehydration of the hydrate either by slowly heating to 400°C with 4-6 equivalents of ammonium chloride under <b>high</b> <b>vacuum,</b> or by heating with an excess of thionyl chloride for several hours. The NdCl3 can alternatively be prepared by reacting neodymium metal with hydrogen chloride or chlorine, though this method is not economical due to the relatively high price of the metal and is used for research purposes only. After preparation, it is usually purified by high temperature sublimation under <b>high</b> <b>vacuum.</b>|$|E

The bleed port is typically located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, to allow quick adjustment during use.|$|R
25|$|Generally, {{the image}} {{resolution}} of an SEM {{is lower than}} that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with environmental scanning electron microscopes (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than <b>high,</b> <b>vacuum</b> or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> of conventional electron microscopes.|$|E
25|$|Cryogenic {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (Cryo-TEM) uses a TEM with a specimen holder capable of maintaining the specimen at liquid nitrogen or liquid helium temperatures. This allows imaging specimens prepared in vitreous ice, the preferred preparation technique for imaging individual molecules or macromolecular assemblies, imaging of vitrified solid-electrolye interfaces, and imaging of materials that are volatile in <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> at room temperature, such as sulfur.|$|E
25|$|The space {{environment}} is hostile to life. Unprotected presence in space is characterised by an intense radiation field (consisting primarily of protons and other subatomic charged particles from the solar wind, {{in addition to}} cosmic rays), <b>high</b> <b>vacuum,</b> extreme temperatures, and microgravity. Some simple forms of life called extremophiles, including small invertebrates called tardigrades can survive in this environment in an extremely dry state called desiccation.|$|E
50|$|An oil {{diffusion}} pump {{is used to}} achieve <b>higher</b> <b>vacuum</b> (lower pressure) than is possible by use of positive displacement pumps alone. Although its use has been mainly associated within the high-vacuum range (down to 10−9 mbar), {{diffusion pump}}s today can produce pressures approaching 10−10 mbar when properly used with modern fluids and accessories. The features that make the diffusion pump attractive for <b>high</b> and ultra-high <b>vacuum</b> use are its high pumping speed for all gases and low cost per unit pumping speed when compared {{with other types of}} pump used in the same vacuum range. Diffusion pumps cannot discharge directly into the atmosphere, so a mechanical forepump is typically used to maintain an outlet pressure around 0.1 mbar.|$|R
40|$|Progress in sensor {{technique}} and electronics {{has led to}} a decrease in the costs of electronic and sensor components. In modern dairy farms, having udders in good condition, a lower frequency of udder disease and an extended service life of dairy cows will help ensure competitiveness. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a teat-end vacuum control system with individual quarter actor reaction. Based on a review of the literature, this system is assumed to protect the teat tissue. It reduces the mean teat-end vacuum in the maximum vacuum phase (b) to a level of 20 kPa at a flow rate of 0. 25 L/min per quarter. At flow rates higher than 1. 50 L/min per quarter, the teat-end vacuum can be controlled to a level of 30 kPa, because in this case it is desirable to have a <b>higher</b> <b>vacuum</b> for the transportation of the milk to the receiver. With this system it is possible for the first time to supply the teat end with low vacuum at low flow rates and with <b>higher</b> <b>vacuum</b> at increasing flow rates in a continuous process with a three second reaction-rate on individual quarter level. This system is completely automated...|$|R
