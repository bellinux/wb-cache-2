5000|$|Protect {{the site}} against climatic hazards: for this a roof {{supported}} by 14 pillars of 9 meters high was built. The {{impact on the}} ground of these pillars is minimal. They are based on micropiles driven deep into the <b>ground,</b> supporting <b>studs</b> of a metre wide, holding the pillars. To West, a 90 meter long concrete wall serves as a spur to a [...] "umbrella roof.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the Romans' arrival, Harringay {{was part}} of a large area {{covering}} Essex and Middlesex which was home to a Celtic tribe called Trinobantes. Led by Imanuentius {{at the time of the}} Roman invasion, they fought with the Iceni tribe under Boudica against the Romans in AD61. The two tribes lost, sustaining casualties in excess of 80,000. Whatever their record in battle, they were a well organised society. On his arrival Julius Caesar found an 'elaborate and well-organised tribal civilisation. Its population was exceedingly large and the <b>ground</b> thickly <b>studded</b> with homesteads'.|$|R
5000|$|On Bass's death, {{the estate}} passed {{to his son}} Hamar Alfred Bass, who after {{rebuilding}} the main house between 1887 and 1891, founded a racing horse stud within the extensive <b>grounds.</b> The Byrkley <b>Stud</b> produced and trained [...] "Love Wisely" [...] which won the Ascot Gold Cup in 1896. Bass was also for 12 years master of the Meynell Hunt.|$|R
6000|$|The {{landscape}} of Perugino, for grace, purity {{and as much}} of nature as {{is consistent with the}} above-named conditions, is unrivalled; and the more interesting because in him certainly whatever limits are set to the rendering of nature proceed not from incapability. The sea is in the distance almost always, then some blue promontories and undulating dewy park <b>ground,</b> <b>studded</b> with glittering trees; in the {{landscape of}} the fresco in St^a. Maria Maddalena at Florence there is more variety than is usual with him; a gentle river winds round the bases of rocky hills, a river like our own Wye or Tees in their loveliest reaches; level meadows stretch away on its opposite side; mounds set with slender-stemmed foliage occupy the nearer ground, a small village with its simple spire peeps from the forest at the bend of the valley, and it is remarkable that in architecture thus employed neither Perugino nor any other of the ideal painters ever use Italian forms but always Transalpine, both of church and castle. The little landscape which forms the background of his own portrait in the Uffizii is another highly finished and characteristic example. The landscape of Raffaelle was learned from his father, and continued for some time little modified, though expressed with greater refinement. It became afterwards conventional and poor, and in some cases altogether meaningless. The haystacks and vulgar trees behind the St. Cecilia at Bologna form a painful contrast to the pure space of mountain country in the Perugino opposite.[76] ...|$|R
50|$|A third, Italianate, {{hall was}} {{constructed}} circa 1778, but this later sold {{to cover the}} Stanley family’s gambling debts in 1850. The hall and adjoining land was bought by a Mr. Naylor, a wealthy Liverpool banker, for 82,000 guineas. He spent a further 50,000 guineas on {{the addition of a}} 100-foot tower, an art gallery, and a large dining hall. He also built a racecourse, polo <b>ground,</b> heronry, <b>stud</b> farm and a church in Childer Thornton in memory of his first wife. His yacht was moored on the River Mersey, but in the 1890s the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal cut off his access to the river, so he moved to another of his properties in Nottinghamshire.|$|R

5000|$|Kildangan ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{a village}} in County Kildare in Ireland. During the Anglo-Norman {{settlement}} of Ireland, Maurice Fitzgerald of Allen built a castle there {{as part of a}} defensive line along the River Barrow from Carlow to Lea Castle near Portarlington. Near the castle a church was built which gave the locality its name.The original castle and church were located within the <b>grounds</b> of Kildangan <b>Stud.</b> The castle was dynamited in 1882 and the stone reused to build the existing Victorian Jacobean style house to the design of William Hopkins.|$|R
60|$|In the {{trenches}} {{it was the}} Russians who were always the aggressors. Sortie after sortie was made throughout the winter, and in these the Russians often obtained possession for a time of portions of our trenches or those of the French. Along {{in front of their}} works the <b>ground</b> was <b>studded</b> with rifle-pits, sometimes so close to our works that it was impossible for a man to show his head above them, and the artillerymen were frequently unable to work their guns, owing to the storm of bullets which the Russians sent through the embrasures whenever a sign of movement was discerned. In the desperate fights in darkness in {{the trenches}} we lost more men than in either of the pitched battles of the campaign; and it was only the dogged courage of our soldiers and the devotion of the officers which enabled us to maintain our footing in the trenches before the city which {{we were supposed to be}} besieging.|$|R
5000|$|Island Sands was {{described}} as a [...] "most attractive" [...] brown horse with a small white star and four white feet and stood 16 hands high. He was bred at the Kilcoran House Stud in County Tipperary, Ireland by Mrs T. V. Ryan. He was sired by Turtle Island out of the mare Tiavanita. Turtle Island won six races, most notably the 1994 Irish 2000 Guineas which he won by fifteen lengths on his favoured soft <b>ground.</b> At <b>stud,</b> he has sired the winners of over four hundred races, but Island Sands, from his first crop of foals, remains his only winner at Group One level. Tiavanita failed to win a race but was a half-sister of Corrupt, who won the Great Voltigeur Stakes and started joint-favourite for the 1991 Epsom Derby. As a yearling, Island Sands was sent to the Goffs Sale in October, where he was bought for IR£18,000 by the British trainer David Elsworth.|$|R
50|$|Most of the island's surface {{consists}} of plains between 30 and 200 meters above sea level. In the southwest, ridges and valleys rise gradually {{to merge with}} the Central Highlands, giving a dissected appearance to the plain. Extensive erosion in this area has worn down the ridges and deposited rich soil for agriculture downstream. In the southeast, a red, lateritic soil covers relatively level <b>ground</b> that is <b>studded</b> with bare, monolithic hills. The transition from the plain to the Central Highlands is abrupt in the southeast, and the mountains appear to rise up like a wall. In {{the east and the}} north, the plain is flat, dissected by long, narrow ridges of granite running from the Central Highlands.|$|R
60|$|The road {{by which}} the English would advance was the old Roman {{causeway}} running nearly north and south. The Bannock Burn was fordable from a spot near the Park Mill down {{to the village of}} Bannockburn. Above, the banks were too high and steep to be passed; while below, where ran the Bannock through the carse, the swamps prevented passage. The army was therefore drawn up, with its left resting on the sharp angle of the burn above the Park Mill, and extended where the villages of Easterton, Borestine, and Braehead now stand to the spot where the road crosses the river at the village of Bannockburn. In its front, between it and the river, were two bogs, known as Halberts Bog and Milton Bog, while, where unprotected by these bogs, the whole <b>ground</b> was <b>studded</b> with deep pits; in these stakes were inserted, and they were then covered with branches and grass. Randolph's centre was at Borestine, Bruce's reserve a little behind, and the rock in which his flagstaff was placed during the battle is still to be seen. To Randolph, in addition to his command of the centre division, was committed the trust of preventing any body of English from passing along {{at the edge of the}} carse, and so making round to the relief of Stirling.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that horses mainly living on meadows in endemic regions {{are exposed to}} a high {{infection}} risk with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Although most cases of equine borrelia infection seem to proceed inapparent, there are numerous reports of cases of borrelia-infection associated illnesses in horses with direct confirmation of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. The clinical signs described in literature are versatile {{and there is no}} homogeneous disease pattern defined for horses. The more important it is to have a reliable serological verification of pathogenic agents as soon as there is the suspicion of Lyme disease. Huge problems result of the still deficient standardisation of examination methods. The superior target of this dissertation was the revision of the diagnostic suitability of an immunoblot of Mikrogen and an ELISA of Virotech, both of which had been used in a preliminary paper and provided contradictory results. As the current recommendation of serological clinical diagnostics of Lyme disease allots a two-step test, both examination systems mentioned above were chosen. For this purpose, a subgroup, whose blood samples had already been tested with those systems in 2007, was again tested with another immunoblot of Virotech. In {{order to be able to}} make a declaration concerning the diagnostic value the results were confronted and compared. The analysed blood samples came from horses of the Bavarian “Haupt- und Landgestüt Schwaiganger“ and were taken in the period between July 2005 to June 2006 in intervals of four to six weeks. The via PCR estimated prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi in the ticks of the <b>stud’s</b> <b>grounds</b> amounted to 18...|$|R
