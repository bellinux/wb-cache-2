Reyes goes to visit Jeb's sister, Katha, and learns {{he did not know}} Bob Harvey. While Reyes is there, Katha receives a call from Jeb, but tells him to call later. As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption. He asks her what made her start to believe in the paranormal. She says she realized she was “afraid to believe.” Scully later tells Mulder to <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> help Doggett.|$|E

25|$|Piaget {{wanted to}} {{revolutionize}} the way research was conducted.

25|$|In {{response}} to Zionists who quote the Maharal's commentary on Ketubot, anti-Zionist writers {{have said that}} even if the oaths are to be seen as decrees, it was obviously not God's intent that the Jewish people should <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> return to the Land of Israel and build a state until they hit the right moment. In view of the harsh consequences of failure ("I will declare your flesh ownerless like the gazelles and hinds of the field"), this would be as foolish as playing Russian roulette. Furthermore, the success of the State of Israel so far is not proof that the decree has been annulled, since the future of the state is still uncertain.|$|E

500|$|Lex also {{develops}} a craving for power, with that hunger expanding in season five. Al Gough believes that Lex's political motivations {{are based on}} his lust for power. Rosenbaum echoes that opinion, believing that Lex can never get enough; [...] "Lex is an insatiable character". Rosenbaum believes that nothing will satisfy Lex's hunger, {{and that he will}} keep going until he is president of the United States.

[...] In the view of Knock, McGovern in all his activities arguably accomplished more for people in need than most presidents or secretaries of state in U.S. history.

It's almost always there, however slyly or covertly or even unconsciously, however 'sympathetic' the person: the attitude that homosexuality is somehow undesirable, some sort of twist or malfunction or failure or maladaptation or other kind of psychic sickness. And in our society sick people, by any definition of sick, just DO not get equal treatment. Equal treatment— no more, no less— is what we want! And compassion— which many homosexuals gladly swallow {{because they think it}} represents an improvement in attitudes toward them— is not equal treatment." ...|$|E

500|$|Uncuts and The Guardians reviews {{were less}} enthusiastic. Uncut {{commented that the}} album sounds dry and superficial, and the songs are too similar {{to each other and}} other Franz Ferdinand songs. The Guardian stated that [...] "if Franz's songwriting is broader than it was, it is still no deeper" [...] and that [...] "they'll <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> move your hips because they know they'll never win your heart." [...] This was echoed by the review in the Daily Mail, which {{described}} the album as [...] "a sterile, unwelcoming affair that fails to pack the band's usual punch." [...] Paste was similarly severe, stating that the vocals are [...] "leering", the production [...] "horrific", and that the lyrics [...] "seem to lack both heart and brain" [...] and conclude by writing that [...] "the layoff suggests that Franz is either too confused or too lazy to move forward".|$|E
500|$|Milhouse's father, Kirk, gives {{a speech}} to the kids at Springfield Elementary about his {{occupation}} of assistant flyer distributor. Due to how boring the speech was, Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel take Lisa's advice and visit the Springfield Writer's Forum to find a better speaker. They find Jeff Jenkins, creator of a popular TV cartoon, Danger Dog. He comes to the school to give a presentation on Danger Dog, including showing them a sneak preview for the next Easter special, and fascinates the kids by telling them about the cartoon industry. Much to Skinner's horror, Jenkins tells the students how easy his job is and how he never needed to work hard to get his job. Later, every kid in school creates their own comic book, all of which are actually rip-off versions of Danger Dog. Bart also creates his own comic Danger Dude (which is actually a dog) and tries to sell it to Comic Book Guy, who criticizes his work. Stan Lee enters Comic Book Guy's store and tells Bart that his comic is bad, but that he should <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> [...] "find his own voice." ...|$|E

He graduated from West Springfield High School in 1974, having been voted [...] "Most Likely Not to Live Up to Potential" [...] by his classmates, and dropped out of Holyoke Community College after one day, undecided about {{what he wanted to}} do with his life. He took up work in the clothing department at Steiger's department store, as a janitor at the Baystate Medical Center and also as a driving instructor. He commented: [...] "I think if I had actually succeeded at college and gotten a degree in accounting or something, I might have given up too quickly on writing. Having no marketable job skills was a tremendous incentive to <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> succeed as a writer." [...] He realized [...] "there probably wasn't going to be a career in riding around with my friends listening to Foghat," [...] so Scully decided he [...] "definitely wanted to break into comedy" [...] even though he [...] "really had no reason to believe [...] could succeed." [...] Regardless, he moved to Los Angeles, California in 1982.|$|E

500|$|Bartholomew JoJo [...] "Bart" [...] Simpson, {{voiced by}} Nancy Cartwright, is the eldest child and only {{son in the}} family—at age 10. Bart's most {{prominent}} character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness, disrespect for authority and sharp wit. During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's main character. The name [...] "Bart" [...] is an anagram of the word [...] "brat". Groening conceived Bart as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening's older brother Mark provided most of the inspiration for Bart. Bart's catchphrase [...] "Eat My Shorts" [...] was an ad-lib by Cartwright {{in one of the}} original table readings, harking back to an incident when she was at college. In 1998, Time magazine selected Bart as 46th of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, and the only fictional character to make the list. He had previously appeared {{on the cover of the}} December 31, 1990 edition. Bart is rebellious and frequently escapes without punishment, which lead some parents' groups and conservative spokespeople to believe he provided a poor role model for children. This prompted George H. W. Bush to rally, [...] "We're going to <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> strengthen the American family. To make them more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons." [...] Bart, and other Simpsons characters, have appeared in numerous television commercials for Nestlé's Butterfinger candy bars from 1990–2001, with the slogan [...] "Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{reference}} to his own work Kelly {{said in an interview}} in 1996: [...] "I think what we all want from art is a sense of fixity, a sense of opposing the chaos of daily living. This an illusion, of course. Canvas rots. Paint changes color. But you <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> freeze the world as if you could make it last forever. In a sense, what I've tried to capture is the reality of flux, to keep art an open, incomplete situation, to get at the rapture of seeing." ...|$|E
2500|$|MacDonald {{returned}} solo to MGM after 5 {{years off}} the screen for two films. Three Daring Daughters (1948) co-starred José Iturbi as her love interest.

2500|$|Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone criticized Jones' performance, stating, Jones [...] "plays Danny {{as a case}} of {{a secret}} {{identity}} that might be just [...] well disguised – because he's so totally devoid of charisma, more cub than lone wolf. With his scruffy beard and dazed [...] "who, me?" [...] eyes, Jones {{could be one of the}} twinkling boy-men who populated Hollywood comedies a decade ago, except now the party's over and he can't understand why bad hombres <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> kill him... Iron Fist has no humor either, so it ends up just looking like a superhero drama where they forgot to invite the superhero.... Iron Fists hero can't seem to muster any inner turmoil beyond the occasional harshed vibe. There doesn't seem to be much of anything going on his skull. His mystic Zen quotes go over like a Wayne's World set-up minus the punch line." ...|$|E
