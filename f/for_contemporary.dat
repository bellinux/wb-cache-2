5|$|Brighton's origins {{lie in the}} Saxon {{fishing and}} {{agricultural}} village of Bristelmestune. The English Channel formed its southern limit, but on all other sides was farmland divided into open fields called laines. These were further subdivided into furlongs—wide parallel strips—and paul-pieces, which were much narrower strips. Despite their small size, neighbouring paul-pieces often had different owners. Wide paths (leakways) ran at right-angles to the furlongs, separating them. This ancient land-use pattern, which survived until the 18th century despite its unsuitability <b>for</b> <b>contemporary</b> farming methods, significantly influenced the pattern of urban development in 18th- and 19th-century Brighton.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Livonian War broke out, the Hanseatic League had already lost its {{monopoly}} on the profitable and prosperous Baltic Sea trade. While still involved and with increasing sales, it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets, most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France. The Hanseatic vessels were no match <b>for</b> <b>contemporary</b> warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection. The Danish navy, the most powerful in the Baltic Sea, controlled {{the entrance to the}} Baltic Sea, collected requisite tolls, and held the strategically important Baltic Sea islands of Bornholm and Gotland.|$|E
5|$|Forum Station was {{nominated}} for the European Union Prize <b>for</b> <b>Contemporary</b> Architecture in 2005. On 2 December 2005, the final agreement to build the City Circle Line was made between the local and national governments. The price was estimated at 11.5 to 18.3billion Danish krone (DKK), of which DKK5.4billion will be financed though ticket sales, and the remaining {{from the state and}} municipalities. In 2006, it was announced that the contract with Ansaldo to operate the metro had been prolonged another three years. However, the subcontract between Ansaldo and Serco Group was not extended, and the contract was instead given to Azienda Trasporti Milanesi in joint venture with Ansaldo; they took over operations from October 2007. The Ørestad Development Corporation was discontinued in 2007, and the ownership of the metro was transferred to Metroselskabet I/S.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{after the}} {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, President Yeltsin's government invited Bukovsky to serve as an expert witness at the trial before the Constitutional Court where Russia's communists were suing Yeltsin for banning their Party and taking its property. The respondent's case was that the CPSU itself had been an unconstitutional organisation. To prepare his testimony, Bukovsky requested and was granted access to a large number of documents from the CPSU Central Committee archives (then reorganised into the Central Depository <b>for</b> <b>Contemporary</b> Documentation or TsKhSD). With the help of a small hand-held scanner and a laptop computer, he managed secretly to scan many documents (some with high security clearance), including KGB reports to the Central Committee. The copies were then smuggled to the West.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 2000s The Royal Opera gave an average of 150 {{performances}} each season, lasting from September to July, of about 20 operas, nearly half of which were new productions. Productions in the 2011–12 season included a new opera (Miss Fortune) by Judith Weir, and the first performances of The Trojans at Covent Garden since 1990, conducted by Pappano, and starring Bryan Hymel, Eva-Maria Westbroek and Anna Caterina Antonacci.

Responsibility <b>for</b> <b>contemporary</b> programming was split between the Studio programmes of The Royal Opera and The Royal Ballet.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{the first}} state in North America to require {{municipalities}} to appoint a teacher or establish a grammar school {{with the passage of}} the Massachusetts Education Law of 1647, and 19th century reforms pushed by Horace Mann laid much of the groundwork <b>for</b> <b>contemporary</b> universal public education which was established in 1852. Massachusetts is home to the oldest school in continuous existence in North America (The Roxbury Latin School, founded in 1645), as well as the country's oldest public elementary school (The Mather School, founded in 1639), its oldest high school (Boston Latin School, founded in 1635), its oldest continuously operating boarding school (The Governor's Academy, founded in 1763), its oldest college (Harvard University, founded in 1636), and its oldest women's college (Mount Holyoke College, founded in 1837).|$|E

5|$|Since the 20th century, actual metal corsets have {{occasionally}} {{been made}} <b>for</b> <b>contemporary</b> wear, although such instances are rare. Steele notes that alongside a 1930s metal corset made for and worn by a fetish corsetiere called Cayne, the late 20th- and early 21st-century tight-lacer Cathie Jung had a silver corset-cover made to wear over her actual laced corset. Between 1933 and 1940 Mrs. Cayne advertised a booklet describing her 14-inch waistline and offered other {{services in the}} Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.|$|E
