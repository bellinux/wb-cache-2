When Katherine Chancellor, flabbergasted that Liz {{of all people}} would receive two {{proposals}} of marriage, she sees a chance of perhaps snaring Bill for herself. Katherine points out to Liz how dependable Sam <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as a husband, and how <b>happy</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{to have all the}} things she always wanted. And Bill with not long to live would have his friends only. Katherine's campaign had some effect on Liz. Liz tells her that she has now made up her mind.|$|R
5000|$|In a side story, Kinsey {{is invited}} to a family event (the first return to her family backstory since [...] "Q" [...] Is for Quarry). During the {{preparation}} for the event, which Kinsey resists attending, she is given letters from her grandmother that her Aunt Gin, who raised her, had refused. She learns that, far from ignoring her, her grandmother had wanted to adopt her after her parents' deaths and had even hired a private investigator to gain custody of her. In a final irony, she learns that Gin and the private investigator had had an affair, and that little Kinsey had gone on outings with them. In the end, she attends the family event, where her grandmother, who is increasingly senile, mistakes her for her late mother and tells her how <b>happy</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if Kinsey were to come visit her.|$|R

60|$|For {{the rest}} of the day Fan was in a state of bewilderment at her own great good fortune; for this {{engagement}} meant so much to her. That horrible phantom, the fear of abject poverty, would follow her no more. With Â£20 in hand and all Mary's presents, and eighteen shillings a week in prospect, she considered herself rich; and with her evenings, her Sundays and holidays to spend how she liked, and Constance always near, how <b>happy</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be!</b> But why, when crowds of experienced girls were waiting and anxiously wishing to get into this establishment, had she, utterly ignorant of business, been taken in this sudden off-hand way? It was a mystery to her, and a mystery also to the clever Constance, and to the still more clever Merton when he was told about it. Unknowingly she had submitted herself to a competitive examination in which useless knowledge was not considered, and in which those who possessed pretty faces and fine figures scored the most marks. After this she was scarcely in the right frame to appreciate the works of art they went on to see. That long interior in Regent Street, with its costly goods and pretty elegantly-dressed girls, and perfumed glossy shop-walker, and ugly bristling fierce-eyed manager, continually floated before her mental vision, even when she looked on the most celebrated canvases--even on those painted by Turner.|$|R
60|$|But now--oh, all {{was changed}} now. She had been languishing in dungeons, away from light and {{air and the}} cheer of {{friendly}} faces, for nearly three-quarters of a year--she, born child of the sun, natural comrade of the birds and of all <b>happy</b> free creatures. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> weary now, and worn with this long captivity, her forces impaired; despondent, perhaps, as knowing there was no hope. Yes, all was changed.|$|R
60|$|It is not {{necessary}} to describe the house, nor is it necessary to dive into the depths of Mrs. Archibald's mind as she gazed about her, passing silently from room to room of the little house. She was a good woman, and she had made up her mind that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> a millstone around the necks of her companions. Many people have been happy in camps, and, indeed, camp-life {{has become one of the}} features of our higher civilization, and this, from what she had heard, must be a camp above the common. So, think what she might, she determined to make no open complaint. If it were possible for her to <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> here, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy.</b>|$|R
6000|$|At length {{came the}} denouement. After confessing {{how much she}} loved Betts, how <b>happy</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> could <b>she</b> be his slave all the days of her life, how miserable she was in knowing that he had placed his {{affections}} on HER, and how much more miserable she should be, had she learned he had NOT, Mademoiselle Hennequin almost annihilated the young man by declaring that it was utterly {{impossible for her to}} consent to become his wife. The reason was the difference in fortune, and the impossibility that she should take advantage of his passion to lead him into a connection that he might afterwards regret. Against this decision, Betts reasoned warmly, but seriously, in vain. Had Mademoiselle Hennequin been an American, instead of a French, girl, her feelings <b>would</b> not have <b>been</b> so sensitive on this point, for, in this great republic, every body but the fortune-hunters, an exceedingly contemptible class, considers a match without money, quite as much a matter of course, as a match with. But, the governess had been educated under a different system, and it struck her imagination as very proper, that she should make both herself and her lover miserable, because he had two hundred thousand dollars, and she had not as many hundreds. All this strangely conflicted with Betts' preconceived opinion of a French woman's selfishness, and, while he was disposed to believe his adored perfection, he almost feared it was a trick. Of such contradictory materials is the human mind composed! ...|$|R
60|$|As for Cynthia, {{nothing was}} farther from her mind. Unchristian {{as was the}} thought, if this thing she had awakened {{could only have been}} put back to sleep again, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have thought herself <b>happy.</b> But <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have <b>been</b> <b>happy?</b> When Moses Hatch congratulated her, with more humor than sincerity, he {{received}} the greatest scare of his life. Yet in those days she welcomed Moses's society as she never had before; and Coniston, including Moses himself, began thinking of a wedding.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were such}} rejoicings {{when she went}} in to her parents that {{it seemed as if}} they would never come to an end. Everyone thought that he could never be {{sufficiently}} grateful to her for all she had done for them all. Now they had everything that they wanted, and everything was as good as it could be. They all asked her how she was getting on where she was. All was well with her too, she said; and she had everything that she could want. What other answers she gave I cannot say, but I am pretty sure that they did not learn much from her. But in the afternoon, after they had dined at midday, all happened just as the White Bear had said. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her own chamber. But she remembered what the White Bear had said, and would on no account go. [...] "What we have to say can be said at any time," [...] she answered. But somehow or other her mother at last persuaded her, and she was forced to tell the whole story. So she told how every night a man came and lay down beside her when the lights were all put out, and how she never saw him, because he always went away before it grew light in the morning, and how she continually went about in sadness, thinking how <b>happy</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if <b>she</b> could but see him, and how all day long she had to go about alone, and it was so dull and solitary. [...] "Oh!" [...] cried the mother, in horror, [...] "you are very likely sleeping with a troll! But I will teach you a way to see him. You shall have a bit of one of my candles, which you can take away with you hidden in your breast. Look at him with that when he is asleep, but take care not to let any tallow drop upon him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, Dasharatha, {{with the}} {{approval}} of the royal assembly, selected Rama to be crowned King. Kaikeyi was delighted and as <b>happy</b> as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> had it been her own son, Bharata's, coronation. However, Manthara, Kaikeyi's wet nurse, became worried that Kaikeyi would lose her status as Chief Queen at Court if Rama ascended the throne, as Kausalya would thus become Queen Mother. She decided to instigate trouble. She tried to fuel Kaikeyi's jealousy and envy of Kausalya by reminding her that her son's coronation would give Kausalya her former status as the most important of Dasharatha's Queens and would cut Bharata out of the royal lineage forever, but this had no effect on Kaikeyi at the time.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the spirit}} of peace and {{permanence}} did not penetrate poor Mrs. Davilow's mind so as to overcome her habit of uneasy foreboding. Gwendolen and Grandcourt cantering in front of her, and then slackening their pace to a conversational walk till the carriage came up with them again, made a gratifying sight; but it served chiefly {{to keep up the}} conflict of hopes and fears about her daughter's lot. Here was an irresistible opportunity for a lover to speak {{and put an end to}} all uncertainties, and Mrs. Davilow could only hope with trembling that Gwendolen's decision <b>would</b> <b>be</b> favorable. Certainly if Rex's love had been repugnant to her, Mr. Grandcourt had the advantage of being in complete contrast with Rex; and that he had produced some quite novel impression on her seemed evident in her marked abstinence from satirical observations, nay, her total silence about his characteristics, a silence which Mrs. Davilow did not dare to break. [...] "Is he a man <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with?"--was a question that inevitably arose in the mother's mind. [...] "Well, perhaps as <b>happy</b> as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> with any one else--or as most other women are"--was the answer with which she tried to quiet herself; for she could not imagine Gwendolen under the influence of any feeling which would make her satisfied in what we traditionally call [...] "mean circumstances." ...|$|R
50|$|Happy {{creates a}} ruckus in Lahore and is caught {{by a police}} officer, Usman Afridi (Piyush Mishra), who informs Bilal. Bilal intends to deport her immediately. <b>Happy</b> fears that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> handed over to her father, who would forcefully marry her off to Bagga. She threatens Bilal that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> ruin his family name by announcing to the media {{that she had been}} smuggled from India as a part of human {{trafficking}} racket. Bilal is then confronted by his fiancÃ©e Zoya (Momal Sheikh). Initially Zoya feels that Bilal is cheating on her with Happy, but then assumes for a while that Happy is telling the truth and co-operates with them. Zoya suggests {{that the only way to}} get rid of Happy is to get Guddu into Pakistan, have Happy and Guddu married and then deport them together. Until then, Happy is to stay at Bilal's residence. Bilal has a difficult time keeping this secret from his father and struggles to keep Happy reined in.|$|R
50|$|The {{girls are}} whisked away to Paris, which {{resulted}} in a <b>happy</b> Anita, as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> there for her birthday. The girls are told that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> posing outdoors and with a male model in a photoshoot for Impulse Body Spray, and that they would each symbolise a different spray. These included, True Love and Goddess. Anne notably struggled on set, as did Roxanne, and the client was less that impressed with Madeleine, stating that she disliked Madeleine's look and attitude. Anita had her first good photoshoot, and Lisa was deemed as having potential to be a supermodel. At judging, Anita's commercial, yet stunning photo won the judges over, with her receiving first call-out. Jennifer's punky look in the photo was seen as a good thing, and Letitia is criticized for resting on being pretty, and for choosing to half Anne's shots, as she was in the bottom two the week before. In the end, Emma's lackluster photo landed her in the bottom two with Anne. Emma was spared, and Anne was asked to leave the show.|$|R
60|$|When {{the ladies}} had taken {{themselves}} to the drawing-room Lucy found herself hardly better off than she {{had been at the}} dinner-table. Lady Lufton and Mrs. Grantly got themselves on to a sofa together, and there chatted confidentially into each other's ears. Her ladyship had introduced Lucy and Miss Grantly, and then she naturally thought that the young people might do very well together. Mrs. Robarts did attempt to bring about a joint conversation, which should include the three, and for ten minutes or so she worked hard at it. But it did not thrive. Miss Grantly was monosyllabic, smiling, however, at every monosyllable; and Lucy found that nothing would occur to her at that moment worthy of being spoken. There she sat, still and motionless, afraid to take up a book, and thinking in her heart how much <b>happier</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> at home at the parsonage. She was not made for society; she felt sure of that; and another time <b>she</b> <b>would</b> let Mark and Fanny come to Framley Court by themselves. And then the gentlemen came in, and there was another stir in the room. Lady Lufton got up and bustled about; she poked the fire and shifted the candles, spoke a few words to Dr. Grantly, whispered something to her son, patted Lucy on the cheek, told Fanny, who was a musician, that they would have a little music, and ended by putting her two hands on Griselda's shoulders and telling her that the fit of her frock was perfect. For Lady Lufton, though she did dress old herself, as Lucy had said, delighted to see those around her neat and pretty, jaunty and graceful.|$|R
6000|$|But it {{was when}} La Fleur had gone to Mrs. Drane's room, and Cicely, wildly delighted when {{informed}} {{who had come to}} see them, had run to meet the dear old woman, that Miriam pondered most seriously upon this visit from a cook. She had not known anything of the ties between families and old family servants. At school, servants had been no more than machines; she was nothing to them, and they were nothing to her; and now she felt that the ignorance of these ties was one of the deprivations of her life. That old woman upstairs had not lived very long with the Dranes, and yet she regarded them with a positive affection. Miriam knew this from what she had heard. If they were in trouble, and needed her, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> come to them and serve them wherever they were. This she had told them often. How different was such a woman from Phoebe or Molly Tooney! How <b>happy</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> if there had been such a one in her mother's family, and were she with her now! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} was {{the day of the}} wedding, and Emily Trevelyan was left all alone. It was of course out of the {{question}} that she should join any party the purport of which was to be festive. Sir Marmaduke went with some grumbling, declaring that wine and severe food in the morning were sins against the plainest rules of life. And the three Rowley girls went, Nora officiating as one of the bridesmaids. But Mrs. Trevelyan was left with her boy, and during the day she was forced to resolve what should be the immediate course of her life. Two days after the wedding her family would return to England. It was open to her to go with them, and to take her boy with her. But a few days since how <b>happy</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> could <b>she</b> have been made to believe that such a mode of returning <b>would</b> <b>be</b> within her power! But now she felt that she might not return and leave that poor, suffering wretch behind her. As she thought of him she tried to interrogate herself in regard to her feelings. Was it love, or duty, or compassion which stirred her? She had loved him as fondly as any bright young woman loves the man who is to take her away from everything else, and make her a part of his house and of himself. She had loved him as Nora now loved the man whom she worshipped and thought to be a god, doing godlike work in the dingy recesses of the D. R. office. Emily Trevelyan was forced to tell herself that all that was over with her. Her husband had shown himself to be weak, suspicious, unmanly,--by no means like a god. She had learned to feel that she could not trust her comfort in his hands,--that she could never know what his thoughts of her might be. But still he was her husband, and the father of her child; and though she could not dare to look forward to happiness in living with him, she could understand that no comfort <b>would</b> <b>be</b> possible to her were she to return to England and to leave him to perish alone at Casalunga. Fate seemed to have intended that her life should be one of misery, and she must bear it as best she might.|$|R

60|$|Into {{that same}} black night, almost, indeed, {{into the very}} same layer of starlit air, Katharine Hilbery was now gazing, {{although}} not {{with a view to}} the prospects of a fine day for duck shooting on the morrow. She was walking up and down a gravel path in the garden of Stogdon House, her sight of the heavens being partially intercepted by the light leafless hoops of a pergola. Thus a spray of clematis would completely obscure Cassiopeia, or blot out with its black pattern myriads of miles of the Milky Way. At the end of the pergola, however, there was a stone seat, from which the sky could be seen completely swept clear of any earthly interruption, save to the right, indeed, where a line of elm-trees was beautifully sprinkled with stars, and a low stable building had a full drop of quivering silver just issuing {{from the mouth of the}} chimney. It was a moonless night, but the light of the stars was sufficient to show the outline of the young woman's form, and the shape of her face gazing gravely, indeed almost sternly, into the sky. She had come out into the winter's night, which was mild enough, not so much to look with scientific eyes upon the stars, as to shake herself free from certain purely terrestrial discontents. Much as a literary person in like circumstances would begin, absent-mindedly, pulling out volume after volume, so she stepped into the garden in order to have the stars at hand, even though she did not look at them. Not to be <b>happy,</b> when <b>she</b> was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> than <b>she</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>be</b> again--that, as far as she could see, was the origin of a discontent which had begun almost as soon as she arrived, two days before, and seemed now so intolerable that she had left the family party, and come out here to consider it by herself. It was not she who thought herself unhappy, but her cousins, who thought it for her. The house was full of cousins, much of her age, or even younger, and among them they had some terribly bright eyes. They seemed always on the search for something between her and Rodney, which they expected to find, and yet did not find; and when they searched, Katharine became aware of wanting what she had not been conscious of wanting in London, alone with William and her parents. Or, if she did not want it, she missed it. And this state of mind depressed her, because she had been accustomed always to give complete satisfaction, and her self-love was now a little ruffled. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> have liked to break through the reserve habitual to her in order to justify her engagement to some one whose opinion she valued. No one had spoken a word of criticism, but they left her alone with William; not that that would have mattered, if they had not left her alone so politely; and, perhaps, that would not have mattered if they had not seemed so queerly silent, almost respectful, in her presence, which gave way to criticism, she felt, out of it.|$|R
