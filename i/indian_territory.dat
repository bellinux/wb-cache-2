5|$|Fort Sill was {{established}} in 1869 after the American Civil War by Major General Philip Sheridan, who was leading a campaign in the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> to stop raids into Texas by American Indian tribes. In 1874, the Red River War {{broke out in the}} region when the Comanche, Kiowa, and Southern Cheyenne left their <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> reservation. Attrition and skirmishes by the US Army finally forced the return of the tribes back to <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> in June 1875.|$|E
5|$|Parker's {{court had}} final {{jurisdiction}} over the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> from 1875 until 1889, as there was no court available for appeals. The legal systems and governments of the Five Civilized Tribes and other Native American tribes in the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> covered their own citizens, and federal law applied to non-Indian United States citizens in the territory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} between 1866 and 1899, cattle ranches in Texas strove {{to meet the demands}} for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner. Cattle trails and cattle ranches {{developed}} as cowboys either drove their product north or settled illegally in <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory.</b> In 1881, four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier traveled through <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory.</b>|$|E
50|$|Later again, huge {{parts of}} the {{different}} <b>Indian</b> <b>territories</b> would {{in one way or}} another be added to the holdings of the United States. Smaller areas of the initial <b>Indian</b> <b>territories</b> became separate reservations, usually populated with Indians from the tribe, which held the treaty right in 1851.|$|R

5|$|In early 1861 after Texas {{voted to}} secede from the United States and join the Confederacy, Ross's brother Peter began {{recruiting}} men for a new military company. Shortly after Ross enlisted in his brother's company as a private, Governor Edward Clark requested he instead proceed immediately to the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> to negotiate treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes so they would not help the Union Army. One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie Tinsley, Ross {{set out for the}} <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory.</b> Upon reaching the Washita Agency, he discovered the Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes.|$|E

5|$|In May 1871, Carpenter was {{involved}} in the capture and escort of the Kiowa warrior and medicine man Satank, along with the Kiowa War Chiefs Santana, and Big Tree at Fort Sill, <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory,</b> now in Oklahoma. General Sherman was present at the fort due to an inspection tour; also present was Colonel Benjamin Grierson.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{also has}} a rich African American history. Many black towns thrived in the early 20th century because of black {{settlers}} moving from neighboring states, especially Kansas. The politician Edward P. McCabe encouraged black settlers to come to what was then <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory.</b> He discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority-black state.|$|E
5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American <b>Indian</b> <b>territory,</b> {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of the Americans managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E
50|$|On 18 June 1954, many leaders met at Lavaccha.

5|$|In August 1874, Carpenter became {{involved}} in fighting at Anadarko Reservation, Wichita, <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory.</b> This fighting is considered {{the first of many}} clashes during the Red River War (1874–75). Carpenter, with Troops H & I was sent to support Fort Sill and by using aggressive patrols engaged several Kiowa and Comanche raiding parties. The relatively peaceful Wichita Indians on the reservation were targets of the hostile Indians because of their increasing positive status under pacification.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{presence}} of white settlers in <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> prompted the United States Government {{to establish the}} Dawes Act in 1887, which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land to the federal government. In the process, railroad companies took nearly half of Indian-held land within the territory for outside settlers and for purchase.|$|E
5|$|The {{first session}} of the Forty-second Congress convened on March 4, 1871. During his first term, Parker helped to secure {{pensions}} for veterans in his district and campaigned for a new federal building {{to be built in}} St. Joseph.

He also sponsored legislation to organize the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> under a territorial government.|$|E
25|$|The Army proved wholly {{unable to}} stem the violence. Not only were units being transferred, but federal law and {{numerous}} treaties barred the Army from attacking Indians in the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territories.</b> Although many <b>Indians,</b> such as the Cherokee, were trying to farm and live as settlers, the Comanche and Kiowa continued to live {{in that part of}} the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territories</b> which was traditionally the Comancheria, while raiding into Texas.|$|R

2500|$|The U.S. Army proved wholly {{unable to}} stem the violence. [...] Federal units were being {{transferred}} {{out of the area}} for reasons that seemed driven more by political than military considerations. At the same time, federal law and numerous treaties forbade incursion by state forces into the federally protected <b>Indian</b> <b>Territories.</b> The U.S. Army was likewise instructed not to attack Indians in the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territories</b> or to permit such attacks. [...] The reasoning behind the order was that many native tribes, such as the Cherokee, were engaged in farming, and living as peaceful settlers. [...] Other tribes, such as the Comanche and Kiowa, continued to use that part of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territories</b> that was the Comancheria to live in while raiding white settlements in Texas..

5|$|Watie {{formed the}} Cherokee Mounted Rifles. He was a guerrilla fighter {{commanding}} Cherokee, Seminole, Creek, and Osage Indian soldiers. They earned a notorious reputation for their bold and brave fighting. Yearly, Federal troops {{all over the}} western United States hunted for Watie, but they never captured him. He surrendered on June 23 at Fort Towson, in the Choctaw Nations area at the village of Doaksville (now a ghost town) of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory,</b> being the last Confederate general to surrender in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{also took}} {{up the issue of}} white {{settlement}} in <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory.</b> For several years, white settlers had been claiming homesteads in the Unassigned Lands in what is now Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Five Civilized Tribes had been forced to cede their unused western lands to the federal government. The settlers, known as Boomers, believed that federal ownership made the lands open to settlement under the Homestead Acts. The federal government disagreed, as did the Cherokee Nation, which leased its neighboring Cherokee Outlet to Kansas cattle ranchers, and many Easterners, who believed the Boomers to be the tools of railroad interests. Weaver saw the issue as one between the landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen, and took the side of the former. He introduced a bill in December 1885 to organize <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> and the neighboring Neutral Strip into a new Oklahoma Territory. The bill died in committee, but Weaver reintroduced it in February 1886 and gave a speech calling for the Indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual Natives and the remaining land to be open to white settlement.|$|E
5|$|A {{military}} post {{was established}} on Key Biscayne in March 1838. Its first commander was Lt. Col. James Bankhead. The fort was initially known as Fort Dallas or Fort Bankhead, {{but it was}} eventually renamed Fort Russell for Captain Samuel L. Russell. He was killed when the Seminoles ambushed two boats on the Miami River in February 1839. In the summer of 1839, a total of 143 soldiers and sailors were stationed at Fort Russell. Some of the Seminoles captured during the war were held at Fort Russell until they could be placed on ships to be removed to <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. The court had such a large caseload that the four terms ran together. Parker's court sat {{six days a week}} {{in order to ensure that}} they tried as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of settlers moving into the Indian Territories actually increased the court's workload.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 18th century, the Oklahoma {{region was}} under nominal French control as Louisiana. The limited {{interaction}} between the peoples was based on fur trading. In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase by Thomas Jefferson brought the area under United States control. In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which removed American Indian tribes from the Southeast and relocated them to <b>Indian</b> <b>Territory</b> west of the Mississippi River. The southern part of this territory was originally assigned to the Choctaw and Chickasaw. In 1867, the United States used the Medicine Lodge Treaty to allot the southwest portion of the Choctaw and Chickasaw’s lands to the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache tribes.|$|E
