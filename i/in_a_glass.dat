Eventually, the skull was removed by Dr John Kilner, who wanted to add it to his extensive collection of Red Barn memorabilia. After a series of unfortunate events, he became convinced that the skull was cursed and handed it on to a friend named Hopkins. Further disasters plagued both men, and they finally paid for the skull {{to be given a}} Christian burial in an attempt to lift the supposed curse.|$|E

5|$|Following the Ottoman {{withdrawal}} from Niš in 1878, the tower was roofed over, and in 1892 a chapel was built around it. In 1937, the chapel was renovated. A bust of Sinđelić was added the following year. In 1948, Skull Tower and the chapel enclosing it were declared Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance and {{came under the}} protection of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Further renovation of the chapel occurred again in 1989. As of 2013, 54 skulls remain on the tower. The one that is said to belong to Sinđelić is enclosed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> container. Seen as a symbol of independence by Serbs, the tower is mentioned in the writings of French Romantic poet Alphonse de Lamartine and English travel writer Alexander William Kinglake. In the two centuries since its construction, it has become a popular tourist attraction, visited by between 30,000 and 50,000 people annually.|$|E

The tomb was then resealed. A small funeral was held on February 14, and a small plaque bearing the names and dates of the two Harveys was posted.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, the Croatian {{archeologist}} Ćiro Truhelka excavated {{bones in}} a settlement close to Jajce known as Kraljev Grob (meaning King's Tomb) {{and found the}} skeleton of a decapitated adult male. The head {{was placed on the}} chest, with two coins in the mouth. Though by no means certain, it was assumed that the skeleton belonged to Stephen Tomašević. Despite objection from the friar Antun Knežević, who argued for leaving the bones where they had laid for centuries and constructing a small church at the site, the skeleton was placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> coffin in the right aisle of the Franciscan monastery in Jajce.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E
5|$|Shyamalan and cinematographer Eduardo Serra chose several {{camera angles}} to {{simulate}} {{the look of a}} comic book panel. Various visual narrative motifs were also applied. Several scenes relating to the Mr. Glass character involve glass. As a newborn, he is primarily seen reflected in mirrors, and as a young child, he is seen reflected in a blank TV screen. When he leaves his calling card on the windshield of David Dunn's car, he is reflected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> frame in his art gallery. Jackson requested his walking stick be made of glass to make his character more menacing. Using purple as Mr. Glass' color to David Dunn's green was also Jackson's idea. Mr. Glass' wig was modeled after Afro-American statesman Frederick Douglass. As he does in his other films, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance. He plays a man David suspects of dealing drugs inside the stadium.|$|E

5|$|Since clones cannot {{properly}} die, the Sakura and Syaoran clones are reconstructed by Yūko, {{who wishes}} to compensate them for how their existences were used. She causes them to be reborn as humans, who eventually meet and start living together. Sakura gives birth to the original Syaoran and they realize {{they are in their}} own past. They raise him until it is time for him to begin the events of the series, then they seal themselves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> tube in order to await the time when Fei-Wang will attempt to shatter reality. After breaking free from the tube, Sakura and Syaoran reverse Fei-Wang's damage to the dimension using the magic they inherited from the sorcerer Clow Reed during their reincarnation. They disappear after Fei-Wang is killed by Kurogane, leaving behind only a feather which the original Sakura and Syaoran absorb.|$|E
5|$|The {{body was}} re-cremated during the funeral, but Đức's heart {{remained}} intact {{and did not}} burn. It {{was considered to be}} holy and placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> chalice at Xá Lợi Pagoda. The intact heart relic is regarded as a symbol of compassion. Đức has subsequently been revered by Vietnamese Buddhists as a bodhisattva (Bồ Tát), and accordingly is often referred to in Vietnamese as Bồ Tát Thích Quảng Đức. On 21 August, the ARVN Special Forces of Nhu attacked Xá Lợi and other Buddhist pagodas across Vietnam. The secret police intended to confiscate Đức's ashes, but two monks had escaped with the urn, jumping over the back fence and finding safety at the U.S. Operations Mission next door. Nhu's men managed to confiscate Đức's charred heart.|$|E

Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.|$|E

5|$|The final {{match on}} the card was the main event, which saw The Undertaker face off against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) in a Handicap match. Per the pre-match stipulation, Paul Bearer would be {{cemented}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> crypt if Undertaker lost. Throughout {{the duration of the}} match, Bearer was locked on a chair inside a glass crypt with the pump of cement truck above him. After a match evenly controlled by The Undertaker and The Dudleys, Undertaker pinned D-Von following a Tombstone Piledriver to win. After the match, Undertaker pulled the lever to the cement truck, which in turn filled the crypt with Bearer inside full of cement.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E
