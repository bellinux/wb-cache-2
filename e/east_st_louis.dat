5|$|Turley {{was born}} in Troy, Illinois. He was raised in <b>East</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> Illinois. He {{attended}} <b>East</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Senior High School in <b>East</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> and played for the school's baseball squad for three years. He was used as both a starter and reliever, becoming the staff's ace pitcher {{by the end of}} his senior season, in 1948. Turley won the team's sportsmanship award that year.|$|E
5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 <b>East</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from <b>East</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E

5|$|After graduating {{high school}} in <b>East</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> Blake played in the farm system of the nearby St. Louis Cardinals before enlisting in the army.

He pitched for them {{on and off for}} three years, then spent the next six years pitching for the Toronto Maple Leafs. His last major league appearance was a stint with the Athletics in 1957, and two years later his professional baseball career ended. After retirement he became a plumber, and died in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Once in control, {{however, the}} group allows power {{to go to}} their heads. At first they {{efficiently}} implement their ideas for Springfield, which include banning green traffic lights and playing only classical music at the dog races, which elevates Springfield past <b>East</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> on the list of America's 300 Most Livable Cities. However, they begin to internally fight over other ideas such as having theaters for shadow puppets and a broccoli juice program, and their wildly unpopular plans at a public meeting (including the banning of all contact sports and Comic Book Guy's plan to limit breeding to every 7 years) further expose the rifts inside the group.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of <b>East</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. In the postwar period, veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|E

25|$|Concomitant {{with the}} {{segregation}} ordinance {{and the rise}} of restrictive covenants {{was the beginning of the}} Great Migration of African-Americans to northern cities. Many thousands moved to the city of <b>East</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> Illinois, where they often were employed at low wages as strikebreakers. Between June 30 and July 2, 1917, a violent race riot in <b>East</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> broke out when a mob of white attackers (including police and National Guardsmen) destroyed 300 houses, wounded hundreds, and killed 39 blacks and 8 whites. Unofficial estimates placed the number of victims of the race riot far higher, but because many bodies were disposed of in the river, accurate counts were difficult. For its part, St. Louis was a haven during the riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food provided by the city government and the American Red Cross.|$|E
