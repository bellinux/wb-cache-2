5|$|Because Exmoor was a royal forest, i.e. a <b>hunting</b> <b>reserve,</b> it was {{unpopulated}} in Medieval times. The {{first house}} on the moor was only built at Simonsbath in 1654. It {{was not until the}} 19th century that farms were built around the moor.|$|E

Pesticide use has threatened birdlife in nearby Doñana. Further south, Lake Faguibine in Mali is another stopover point {{but it has been}} affected by drought in recent years.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, due to hunting, the Alpine ibex survived in the Gran Paradiso and Vanoise area. Approximately 60 {{individual}} ibex survived, here. Ibex were intensively hunted, partly for sport, {{but also because}} their body parts were thought to have therapeutic properties: talismans were made from a small cross-shaped bone near the ibex's heart {{in order to protect}} against violent death. Due to the alarming decrease in the ibex population, Victor Emmanuel, soon to be King of Italy, declared the Royal <b>Hunting</b> <b>Reserve</b> of the Gran Paradiso in 1856. A protective guard was created for the ibex. Paths laid out for the ibex are still used today as part of 724 kilometres (450mi) of marked trails and mule tracks.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the okapi as Endangered. It {{is fully}} {{protected}} under Congolese law. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve and Maiko National Park support significant {{populations of the}} okapi, though {{there has been a}} steady decline in numbers due to several threats. Other areas of occurrence are the Rubi Tele <b>Hunting</b> <b>Reserve</b> and the Abumombanzi Reserve. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines. A threat that has emerged quite recently is the presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas, inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions. A small population occurs north of the Virunga National Park, but is bereft of protection due to the presence of armed groups in the vicinity. In June 2012, a gang of poachers attacked the headquarters of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, killing six guards and other staff as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center.|$|E

25|$|High Peak was {{the name}} of a hundred of the ancient county of Derbyshire {{covering}} roughly the same area as the current district.

25|$|The area is {{believed}} to have been occupied during the Bronze Age; there is a Bronze Age barrow near High Low Farm to the west of Macclesfield Forest and another earthwork east of the forest near Toot Hill.

50|$|The Renaissance period saw a {{dramatic}} reduction of forests for agriculture, thus diminishing some boar populations. Boars were increasingly hunted as crop predators by the rich, who {{rather than using}} spears, daggers and arrows, now had firearms allowing them to kill boars far more quickly and efficiently.

50|$|Hieratic formalized {{recreational}} hunting {{has been taking}} place since Assyrian kings hunted lions from chariots in a demonstration of their royal nature.

The biography of the Merovingian noble Saint Hubert (died 727/728) recounts how hunting could become an obsession. Carolingian Charlemagne loved to hunt and did so up until his death at age seventy-two.|$|R
